all rights reserved act i under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic mountainside
from within we hear the agonizing scream of a woman giving birth
the scream continues as we move through the grim corri dors of the castle toward stairs leading down to a dungeon
silhouetted in sadows three nockmaar minions stand guard
in a jail cell sex fully pregnant women watch from behind iron bars
the screaming stops
theres a moment of silence
as we move into another jail cell we hear a slap and the first cry of a newborn baby
in the cell a black robed druid watches intensely as ethna a midwife leans over the mother and wraps the baby in swaddling
is it a girl
it is a girl
show me its arm
ethna peels back the swaddling
on the babys arm is a small marking
its true then
i must tell queen bavmorda
with great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon stairs
ethna gently places the baby on the mothers breast
the mother comforst the baby lovingly until it stops crying
then she reaches out and clasps the midwifes wrist
theyre going to kill my baby
ethna nervously looks out at the guards then shakes her head at the mother
theyll kill you
please save my baby
she quickly wraps to gether some rags and gives them to the mother
pretend this is the child
thank you ethna
the mother kisses her baby and hands it to ethna who hides the baby inside the basket of rags
ethna car ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs
the mother lies back and sighs with relief
then she hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear
queen bavmorda sweeps down the dungeon stairs her black robes flowing behind her
the druid hurries alongside
we will start the ritual at dusk
youre certain this is the one
it bears the markings
i must see for myself
just as the omen foretold
the guards fearfully move aside as bavmorda enters the cell
you were the one
but nothing you can do will stop the prophecy
this child will have no power over me
bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi ously tears them apart
furiously wheres the baby
one of the guards looks up the stairs
bavmorda flies into a rage
find that baby
use the dogs
two guards draw swords and charge upstairs
bavmorda grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother
bavmorda storms away with the druid
we see the shadow of the guard move over the terrified mother
war drums begin to beat out an alarm
the midwife hurries through swirling show clutching the baby
nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate village driving ferocious death dogs into huts violently searching for the baby
the oppressed poor villagers are yanked into the street
some of them are beaten
one is killed
the midwife hides behind a hut still holding the baby then runs away from the village
ethna treks across an open grass field
she huddles by a fire exhausted and hungry her clothes filthy and torn and she rocks the crying baby
she hears dogs howling in the distance
she clutches the baby kicks out the fire and runs
she scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline
ethna runs desperately for her life
chasing her are two vicious death dogs
she scrambles across a shallow river
she claws at rock and tears away sticks and driftwood matted together with weeds
into this she places the baby and sets it afloat downstream
the dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the river
the midwife claws her way up a steep bank lur ing the dogs
as they attack her i dont have her
she grabs a stick and tries to defend herself thrash ing at the snarling dogs
from the babys view as it floats down the river we see the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees
the little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the current
it glances off jutting rocks tumbles over rapids and scrapes under overhanging trees
at last the raft catches in some weeks almost dumping the baby
suddenly we hear rustling leaves possibly another death dog
then we hear giggling
two children ranon and mims watch in amazement from the riverbank
holding onto a plow willow ufgood struggles behind a huge hog
from a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he tosses seeds
we found something in the river
willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to ward him
they grab his sleeves and tug him away from his plow
i cant run off and play with you now
ive got work to do
but dada you gotta see it
willow drops his sack of seeds
the ugly hog glares at him like a guilty conscience
the children squeal with excitement as their father runs toward the river with them
we see willow from the babys view
his eyes pop open
he quickly backs his children away
dont go near it
we dont know where its been
it could be diseased
its a baby
its not a nelwyn baby
no its too big to be a nelwyn baby
it looks like a daikini
ooh its so cute
get back here
it might bite you
willow drags mims away
then the baby starts crying
cant we keep it dada
willow in a sudden panic sees burglekutt in the dis tance
he splashes into the river grabs the raft plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying baby
its the prefect thats all i need
mims ranon keep this thing hidden
burglekutts beady eyes spot willow making a mad dash for his plow
swinging his fat stomach he angrily points his walking stick and goes after him
he hasnt done anything wrong
willows wife kiaya chases burglekutt across the field her beautiful long hair flowing behind her
willow quickly gets behind his plow like hes been there all day
what do you think youre doing
i tell the planting seeds in this village
i told him we didnt steal it wil low
burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of willows sack and shakes them under willows nose
you havent paid your debts
where did you get these seeds
with pride willow puts his arm around his wife
in the forest
my familys been gathering them since last fall
theres no law against that bur glekutt
suddenly the children laugh in the distance
you left the children alone by the river
in alarm she runs off before willow can stop her
bur glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick
too late ufgood
youll never get your planting done before the rains start
youre gonna lose this land
he raises the seeds high above his head then smashes them down at willows boots
he waddles away toward two of his men who wait by the road
then kiaya shrieks from the river
burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say the whole familys crazy
off he trudges
willow watches and waits
then runs as fast as he can to the river
kiaya cradles the baby in her arms
willow runs up and with patriarchal authority puts his fists on his hips
absolutely under no condition is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby
they all fall in love as he speaks
the children fol low kiaya up on the bank walking right past willow
we cant keep that baby
i will not be ignored
ignored willow huffs after them across his unplowed field
willow nervously paces as kiaya pours water in a wood tub and the children entertain the naked baby with sticks and brightly colored cloths apparatus for a magic trick
this is bad
if were caught with that little daikini itll be the end of us
careful ranon i need that for the festival
indicates magic cloth kiaya what are we going to do
were gonna give this baby a bath
the baby squeals with joy as kiaya lifts her into the bath
theres not enough time to finish plowing
well lose everything and ill end up working in the mines
he shudders at the thought
willow do you think we should take her to the village council
theyll think its a bad omen
therell be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybodyll blame me for it
willow leans forward
on the babys shoulder is a small branded scar in a circular design
it only adds to willows fears
i dont know
this is trouble
ill talk to the high aldwin about it tomorrow at the festival
the baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath
the raucous band plays as nelwyns dance and celebrate amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers
a crowd cheers wildly as miners battle farmers in a tug of war finally yanking the farmers face first into a puddle of mud
on a stage a harlequin dances delight fully
while on a raised platform the five members of the village council sit and observe mildly amused
the head councilman is burglekutt
the we see willow on another stage
he flourishes his colorful sticks and cloths
in the audience we notice his friend meegosh who wears a miners apron rooting willow on
for our final amazing bit of magic i will make an entire pig completely disappear
meegosh applauds as mims and ranon trot out lugging a tiny baby pig in a crate
as willow takes the pig out it bites his hand and gets away
willow tackles and squashes it
the crowd laughs and half of them leave and meegosh covers his face
mims and ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket
willow cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his back and suddenly its gone
impresse the crowd gasps
then the pig squeals and dashes through willows legs and leaps off the stage
burglekutt and the council shake their heads as willow embarassed picks up his things
meegosh trots up with the pig under his arm
meegosh im in trouble
hey it wasnt that bad
you need a better pig thats all
but as they walk past the village council and bur glekutt sneers down at willow meegosh catches on
now burglekutts got you in the squeeze
soon youll be down in the mines like me
i hate closed in spaces
thats the last thing id ever do
he shudders i gotta get my crop planted
you know ill help you as much as i can willow
the village council members stand up respectfully as the wise old high aldwin hobbles through the adoring crowd
mims and ranon rush up to willow with several other children who are eating candy
dada can we get treacle candy
can we can we
preoccupied meegosh can you watch the chil dren
i gotta talk to the high aldwin
truly amazed the high aldwin
but willow has already wandered into the crowd leaving meegosh with a dozen sugar charged children and a pig
willow desperately pushes past people and finally reaches the high aldwin
i have to talk to you
not today willow
its a matter of great importance to me
burglekutt stares angrily from his platform
slightly annoyed the high aldwin stops and places his hand on willows shoulder
intuition willow remember
i know youre eager to be my appren tice willow
but today is the spring festival
suddenly a walking stick is pointed at willows nose
to the high aldwin
his belly shakes as he howls with laughter encouraging his councilmen to join in
willow shrinks away em barassed
then a terrified shriek shatters the festivity
music stops and people grab their children and run for their lives
a death dog rips a trail of destruction through the village
meegosh holds onto ranon and mims
but when mims sees willow she runs right out into the open
willow charges twoard her tackling her and rolling away from the beasts claws
a loud war cry distracts the dog
vohnkar the toughest warrior in the village leads a charging army of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks
wil low and meegosh grab sticks
the nelwyns battle the death dog
at last vohnkar drives a spear through its chest and it dies hideously
what was it looking for
it said bordak
what does it mean
it means baby
it was look ing for somebodys baby
mothers grab their children people look around the wrecked village in terror
theres a haunting silence
suddenly alarmed willow races towrd his distant farm his children hurrying behind
willow bursts in and finds kiaya calmly feeding the baby
relieved he throws his arms around her
we cant keep this baby kiaya
we must take her to the council
the children run in and they all huddle together cher ishing their precious lives
arguing villagers pack the church shaped room to the open door at the back and into the balconies above
the councilmen sit on a platform at the front with the high aldwin seated in a special chair above them
tak ing charge burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with his walking stick
an evil beast from the outer world has invaded our peaceful village looking for a baby
this only adds to the frenzy
its a sign
our crops will die
one beast we can kill
but there may be more
and they wont give up their search till theyve found what theyre looking for
whose baby is it
whos to blame for this
amid the chaos the high aldwin slowly stands up
as if he senses something he looks over the crowd toward the back
at the back door holding the baby willow tries to push his way through the jostling crowd
the high aldwin raises his hand
it flashes magically
he points as he speaks willow ufgood
come before me
the crowd stands apart as willow walks the length of the room
kiaya and the children follow part way and then stand aside next to meegosh
burglekutt simmers as willow approaches the platform
earlier today you tried to tell me something willow
bows his head my family found this baby in the river high aldwin
the crowd stirs but the high aldwin silences them with a simple gesture
he gazes down at the baby mysteri ously
a daikini child
his eyes close of some importance i feel
thats what the beasts want
give it back
the crowd rumbles many agree
theyll kill her
we cant let this baby die
what do we care
burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd
the high aldwin raises his hands feeling the air above him
almost in a trance importance
this child is special
what should we do
instantly the high aldwin drops his arms and opens his eyes
this child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village
all the way to the daikini crossroads
the room goes silent
who will do that
vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and pounds his chest once with his fist
the outer world is dangerous and corrupt vohnkar
and this baby is hunted by blood hungry beasts
are you willing to sacrifice your life
brave vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful ly
if i go wholl defend you if other beasts attack
the crowd rumbles and shouts and vohnkar mops his brow and scuttles away from the platform
it seems only fair that the man to take this baby to the crossroads
walking stick up be the very man who plucked it
walking stick down out of the river
all eyes turn to willow
kiaya gasps and meegosh holds her back
i cant do it
i havent put my crop in
you caused this trouble
you found the baby
you get rid of it
i nominate willow ufgood
the crowd cheers wildly
the high aldwin steps forward to the edge of the platform
with a flourish he waves his arms
i will consult the bones
something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands
the crowd jumps away
the high aldwin scatters small bones across the floor below him
he leans down and studies the bones
willow looks at kiaya who is worried and afraid
the high aldwin speaks softly to him the bones tell me nothing
he eyes willow but i must make a decision
is there love in your heart for this child
he looks at the baby
the high aldwin bolts straight up broadcasting the bones have spoken
the security of this village depends on you
the people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to leave
kiaya and meegosh and the children push their way toward willow who stands there staring at the baby
kiayas hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid
near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack
on the other side of the fire willow diapers the baby
the house is quiet
willow sets the baby down
he goes around an opne wall an sits on his daughters bed straightening her blank ets and toys
watch out for brownies dada
i will mims
he smiles and kisses her
then crosses over to ranons bed
dada whats a daikini
daikinis are giant people who live far far away
are you scared
ranon sits up in bed
i could be you rguard
i could carry your spear
smiles what a great son you are ranon
i wish i could take you with me
now go to sleep
ranon slides down under his blankets
willow kisses him looks at him a moment then quietly withdraws to ward the fire
the silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on top
carrying the baby willow climbs the hill with his fami ly
he wears a papoose rig supply pack and a dagger
he hands the baby to kiaya then walks through the towering stones
the high aldwin solemnly looks out at the distant forest
now you know where youre going
willow shakes his head down there through those trees follow the river
youll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc ture
willow this is serious business
dont waste any time the outer world is no place for a nelwyn
give the baby to the first daikini you see then hurry home as fast as you can
if im not strong enough to be your apprentice how can i do this
youre strong enough
but youre going to need courage willow
i dont want courage
i dont want to be a warrior
all ive ever wanted was to do magic real magic like you
real magic willow is simply the art of controlling the reality of others
you lack faith in your self
you must learn to trust your intuition
the high aldwin picks up a rock
with intense concen tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand
then throws it in the air
it changes into a bird and flies away
go in the direction the bird is flying
amazed oh if i could do that id id turn burglekutt into a toad
waste magic on revenge
you have much to learn willow
the high aldwin touches willows shoulder and turns away
the children are playing tag among the stones
willow hugs them
kiaya places the baby in the papoose
willow weve never been apart
i miss you already
it will bring you luck
kiaya whose head is covered with a kerchief places a braided necklace on her own hair around willows neck
you cut your hair kiaya
he kisses her
the adjusts the papoose and heads off down the hill
the others wave goodbye sadly
kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her arms around willow tears in her eyes
at last they break apart and willow begins the journey
willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain amazed and frightened
animals rustle in the brush and he stumbles into a thistle patch jumping out picking burrs off his legs
he hides from a fierce bear
the bear sees him and runs away
willow hurries along shifting the papoose getting used to the babys weight
the baby is fussing hungrily
willow impetuously digs a bladder of goats milk from his sack and struggles to feed her
then he hears something
sensing danger he clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank
he hides under a bridge
nockmaar soldiers on horseback thunder toward the bridge led by the knight sorsha whose face is hidden under a black helmet and visor
in the other direction willow sees a lieutenant and two death dogs
they all meet on the bridge
the hideous soldiers are part hu man part beast
weve patrolled the hills
this is where they killed the nursemaid
she must have done something with the child
widen the search
one of the death dogs is chewing on the lieutenants stirrup
get away from there
the dog panics and gnashes at the lieutenants arm ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth
the lieutenant draws his sword lightning fast
he slices and kills the death dog
the baby begins to cry but the death howl of the beast drowns her out as it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below
the soldiers gallop off into the woods
willow falls back against the riverbank shrinking away from the murdered death dog which lies bloody and twisted in the water
the terrified baby cries in his arms
a harmless rabbit springs across willows path
willow trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face
i hate this
where am i
i should stick you in a tree and go back home
looks at baby im sorry
i didnt mean that
he hurries along the road looking over his shoulder
various views of willow and the baby trekking across vast hills and valleys
gasping with exhaustion willow staggers up a sloping hill and drops to his knees
his eyes brighten
in the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden scaffolding
he stands and heads toward it cautiously
the place is disgusting
littered with junk buzzing with flies plagued with rodents
willow creeps toward the scaffolding covering his face against the stench
from it hang two cages
in one is a heap of filthy rags
in the other a half clothed skeleton with one bony arm dangling out
willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted road
he shivers with cold
i hate this
willow waits uneasily brushing flies off his face
the baby fusses and squirms
he peeks inside her diaper
i hate this
he looks anxiously up and down the road
the babys crying gets worse
he begins to change her
willow finishes building a fire lighting it with flint and blowing it into flame
the baby lies quietly near by in a kind fo porta crib made of papoose and twigs
nightfall teems with spooky noises crickets frogs bats owls and howling wolves
then a terrible moan frightens him
i really hate this
not sure where it came from
he backs away from the fire under the rag filled cage
suddenly a hand reaches down and yanks willow up off the ground
wil low screams
the baby cries
and we see the haggard unwashed unshaven face of madmartigan pressing against the bars of the cage
get me some water
or youll diiiiie
madmartigan shakes willow like a rag doll until willow nods his head yes
then drops him
instantly willow races around that fire picking up everything he owns
i will ill getcha water getcha lotsa water anything you say
willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the bushes
he dives headfirst into the weeds
madmartigan rattles his cage
youre a weasely little peck
gimme some water
willow peeks at him and shakes his head
im not coming near you
they stare at each other across the fire
then mad martigan puts on a very phony smile
im dyin of thirst in here
how long will it take
madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire
dont make me angry peck
you be careful
im a powerful sorcerer
i could turn you into a toad just like that
willow throws a rock at him
it bounces off the cage
madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again
crossroads night the wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls
willow rocks the baby and eats some bread
madmartigan watches him hungrily sighing forlorn his eyes asking for pit
willow glances at him
finally he cant take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some goats milk in a cup
he reaches up on tip toes and offers the milk to madmartigan
thats more like it
madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk retching horribly at the taste
then he tosses the cup back
do any other daikinis ever come by here
i have to give this baby to some body
madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up
lemme out and ill take care of your baby
he makes little kissing noises to the baby trying to be sweet
however his teeth are filthy
somebdoy put you in there for a reason
ill wait for somebody else
willow retreats to the fire
madmartigan whacks the cage with the back of his hand
by the blazing fire willow feeds the baby
we hear hoofbeats
douse the fire
excited willow tosses more wood on the fire picks up the baby and waits
no you fool
put it out i say
torches appear up the road
a horse drawn wagon clatters full speed toward the fire
we hear load drunken voices far from friendly
willow quickly dives into the bushes
four boorish picts with tatooed faces and arms halt at the crossroads yelling and waving their torches
madmartigan is hidden under his rags
for fun the picts set fire to the skeleton cage
then head for the other
he rises up in the torchlight
the picts taunt him
they jab their torches at madmartigan
where are they
where did they go
madmartigan points way up the road
the picts ride away
as they go they swing his cage and st fire to the floor of it
madmartigan frantically geats the flames
his sleeves ignite
willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand fuls of dirt which he chucks at madmartigan
spitting out dirt thanks for your help peck
are you okay
as if you care
i saved your life peck
those guys woulda killed us
points dramatically you wanna give your baby to them
they eat babies
i dont know
madmartigan literally licks his wounds dragging his parched tongue along the length of his forearm
willow begins to walk away
the worlds gone insane
good men locked in cages criminals running free
it doesnt pay to be honest peck
willow stops and turns around
dont call me a peck
my name is willow
madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends his derty hand through the bars
willow stares warily at the hand
willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away
madmar tigan laughs in a harmless friendly way
you a woodcutter
i knew it
youre a vic tim willow
yep you and me victims of a rotten corrupt cor rupt rotten world
a rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the baby in the porta crib
madmartigan suddenly points
willow screams and chases the rat away
madmartigan shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker
listen willow my friend
im really a good man
give me my freedom and ill look after that baby for you
after a moment willow takes out his dagger
he stands on his toes under a cage reaches up and hacks at the chain lock
madmartigans eyes widen over eagerly
he rubs his hands together and licks his lips
thats it good good like that yes good good the chain thats it come on come on
willow suddenly steps away
nooo i dont think i should
madmartigan goes berserk
his arms flail and the whole cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the roof
ill kill ya
let me out
willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the baby and rocks her in his arms
madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark and cloth
he smiles sweetly as willow wakes up
willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby
sorry i yelled at you
ive been in this cage toooo long
cant think straight anymore
willow looks over
madmartigan pats his arms in pain
you all right
he holds up his arms in agony
willow fishes some gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a leaf
he hands it up to madmartigan
see if this helps
madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms
here i made something for the baby
he holds out a ratlle and shakes it
willow accepts it
madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it open as wide as possible
willow reacts im strving
i got no used for it
noise in the distance
up the road willow sees a messenger charging on horseback
he gallops right past whipping his horse almost knocking willow off the road
then another messenger follows with the same urgency
willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop him
the messenger screams a willow who jumps aside as he thunders by
the two horsemen disappear up the road
with authority smells like a battle
are you a warrior
the greatest swordsman that ever lived
madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword
willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby
we see the empty road
willows head pops into frame
he grabs the baby
i hear something
you hear trouble
what is it
the horizon rumbles
madmartigan cups his ear
cyni cally a hundred horses
five or six wagons
and about six thousand fools
two cavalry officers gallop into view raising a plume of dust
then an enormous army appears cavalry foot soldiers assault wagons shields swords spears raised banners
the two officers shout orders over the thunderous clamor of hoofbeats marching boots and clanking armor
charging back and forth they shepherd the army through the crossroads
willow holds the baby
fighting dust and noise he tries to get the officers attention
out of the way
an officers horse nearly kicks willow who scurries out of the way
huddling with the baby he notices airk thaughbaer a large muscular bearded officer clearly in charge
on horseback airk breaks file and rides up to the other officers
push em harder
no rest at mid day
we need to make ten more leagues by dark
shouting orders the officers split up charging to the front and rear of the army
airk watches the army pass
willow desperately scrambles up to him
i have this baby
we found her in our village
will you take her
huge airk looks down from his huge horse
little wil low holds up the baby
were going into battle little one
find a woman to take care of it
he thought you were a woman airk
airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash
what did you do this time
nothing you wouldnt have done it my place
airks horse prances menacingly around madmartigans cage
i always knew youd end up in a crows cage
least im not down there herding sheep
airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage
youre lucky somebody got to you first madmartigan
idve killed you myself after that stunt at lands end
he swings that cage and starts to ride away
come on airk
lemme outa here
really sarcastic hey remember
you dont need my help madmartigan
little rabbit trap like this
i could open it for you but i wouldnt wanna insult you
gimme a sword airk
ill win your war for you
airk quickly drops the banter and glares at madmartigan seri ously
youre nothing but trouble madmar tigan
and i got plenty of that
stay in your coffin and rot
airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges off
ill be around long after youre dead airk
when i get outa here ill cut your head off and stick it on a pig pole
friend of yours
madmartigan snarls down at willow as the army continues to march by
but then he quickly gets cute again
hello little baby
a ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads
the road is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks
willow shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire
whatcha thinkin about willow
i hate this
madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his cage
nobodys gonna take your baby
beat except me
wistfully you wanna go back to your farm
you wanna go back to your family
i could take care of that baby
ill look after her like she was me own
you dont know anything about ba bies
madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his finger astutely
but i know a lot of women who do
why if i had somebody in my life a little daughter for instance id have a reason to live
he clsps his hands together outside the bars plead ing willow
you cant let me die here
not when i wanna help you
willow looks at the baby in the porta crib
then looks up the empty road
then looks hard at madmartigan
you gotta promise to feed her
fresh goats milk
willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the chain
and give her a bath everyday and dont let her get cold
and keep her diaper changed
willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks open
the bottom of the cage falls out dumping mad martigan into a heap of rags and dust
come to daddy little darlin
picks her up i think she likes me
kneeling on the ground he plays with the baby
willow quickly hitches the papoose to madmartigans back and hands him supplies
here are her diaper rags
and this is her milk bladder
and when she cries shes either hungry or shes tired rock her on your left shoulder
she likes that
dont worry willow
shes in good hands
you havent made a mistake
willow takes the baby and kisses her
he puts her in the papoose
to madmartigan please take good care of her
madmartigan stands up
he towers above willow
he pats willow on the head
youve done a great job
now you go back to your family and get your crop in
madmartigan smiles turns and marches off down the road
willow sighs with relief his task accomplished
he watches madmartigan and the baby disappear over a hill
swinging his arms and whistling a tune willow struts proudly up a gentle hill
look its willow ufgood
hes come home
welcome back willow
he deserves a medal hes quite mystical
for honor for bravery for his intuitive powers
he chuckles lets make him apprentice aldwin
better still high aldwin
its willow uf good high aldwin of the baby cries
willow spins around
flying towrd him is an incredible vulture with enormous winds
in its claws it carries the baby papoose and all
it swoops straight at willow buzzing him and willow hits the dirt
he looks up
to add to the wonder riding the vulutre is an elf
come back here you
thats my baby
the vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of the forest with the baby crying
shouting and waving madly willow gallops after it
willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the towering trees
as the path narrows something whis tlse past his ear
finger length arrows rain down on him from every direction peppering the surrounding trees
some even hit willow
he plucks them out as he races along
he comes to a fork in the path decision
he starts down one way then slams on the brakes
he sees ropes and nets
oh no its a trap
he hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route oh noooooo
and gets swallowed by a deadly pit
willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the face
his feet and wrists are being bound
several little elves are gawking and laughing at him
they wear samurai type outfits and angry little haircuts
focusing where am i
wheres the baby
franjean the elfin king struts forward arrogantly
he speaks a haughty nasal accent resembling french i am franjean king of the world
willow struggles against the ropes that bind him
that babys my responsibility
outraged franjean smacks willows nose with the back of his hand
i dont care
we paid for her
go back to sleep monsieur
as he leaves franjean nods to an intense looking arch er elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear
the archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid
he pricks willows arm
he loses consciousness madmartigan
i never shouldve trusted you
willows eyes open
a wild little face is looking at him
a wild little person is standing on his chest
too groggy to argue willow sticks out his tongue
teemo the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the dust into willows mouth
smacking his lips willow comes around
he sees down between his legs another brownie named rool cutting the ropes
who are you
quiet you fool
formal we are emissaries of her majesty queen cherlindrea of the land of coshairm
she requests the presence of your self and the young princess
youre the guardian arent you
quit yakking teemo
we gotta get outa here
willow rolls onto his knees stands up and bumps his head on the ceiling
the fuzzy headed brownies creak open the door and becon willow to follow
he squeezes through
like a rabbit warren compartments branch off the main tunnel
willow scrunches along behind the tip toeing brownies
they hear the baby crying
they peek through the door
inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser ably
her tears are being carried to a high level in tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel operated by four elves
theyre always tormenting babies
they make them cry and take their tears
somebody has to do it
how else they gonna make dew drops
the baby shrieks
im getting her out of there
you let us handle this
come along rool
teemo ridiculously pushes willow away from the door
with a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt and he and rool open the door
they enter like gunslingers in a saloon
the four elves who are twice their size turn and face them
teemo draws his small dagger
with confidence he smiles at rool
right between the eyes
to the elves he never misses
artfully teemo poises the dagger above his head
with all his might he throws
his dagger flip flops through the air and lands at the elves feet plink plunk
was that right
that wasnt right
suddenly the entire wall implodes
the elves scream and panic as willow comes crashing in like king kong
he grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm
the brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where the elves keep their vultures corralled
they untie th evulture and send them flapping away in the forest as willow wiggles out of the elf hole with the baby
they run for their lives
rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed willow barely keeping up with them
little elf arrows shower the forest as the angry elves chase after them whoop ing and screaming
they skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion
the elves are shrieking toward them
the only chance of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge
the brownies scamper out
willow looks down and reels with vertigo
i cant go out there with the baby
frantically point elves
the elf army pours out of the forest
willow holds his breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of the tree
arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a drunken tightrope walker toward the middle
the brown ies wait for him
ohhh i hate this
take your time
dont worry about the elves
they wont come out here
because of the trolls
the brownies console willow with unworried laughter
they only come out at night
an ugly troll snarls up behind willow
they all scream and race for the other side
another troll pops up to meet them
the trolls slink along like possums
the brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk
the elves meanwhile flint start a fire at their end of the tree
one troll claws at the brownies inside the trunk while the other chases willow across gangling branches
then the baby falls out of the papoose
she tumbles and catches on a low branch and willow races the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into the gorge
one troll catches rool but cant then get his claw out of the trunk
the brownies finally excape
the tree burns and breaks dangling over the gorge by its roots
a troll howls as he falls to his death
the other scrambles up the tree and grabs willows foot
willows boot slips off and down goes the second troll
flames lick at willow as he at last hauls himself to safety just as the roots snap and the blazing tree goes crashing down in the gorge
this is not going well
queen cherlindrea will know what to do
willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into the forest
hobbling slightly on his bootless foot
fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful trees as willow and the brownies trek into the magical fairy kingdom
elora danan falls into a peaceful sleep
willow comes to a halt
his mouth drops open
the forest is a luminous milky way of dancing flying fairies like fireflies
the brownies tug at his pant legs and whisper
this is a privilege
no body ever gets called before her majesty
wonder struck willow walks into a clearing where colorful night flowers bloom
he lowers himself onto an enormous toadstool testing it with his hand
other brownies stand watching like courtiers
the tiny fairies fly up to willows face and giggle they look like five year old girls full of mischief and fun
suddenly a strange light begins to throb behind the trees peircing the forest with helter skelter beams
willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings his eyes
its the queen
cherlindrea the fairy queen materializes out of frag ments of moving light diaphanous sylph like beauti ful
i hope you are comfortable here inside my kingdom
willow says nothing still batling the bright light
i cant see anything shes too bright
the light diminishes enabling willow to see the queen
she is a beautiful vision with flowing hair and lumi nous eyes
her magical presence both stuns and impresses willow
she turns to the brownies
broke heart of nightingale for our honored guest
all the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into action bustling about going to work some even trip ping over one another
they bring willow a drink in a delicate cup shaped leaf and he takes a sip
the queen dissolves and reappears near willow
she le ans down and opens the babys swaddling and looks at the mark on the babys arm
it is elora danan
the prophecy has come true
the tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh with respect and amazement
cherlindrea seems to levi tate the baby out of willows arms floating her magi cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks
the brownies and fairies crowd around with great rever ence
you mean you know who this baby belongs to
she belongs to all of us
she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth
willow starts to get up
what a relief
now i can go home
the queen fragments and reappears right in front of willow
your journey has just begun
it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of queen bavmorda whose evil powers have darkened our world
upon you depends this princesss life
the fairy queen flashes and vanishes
willow lowers himself back down again
she reappears behind him
you are the guardian willow
you must take her to tir asleen
what is tir asleen
willow cant keep track of her
she keeps changing her shape
the brownies and fairies snicker at willows confusion
it is a distant castle where a great king and queen will look after elora danan and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule
she is gone again
willow looks everywhere frusturated by these riddles and mysteries
where is tir asleen
how far is it
she reappears again
the way has been lost in time
but there is one person a druid sor ceress who might guide you there
she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago
her name is fin raziel
you need a warrior for this job
you are very important willow
no im not
have you really looked at me
jumps to his feet im short
even for a nelwyn
from down at his feet rool and teemo stare up insult ed
continuing why cant you do it
you have mag ical powers
my prsence cannot extend beyond this forest
but i can give you these
cherlindrea drops three small objects in willows hand
they will protect you
use them wisely
willow looks at them for quite a while
they look like acorns
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone
willow looks closely at the acorns then up at the queen
are you serious
the forest light grows brighter
the queen looms over willow and he again has to shield himself from the brightness
sternly i am very serious willow
there is no time to lose
now she intensifies her light so that willow backs away completely covering his face
but ive got a family to think about
they need me
the queen swirls around him like a solar wind blowing the forest trees scaring even the brownies
and then all of a sudden silence
and total darkness
all we see in dim moonlight is willows face peeking out from between his fingers
the queens voice echoes the forest
bavmorda powers are growing like an evil plague
soon she will con trol the lives of you children your wife your village
very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin to flicker restoring light to the forest
more light genlty brightens bathing the woods and the fairy queen reappears
she is holding elora danan in her arms
the brownies creep out from behind the trees
all eyes are upon willow
the choice is yours
willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment
he struggles with his conscience
the fairies and brownies wait in anticipation
at last willow looks up at them resolved and determined
ill do it
yes i will ill do it
the fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause
fairies giggle playfully around willows face and brownies hug his ankles
but i only have one shoe
we see willows feet as he walks along
he has himself a brand new shoe
spirits high he treks in the sunshine papoose strapped to his back
teemo rides in his pocket while rool straddles the papoose tickling the giggling baby
wait till i tell my children
stuff like this never happens in my village
he digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it high in the air
the brownies gasp
hey careful there
how do these work i wonder
i got ta save one to show the high aldwin
rool points through the trees
willow hurries down the hill to the tree line
in the valley below nock maar soldiers and calvalrymen battle a hundred ragtag rebel troops
from this sage position high on the hillside willow watches in disgust
weapons clash and men fall to their deaths
they hear a clank behind them
willow slowly turns around
there is movement in the trees
the hillside woods are full of nockmaar horsemen moving right up next to him
in the valley the oupowered rebels are being forced up the hill toward them
willow is suddenly standing under several large horses and black armored minions
he is frozen in fear
swords flash and the horseman charge
the brownies jump and run for their lives
willow stumbles and spins as horse after horse thunders past him nearly trampling him and the baby to death
the nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining rebels and crush them
willow falls and quickly digs the baby out of the papoose
she is shrieking in ter ror
he holds her tight and runs along the tree line following the brownies while the bloody battle rages below
lets get out of here
shhh dont cry elora
things cant get any worse than this
bleak rain dribbles down willows miserable face
pro tecting the baby he hurries toward a tavern
the bot tom of the building is an open stable with several horses
two burly iron workers clank a red hot wagon rim fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse
its a rough place
rool and teemo peek out of willows pockets
upstairs people drink and shout
im not going in there
dont worry im a sorcerer
what could possibly happen
suddenly theres a crash up above and two picts burst through a balcony and land in the mud fighting vi ciously
rool and teemo duck inside willows pockets
willow steps around the picts dashes through the stable and up the stairs
the place is packed with tattooed picts nomadic fami lies mothers wit babies thieves and cutthroats
willow enters with the crying baby
could you spare some milk for this poor hungry baby
everyone looks up
mopping a table is an ugly barmaid as big as a wrestler
get outa here peck
get him out
beat it peck
they hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their weapons
willow runs along the wall and takes cover under some stairs
he pulls open his pocket and peers down inside
i could use your help boys
instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles
willow cautiously looks out under the stairs
he sees a pail of milk very near some roughnecks
willow puts his little finger in the babys mouth silencing her
he creeps out
and bravely reaches for the milk
willow slaps his pocket
then stretches his arm out very very slowly
and gets the pail and zips back under the stairs
this is not fun
he soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby
catching his breath he backs up and leans agains a woodplank wall
the plank gives way and willow falls through the wall
willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed
peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan ic
one is a plump chested wench with a pretty face
very frightened she looks out the window
the other woman who wears a kerchief over her hair packs thick powder and make up paint on her face
in a gruff voice how do i look
willow pops up like a jack in the box
where the hell did you come from
willow strides toward madmartigan holding the baby like a machine gun
i trusted you
the brownies peek out
youre crawling with rodents
the bedroom door explodes open
in storms a big mean half drunk raging lug named llug
where is he
madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat
the wench innocently curtsies
theres nobody here except me and my um cousin
llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi ciously at madmartigan who bats his heavily made up eyelashes
he speaks in a high feminine voice
how do you do
llug sniffs at madmartigan then fixes his gaze on madmartigans flat chest
he goes to squeeze him there but madmartigan ducks out of the way and snatches the baby from willow
give me that baby
high voice these pecks make terrible nurse maids
willow angrily jumps up and down swiping at the baby
high voice they get too excited
with a swing of the hip madmartigan butts willow aside and maternally puts the baby against his chest
llug houd dogs him around the room finally cornering him and staaring lecherously into his eyes
madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in front of his face
then he smells the baby
he winces and groans
mischievously time to change her diaper
time to leave
madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out
but he doesnt get very far
several nockmaar soldiers push him back in
then they grab madmartigan and wil low and llug and his wife and haul them all outside
madmartigan is slammed against a wall
then llug and his wife
in the b
nockmaar troops are rousting the tavern taking babies away from frightened mothers and inspecting them
heavy bootsteps thud toward them
willow looks out and recognizes sorsha the black helmeted knight from the bridge
are you the mother of that child
looks at llug in a high voice i mean yes
sorsha strides over to madmartigan her sword drawn
let me see it
madmartigan looks at willow then back at sorsha
high voice i cant
let me see it
madmartigan looks at willow then back at sorsha
high voice i cant
to willow why not
because shes sick
to sorsha because shes sick
give it to me
sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike
she grabs for the baby
instinctively madmartigan el bows her away whacking her hard and knocking her off balance against a nearby bench
the soldiers tense up pointing their swords and spears
sorsha regains her balance
she rips off her black helmet
long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders
she is a young woman and madmartigans eyes pop open
he does his best to keep up his femal facade
high voice gawd
youre not a woman
sorsha comes right up to madmartigan squinting into his eyes
the she rips away his kerchief and muffler
not a woman
all hell breaks loose
llug charges for madmartigans throat
madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and dashes right out the window
llug bulldozes sorsha and her lieutenant and the tavern patrons take advantage of the chaos and stampede for the stairs
willow dives out the window after madmartigan
she grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who clatter toward the stairs flinging people out of their way
madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in the wagon below
the two iron workers look up with concern
then they react with surprise as madmartigan rips away his disguise
up above willow charges along the balcony
madmarti gan juggles the baby and whips the reins
the wagon pulls away iron workers scrambling after it
willow flings himself off the balcony
the brownies tumble out of his pocket
they all land in the back of the wagon as it takes off
it has stopped raining
in the stable under the tavern horses smash together and people fall in the mud and the nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the traffic jam
as madmartigan lashes the horse willow crawls up to hum and takes the baby
we couldve been killed madmarti gan
in the back the brownies boucne all over the place amid wooden kegs and other objects
when they finally get their balane they look back in alarm
chasing them are two nockmaar horsemen plus a death dog and a war chariot
willow ducks low and peeks out protectively hugging the baby
the wagon bounces and flies along but the minions are quickly gaining
rool and teemo spring into action
they struggle with all their might and manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the wagon
the kegs bounce onto the road and the minions lose some ground trying to avoid them
but soon the horse men flank the wagon
one leaps off his galloping horse and climbs on board
the other draws an arrow and gets ready to fire
madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes
he quickly rolls into the back
the archer firse
and hits the other minion in the chest
madmartigna snaps a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes the wounded minion off the wagon he crashes onto the road
willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the reins
at the same time the minion archer leaps aboard
he and madmartigan fight in the back
then theres a terrible howl right beside willow
the death dog is leaping alongside the wagon gnashing and trying to board
willow yanks the reins and swerves the wagon into the dog which yelps furiously
in the back madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the swerving jolt
up ahead willow sees an exposed tree root in the road
the wagon is headed straight for it
the wheel hits the root hard and willow is dumped onto the wagon floor and very nearly goes overboard
in the back madmartigan and the minion keep fighting as the wagon clatter along out of control
the death dog catches up again and this time spring aboard
the dog snaps at the baby
willow scurries under the wagon seat
the dog stands up on its hind feet
it gets ready to attack
an overhanging tree branch hits it and willow looks up from under the seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling from the tree rapidly disappearing in the distance
in the back meanwhile the minion draws a knife
mad martigan ducks out of his way hanging onto a post at the edge of the tailgate
the minion comes after him
suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off
the jolt throws the minion off balance
madmartigan kicks him
the minion hurtles off the taligate but holds on dragged by the wagon
rool and teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large wooden keg
together they yank it
untying the keg and sending it tumbling off the back
the minion looks up in horror as the heavy keg crushes him
but the danger is far from over
the wagon rocks along with one wheel half destroyed
willow whips the reins and looks over his shoulder
steam rolling toward them is the war chariot
the nockmaar chariot driver stands up and stuffs the reins in his mouth
he rasise his arm and begins to twirl a deadly weapon a kind of bolo blade over his head
madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon post
the chariot driver hurls the whistling blade chonk
it lodges in the post
so does the chariot driver
back and forth the wagons smashing up each other
at last madmartigan lets go of the post and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the airl over a cliff to his death
willow tries to stop the horse
but the wheel col lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch
the brownies dive overboard
madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately sends the wagon up the road
he scrambles down into the ditch and lies flat beside willow
suddenly hoofbeats thunder and sorsha and the rest of her troops gallop past
lying flat madmartigna raises his head and sees sorshas long flowing red hair
that girl is a vision
as soon as the troops are gone willow jumps up
wheres the baby
i thought you had her
the brownies are waving and gesturing madly pointing at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the wagon
willow and madmartigan race over and start dig ging flinging debris aside
now willow i know youre gonna blame me for this but it wasnt my fault
willow sees the battered lifeless papoose
he grabs it and rips it open
madmartigan kneels in the dirt remorsefully
when i left the crossroads i got ambushed by an elf
you saved her life
willow holds up the baby
she giggles and smiles
madmartigan switches gears boasting i mean of course i saved her life
shes almost my daughter isnt she
willow bundles the baby and looks up the road
lets get out of here before they come back
they hurry off into the darkening woods
a campfire blazes
willow tends the baby while the brownies point up at the stars
northeast is that way
weve come west and south
madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire spraying the brownies with sparks
youre gonna set us on fire
not a bad idea
madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick
then he squats beside willow and the baby
so youre on your way to tir asleen huh
i hate to tell you this willow but tir asleen dosnt exist
yes it does
the fairy queen told me
the fairy queen
and the baby heres a princess
and these two rodents are your guides
he shakes his head sceptically stretches out and puts his feet up on a log
in the morning i think ill be on my way
he laughs sarcastically
willow sets down the baby
he takes off kiayas necklace and fingers it sadly
madmartigan i need your help
a great magician like you
you dont need any help
willow stares at him angrily
but youre a great swordsman
he jumps and starts pacing around the fire
rool and teemo dive for cover
explodes youre not a warrior madmartigan
a warrior wouldnt lie there and do nothing
he kicks madmartigans boot and knocks his feet off the log
were in trouble
youve seen the big army thats after us
youre a fake
youre a bum
youre a youre a coward
he picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire sending up a shower of sparks
madmartigan eyes him with concern
whats with you peck
willow lets it all pour out
he begins to cry
i miss my wife
i miss my chil dren
my boy ranon
hes growing up so fast he even helps me on the farm now
and little mims
if you ever saw her sweet little face youd melt madmartigan youd melt
sniffles or maybe you wouldnt
you dont know anything about love
you dont know anything about any thing
willow sits on the ground exhausted
madmartigan picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap
i was in love once willow
she had a hold on my heart
i could barely function
a pause i was a great swordsman
i was knighted
i could have been king
but she betrayed me
she robbed me of my dream
madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the fire
willow watches him curiously
ill never fall in love again
willow wakes up and looks around
the baby is gone
he scrambles a short distance through some bushes
theyve been camped all night near the shore of a lake
willow finds madmartigan and the baby bathing happily in the water
were having fun
the baby squeals with delight as madmartigan twirls her around
he lifts her yp and carries her to willow on the shore
the brownies crawl thorugh the bushes
rool points out at the lake
the sorceress lives there
in the middle of the lake is an island with a single tree
are you sure
she lives out on that island
madmartigan lets out a sarcastic sceptical laugh
teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island
that tree dosnt look like gold to me
madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest
its branches are supposed to be made of gold solid gold
how are we going to get out there
madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking
well find a way willow
look over there that looks like a village maybe theyve got a boat
come on what are you waiting for
madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village in the distance
half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of the lake
there are no inhabitants just a lot of dis carded junk including a few battered fishing boats
but madmartigan keeping one eye on the gold tree out on the island is undaunted
he rummages through the debris hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it toward the water
give me a hand here peck
willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps mad martigan
what are you doing
they turn around
a golden haired boy is standing waist deep in th elake
madmartigan is instantly wary of him
its nothing to do with you
but the boy looks innocent and harmless and willow ap proaches him
we need to get out to that island
the island is cursed
madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense grunting and push ing the boat into the water
weve traveled a long way
were looking for fin raziel
but you cant go there
the island is cursed
no patience yeah
who cursed it
her powers govern the elements
ahh hes trying to protect the gold
come on willow
madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar eager to go
willow looks down at the brownies for help
what would the fairy queen say
shes not here
to rool obviously
without raziel well never find tir asleen
decision wed better go
willow marches to the boat
calmly accepting their choice the golden haired boy dives into the lake and disappears
willow and the brownies board the boat and madmartigan poles them away from the shore
they row across the placid lake toward the island
they climb onto the rocky shore
flies buzz and swarm around them and creepy bugs crawl around their feet
broken skeletons litter the shore
handing the baby back and forth willow and madmartigan claw their way up to the large tree
madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch
a littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi ciously at madmartigan chattering its teeth
raziel scampers over to willow
her voice screeches like a parrot
she looks like an otter with a bush tail
who are you
who are you
im willow ufgood
im here to find fin raziel
she springs right onto willows chest
willow looks down at the browines questioninghly
this cant be right
this isnt a sorceress
this is some kind of animal
queen bavmorda transformed her
what do you want
we need your help
to take this baby to tir asleen
shes a prin cess
still sceptical willow shows raziel the babys mark
raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks her tail
madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree
a flock of birds suddenly screech and fly away
his eyes bulge
you were right
this whole tree is made of gold
he strips away the bark revealing a vein of gold
you should never have come to this place
were all going to die
the wind begins to blow and the sky darkens
raziel zips over to willow and whispers intensely
weve got to get off this island right now
its our only chance
the wind howls
they hurry down to the boat
madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree
waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard
madmarti gan loads up with branches
as they push off he scrambles down the rocks
just in time he jumps into the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy lake
willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches the boat
madmartigan hangs onto his gold but pices of it drop and topple overboard
suddenly a hand appears on the stern
the water boy climbs in
madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back into the lake
the boy surfaces like a dolphin
his shape begins to change becoming fish like diving and vanishing
then he attacks the boat
he is now a ferocious shark like monster
he chomps the boat and the gold branches slide into the water
madmartigan bashes the monster with the oar then grabs an anchor
the mon ster attacks again and madmartigan jabs its gill with the anchor
the monster sinks into the lake
they all sigh with relief
madmartigan shrugs proudly
suddenly the an chor line unravels tangling madmartigans legs in fishing nets and yanking him overboard
underwater madmartigan swirls behind the monster
he pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts himself free with his dagger
he surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat
willow reaches out to him
the monster surfaces and circles the boat
then it attacks madmartigan
willow digs out a magic acorn
but he drops it
he fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it
the monster opens its jaws and goes to devour madmartigan
willow throws the acorn
the monster miraculously turns to stone
madmartigan grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster sinks
willow hauls him into the boat
the storm begins to die down as they jump to shore ex hausted
madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged loincloth
he falls to his knees coughing and spit ting
we could team up
he pulls himself up and follows willow
suddenly they all stop
sorsha and her men come out of the woods
the brownies scurry into a hole
raziel makes a dash for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear dangling her in front of sorsha
did you think my mother would allow you to escape
sorsha gestures and the soldier takes raziel away
the lieutenant wrestles the baby away from willow
he gives her to sorsha
this is what were looking for
it bears the markings
dont worry willow
if theres one thing im good at its charm ing a woman
he swaggers forward
sorsha turns and looks at him
couldnt live without me huh
sorsha looks up and down at his naked body
lose your skirt
madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth
still got what counts
a pause as he smiles at her
not for long
she raises her fist and zap madmartigan is instantly surrounded by spears and swords
well join the column
bring them with us
madmartigan and willow are roughly taken away
sorsha and her troops mount horses and ride off
rool and teemo crawl lup from under a rock
we gotta follow them
well never catch them
any way were all done teemo
lets go home
rool walks off and teemo grabs him yanks him back
get back here rool
let go of me
rool throws a punch and the brownies somersault into the bushes fighting each other
sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty nockmaar troops
chained by their necks
willow and madmartigan walk behind a wagon
raziel sits trapped in a cage on the back of the wagon
i cant go on
willow loses strength falls and is dragged
madmarti gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders
sorsha sees this
willow why dont you use your mag ic to get us out of here
hes no magician
he turned that monster into stone
raziel peers sternly at willow who is eye level with her cage
did you give that acorn its power
a magician makes magic
any fool can use it
madmartigan shakes his head at her
then you get us out of here
but i need help
ill help you
you must learn magic
thats all i ever wanted
then i will teach you
sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan carrying the baby who is crying
madmartigan with willow still on his shoulders straightens up and flirts with her
real nice hair
id say youve got the most beautiful hair ive ever she flashes her eyes at him
wolff wants to boil you in oil
she nods toward her lieutenant who snarls viciously
dont tempt me
she turns away
the baby squirms and cries
if you rest the baby on your shoulder shell stop crying
sorsha rides along
she shifts the baby to her other shoulder and she instantly stops crying
sorsha throws a look at willow
madmartigan takes a long deep breath
mmmm i love the smell of a woman
angry threat my step fathers going to tear you apart
madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her im torn apart already
i mean it
under all that armor is a beautiful crack
sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead
who is that girl anyway
sorsha queen bavmordas daughter
madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself
forget that one madmartigan
raziel leaps against the bars of her cage chatters her teeth and whispers to willow
to learn magic first you must make your own philosophers stone
what do i need for that
we must start with feathers dung and a lock of your hair
willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his eyes and frowns at it
madmartigan meanwhile cant take his eyes off sorsha
now thats a woman
fires and torches burn around pitched tents
soldiers eat and drink and meat is thrown out to death dogs
from her cage raziel looks down at willow still chained to the wagon next to madmartigan
willow is grinding a substance with a rock
keep working at it
forget all you know or think you know
a magicians power depends on disord er of the mind
she twists her head through the bars
madmartigan squints up at her
you got that one covered
willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent
i hope shes all right
how much more do i have to do of this
till its in a powder
the energy exits within you
reciting i know and the magicians goal is to find his true self
but whats this got to do with it
as below so above
you hold the univers willow in your hand
madmartigan clasps his forhead
im beginning to think you two deserve to be locked up
the universe is a living creature like you and me madmartigan
madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky gesturing wide ly
were a tiny version of all that
as above so below
madmartigan rolls his eyes
willow jumps to his feet and shows raziel the substance
im all finished
burn it to a fine ash
willow looks around
heavily armed nockmaar minions rip chunks of meat around a campfire
how am i gonna do that
you will find a way
suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them
willow quickly folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his pocket
the lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them suspiciously
he abruptly snatches willow up hacks the chain and drags him off
whats going on
madmartigan sturggles against his chains
angry and worried hurt him and youll answer to me
the lieutenant clamps irons on willows wrists flings him into a tent and exits
willow looks up and sees sorsha still in her uniform impatiently pacing wiht the crying baby
this baby wont do what i say
you seem to know what to do
make it shut up
sorsha dumps the baby in willows arms and then backs away
she needs to be changed
i changed her already
willow politely shrugs
she needs to be changed again
sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby
soon the baby stops crying
re lieved yet still anxious sorsha paces to a mirror
willow rocks the baby gently absently looking at the fire
then his eyes focus on the fire
who is that horrible friend of yours
watching the fire madmartigan
who is he
i dont know much about him
sorsha fiddles with her long red hair
willow creeps toward the fire
hes very bold
do you really think my hair is beautiful
she turns and looks right at willow
he looks back
she asks the question again by holding out strands of her hair
its very nice hair
he suddenly strides over to sorsha
i know shes hungry
i tried to feed her but she wouldnt eat a thing
im not a wet nurse
he hands sorsha the baby then goes to the fire where theres a stone crock of milk
he carefully takes his cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it
at the other side of the tent sorsha awkwardly paces with the baby
i tried everything
i poured milk into her mouth she just spat it out
i dont know what to do im not a mother
during this willow ignites his powdery substance
it flares slightly then burns to an ash
he gathers it up then returns to sorsha with the milk
sometimes she likes it heated
willow finds a strip of cloth dips it in the milk and feeds elora danan in sorshas arms
he looks up at sorsha and smiles
shes a good baby
sorsha looks down at the baby
the caravan packs up to move on
soldiers drag willow to the wagon and lift him on board chaining him beside raziels cage
willow excitedly pats his pocker and whispers i did it
i got the ashes
when the soldiers leave he digs out the pouch and proudly shows it to raziel
the first step is complete
chained behind the wagon madmartigan reaches forward and pokes willow with his finger
did she ask about me
come on peck dont give me a hard time
you were in her ten all night
did she say anything
willow deliberately plays innocent
she said lots of thing
at last she asked about you madmartigan
well what did she say
suddenly sorsha gallops by on horseback holding the baby
she flings a wad of clothes at madmartigan
youre going to need these where were going
she rides off
madmartigan looks down at the clothes
the looks at willow
shes in love
i think youre in love
the nockmaar caravan climbs into snow covered moun tains
in the wagon raziel is grilling willow
he concentrates hard cramming memorizing straining
we dont have much time left
i must concetrate my imagination
to creat a new
whats the magicians weapon
the limitless power of
raziel flips around in spasms of impatience
what else could it be
frustrated i cant remember all these things
what am i learning
the art of transformation
exasperated but what am i gonna transform
willow and madmartigan stare at raziel
what are you gonna become raziel
queen of the rodents
sorsha rides up to the wagon
the babys cold
with care keeping the baby bundled she hands the baby to willow
madmartigan watches and listens
you remind me of your father sor sha
my father was a weakling
he was a great king
madmartigan reacts not like your step father not like your mother
he ruled tir asleen with kindness and a generous heart
my mother calls that weakness
what do you call it
sorsha turns and glares at madmartigan
i do what im told
too bad youre not more like your father
she looks at him a moment then abruptly mounts her horse and rides ahead
the caravan rides toward a large nockmaar camp
death dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance
willow and madmartigan watch as king kael rides out to meet the caravan
kael is huge powerful and cruel partbeast part man and he carries a terrible sword at his side
sorsha carefully shows him the baby
he grabs it from her
dont tell me what to do
kael viciously hits sorsha knocking her off her horse
madmartgian and willow watch angrily
kail gallops to ward camp with the baby under his ar
sorsha shakes away the pain and humiliated mounts her horse
we gotta get the baby out of here
raziel dashes around her cage
complete the philosophers stone
i must be turned back
looking off into the camp angry and resolute willow takes out the ingredients for the stone
ill do it raziel
now in a kind of portable cell madmartigan clutches the jail bars and looks out at the camp
fires and torches burn and nockmaar soldiers patrol
shivering cold willow sits cross legged in the jail melting snow into a bowl
on a nearby lean to where skins and shields are kept raziel hangs in her cage
somewhere the baby is crying
in the distance sorsha goes inside one of the tenst
theres a muffled yel ling between sorsha and kael
then keal storms out of the tent and goes inside the tent next door
willow pours the ashes into the melted snow
let it settle
concentration and will
now pour the water off
as willow works madmartigan binds together scrap sticks of wood making a long pole
he gingerly hooks raziels cage with this lifting it from the spike
oooh this smells terrible
thats the life spark
exxence of magic and sorcery
madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard him
he grabs it with both hands and rips it apart
raziel right away scurries down the cell bars jumps into the jail and bits willows hand
they look out nervously at patrolling nockmaar sol diers
willow sucks the back of his hand
whatd you bit me for
we need blood
to nourish the stone
charge the stone with ener gy
willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs it with a twig
it begins to glow from within
the components of the stone are fusing
willows eyes widen with anticipation
fires have burned down
most of the camp is sleeping
it is nearing dawn
madmartigan stares out at sorshas tent deep in thought
willow holds up the completed philosophers stone a red ball of pliable putty
again what is the magicians weapon
now use it
willow presses the philophers stone against the chainlock
he sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at raziel
i just wanted to test it first
change me back into a sor ceress willow
willow goes to raziel and concentrates with physical and mental intensity
avaggdu supriom luwatha
it starts to work
raziel curls into a ball of fur
the fur changes to feathers
she begins to squawk strangely
she emerges as a raven sized bird
what did i do
he sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered hands
the lock falls open
they all look over and madmartigan picks it up off the ground
not bad peck
you busted the lock
wilow clutches madmartigans arm
he holds up the stone
lets get eloran danan
with coldness in his eyes madmartigan stares across the camp at sorshas tent
lets get elora danan
they sneak away
what about me
raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky
willow and madmartigan sneak behind tents hiding from the patrolling guards
very quietly they creep up to kaels tent
madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals his knife
they crawl dangerously over to sorshas tent
youre a magician willow
but im a thief
ill get the baby
madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips inside
raziel flutters down and lands on willows shoulder
im supposed to be a beautiful wo man
willow shrugs apologetically
crouched inside the large tent madmartigan calculates his next move
in the far corner sorsha lies asleep
he steals the baby from a crib of straw
starts to leave
willow pokes his head inside
whispers come on madmartigan
madmartigan stares over at sorsha
lured by her beau ty he slowly walks toward her bed
what are you doing
get out of there
madmartigan looks down at her
morning rushlight il luminates her youthful face and her long red hair is spread across her pillow
out of her armor in soft nightclothes she looks like a goddess
upon her breast is a golden necklet inlaid with ornate jewels
quietly i love you
he kisses her lips
her eyes open
one move and you really will be a woman
holding the baby madmartigan does not move a muscle
sorsha holds a knife at his crotch
youre a fool
now put her back
im not going to let this baby die
sorsha presses the knife
dont make me kill you
willow watches as madmartigna carefully backs away from sorsha
i believe you would
sitting up sorsha waves her knife
madmartigan places the baby in the straw crib
why did you say that
i love you
madmartigan walks back to sorsha bed
willow crawls into the tent behind madmartigans back
because its true
i dont believe you
sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as madmartigan walks toward her
he shows no fear of her knife com pelled instead by honest passion
for once he isnt conning anybody
his feelings are genuine
i wish it werent true
i swore id never let this happen
i hate you
i hate your beauty i hate your innocence i hate the feelings youve awakened in me
the knife trembles in sorshas hand
im in love with you sorsha
i dont want to be but a power has enchanted me and i stand helpless against it
battle field or prison cell was never half as cruel
he kneels onto her bed
her hand falls her knife falls to the floor her chest heaves with fear and emo tion
i want you and i cant have you so i want you all the more
if this were another time and another place id he stops
he looks into her eyes
willow dashes out of the tent with the baby
madmartigan takes sorsha in his arms and kisses her
her trembling body surrenders to him
until they hear a scream outside the tent
it all happens quickly
kael rips open the canvas and catches them in their embrace
in one hand he holds the baby
in the other hand willow
whats going on here
sorsha sees the baby sees the empty crib and smashes madmartigan hard across the face
kael hurls willow across the tent and tosses the baby in the straw
growling horribly he lunges at madmarti gan
madmartigan rolls away and sees sorshas sword nearby
as kael draws his sword madmarti gan artfully slices away the center pole and the en tie tent collapses
bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas and ra ziel hovers and screeches above
then a silver blade slits through the tent and out jumps madmartigan wielding sorshas sword
nockmaar soldiers and death dogs charge across the snow
madmartigan battles them with incredible skill backing toward the mountain slope
wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent clutchign the baby
madmartigan kills several so diers littering the snow with bodies and weapons
willow reacts impressed by madmartigans swordsman ship
madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging it he bows prod and cocky
he slips on the ice and catches himself
nearby a shield skids off along the snow
jump on the shiled
kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent
then he gashes it open with his huge black sword
he sees willow and the baby get on the large shield
madmartigan runs toward the shield
archers draw their bows
madmartigan turns and sees sorsha beside kael
i didnt betray you
i love you
as arrows rain down around him madmartigan leaps onto the shield behind wuillow
sorsha watches them as they slide away down the mountain raziel flapping and shrieking overhead
kael waves his sward and a crack squad of nockmaar horsemen gallop down the mountain after the sled shield
willow hugs the baby while he sits between madmartigans legs and the shield zooms down the moun tain zig zagging through trees
madmartigan steers by using sorshas sword as a ski pole
the nockmaar horsemen gallop after them
the shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps
raziel squawks in terror above them
just missing trees and rocks they pick up speek
their eyes sud denly widen
dead ahead is a huge wall of ice
willow shuts his eyes
the shield speeds toward the wall
at the last moment madmartigan steers them into a small opening little more than a crack
raziel nearly smashing into the wall herself soars up into the sky and loses them
they slide and sway down a long tube of ice picking up incredible speed until they loop degrees upside down and around and go shooting out a hole at the
they soar thorugh the air
madmartigan and willow shriek in terror
but elora danan giggles shes hav ing fun
but in the air the shield goes one way and they go another flipping and hanging onto one another and landing on soft snow with a fffump
inertia keeps them rolling
clumped together they tumble down the mountain gath ering snaw as they go bouncing and rolling into a snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
the snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the foot of the mountain
chldren look up and squeal with delight while the adult villagers run for their lives
it plows through the middle of the village scattering peole and animals left and right
at last it smashes against a stone house and cracks open like an egg
raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball flapping her wings frantically
madmartigan crawls out as the villagers rush up
they stand back in amaze ment the baby starts crying
are you all right
madmartigan drags willow and the baby out of the snow
willows body is limp hes unconscious
then a vil lager points up at the mountain
to villagers help us
in the distance kael and his squad of about horsemen charge toward the village
the villagers flee into their huts and houses
madmartigan scoops up willow and the baby
some villagers usher them around a corner and into a house just as kaels army invades the town
madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts behind him
men women and children huddle here in silence like refugees or criminals
madmartigan hands the crying baby to a woman then lays willow on the floor
suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder his old friend and rival airk thaughbaer
settled down with a family huh
madmartigan knocks airks hand away
you left me to die friend
you managed alright
is this whats left of your army
among the refugees is a handful of war battered warri ors
one of them an officer looks out through the ceiling beams
keep that baby quiet
they hear hoofbeats outside
airk gives madmartigan a flask of whiskey
he squirts whiskey into willows mouth and willow coughs and shudders awake
raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down
nockmaar soldiers flood the village dismounting kicking down doors searching houses
then raziel sees kael riding alongside sorsha
in her armor at a distance sorsha looks fierce
but closer her eyes show confusion hesitation
kael watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil lage
where is it
tell us or well burn your village
he shakes her roughly
raziel watches as sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where madmartigan and willow are hiding
willow holds the baby tight
madmartigan airk and the officer watch through the cracks
boots pound above shaking dust down on them
a door opens
willow buries the baby in his chest
madmartigan peeks through the door
sorsha alone comes down into the cellar
they see her
airks men reach for their swords begin to draw
whisper kill her
madmartigam shakes his head
youll draw the others
airk looks at madmartigan curiously
madmartigan watches sorsha
she is right there inches away
inaudibly be says her name
at last she goes back upstairs
sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two soldiers
in willows arms the baby lets out a cry
sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords
the babys cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud sdrrech
raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around the house cawing and shrieking insanely
sorsha and the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave
everyone sighs with relief
in the distance the nockmaar army is setting houses ab laze and kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with his sword
sorsha mounts her horse
her attention is momemtarily caught by a man across the street who from the back looks like madmartigan
the man turns around
she sags with disappointment spurs her horse and rides off
the deadly squad of nockmaar horsemen gallops out of the village
madmartigan and willow come upstairs with airk and his men
its you theyre after madmarti gan
what did you do this time
theyre not after me
they want the baby
living in the house is a scrawny shifty eyed man named cuth
he watches and listens
who is this baby
willow steps forward both protective and proud
the princess elora danan
they all know of her
they all sigh with respeck and awe and they bow
the prophecy has come true
give her to us
well protect her
raziel screeches from a ceiling beam
willow looks up at raziel hopefully
were taking her to tir asleen
shell be safe there from bavmordas powers
airk looks up at raziel
then down at willow
he clasps madmartigans arm
tir asleen is a myth
it doesnt exist
i will show you
airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves madmar tigan in the chest
you gonna be a hero madmartigan
ive lost half my men fighting kael and bavmorda and the nock maar army
now you and this peck and that magpie up in the rafters are gonna take em on alone
challenging then come with us
airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor
the war is here
in towns and vil lages like this
airk crosses his arms and turns his back looking out at the burning houses and the suffering families
youre chasing a dream
just get me some horses
airk glares at him furiously
then he kicks open the door and storms out into the street
madmartigan and willow hurry after him
airk and his men plus some villagers watch as madmar tigan mounts a large horse
then some villagers help willow wiggle up onto a small pony
they sling the baby over willows back and stuff saddlebags with pro visions once again airk we say goodbye
sadly and cynically airk laughs
one day one of us willl stand on the others grave
they shake hands ruggedly
madmartigan nods at willow and they head off
airk watches them go clearly am bivalent about staying behind
they ride up the snowy slope raziel circling above
we see cuth
he scratches his filthy beard
he sneaks off through the village in the direction of the nock maar army
snow circles around them as they climb
then oddly the mountain becomes warmer and the snow melts away
they reach a slope of dark vitreous lava
far away at the top of the mountain looms the ominous catsle of nockmaar
the black lava flows from it like a deadly shadow
their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the cave
raziel waits for them circling and cawing
they dismount and lead the horses
but the horses pan ic their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in the gloomy cave and they break away and run off
willow swallows hard
he and madmartigan follow raziel inside
daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten lava
i cant stand being in closed in places
want me to carry elora
im used to her
hows she doing
willow wears the papoose on his back
madmartigan looks in at the babys face
shes doing a lot better than we are peck
willow and madmartigan laugh which breaks the tension
then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat screeches somewhere and the tensions back
they keep going
hot liquid drips from the ceiling
hissing steam bub bles from the floor
they go single file along a ledge over a foaming lava pit
raziel is squawking way ahead in the distance
this may be a bad time to ask this question but
what if raziels wrong
she cant be wrong
shes a very very very powerful sorceress
shes a bird willow
thats my fault not hers
ive got to keep practicing
im still in the learning stage but magic madmartigan requires concentration and watch it
madmartigan lunges and grabs willow just as he is about to fall into the lava pit
he hauls him to safety
they gasp with relief
then they head deeper into the cave
they hear something
then something moves on the wall
i hate this
the cave walls come to life
down them crawl ugly rock puffers pillow sized wall crabs that screech horribly like bats
madmartigan fights them off with his sword
the rock puffers bloat themselves up tripling their size
madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an untied balloon
suddenly distant hoofbeats thunder and echo
madmar tigan flashes his sword and turns around ready to de fend willow and the baby against the army
willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder
at last he turns and runs deeper into the cave
mad martigan waits
the nockmaar soldiers now increased to eighty come charging down the cave
kael rides in the lead along side the turncoat cuth
as they gallop along the ledge cuth makes the mistake of crowding kael who an grily elbos him horse and all into the boiling pit
the army tramples over the rock puffers which explode underfoot
madmartigan braces himself as they stampede toward him
but suddenly the horseman all screech thir horses to a halt
the horses rear and back away
madmartigan stands there wondering
then suddenly a shadow looms behind him
the eborsisk roars and the cave shakes and thunders
its an enormous two headed monster that doesnt like visitors
he looks around frantically
willow is nowhere to be seen
then the baby cries out
madmartigan sees them cowering behind a rock
he runs toward them
the eborsisk exhales flames over his head
go after them
soldiers obey kael and go after madmartigan
he fights them hacking down a few while a few others are in cinerated by the eborsisk
sorshas horse rears as she watches madmartigan battle for his life
archers shoot arrows which pierce the eborsisk and make it even an grier
willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket
a head of the eborsisk gnashes at madmartigan
madmar tigan looks to willow for help
willow winds up and throws with all his might
the eborsisk blasts a flame which startles willow wreck ing his aim
madmartigans eyes pop open and he ducks as the acorn whistles by his ear
the acorn bounces off a rock and flies back trickles along the ground and hits a nockmaar soldier who is already dead
the soldiers body turns to stone
one of the eborsisks heads lunges toward the baby
raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monsters eye as willow whisks the baby away
then madmartigan leaps up on the eborsisk
he climbs up over its flaming head and drives his sword down through its skull
the eborsisk howls horribly and its wounded head falls
madmartigan topples down its back and leaps onto a horse knocking its rider off and all in one swashbuckling move scooping willow and the baby up onto the back of
the horse and galloping away
but as his horsement charge forward the eborsisk falls to its knees half dead
the surviving head blasts the soldiers with fire
they rear back on their horses and continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears
they ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush valley of flowers
in the distance stands the beau tiful castle of tir asleen
raziel zooms up out of the cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to ward it
she soars higher and higher and flies right over the castle wall
the door of the castle is half open
madmartigan and willow gallop inside
raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the castle courtyard
a haunting wind drones amont twelve pillars which look like stone from a distance
theres nobody here
they approach the twelve pillars
the knights of the pacalcade
the kings bravest warriors
suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry
kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample across the valley of flowers
madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to shut it
turn them back willow
willow stares at the twelve knights
use the philosophers stone
the castle door is rusted and old
madmartigan heaves against it
outside he can see the army storming to ward him
willow digs out his philosophers stone
he squints and strains concentrating his energy
beings within beings without
danu danu walkail funfawtha
he continues to chant and to concentrate
one of the knights comes to life
i did it
you gotta see this
i did it
madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army charges up and he locks it with a huge bolt
the nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door
scale the walls
he sends his men in all directions
they leap off their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods
willow brings the knights to life one by one
tuatha tuatha danu
each knight shakes himself into action
madmartigan follows them in an armory
i transformed them all
im a magician
you didnt transform them willow you released them
that was noth ing
now change me
willows on a roll
he rubs his hands together
i feel like i could do anything
he drops to his knees and stretches his philosophers stone apart like an accordian
madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor
two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements
madmartigan wees displayed specially on a rack a com plete set of armor of shining silver
he reaches out to touch it
it belonged to our king
the knights light a fire and boil vats of oil
willow struggles to transform raziel trying to remember all he has learned
capture the enery
limitless power of the will
avvdachh doth indicht rredd baerkinhaekin
raziel begins to change
from a bird she expands stretches and turns into a goat
is that you
raziel tilts her goat head
i hate this
suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall
willow scoops up the baby and he and raziel run for cover
from their horses kael and sorsha watch as the soldiers climb the wall
they suddenly hear a hacking noise above and several nockmaar men tumble down the ladders
sorsha looks up
high on the wall stands madmartigan magnificently dressed in the glimmering armor of the king
kael roars and points his deadly sword up at madmarti gan
then several soldiers attack the castle door with a huge battering ram and smash it open
kael and sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr nock maar horsemen while madmartigan continues to battle attackers on the castle wall
willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court yeard
he makes a run for the hallway
six horsemen chase after him jumping off their horses and drawing their swords
sorsha dismounts draws a sword and strides up the stairs toward teh top of the wall
willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a corner
the six horsement run in and corner him
he grabs an enormous broadsword
swings it like a base ball bat
the momentum of the heavy sword hurls willow across the room
the blade pierces a nockmaar man
willow grunts and yanks the sword out
the remaining soldiers come after him
willow swings and flashes the sword as they close in on him
in the courtyard raziel the goat butts a few soldiers as the battle rages
madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down the wall
then he turns around
five more enemy swordsmen slash at him
madmartigan is amazing spin nig lunging ducking he takes out one two three four of them with ease
but not the fifth
its the nockmaar lieutenant
he and madmartigan swordfight
the lieutenant hacks the sword out of madmartigans hand it clatters down into the court yeard
madmartigan throws up his arm
the lieutenants sword clangs against his wrist armor knocking madmartigan onto his back
with two hands the lieutenant lifts his sword high and goes to kill madmartigan
madmartigan shuts his eyes
but nothing happens
madmartigan opens his eyes
the lieutenant stands there frozen staring at him
then falls forward
rolls over madmartigan
and plummets off teh wall
in his place stands sorsha holding a bloodied sword
he props himself up on his elbows and smiles
whose side are you on
she reaches down and pulls madmartigan to his feet
they look into each others eyes
they go to embrace
out of nowhere a nockmaar minion attacks them his sword flashing over his head
sorhsa hardly moves
she simply dusts him off the wall with her sword
she turns back to madmartigan
i love you
their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each other and kiss high up on the castle wall
kael looks up from his horse
he sees sorsha and madmartigan coming down the wall fighting nockmaar troops
kael holds up his great hand
in it he holds the baby
kael waves his men after sorsha and madmartigan
kill them both
he laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle door
as he reaches it he abruptly stops
two hundred horsemen are charging straight toward kael
led by airk thaughbaer
closer riding in airks saddlebags with their tiny daggers flashing are the long lost brownies teemo and rool
kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic
ride with me
kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers and hack their way through airks army
kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers and hack their way through airks army
madmartigan and sorsha mount horses
willow staggers out of the armory wounded and bleeding
there were too many of them
madmartigan scoops him up
with seven surviving knights they ride out
many of kaels men fall in battle
but kael and a dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave
madmartigan rides up to airk thaughbaer and their horses powerfully dance around each other
out for a little ride in the coun try airk
thought you might get lonely mad martigan
then they drop the bravado and clasp hands
thank you friend
they charge into the cave
the clamor of their hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence
the valley is littered with fallen soldiers
then raziel trots out of the castle
she clip clops across the valley and follows the others to the cave
the nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle
the army of tir asleen thunders out of the cave in pur suit
arrows fire back and forth
the tir asleen army stays right on the enemys tail
willow hangs on to madmar tigan for dear life
airk and madmartigan ride side by side perfect team work and cut a few nockmaar ment down
then madmartigan turns and sees sorsha ride up past everybody
what a rider she is
she surprises a cou ple of nockmaar soldiers swordfighting as she rides killing them both
but she cant catche kael
he rides ahead of everyone else whipping his horse at an in credible speed toward the castle
the chase continues up the mountain
the tir asleen army keeps firing arrows at the enemy or cutting them down with their swords until only two nockmaar men ride behind kael
at last kael reaches the castle drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise
his two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short and tumble into the dry craggy moat
the drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing klungg
mad martigan and arik screech to a halt on the brink of the moat
they look up
the castle loom huge dark powerful evil
any way in there
sorsha rides up to his side
the fortress is protected on all sides
the tir asleen warriors dwarfed by the huge black wall look at one another with doubt and worry
well assault at dawn
the army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies
it is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening
kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up the gloomy narrowing stairs of the queens tower
he comes to a large door and hesitates a moment showing fear
then creaks the door open
bavmorda looks up
kael cowers afraid of her evil power
carved in the floor is a magicians circle and in the very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of shining copper
bavmorda stands over the altar wear ing black robes
behind her stand two decrepit druids
i have the child
the baby squirms and cries
seething with hate bav morda reaches out her arms then shrinks back
we must start the ritual
she hears noise outside the castle
who is that
an army of rebels and traitors
bavmorda closes her eyes holds out her hands and feels the vibrations and energy around her
psychically where is sorsha
she has turned against you
bavmorda opens her eyes furiously
to her druids purify the altar
arrange the im plements
ill deal with sorsha
the druids take the baby from kael
bavmorda storms out the door
the tir asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires
then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the castle wall
amid torches and hideous minions bavmor da leers down at them and laughs
this is not an army
sorsha looks up and her mother seems to laugh right at her
madmartigan steps forward
seeing him in the ar mor of the king bavmorda stops laughing taken aback
get out of here
raziel suddenly butts willow into a tent
willlow tumbles into the tent and raziel follows him
the ritual chant
just do it
willow takes out his philosophers stone and begins to chant
madmartigan faces the queen
weve come for elora danan
turn her over to us
bavmorda stabs her finger down at him
you dare to challenge me
you are not warriors
she waves her hand casting a horrible spell over the army
madmartigans body begins to change its shape
his armor breaks apart
he grows hideous
youre all pigs
the rebel soldiers panic and run
slowly horribly they all expand and contort ripping out of their armor and clothers casting down their weapons and shields
you made your decision
bavmorda points at sorsha and sorsha too begins to change
the mountainside becomes a sea of writhing flesh
every one of the tir asleen army is transformed into a pig
queens tower dusk bavmorda throws open the door
her druids are binding the baby in a leather thong
begin the ritual
light the first candle
a druid lights on of thirteen enormous candles
bav morda glares up at the roof
in the middle of it is a large circular hole showing the starlit sky
touch this altar with your pwer
come into my tower
lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the distance
bavmorda smiles with satisfaction
a druid places teh baby on the altar
the other druid hits a loud gong once
bavmorda enters the magicians circle
her face contorts as she recites dark runes dark powers
blend and bind bind and blend universal night
and the might of nockmaar
magically she produces a razor sharp knife
lightning flashes again getting closer
willow is crouched on his knees chanting with her eyes closed
its over willow
you did well
you protected yourself
willow looks up
he hears the grunting outside
with great trepidation he crawls to the tent door
willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight
amid horses and tents and weapons hundreds of pigs wander about
willow stands and walks through them
he looks down at one point and sees rool and teemo two tiny baby pigs
then he turns and runs back into the tent
willow collapses to his knees beside raziel
ive come all this way and now elora danas going to die
i can still defeat bavmorda
shes too powerful raziel raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof
a true magician willow never surrenders
she is a sorceress i am a sorceress
transform me now and i will destroy her
willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around ra ziel
he steps outside of it holds up his philosophers stone and begins his magic
banish all disturbing forces from this place
fire water above and below
raziel begins to change
willow wrestles with his own powers of concentration and will now and then losing strength
voice distorted dont give up
he chants and strains
raziel momentarily changes into a partly formed grotesque creature
then into a deer
then she becomes human
at last she becomes herself a once beautiful and now elderly woman
willow covers her unclothed body with a simple smock
she looks down at her old hands
then her eyes focus with purpose
weve got a lot of work to do wil low
bring in our brave men
willow opens the tent
some pigs shuttle in and ra ziel begins to change them back into warriors
stationed high on the castle wall three nockmaar min ions laugh and drink
then they hear the terrible scream of the baby
they look up at the queens tower
a druid hits the ceremonial gong twice
the baby shrieks
standing over her bavmorda crushes a piece of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments into a witchs bottle
black fire forever kindled within let the second right begin
with a pair of razor sharp shears she clips the babys tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the witchs bottle
the bottle glows and sparks and teh heavens asnwer with distant thunder
in the dark tir asleen camp some figures crouch low and hurry from tent to tent
closer the faces of rebel warriors watching the castle wall
willow raziel madmartigan sorsha airk thaughbaer and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth
uphill with our rough weapons well never make it
elora danan will die
by dawn upon thirteen tolls of the runic drum
bavmorda is too powerful
we need more forces
i say we retreat
the other warriors agree
bavmorda cannot transform you
ive protected this camp with a spell
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress raziel
raziel shakes her head
bavmorda has shielded it with a spell of her own
the warriors grumble and protest
in a corner rool and teemo poke their heads in under the canvas
curi ously they look at willow who sits in silence and deep though scratching the ground with his fingernail
the warriors rumble
willow jumps to his feet
they all turn to him
i have an idea
back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs
willow this is war not agricul ture
i know i know
but this is a way to get into that castle
the all gather around willow to listen
bavmorda looks up
her face is gra dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds
a druid hits the gong three times
now three candles are lit
the baby screams on the altar
with a demonic laugh bavmorda digs her hands into a deep vat of blood then raises them over her head
the blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black cloak
they all look at willow
its too much work
it cant be done
kael will never fall for it
willow looks hopefully at madmartigan
doubtful i dont know willow
madmartigan you promised me youd take care of elora danan like your own daughter
she is all that matters
are you going to abandon her
madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard
come on madmartigan
you gonna listen to a peck
you and i are warriors
you know this plan will never work
frustrated and torn madmartigan brushes airk away
the men rally with airk
mdmartigan goes over to sor sha
well probably die here sorsha
i have no family
the gong rings four time
raziel turns to airk and his men
if we do not fight and the baby dies all hope for the future is lost
i shall face the danger alone if i have to
the men shake their heads
madmartigan still torn by indecision raises his arm and silences the protest
time is running out
we must now decide whos going to leave and who is going to stay
light pulsates in the queens tower
the druids cower behind bavmorda whose face has taken on the hideous features of a hellish beast
the baby has been streaked with ritual paint
ocht veth nockkthirth bordak
her voice growls a sickening chant and light shoots out of her claw liek fingers enveloping the baby
the baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light
the sun rises over the volcanic mountain
the gong strikes twelve times
pan across the slope outside the castle
the tir asleen army is gone
littered across the ground are flattened tents borken wagons an dis carded shields
the wind howls taking bits of debris with it
alone on the deserted mounatinside stand willow and rz ziel
time is running out
nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh
willow and ra ziel trek closer to the castle wall
willow cups his mouth
we are all powerful magicians
give us the baby or we will destroy you
the nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter
the great drawbridge falls across the moat
willow clutches a spear and trembles nervously
eight horsemen ride out of the castle with swords high
willow lifts his spear with two hands
and smashes the spear on the ground striking a loud war drum
suddenly madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse back
and the entire mountainside comes to life
tents and shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the tir asleen army charges with one loud warcry
the eight nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down
the rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle
airk thaughbaer scoops willow up on his horse and sor sha scoops raziel up on hers
madmartigan leads the assault cutting down nockmaar minions as they run out to defend the fortress
sorsha slides off her horse with raziel
airk sets willow down
sorsha leads willow and raziel into a dark hall way
rebel warriors storm into the courtyard
madmartigan circles behind airk their horses dancing handsomely
lets squah em
in unison their swords flash and they charge across the courtyard chopping down the enemy
sorsha hurries willow and raziel down a dark hallway
they come to a corner
she grabs him by the collar and yanks him back
a huge death dog leaps out wiht a gnashing roar and sorsha kills it with her sword
willow sags with relief and the women grab his hands and haul him further down the tunnel
they come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into the queens tower
willow climbs nervously behind ra ziel and sorsha
at the top in the door
light throbs behind it
suddenly they hear a loud shriek and the door shakes and bangs
willow fals to his knees frozen with fear
i will face my mother alone
willow and raziel stay back on the stairs
sorsha climbs to the door
courageously she opens it
bavmordas monstrous face fills the screen
sorsha recoils in horror
bavmorda looks barely human she has transformed into a grotesque witch
she waves her gnarled hand and her druids attack sorsha
sorsha kills them
the baby lies under a deathlike spell on the copper altar
i wont let you kill her
bavmordas voice is a demonic growl
you are a weakling
like you fa ther
can you not see that i am about to become all powerful
lightning explodes overhead
sorsha lunges for the baby
but bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy force
pulsating light lifts sorsha levitates her across the room and drives her toward a wall of spikes
just as she is about to be implaes another force stops her
bavmorda can sense the source of it raziel
the door flies open
the twelve burning candles all blow out
there stands raziel
sorsha falls to the floor unconscious
raziel raises her arms magnifi cently
the sorceresses face each other
madmartigan and airk lead the assault and the tir asleen rebels push back the nockmaar min ions
down low where weapons adn bodies fall and horses clop and stamp the brownies scurry along in terror arms crossed over their heads looking for shelter
like mice they dart up some stairs
then a huge boot nearly crushes them
the dive away and look up
towering high above them kael lets out a loud warcry
and brandishes two weapons a huge sword and a huge axe
madmartigan and airk turn and see kael
they look at each other
like samurai warriors they stand ready
kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them
willow creeps toward the door
it suddenly throbs and flashes
he jumps back
bavmorda and raziel oppose each otehr circling the al tar
the air between them crackles and sparks with the concentration of energy between them
the baby will be queen
it has been foretold bavmorda
my ritual will kill the prophecy
now the child dies with it its en ergy exiled into oblivion
lightning flashes you see
i hold the power of the universe
not until your ritual is complete
and who will stop me
the elements are slaves to my command
she points at the sky
as if oberying her lightning flashes and thunder cracks
there is no one who can match your sorcery
raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around the room
bavmorda counters and chairs come to life turning into beasts
objects fly about
the tower be comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft
kael swings his axe and sword at airk and madmartigan
he roars at his army and six nockmaar swordsmen hurry over to fight with him
madmartigan and airk split up
madmartigan battles the six swordsmen
airk battles kael who backs airk up stairs on the castle wall
madmartigan fights in the courtyard
he hears a yell and looks up
kael strikes airk down
airk falls down the stairs
madmartigan finishes off the swordsmen then runs to him grabs his bleeding body
youre a brave warrior
a true friend
a good man
were gonna win this war airk
an incredible smile lights up airks face as he dies
picks up his sword
and goes up the stairs after kael
the sorceress continue their battle
they change each other into various beasts
they fight physically and magically
in the midst of chaos the door opens
willow pokes in his head reacting in fear
then sneaks around the wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby
as above so below
universe of evil raziel
it conquers even you
bavmorda hurls a final spell at raziel crippling her throwing her into a corner
bavmorda laughs and goes to the altar
the baby is gone
willow races toward the door with the baby
the door suddenly slams shut
bavmordas voice roars out stop
bring back that child
he turns around
bavmorda towers over him grotesque monstrous poised to destroy willow with her magic
who are you
im willow ufgood
im a magician
willopw slowly walks toward her
he digs into his pocket
takes out the last magic acorn
im a great magician
willow throws the acorn at bavmorda
her hand shoots out and catches it
the acron begins to turn her to stone petrifying her hand her wrist her arm
willow backs away feeling successful
but with intense con centration of her evil will bavmorda fights off the acrons spell
it reverses her arm wrist and hand turn back to flesh
she crushes the acorn in her fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor
is that the extent of your power
willow stands there helplessly
thunder cracks and lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the altar
the tir asleen rebels outnumbering and overpowering the nockmaar army fight toward ultimate victory
madmartigan battles kael on the wall outside the queens tower
up and up they go
a spectacular swordfight
until finally madmartigan stabs kael through the heart
kael screeches and falls through the air into the moat
madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower
bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at willow
place it on the altar
you cant have her
by ritual by sorcery i well draw the lightning and send this child into the destructive realm
willow straightens up boldly courageously
and with my magic ill send her into the
he gropes for a word
bavmorda laughs at him
youre no magician
into the good
bavmorda instantly stops laughing
her eyes flash
even i dont have the power to do that
youre a fraud
willow suddenly starts chanting loudly and desperate ly
raziel opens her eyes and watches
the chenting confuses bavmorda
then willow cleverly whips the baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly shes gone
bavmorda flies into a rage
she lunges across the copper altar
thunder and lightning
a bright fork of lightning conjured by her own evil shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her
she howls in pain
her body contorts then bursts into flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash
madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in
he scoops up sorsha reviving her with a kiss
and as if bavmordas death has ended evil and oppres sion raziel stands up with renewed strength
how did you do that
willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the sleeping baby
it was just the old disappearing pig trick
elora danans eyes open
and sunlight floods into the tower
flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte
the valley is lush with flowers and the kingdom is once abain alive with happy activity
at the door of the castle willow stnds beside a cute little white pony
the court of tir asleen has gath ered to see him off
madmartigan in robes and armor worthy of a king stands proudly beside his queen sor sha who holds the baby princess elora danan
a trumpet blares
raziel comes forward from inside the castle dressed in druid robes carrying a sacred book
take this book of sorcery
you are on your way to becoming a great magician
willow accepts the book
willow smiles gratefully and humbly
he glances down and no tices rool and teemo who have been civilized to a de gree with page boy uniforms fuzzy haircuts and nifty little swords
madmartigan and sorsha come forward with elora danan
your dream has come true madmarti gan
madmartigan smiles with thanks
willow has one last look at the baby
she smiles and giggles at him
he happily gives her a kiss
farewell elora danan
suddenly willow flies up in the air
madmartigan lifts him onto the ponys back
willow and madmartigan shake hands warmly
and willow rides across the valley of flowers everybody waving goodbye to him
musicians stike up a welcoming march
willow rides thorugh his village on his little pony proudly carry ing the sacred book
the nelwyn people swarm around him wild with excitement and celebration
meegosh runs up deliriously happy
the high aldwin comes forward beaming with pride and honors willow with a nod of approval
willow presents him with the book
old burglekutt peers out
his mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd
willow stands up in his stirrups
he sees kiaya fight ing her way through the crowd to reach him
he jumps off his pony and runs to her
they collide kiss and embrace
then ranon and mims jump on their father and hug him
family and friends smother their homecoming hero with love
