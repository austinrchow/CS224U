written by david benioff skip woods a two lane road carves through an endless forest of towering black spruce
a flock of pintails skims over the treetops heading south before the first snowfall
a young boy undersized and feral trudges home bookbag strapped to his back
black haired and pale skinned the boy looks as if he hasnt had a good meal in a long time
before we hear anything the boy turns watching the bend in the road behind him
after a moment we hear the thrum of a hard charging engine
an oldsmobile super rounds the bend accelerating as it hits the straightaway
the boy steps away from the road but the car comes straight at him
the boy closes his eyes
the oldsmobiles brakes clamp down on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to spare
laughter spills from the cars open windows
four high school lettermen pile out of the car wearing their leather sleeved football jackets
gilman the largest of the four shakes his head and laughs
kid didnt even move
you see that
wheres your survival instincts boy
the boy says nothing
he readjusts his bookbag and resumes his long walk northward
gilman contd hey
gilman grabs the boys shoulder and spins him around gilman contd the hell you going
you hear me talking to you
one of the other football players mason walks over and inspects the boys face
this is the kid whose old man robbed the truck stop last year
gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boys neck and pulls him closer scrutinizing him
the four lettermen tower over the small boy
i c onttntt f
you the one with the convict daddy
the boy stares back at gilman unblinking
whats the matter you about to piss your pants
the boy says nothing never looking away from the bully
gilman presses his fist adorned with a heavy class ring against the
gilman contd you a tough guy like your daddy
gilman shoves the boy forcing him to stumble backwards
the boy regains his balance never taking his eyes off gilman
gilman contd you want to play tough guy with me
provoked by the boys lack of fear by the insolence of his stare gilman rears back and punches him in the face
the boy falls to the ground
blood spills from a gash in his cheek where the class ring cut him
a ringside announcer right cross to the face
and hes down
the football players laugh looking down at the fallen boy
the boy stands
there is still no sign of emotion on his face
no fear no anger no evident pain
whats the matter
you want some more
the boy doesnt look away
the bully swings cracking the boy in the side of the head knocking him down again
gilman contd to his friends lets get out of here
walking back to the car mason slaps gilman on the shoulder
you gave that little pissant something to think about
gilman grins and looks back at the boy expecting him to be sprawled and crying on the ground
instead the boy stands again brushes the dirt off his shirt and walks toward gilman
you got to be kidding me
im gonna knock the but gilmans words die in his throat as he sees something impossible happening
the gash on the boys cheek knits itself shut leaving no sign of injury
gilman is so shocked he doesnt see the boys fist whizzing toward him striking him in the nose
and then another punch
and then another
the boy is far smaller and weaker than gilman but he fights with a ferocity that seems inhuman punching and kicking and headbutting doing whatever it takes to fell his
gilman stunned by the intensity of the assault goes down trying to protect his face from the blur of blows
mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite to the hand
he howls with pain and backs off
the other two football players amazed to see their leader getting pummeled by a boy half his size watch in awe
the boy growls as he batters the bully
he grabs gilmans collar and lifts the football players head off the ground prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist
three bone claws spring from the boys hand serrated and razor sharp
mason clutching his wounded hand quits hollering and stares
the other two football players blink and slowly back away
even gilman moaning on the ground hushes and tries to crawl backwards away from this beast on top of him
but the boy is more shocked than any of them
he stares with horror at the claws this part of him he never knew existed
he stands and stumbles away from gilman
mason runs over lifts his punch drunk friend to his feet and hustles him toward the oldsmobile
the other football players pile in slam the doors shut and speed off leaving the boy alone by the side of the road
the boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see fear in his eyes
he screams a scream that echoes over the black spruce into the darkening northern sky
with a wordless shout sitting upright shirtless in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets
kayla silverfox wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear
logan pants chest heaving eyes wild gripping the tattered sheets in his fists
kayla holds him tight until his bone claws retract
kayla contd im right here with you
im right here with you
kayla a full blooded innu wears her long black hair pulled back in a ponytail
shes been sleeping in one of logans flannel shirts
kayla contd the war dreams or the one where youre a kid
logan takes a deep breath finally calming down
he relaxes into kaylas arms
the one where im a kid
kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair kissing his forehead
he sees that she has a small cut on her forearm
he takes her arm and looks at the wound
logan contd i cut you
just a scratch
she kisses him
kayla contd we need new sheets again baby
a traveling carnival has come to a seaside new england town
the brightly lit ferris wheel spins a few hundred yards inland from the dark atlantic
locals roam through the carnival lining up to ride the tilt a whirl
kids carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot em up games to free throw competitions
a carny barker of the old school wearing a patched suit and a derby beckons the curious to his attraction
come see the notorious bird man
half man half eagle is he an angel from heaven or a spawn of satan
ladies and gentlemen tonight is your last chance to see the creature youve all been hearing about we follow two boys who hand the barker their tickets pull aside the
curtain and step into the sideshow
joining a small crowd of curious onlookers
the tent is dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage
sherrlene a peroxide blonde in her fifties whose tanned hide is covered with interlaced tattoos slaps a tribal beat on a pair of bongos
the crowd hushes
a tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward the stage like a boxer long past his prime
he stands in front of the gawkers head bowed face shadowed by his hood
finally beak throws off his robe and raises his wings to the crowd
as advertised he looks like an amalgam of man and bird with three toed clawed feet and dirty feathered wings
his very human tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated by a long sharp beak
he stares back at the gaping crowd
beak looks more pathetic than monstrous
his skinny limbs dont seem very strong and he projects an air of weary resignation not menace
but when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their fathers legs
sherrlene and beak sit at a card table playing gin and drinking bourbon
im gonna knock with three
are you kidding me
he throws down his hand in disgust
you always hold out for gin
you could have knocked a while ago
yeah well im an eternal
sherrlene tallies the points
all right im gonna hit it
you want to come look for shells with me on the beach tomorrow
i dont want to scare away any tourists
aw sweetie its winter
ill come get you in the morning
rr nttntrj r
sherrlene collects her things stands and kisses beak on the side of his feathered head
sherrlene closes the door behind her and beak flips through the deck of cards preparing for another lonely night
a knock on the door
you forget your purse
another knock all right all right im coming
he stands and opens the door
a towering figure in a long black coat looms beside the trailers door
shows over pal
victor creed is shrouded in shadows but when he grins his white fangs gleam
he drapes his arm around beak and drags the birdman inside the trailer
shows never over for you freak
you want money
theres twenty bucks on the dresser
thats all i i just want to hear you talk a minute before i cut your lungs out
creed shoves beak back into his seat picks up the bottle of bourbon examines the label and guzzles it
beak opens his mouth but no words come out
youre the one thats been killing mutants
creed wipes his lips with the back of his clawed hand
beak contd but you
youre one of us
theres no us
theres you and theres me and in a minute just me
creed smiles down at his feathered target
beak tries to shield his body with his wings
i never hurt anybody my whole life
let me show you how its done
an awful prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer
the small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest
winter has come to the north country the ground and tree branches are covered with several inches of snow
logan chops firewood behind the cabin splitting the logs with expert axe strikes smoking a cheap cigar
his nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air
smells like government
behind logan two approaching men in dark suits and black overcoats glance at each other
logan halving another block of wood doesnt turn around
one of the newcomers stryker was a colonel in the special forces
he still has the look
his hair is cropped short his bearing is military and his blue eyes are fierce
f r onttntjf d
christoph nord a
agent zero looks more like a death row convict than a military man
a family of tattooed spiders walk down his neck
i even showered today
logan turns the axe gripped in his hand
stryker contd been a long time logan
you havent aged a day
everyone else gets old and gray but not you
howd you find me
we never lost you my friend
i believe you know my colleague
logan and agent zero stare at each other
there is a history between these two and clearly the memories are not fond
stryker contd were with the department of agriculture now
you working with farmers
agent zero grins
there is nothing pleasant about his grin
pest control division
working with exterminators
puffing on his cigar still shooting first asking questions later
in one blindingly fast motion agent zero pulls a customized automatic from his shoulder holster fires and reholsters
still smoking cheap cigars
logan spits the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and clenches his fists
that was a buck twenty five asshole
stryker holds up both hands one palm to logan one to zero
to logan could we take a minute of your time
youre taking it
we want you back
logan turns away from them
he tosses aside the axe picks up a load of firewood and
it beside the cabin
stryker contd youre a born warrior
you can hide up here as long as you want thats never gonna change
creative work i can assure you of that
and it pays well
already got a job
eighteen grand a
you content chopping down trees
yeah i am
its good work
and i havent killed anybody in three years
starting to miss it
right about now i am
agent zero grins enjoying the game
stryker seeing that this is going badly tries to break the tension
were putting together a team
best men in the business
men like you
logan walks around to the front of the cabin
stryker and agent zero follow
logans battered old pickup truck is parked beside the newcomers lincoln
its a team of hunters
were going after some very bad people
logan climbs into the drivers seat
stryker contd you read the papers logan
theyre killing mutants
logan closes the door turns the key and revs the engine to warm it
stryker taps on the window
logan grits his teeth and rolls down the window not looking at the colonel
stryker contd listen to me
they have names
they have addresses
i can take care of myself
all right forget about yourself
your country needs you
he hits the gas forcing stryker to jump back lest the tires run over his foot
stryker and agent zero watch him go
logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school
he gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building
the school day has ended
students meet up with their moms or dads for the ride home
as logan rounds a corner he stops in his tracks looking around
somethings not quite right
loganducks his head at the last
possible second and a snowball whizzes past missing him by inches
six fourth graders four boys and two girls charge at him hurling snowballs and screaming
logan jumps back around the corner out of sight
the fourth graders chase after him round the corner with their throwing hands cocked ready to launch some serious ice
logan is nowhere in sight
the fourth graders turn in confused circles searching for their target snowballs melting in their hands
the boys and girls look up and see logan sitting on a second floor window ledge
he has already formed six perfect snowballs with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders
the kids run screaming and laughing nearly colliding with kayla who rounds the corner and stares up at logan
logan caught with a snowball in his hand looks sheepish
they started it
logan drives kayla home over roads slick with black ice
she sings softly along with the country song on the radio
stryker came by the house today
the one you told me about
off logans nod what did he want
wants me back
told him no
so why cant they get someone else
logan thinks about it for a moment
when he speaks there is a degree of self loathing in his tone
im the best there is at what i do
and what i do best isnt very nice
kayla studies the side of his face for a moment
logan contd maybe hes right
maybe its the only thing im good for
kayla watches him
logan shakes his head as if ridding himself of an errant thought
logan contd son of a bitch had me thinking about it for a minute
he wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer
f conttn fn
logan contd im not going anywhere
first time in my life i dont feel like a freak
youre not a freak
most guys dont have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream
youre not a freak
youve got a gift
logan shakes his head staring at the black ribbon of road
logan contd you can return a gift
a well built fire burns in the fireplace
logan and kayla sit naked in front of it wrapped in an old flannel quilt
the kids made cornhusk dolls today in arts and crafts
she reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll
kayla contd i made one for you
kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight
given the limitations of the art form its a skillful representation of logan unique hairstyle and all
i look like elvis
youre elvis with claws
the moon swollen and red hued rises above the dark hills framed in the cabins window
full moon tomorrow
you know why the moons so lonely
logan shakes his head
kayla lies back resting her head on logans leg as he plays with her hair
kayla contd she used to have a lover
they lived in the spirit world and every night theyd wander the skies together
but one of the other spirits was jealous
trickster wanted the moon for himself
so he told kuekuatsheu the moon asked for flowers
he told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses
never trust a guy named trickster
yeah well you do some stupid things when youre in love
kuekuatsheu didnt know that once you leave the spirit world you can never go back
now hes trapped here
every night the moon searches for him and every night he sees her in the sky and howls her name
but he can never touch her again
for a moment theyre both quiet contemplating the sad myth
koo koo choo got screwed
viewed from a distance the little cabin looks warm and inviting the firelight shining from the windows
something watches from the edge
of the dark woods
something monstrous its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a pine tree
kayla drops logan off at the logging camp
the site is already loud with motorized activity
trimmers remove the limbs from fallen trees
teamsters in forklifts load logs onto flatbed trucks
logan comes around to the drivers side window holding his orange husqvarna chainsaw in one hand
logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips
he turns and walks towards a crew of lumberjacks circled around a supervisor with a clipboard
logan turns when he hears a honk
kayla leans out the window
kayla contd i love you by the way
logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this scene
he clears his throat
t love you too
thick maine accent we all love you casanova but could we get to work here
we need to let some daylight in the swamp
the lumberjacks laugh loudly
damage done kayla waves a cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp
logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks who make kissie kissie sounds and slap his shoulder
supervisor contd all right i need a team of choppers for b thats gonna be phelan marcuse van mier and logan
two teams for c
kayla steers the pickup along the access road leading away
from the logging camp
an eighteen wheel flatbed loaded with trimmed logs blocks the road
men in reflective vests stand on the flatbed securing the load with chains
kayla hits the brakes and checks her watch
she taps the horn
a foreman ambles over to her in no particular rush
cant move the truck till the loads tied down
im already late
not gonna happen maam
the foreman thinks about it sighs and changes his tune
foreman contd yelling to truck driver hey zeke
pull this mother over
ladys got to get through
moments later the truck rolls forward enabling kayla to scoot through in her pickup
she toots her horn and waves
logan and three other lumberjacks phelan marcuse and van mier tramp through the woods towards their designated area carrying their chainsaws and helmets
phelan whiskey bellied and flushed from the exertion has fallen behind
you all want to ease the pace a little bit
trees aint going anywhere
logan in the lead stares at a crude smiley face carved into a tall pine tree
his gaze travels from the carving to something sitting on the forest floor
n i lb
phelan contd what you got there
the other lumberjacks gather around logan
a severed bears head haloed by buzzing flies rots in the sun
phelan contd goddamn
why would a hunter leave the head
bullet didnt kill this bear
kayla sings along with the tape on the tape deck
lolly lolly lolly get your adverbs here lolly lolly lolly got some adverbs here come on down to lollys get the adverbs here
rounding a corner on the narrow access road kayla nearly collides with a man in a long black coat
she slams on the brakes and the truck shudders to a halt
the mans back is turned to the truck his head bowed
his hair hangs below his shoulders clotted with dirt as if hes been sleeping in the woods for weeks
kayla leans out of the open truck window
before she can speak the man in the long black coat turns
its not just his size that frightens us though the man is massive
its not just the four inch long black talons curling from his fingertips or the gleaming fangs he licks as he smiles at her
what terrifies us most are his eyes
they are a sharks eyes black and loveless and utterly inhuman
f conttnt fd
victor creed walks toward the truck
he scrapes his talons over the hood screeeeee
five parallel gashes now scar the hood carved straight through the steel
logan hearing a noise the other men cant rises from his crouch
he looks to the west listening carefully
whats the matter logan holds up a hand quiet
he hears a distant scream
voice he knows better than any other
he runs leaving his astonished co workers behind
no one can run through the woods faster than logan andlogan has never needed to run faster
he vaults fallen trees ducks under branches accelerates when he hits the access road
logan sees the pickup truck in the distance
even a hundred yards away he can tell that something is
it seems impossible that he could run any faster but now he does reaching the truck in seconds
he sees the claw marks gouged through the steel hood
the drivers side door tossed onto the asphalt twenty yards
from the truck
and finally he sees kayla curled in the fetal position on the side of the access road
blood puddles beneath her
her skin has already begun to lose its color
he runs to her kneels beside her body hands checking for a pulse listening for breath trying desperately to find any sign of life in her lifeless form
come on youre okay
say something darling
kayla come on
he cradles her in his arms
logan contd youre okay
he rocks back and forth her lifeless body clutched tightly in his arms his eyes clenched shut
the veins bulge in his neck every muscle in his body tenses as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of his skin
the local dive opens early
town drunks sit by themselves smoking cigarettes sipping the days first hair of the dog reading the paper or staring into their beer
victor creed sits at the bar carving a crude smiley face into the wood with the claw of his index finger
he looks up and sees the bartender staring at him
the bartender doesnt approve of the vandalism but hes not about to say anything
creed taps the rim of his glass
the bartender comes over with a bottle of george dickel tennessee whiskey
he fills creeds glass halfway a standard pour
creed stares at the bartender
he taps the glass again
the bartender hand shaking fills the glass to the brim
creed raises the whiskey to the light
stuff dont work on me
i drink and drink and i never feel any different
he downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow
he looks around the bar at the pool table in the back the wurlitzer jukebox the stacked bottles of liquor
victor creed contd you got any insurance on this place
i guess so
creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand
cause its about to get ugly
logan walks into the tavern sniffing the air
he sees creed sitting on the barstool back to the door
logan approaches the bar never taking his eyes off creed
finally creed turns to look at logan
he stands towering above the smaller man
logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of creeds hand
creed knows logan is looking at it
he lifts his hand to his mouth and licks the blood off
victor creed contd sweet girl
tasted like strawberry jam
the bone claws burst from logans hands pale white and serrated
he growls and swings at creeds head
the big man is fast
he ducks under the claws grinning and circling like a boxer happy that hes finally got a decent adversary
the bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar fights but not ones featuring clawed mutants
victor creed contd you can scare off the civilians with those sonny boy
but i got claws of my own
he swings raking his talons across logans chest drawing first blood
logan lunges at creed and the battle begins
the pace of the combat is startling the physical power stupendous
a missed swipe by creed ends with him clawing out the guts of the jukebox
logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted into the wall smashing the plasterboard
creed grabs logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool table
creed brings his fist down looking to pulverize logans skull but the smaller man rolls clear
creeds fist shatters the slate and the table collapses
clearing his head on the sawdusted floor logan sees the eight ball rolling past
he picks it up and hurls it at creeds head
creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut
he opens his hand and lets the powdered remains spill onto the floor
logan springs to his feet and swings at creed again and again his claws whooshing through the air
creed despite his bulk is an elegant fighter
he circles just out of reach grinning as the claws slash past his face
creed grabs logans right wrist as it flies by
he grabs the left wrist
his wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward logans throat
with no room to dodge logan drives his head forward smashing creeds face with a glorious headbutt
as creed staggers back logan kicks him in the chest knocking the big man over the bar where he crashes into the bottles of liquor and slides to the floor
in a tumult of glass shards and alcohol
logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the tables
he picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar
the cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol
creed roars and rises to his feet a burning man
he vaults over the bar and advances on logan
the flames consume his overcoat licking at his skin
creed slaps them out with his palms apparently oblivious to the pain
victor creed contd you put up a better fight than your girl did
creed snatches logan and slings him headfirst through the plate glass window
logan hits the snow covered pavement hard splinters of glass in his hair his face bloodied from dozens of small cuts
creed steps out the bar
as logan struggles to his feet creed kicks out his legs and drops him again
creed crouches beside logan grabs the back of his head and smashes his face into the concrete
the beating gets savage creed hammering logan again and again
logans healing factor cannot keep up with the violence being done to his body
time you got declawed kitty kat
creed lifts his heavy black boot and brings it down hard on the extended claws of logans left hand
logan howls as the bone claws shatter
creed repeats the process on logans right hand
contd you were a tough little guy
but theres always someone tougher
creed plunges his clawed hand into logans chest
logan gasps eyes widening
his tolerance for pain is world class but this is another level of suffering
victor creed contd and its always me
creed stands staring down at logans unmoving body
sirens moan in the distance
creed walks away
logan bleeds in the snow
we rise above him higher and higher his battered body dwindling as we rise with the smoke
two male nurses shove a gurney down the corridor
logan is flat on his back bloody and unconscious
a surgeon hurries after them pulling on latex gloves
we know what were looking at
multiple knife wounds
the male nurses transfer logan from the gurney to the operating bed
one female nurse prepares logans arm for an iv while a second nurse cuts open his blood soaked shirt with surgical scissors
the frenetic activity in the room ceases
everyone stares at logans unblemished chest
what is this
logan lunges forward grabbing the surgeons collar and pulling the startled mans face next to his own
where is he
hey hey easy the male nurses struggle to restrain logan but hes too strong for them
the surgeon gasps for air
where is he
his name is victor creed
logan turns and sees stryker standing at the entrance to the operating room
stryker contd i can help you find him
logan storms out of the hospital followed by stryker
he escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in nevada last year
started murdering mutants
shape changer in new mexico pair of telekinetic twins in california logan turns on stryker grabbing the colonel by the throat and shoving him against a lamp post
three years i been here
three years everythings good
nobody knows me
and then one day you show up and the next day shes dead
i came to warn you you knew he was coming
stryker shakes his head as well as he can with logans hand on his throat
strykers face is turning red
logan contd how did you know
he got the list
stryker chokes gasping for air
logan eases up on his grip but doesnt release the man
stryker takes a deep breath
every known mutant in north america
governments been keeping it for years
names addresses everything
how did he get it
someone must have leaked it to him
there are people in washington who want to see you all destroyed
logan releases stryker
the ex colonel straightens his jacket collar and composes himself
creeds a mutant too
apparently he doesnt have much tribal loyalty
logan turns and walks away
he looks like a homeless man his clothes torn and bloodied his hair disheveled
he walks fast
stryker calls after him
stryker contd do you have a plan captain
im not in the army anymore
do you have a plan
logan turns and stares at stryker
im gonna track him down and im gonna end him
thats the plan
you already tried that
hes a hundred miles away and youre walking out of the hospital
logans fists are clenched
hes ready to hammer stryker into the ground but the older man does not back down
stryker contd you cant beat him
not the way you are right now
youve probably gone your whole life without losing a fight but im telling you now you cant beat him
unless i give you the tools
logan glares at stryker still itching for immediate revenge
stryker contd you come with me i promise you two things
you will suffer more pain than any other man could bear
and you will have your revenge
logan stares into strykers eyes
a black helicopter lands on a concrete helipad inside the walls of the massive compound
sentries armed with assault rifles man the guard towers scanning the perimeter with binoculars
logan stryker and agent zero step out of the helicopter
logan glances around the foreboding place before following stryker inside the main building
logan lies on his back on an examining table naked save for a strategically placed towel
a red bearded scientist dr
cornelius draws blood from logan with a syringe
an army surgeon carol hines marks logans skin with an indelible pen
he looks like a maori warrior his body mapped with strange lines dots and xs
stryker watches hines work
could you unsheath your claws
logan raises his left hand
the bone claws pop out the same length they were before creed shattered them
stryker contd remarkable
logan examines the markings on his forearm
the hell you planning on doing to me
hines gives stryker a worried look but he ignores her
were going to make you indestructible
but first we have to destroy you
stryker heads for the door but stops midway and turns
stryker contd i forgot to give you something
he reaches into his jacket pocket pulls out an old set of dog tags and tosses them to logan
logan inspects the tags with ambivalence
never wanted to put these on again
held on to them for years
figured youd be back one day
logan slips the steel chain over his head
stryker contd now youll always know your name
stryker walks down a long concrete corridor lit by fluorescent ceiling lights
hines steps out of the prep room and hurries after him
stryker stops and waits
for her to catch up
hines contd i know weve discussed this before he knows what shes going to say
he shakes his head and continues down the hallway forcing hines to chase after him
ad nauseam lieutenant
anesthetic wont work on him
his healing factor neutralizes drugs
he can handle the pain
weve never conducted any animal no other animal would survive the experiment
logan wearing a hospital style robe stands by the closed door
no other human could hear the conversation down the hallway
logan catches every word
he might not either
theres a significant chance the procedure will kill him
c l nttnttfn
some experiments succeed some fail
thats why we call them experiments
the mans well being is not my concern
proving that the science works thats what matters
hines does not relish confrontation and shes afraid of stryker
but she gives it one more try
i took the hippocratic oath
i swore id never intentionally harm another human being
stryker turns on hines jabbing his finger at her
you also swore
to protect your nation
you remember that oath lieutenant hines
yes sir but i dont understand why i dont need you to understand
i need you to follow orders
stryker continues down the corridor leaving hines standing alone in the fluorescent light
hines enters the room to find logan sitting on the examining table paging through a magazine
he smiles up at her
you ready for me doc
hines and two medical technicians accompany logan to a water filled plexiglass tank the size of a lidless coffin
an array of stainless steel machines crowds around the tank including a series of robotic arms that taper into foot long needles
one wall of the theater is glass
behind the glass is the control room where stryker looks on hands behind his back
cornelius and several support staff enter data into computers monitoring the experiment
logan removes his robe and hands it to hines before stepping into the tank of water
see you onthe other side
one of the technicians fastens a breathing tube connected to an oxygen tank to logans mouth
logan lies down submerging himself in the cold water
the technician clamps logans wrists and ankles into place with stainless steel shackles bolted to the plexiglass walls
logans eyes are open as he watches the robotic arms swivel into place poised above him like a gang of metal vipers
general munson stands in the back of the room observing the experiment with great interest
agent zero leans against the back wall bored cracking his knuckles
hines takes a seat beside cornelius who studies a readout on his computer screen
steady at eighty two eleven
feed lines clear
lines one through twelve clear
logan lies underwater watching as the robotic arms descend toward him
the needles begin to spin at high speed like massive power drills
they churn the water when they enter
close on logans eyes as the needles enter his body
the man has suffered gunshots and knife wounds car crashes and bottles smashed across his face
he has never suffered this
he closes his eyes
the technicians enter commands watching close up images of the procedure on their monitors
logan writhes in the tank
twelve long needles have drilled into his bones including his skull
feed commenced at a rate of twenty nine ccs per second
density probe indicates preliminary chelation of the compact tissue
one zero two point three
stryker turns and addresses the general
youre witnessing medical history in the making
weve begun bonding adamantium to weapon xs skeleton
we tried to use that stuff for tank armor
too damn expensive
it took us three years to prepare enough alloy for the skeleton
so if this works i guess weapon x wont be walking through any metal detectors
if this works general weapon x will walk wherever he wants
logan spasms in the tank like a man being electrocuted
heart rate one ninety
four four seven
close on logans clenched eyelids and closer still entering the mind of the tortured man
horrific images flicker past selected traumas from a deeply traumatic life
logan cradles the lifeless body of kayla silverfox
the feral boy stares at his monstrous claws and howls
logan looking identical in age to the man weve been following stands in a village in vietnam as bamboo huts burn around him
how long before hes mission operative
remains to be seen
were in uncharted territory here
uncharted territory is a pretty good description of your budget colonel
this doesnt work you can kiss the eleven good bye
we need the eleven
our victory in the war to come depends on it
not everyone in the pentagon thinks theres gonna be a war
stryker turns and fixes his gaze on the general
oh its coming general
the enemy walks among us
wed better be prepared
logan thrashes in the tank his convulsions increasingly violent his eyes rolling back in their sockets
the water in the tank begins to steam
the reel of blood stained images from logans past continues
a bull necked man beats the feral boy with an axe handle
body temperature one zero eight
heart rate two ten
sir a dying russian lies on his back on a dock in odessa staring at the sky his shirt punctured with three precise holes
logan stares down at him bone claws extended
hes a warrior hines
he can handle it
victor creed plunges his clawed hand into logans gut
probe rejected sir
is there a problem
stryker allows himself a small smile
on the contrary
the probe is diamond tipped
its not hard enough to penetrate adamantium
heart rate two twenty five
sir were well beyond maximum youre trained to care for humans doctor
weapon x is not one of us
logan writhes in the tank muscles coiling and uncoiling
the montage of nightmares continues snapshots from hell
the feral boy sits alone in the back of a school
while the other children talk and laugh he cuts his thumb with a pocket knife and watches the wound heal
chelation near completion
heart rate two forty four
two fifty seven
adamantiumreservoir ninety percent depleted
core temperature one hundred and nineteen degrees
a young stryker wearing jungle fatigues and a necklace of human ears holds a revolver to the temple of a sobbing viet cong prisoner
stryker smiles as he pulls the trigger
stryker leans close to the glass watching his test subjects agony
his experiment will succeed or fail in the next few moments
sweat beads his forehead
tsurgical theater continuous i
adamantium claws burst from logans hand shimmering underwater
crazed with pain he carves through the walls of the plexiglass tank
steaming water cascades onto the poured concrete floor
bursting free of his restraints logan slashes through the robotic arms
sparks dance like a swarm of fireflies
the dismembered machines twitch like wounded beasts
logan rises from the broken tank drenched with water naked save for dozens of long stainless steel needles drilled into his body and the wires and hoses trailing from the
hair matted to his head eyes wild face contorted he looks like a strange amalgam of machine and animal
he tears the breathing tube from his mouth and stares through the window into the control room panting claws extended
hines sits very still hand over her mouth
cornelius and the technicians rise from their chairs and slowly back away from the window
the general stares at logan awed by the sight of the living weapon
even agent zero no longer looks bored
logan slashes through the locks of the steel reinforced theater door
he charges out of the room
for a moment there is silence in the control room
i take it this is still part of the plan colonel
hes got nowhere to run
closed circuit monitors show logan running down a tunnel
stryker contd the only exit is a ton blast door
it was built to withstand a nuclear detonation
logan hurries down a long tunnel hewn through solid rock leaving a trail of watery footprints
he stops in front of the battleship steel door at the end of the tunnel
growling he carves through the door as if it were cardboard
the savaged blast door flickers on the monitors
logan is free
the general stares at stryker
stryker licks his lips
to agent zero alert the containment team
bring him back
bagged or breathing
just bring him back
a full moon shines down on the frozen landscape
logan has exited the alkali lake complex beyond the high walls of the compound
the lake itself shimmers in the moonlight
logan stares at the lonely moon
a wolf howls in the distance
his breath rises above him in the cold air his wet hair freezes
ignoring the gusting wind and bitter chill he runs through the snow toward the distant woods
pine trees tower above him
he enters a clearing where the virgin snow glitters beneath the moon
he stops moving and peers through the darkness
he smells something coming closer
a pack of gray wolves emerges from the woods surrounding logan
snow dusts their fur
they look hungry their blue eyes unblinking as they watch this pale interloper
the leader of the pack a muscular brute far bigger than his comrades snarls at logan
logan stares back at the wolf
the wolf jumps at logan fangs bared aiming for the mans throat
logan sidesteps and the wolf hurtles past skidding on the snow when he lands
logan and the wolf circle each other looking for weakness
the wolf gnashes its wet teeth and pounces again
man and beast battle in the moonlight a shadowy combat of ferocious velocity of gleaming fangs and gray fur
the wolf lunges for logans throat again but this time logan catches the wolf in one hand and slams it to the snow
the wolf desperate to escape rakes logans arm with his claws
logan ignores the bloody welts
his face is close to the wolfs face and they stare into each others eyes predator to predator
logan presses the claws of his left hand to the wolfs throat
the wolf quits fighting mewling submissively
he goes slack in logans grip rolling over to signal surrender
logan stands over the newly subservient alpha wolf
the other wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion
intense light shines on logans face
he turns and sees that hes surrounded by a dozen soldiers wearing tactical armor
powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their guns which are pointed at logan
the wolves flee dodging through the pines their paws kicking up snow
put your hands in the air
stryker and the others are able to watch logan in action as night vision security cameras mounted in the trees beam a constant live feed back to monitors in the
these soldiers are the creme de la creme
theyre equipped to handle the situation
logan tries to gauge his enemies staring into the harsh lights he growls
hands in the air now
logan charges at the soldiers
the soldiers fire their weapons
these are not rifles but high powered tasers
twelve darts sink into logans skin each connected to a silvery wire
thousands of volts of electricity course through logans body
gritting his teeth and fighting through the pain he slices the twelve wires with his claws and advances on the stunned soldiers
the monitors show the fallen soldiers lying in the snow
for a moment everyone in the room is quiet
the creme de la creme just got creamed
stryker gives her a very nasty look before turning to general munson and speaking in calming tones
theres a high voltage fence on the perimeter of the base is it made out of adamantium
an old chevrolet pickup truck rattles down a snow covered road that passes acres of frozen farm fields
a good sam club sticker is pasted on the rear bumper
james and heather hudson a middle aged farmer and his middle aged wife are bundled up in heavy parkas
james drives his wife talks
margell probably make her walnut pie again
i thought id do meringues this year
try something different
dont you think
you like my meringues dont you
forty years of conversation all i get is yeps
heather grabs her husbands arm
heather hudson contd jimmy
james turns in time to see a naked man sprint across the snow and slip inside a red sheep barn
heather hudson contd i think theres a naked man in the barn
james hudson cautiously slides his barn door open
he holds an old shotgun in his hands a gun he hasnt fired in years
he advances slowly into the barn sunlight from the open door falling on the scattered straw
a vintage motorcycle covered in a tarp stands near the side wall
hudson looks inside each sheep pen
his thick wooled sheep ready for breakfast bleat hopefully
in the third pen hudson finds logan who has covered himself with straw
a few curious sheep sniff at the fugitives face
hudson stares at logan who stares back somewhat well sheepishly
what in hell are you doing
its a little cold out there
its the middle of january and you got no clothes on
thats probably it
hudson sighs and lowers his shotgun
youre not on the drugs are you
just had a rough night
pretty rough yeah
all right come on
i got some old clothesll probably fit you
he turns and logan begins covering strategic places with wads of straw
james hudson contd ill take you around back so my wife dont see you again
sorry if i scared her
im not worried about you scaring her
logan sits at the breakfast table with james and heather
he wears an old plaid shirt dungarees and a pair of scuffed work boots
a heaping breakfast lies before him scrambled eggs pork sausages pancakes with maple syrup a steaming mug of coffee
logan devours everything in front of him looking up only to nod in thanks as heather scoops more food onto his plate
you mind if i ask where you came running from
let the boy eat
logan piles eggs onto a slice of buttered toast
im just wondering
were twenty miles from town
its a miracle you didnt get hypothermia out there
ive got good circulation
gesturing toward barn nice chopper you got out there by the way
jamess face lights up
logan has found the mans passion
you know motorcycles
what is it panhead
best bike harley davidson ever made
first one with a seventy four cubic inch engine hydraulic valve lifters aluminum heads heather stands to clear the plates
now youve got him started
you need more of anything
logan smiling holds up his hands to surrender
the smile fades when he sees the red laser dot appear on heathers shirt
heather hudson contd whats the matter honey
logan dives across the table trying to knock her out of the way but the bullet beats him there punching through the window frame and straight through heather hudsons heart
she collapses in logans arms
but its too late
a second bullet hits james in the back the farmer blinks and topples forward dead before he hits the ground
agent zero lies on his belly three hundred yards from the farmhouse
he lowers his sniper rifle and speaks into his headset
weapon x is in the farmhouse
he just murdered
fire at will
an apache longbow helicopter streaks overhead fifty feet above the ground
logan checks james hudsons pulse but finds none
he looks up when he hears the thrum of the military helicopter
two good samaritans lie dead at his feet slaughtered for sheltering him
something bestial has
entered logans eyes
the apache circles the farmhouse
both the pilot and the gunner wear helmets with monocular eyepieces that provide images from the external cameras
the farmhouse is centered in the crosshairs
scrolling numbers to the side of the image indicate the range in meters
the gunners finger tightens on the trigger
logan growls and runs for the door
the gunner squeezes the trigger
the apache fires multiple hellfire rockets which blast out of their launchers and rip into the farmhouse
the old hudson homestead collapses as the explosions blow out the roof and the support walls
locate the target and fire again
the gunner glances at his pilot
both men seem mystified by the command
the targets destroyed
repeat locate the target and fire again
the apache circles the smoking ruin where the house once stood
no sign of logan is visible in the scorched debris
they mustve hated this guy big time
t c c
what was he terrorist or something
i dont know but hes a puddle now
the apache hovers near the sheep barn rotor blades fanning the rising smoke
as the gunner continues to scout the ground for any sign of a corpse the pilot notices something out of the corner of his eye
he stares at the roof of the sheep barn
a smoke darkened figure stares back at him
logan claws extended skin blackened with soot jumps from the roof of the barn
he lands on the helicopter windshield
the pilot nearly jumps out of his seat
logan raises his right hand and plunges his claws through the bulletproof glass
agent zero watches the apache plummet to the ground
he snorts with amusement and activates his headset
your boy just took down fifty million dollars worth of hardware
guess i got to do this myself
stryker sits alone in his office pinching the bridge of his nose
its been a long day for the colonel
on headset negative
come back to base
have a little faith boss
you dont have the weaponry
dont care what kind of bones hes got
fifty caliber bullet through his eyeball ought to do it
nord goddamnit im losing you boss
agent zero clicks off his headset and
raises the sniper rifle searching through the smoke with his scope
agent zero contd muttering to himself come out and play
logan emerges from the apaches wreckage and runs toward the sheep barn door
a bullet cracks him in the forehead and logan falls backwards into the snow stunned
for a few seconds we can glimpse the adamantium of his skull
his healing factor takes over and his skin begins to knit itself back together
logan combat crawls inside the sheep barn
he throws the tarp off the harley
james hudson restored this bike with love and elbow grease
the chrome and leather shine as brightly as any new model on the factory floor
the key is in the ignition
this used to be a safe neighborhood
logan bursts out of the barn on the harley
the tires spin on the snow but logan is an experienced rider
he steadies the bike steers it onto the blacktop and accelerates heading in the opposite direction from agent zero
agent zero grabs his rifle and jogs over to a black suv with tinted windows and off road tires
logan speeds down the road agent zero in hot pursuit
zero gains ground both hunter and quarry racing past mph
agent zero grabs an atchisson assault shotgun from a rack behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry
he lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on logan who swerves to keep himself and his more fragile motorcycle a tricky target
agent zero fires six shells in rapid succession
hundreds of steel pellets scream over the motorcycle perforating the face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard
logan turns and sees the suv closing on him
agent zero rams the bumper into the harley and logan very nearly loses control managing to right the bike at the last second
logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing room
he turns and sees agent zero catching up again
logan clamps on the brakes hard
he holds out his left hand and extends his claws
the tips of the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly
the suv cannot brake in time
as it hurtles past the motorcycle logans claws hit the suvs front tire and shred it instantly
a split second later he shreds the rear tire
the suv totters falls to its side and barrel rolls across the empty road
it ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch wheels still spinning in the air
logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended suv
he lowers the kickstand stands and walks to the drivers side
agent zero bloodied and dazed has managed to push open the door
he leans out and aims his shotgun at logan who slices the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws
logan grabs agent zero by the back of the neck and hauls him out of the car
those were good people back there
agent zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a sheath on his ankle
you ever notice good people tend to die when they spend time with you
he swings the knife at the side of logans neck
logan catches agent zeros wrist and slams it against the door frame
agent zero drops the knife with a pained smile
he didnt think that would work
agent zero contd maybe you should stick with the bad people
were more your speed
i got a message for your boss
the smirk fades from zeros face as he sees the adamantium claws plunging toward his heart
logan stands at a pay phone beside the texaco station watching a couple of skateboard punks practice their ollies
he punches in a number and waits for the connection
department of agriculture
get me the pest control division
im sorry sir there is no pest control division
why dont you get em anyway
and tell em logans calling
while he waits he watches one of the kids attempt a backside tailslide on the curb
the kid loses his balance and wipes out skinning his palms on the asphalt
where are you
controlled fury you shouldnt have killed those people
all they were doing was helping a stranger
stryker sits behind the desk of his office
his aide collins stands on the other side of the desk listening in on an extension
you ran on me goddamnit
we had a deal
now you get back to base
we continue to intercut between the gas station and strykers office
they had nothing to do with this
you let that mad dog gun em down like they were animals
im giving you an order soldier
return tobase had enough orders for one lifetime
im going after victor creed
for several seconds there is silence on the line
were bringing you in
one way or another were bringing you in
logan bows his head considering his next words
people like you are always waiting for the next war
you start one with me colonel you better sleep with the lights on
he hangs up the phone and walks to his bike
the skateboard punks give him a wide berth
closing time at the big zoo and families flock toward the parking lot
sanitation workers clean the trash from the walking paths
the lemur habitat is cultivated to mimic the environment of madagascar
four ring tailed lemurs swing from the branches of the baobab trees shrieking at each other
f rc nttnttpd i
they congregate in a small wooden hut with a peaked roof where they scamper up and down the back of francis a slender balding man in a zoo keepers uniform
francis has a gentle smile as he feeds the lemurs leaf eater biscuits
he speaks to them as they shriek clambering over his lap biscuits clutched in their tiny hands
she did what
ninna that wasnt very nice
he gives one of the female lemurs an admonishing look
she shrieks and dances away biscuit held to her chest
francis contd you must have done something to deserve it myrto
oh you bit her
havent we talked about this
the lemurs all quiet down at the same time
francis watches them
something is wrong
the lemurs flee ducking into holes in the baobab trees hiding from whatevers coming
francis frowns and turns
victor creed stands above him
everyone thinks youre a lunatic talking to animals
but i know youre not francis
you understand them dont you
thats your power
francis looks for help but there is no one in sight
victor creed contd what do they tell you
francis is quiet for a few seconds staring at the killer
nothing very fancy
they tell me when theyre scared
when theyre angry
when theyre hungry
you ever talk to a panther francis
francis shakes his head
i victor creed cont
d every now and then a white panther comes along
the mama panther wont even look at it
she wont lick it she wont feed it nothing
so pretty soon the white panther dies
you know why
off franciss silence white panthers are mistakes
and nature takes care of its mistakes
there are no mistakes
were all part of the plan
were all gods children
creed grins licking his sharp fangs
i dont know who my daddy was but it sure as hell wasnt god
francis bows his head
im not afraid of dying
creed runs one long claw across franciss cheek
how do you know
youve never done it before
ninna the ring tailed lemur mewls softly trying to hide herself deep within the baobab tree as her human friend logan riding james hudsons vintage motorcycle rolls down the famous
strip lit by the mammoth neon signs above him
he stops at a red light and stares at the lonely moon rising over the desert
you look like a man who could use a night off
logan turns to look at a redhead in a tight silver dress waiting at the light in her cadillac convertible
she looks like shes expensive and she looks like shed be worth it
youre way out of my league darlin
you never know
you looking for a good time with a bad woman
logan smiles and shakes his head
the redhead purses her lips
you dont know what youre missing
logan revs his engine as the light changes
i know exactly what im missing
the courtesan waits at the green light
watching logan speed off into the night in a seedy part of town far from the casinos bright lights logan walks through the front door of a rundown boxing gym
even at this hour the gym is packed with aspiring pugilists
las vegas has become the mecca of world boxing and many of the fighters here exhibit impressive skills as they batter the heavy bag tap at the speed bag and
logan walks toward a ring in the center of the gym
two young boxers inside the ropes wearing headgear and sparring gloves dance around throwing quick jabs that dont land
john wraith stands outside the ring watching this action with evident distaste
he wears a black cowboy hat sunglasses and a handlebar mustache
he has the swagger and drawl of a rodeo cowboy
this is a contact sport ladies
if you dont like hitting people try golf
logan comes up behind wraith unseen by the texan
you talk tough for a guy who always let me do the dirty work
a slow smile creases wraiths face
look at this
you never get old do you
the two menembrace
there is genuine affection here the camaraderie of men who have fought together bled together
wraith contd nobody followed you
you tryin to insult me
cant be too careful brother
ive been retired five years i still check under the car every time i drive
im looking for victor creed
wraiths face goes serious at the mention of the name
he looks around the gym making sure no ones watching them
he glances at the boxers in the ring who lean on the ropes and breathe heavily awaiting instructions
why dont you two get a manicure or something and meet me back here in the morning
to logan want a beer
wraith leads logan toward an office in the back draping an arm around his shoulders
i love you like a brother
so im giving you thirty minutes
after that youre too dangerous to know
the windows in the office look out on the training boxers
wraith leads logan inside and grabs two longneck bottles of beer from a mini fridge
what i hear our friend the colonels got eyes all over the country looking for you
he aint about to let weapon x go rogue on him
wraith pops the caps off the beer bottles and hands one to logan
whats weapon x
they tap glass
a walking talking hundred million dollar experiment
you know about it
wraith sits behind his desk and puts his boots up
logan sits across from him
i keep my ear to the ground
people like us we never really quit the game
woke up one day and knew i was done
logan peels the label from his bottle of beer
logan contd stryker used to give me a new name every monday
and by the end of the week id draw a line through it
put a whole lot of people under the ground
and one day i realized
stryker was never gonna run out of names
wraith nods meditative
our friend the colonel has big plans
what kind of plans
hear a lot of chatter about something called the eleven
my boys in arlington say its the biggest covert weapons project since fdr built himself an atom bomb
other than that no one knows a goddamn thing
wraith places his bottle on his desk and sits up straight in his chair
wraith contd look i
i heard about what happened to your woman
for what its worth im sorry
he doesnt want to talk about it
wraith contd i did a little contract work with creed back in the day
ive known some seriously foul people but that cat
they say he took out a whole village in nicaragua one time every man woman and child killed em all just cause he was bored
i been screwed sued and tattooed but i never killed no kids
creed did government work
till they got wise to him
wherever he went there was a trail of bodies
and not always the right bodies you know what im saying
there is murder in logans eyes
help me find him
hes a hard cat to track
just tell me where to start looking
ill do the rest
wraith taps the bottleneck considering
might want to talk to his friends from the ultramax
the prison he busted out of
feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants
worked pretty well
only problem now they all know each other
you ever hear of a guy named fred j
people call him the blob
you find him youll know why
got out of the hoosegow a few months ago
went home to iowa
town called elgin
you think hes still in touch with creed
f c onttntirt
wraith leans back in his chair and allows himself another slow smile
i bet youll find out
logan on his harley speeds past a welcome sign for elgin iowa population
the neon vacancy sign shines a beacon for tired travellers in the heartland
logan lies on top of the bed covers hands behind his head
the lights are out and fox news plays on the television casting the small room in blue light
a reporter stands in a detroit alleyway as police officers in the background cordon off the area from onlookers
this is the th confirmed mutant slaying of the last two months and with the investigation apparently stalled members of the mutant community are voicing their outrage
a young woman wearing a mutants are humans too t shirt speaks passionately for the camera
of course theres bias at work here
if these were normal people getting
chopped up you better believe thered be an fbi task force investigating thered be all sorts of resources allocated to find this killer
why is it that when violence is done to our community the nation turns its back
young woman contd if the government cant protect us were gonna have to start protecting ourselves
in the corner of the tv screen carved directly into the brick wall of the alley is a crude smiley face
logans expression does not change as he watches the report
our only indications that hes boiling inside are the look of dark vengeance in his eyes and the fingers of his right hand which clench into a fist unclench clench
he lowers the volume with the remote picks up the telephone and dials a number
we hear four rings
on answering machine hey youve reached kayla and logan
were not home right now so please leave a message after the beep and well get back to you as soon as we can
logan replaces the receiver in its cradle and lies back alone in the world
a mother pushes her shopping cart towards her minivan
her young freckled son holds her hand gazing fearfully at logan who stands on the edge of the lot smoking a cigar
he looks out of place in this quiet midwestern town
logan winks at the kid
he drops his cigar grinds it out with the toe of his boot and heads for the supermarket
two stock boys wearing bright blue vests over red shirts stand at one of the aisle dividers hiding behind a stack of breakfast pastries
they are plainly terrified
you say something
its your section
the stock boy peeks around the divider
the blob stands in the center of the aisle tearing open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet
dukes is the biggest man youve ever seen
by a long shot
just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton hes beyond fat
his eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his face
when he shifts his bulk ripples cascade down his flanks his flesh trembling with each breath
dukes mouth and chin dusted with fried pork skin turns his head to examine the pest standing next to him
logan contd maybe its time to give the pork rinds a rest
dukes swings his arm
despite his enormous mass the man moves with surprising speed
not quick enough to catch logan though who ducks beneath the blow
dukess forearm thicker than a fire hydrant smashes through the steel shelving
bags of pork rinds and potato chips tumble to the floor
logan shows his glittering claws to the big man
logan contd ill fillet you standing fat man
that what you want
that is not what he wants
logan contd wheres victor creed
dukes grunts and bulls forward toppling the heavily laden shelves into the next aisle
panicked shoppers scream and run for the exits
dukes blasts through the cereal aisle too with a great rending of steel his giant shoes crushing boxes of lucky charms as he stomps into the produce section
a coconut bounces off dukess head
enraged the giant turns and sees logan standing by a pile of hairy coconuts tossing one in his hand like a baseball
logan contd youre gonna help me bub
you just dont know it yet
dukes bellows and runs at logan
a coconut pelts him in the face angering him further
logan jumps out of the way as dukes brings down his massive fists
dukes charges after logan shattering watermelons stacked grapefruits clusters of bananas
after a thirty second rampage dukes is exhausted his giant chest heaving as he gasps for air his hands and face splattered with remnants of crushed fruit
logan jumps onto dukes back
the fat man roars and spins around trying to buck the little rider but logans got one arm wrapped around dukes throat and hes not letting go
the spinning makes dukes a little dizzy and he slows down
three adamantium claws shine in the big fellows face reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights
dukes quits his massive shoulders slumping
he sinks to his knees his great bulk splitting the linoleum floor
logan presses his claws against dukes quivering jowls
logan contd wheres creed
how the hell would i know
come on hes your friend
when was the last time you talked to him
he dont have any friends
all hes got is victims
i can smell a lie before you even tell it
the blob begins to cry the great bellows of his cheeks trembling tears and snot dribbling down his face
im not lying
i dont know where he is
logan pulls a handkerchief out of his back pocket and hands it to dukes
all right take it easy
dukes blows his nose into the handkerchief one of historys loudest and most violent nasal ejaculations
he offers back the soiled handkerchief
logan waves it off
logan contd its a gift
dukes takes a deep breath gathering himself
you ever been to superior
the club for mutants
down in new orleans
creed likes to party down there
talked about it all the time how hot the girlies were
thats all i know
logan shaves dukes jaw with the edge of his claw
you know more than that
dukes tilts his face trying to keep his face from getting scraped off
joints owned by a guy named barbarus
shared a cell with creed in the ultramax
anyone knows where to find him its barbarus
logan stares into the blobs face gauging the mans words
he better be there freddie
and he better know something good
rnnt t nt tf
logan contd cause im in a mood for violence and youre way too big to hide
stryker stands by a window overlooking alkali lake while general munson sits at the head of the conference table
we have information that he was in las vegas two nights ago
well find him soon
this is turning into a goddamn disaster colonel
id say the experiment has been a success
are you kidding me
weapon x is a prototype
hes the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable
that along with the healing factor weve replicated from his blood will insure that the eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction
at this point logan is merely an inconvenience
he wont be for long
im sorry william
ive lost confidence in your leadership
im going to recommend your dismissal to the joint chiefs
stryker stares out the window at the distant lake with no visible reaction to the generals words
expected but still
general munson takes a sip of water from the glass in front of him
i know you believe in what youre doing
but i dont
war with the mutants is not inevitable
the general coughs
he begins to look confused as he coughs again his breathing gone suddenly ragged
he clutches at his chest
a thin smile curls strykers lips
he turns to regard the general
youre having a massive heart attack sir
leading cause of death for men in your age bracket
the general gasps for air trying to rise to his feet
in his death throes he knocks the glass of water from the table
it shatters on the floor
contd the war is coming
its time to choose sides
the general collapses and stryker stands above him staring down at the dying man with pitiless eyes
stryker contd you chose treason
a heavy rain falls in the french quarter
there is no sign outside the club only
a gargantuan bouncer standing in front of an unmarked door in a dark alley
the bouncer apprises the stocky mutant walking his way
only when we go close on the bouncer do we realize he has a single eye large and bloodshot centered in his forehead
logan raises both hands
a single claw extends from his right hand
he shoves the claw straight through his left palm retracts the blade and shows his wounded palm to the bouncer
the bouncer sees the wound heal and opens the door
bouncer contd welcome home brother
the dimly lit club is the size of a warehouse and jammed with partying mutants
most of them look like normal humans but a few are overts distinguished by curling horns scaled skin and other genetic abnormalities
a sexy waitress walks by with a tray of drinks
she winks at logan
a kiss me im a mutant button is pinned to her shirt
industrial beats pour out of speakers bolted to the ceilings
logan surveys the room
a young pusher approaches his long sideburns shaved into scimitars running down his jawline
you lookin for help man
ups downs in betweens
what you need
wild roses for the moon
that some new hash out of amsterdam
something like that
you seen my buddy barbarus
the dealer points toward a staircase at the back of the club
but hold up bro
i got what youre looking for
trust me bub you dont
logan heads for the staircase
logan tries to enter the vip room but a muscle bound skinhead with mutant power brands on his biceps blocks his path
im on the list
the skinhead raises his clipboard and examines the list
logans fist splits the clipboard and crushes the skinheads nose
the muscle bound brute slumps to the floor unconscious
logan steps over him and into the vip room
the vip mutants sit at plush booths downing shots of tequila
they grope their girlfriends
they arm wrestle and compare tattoos and gobble down fried oysters
barbarus sits in a corner booth
he wears a custom made wife beater
the brutally muscled mutant has four arms all sleeved in tattoos
one hand pours himself a new glass of jack daniels
a second hand gouges his name into the table top with a black steel commando knife
the third drums the beat of the current song on the vinyl booths backrest
the fourth hand pets pantera the nubile mutant sitting on his lap a beautiful young woman entirely covered in glistening black fur
her yellow eyes glitter
logan approaches the table
barbarus stares up at him
pantera purrs yellow eyes on logan
nuzzling his girl oh i heard about this lil fella
creed beat him to hell
i came back
where is he
somewhere in america
doing what he does best
putting peoples insides on the outside
hes killing mutants bub
barbarus smiles twenty fingers drumming on the table top
some mutants need killing
you got that right
barbarus shoves his girlfriend out of the way and stands unsheathing three more black commando knives from his belt
the other mutants quiet down watching the fireworks
barbarus swings the four knives whistling through the air
logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel
logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground
barbarus howls stabbing at logan with his three good arms
logans claws flash through the air again and another neatly severed hand lands on the table
logan retracts his claws and curls one finger come at me
barbarus shamed and furious gathers himself and charges
logan times his punch perfectly pivoting on the ball of his foot and hitting barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a well hit baseball
barbarus crashes to the floor
pantera hisses and pounces at logan her black claws aimed at his face
logan backhands her
she hits the floor and slides across the hardwood
logan kneels beside barbarus
logan contd you want to keep your other hands
where is he
blood dribbles from barbaruss lip
he spits out a tooth
he dont sent me postcards
way i hear it you two were practically boyfriends before he busted out
you been misinformed
victor creed got himself a government pardon
some fellas from the department of agriculture came and picked him up
youre lying to me
barbarus grins his teeth red from the blood in his mouth
but somebody is
a five story concrete parking structure on the edge of las vegas
john wraith walks to his black
mustang whistling a jerry jeff walker song
when he gets to the car he drops to the floor and checks the underbody for bombs
nothing down there
he stands reaching into his pocket for his keys
you think id use a bomb on you johnny boy
wraith spins around
victor creed sits on a concrete parapet the desert wind blowing his filthy blonde hair
he hops off the parapet and walks toward wraith
victor creed contd its all about human contact for me
wraith quickly unlocks the car door and get in
he slips the key into the ignition
the engine turns on the first try
wraith hits the gas and the mustang squeals out in reverse
he slams on the brakes shifts into drive and guns the car right at creed
an instant before impact creed sidesteps the car and punches through the drivers window
its a miracle of a punch timed perfectly a crushing shot to wraiths jaw
wraith loses control
of the car and it sideswipes a parked hummer spinning to a stop against a concrete wall
wraith blinks and tries to clear his head
creed reaches inside the broken window and hauls the texan out
he lifts the bleeding man into the air and flashes his white fangs
victor creed contd hear you been talking out of school
hell find you
thats the plan
its a lot easier than finding him
creed slams wraith against the concrete wall and plunges his claws deep into wraiths gut
the texans mouth opens as the full force of the pain hits him
creed whispers in his ear
victor creed contd i can feel your spine johnny boy
a sickening crunch as vertebrae are crushed like walnut shells
victor creed contd never knew you had one
creed drops wraiths body to the ground
carol hines the army surgeon last seen in alkali lake unlocks her front door and steps inside her house
she looks exhausted with deep circles under her eyes
she puts her keys and the mail on a table by the door and then looks up startled when she hears shrieking
hines very nervous advances into the dark kitchen
she flicks on the lights
a red kettle on the stove top whistles
a mug waits on the counter
hines mystified turns off the burner
pour yourself a cup of tea
hines spins around
logan sits at the kitchen table an unlit cigar in his mouth
logan contd its gonna be a long night
they both sit at the kitchen table now
logan smokes his cigar and watches hines who clutches her mug of tea with trembling hands
logan watches her through the haze of smoke
i can smell a lie
i can hear it
maybe you start to sweat a little bit
maybe the pitch of your voice changes
but ill know
tell me about creed
hines opens her mouth closes it opens it again
you dont know what theyll do to me
but i know exactly what ill do to you
rnnttnt ft i
hines stares at logan and he stares back
i dont believe you
youre different than they are
you wouldnt hurt an innocent person
youre not innocent doc
he leans forward forearms on the tabletop
logan contd what does victor creed have to do with the weapon x program
its not the weapon x program its the weapon ultra program
started sixty five years ago
theyve been trying to make the perfect soldier for a long time
first to fight the nazis
then the communists
now its mutants
so where does weapon x fit in
hines closes her eyes and takes a deep breath
you dont understand
x is a letter but its also a roman numeral
weapon ex is a nickname
officially youre weapon ten
victor creed is weapon nine
hines watches him unsure how hell react
hines contd both of you are experiments
the final product is almost ready
logans face darkens as the extent of his betrayal becomes clear to him
creed works for stryker
i conttni rm
logan contd be ordered it
he ordered creed to kill her
hines can see logans mounting fury
she holds up her hands
i dont know about anyone getting killed
im just a scientist
i work in a lab sixteen hours a day
just following orders huh
he was your commanding officer for years
how many people did you kill on his orders
logan stares at her for a long count
she stares back terrified but resolute
all this time i been hunting creed and hes just a puppet
its stryker pulling the strings
he stubs out his cigar on the breakfast table
logan contd you ready to stop following orders
stryker stands at the window overlooking alkali lake
cornelius steps into the room holding a black leather case
the eleven will be ready within hours
lieutenant hines hasnt reported to base today
stryker considers the information for a moment and nods
stryker contd all right thank you doctor
glancing at case whats this
cornelius sets the case on the table and opens it
six gleaming armor piercing bullets rest in green felt niches
we saved the leftover adamantium from the weapon x procedure
stryker plucks one of the bullets from its niche and rolls it between his fingers examining it with a practiced eye
cornelius contd each ones got a high explosive core
two in the head and logans brain will have to regenerate from scratch
they wont kill him
according to the computer models we ran theres a percent chance his healing factor will reconstitute the gray matter
but those synaptic bridges that form our memories
if he survives his brain will come back fresh
a blank slate
easy to train
stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly
stryker contd shes a pretty little thing
she ought to be
thats the worlds most expensive bullet
stryker pulls a revolver from his shoulder holster dumps the standard rounds and begins loading the adamantium bullets
cornelius contd theres another way a more reliable way to break down his memory
only problem is the procedure can only be done here at alkali lake
stryker swings the chamber shut and holsters his gun
oh hes coming back doctor
we have what hes looking for
hines driving an old ford pulls up
to the guard house at the perimeter of the compound
a young sentry salutes her
hines smiles brightly trying to hide her nervousness
the sentry looks into the cars cabin
the passenger seat is empty
the back seat is empty
could you pop the trunk for me
its all standard procedure but hines is close to panicking
she opens the glove compartment and hits the trunk release
the sentry inspects the trunk
nothing but a coil of rope and a roll of electrical tape
he slams the trunk door
young sentry contd you have a good day
he signals to a second sentry standing inside the guard house who hits a button
the steel gate rolls open and hines drives into the compound
hines steps out of her parked car and looks around
no one is in the immediate vicinity
logan crawls out from the underbody where he had been clinging
he dusts himself off
were you aiming for every speed bump in the state
sorry about that
we find a uniform that fits
a well built sergeant walks toward his vehicle paging through requisition papers on a clipboard
logan contd that ought to work
hines and logan who now wears a crisp uniform with a sergeants stripes and a black beret walk into the building
you have some blood on your shirt
logan sees the drops of blood and tries to blot them out
i barely hit the guy
they dont notice as a small security camera near the entrance pivots its black eye watching the intruders
hines very nervous tries to keep her composure
logan puts a hand on her shoulder partly to steady her nerves partly to keep pushing her forward
logan contd time to visit the colonel
hines and logan walk down a long corridor
several soldiers and scientists walk by most of them ignoring the pair
one young scientist in a lab coat hurries past nodding at hines
hines waits till murphy passes
she stops in front of a locked door and allows a laser scanner to read her retina
the door slides open
logan looks through the open doorway his nostrils flaring
he looks primed for homicide
i can smell him
he walks through the door
hines checks to see if the coast is clear
and follows him
neither notices the security camera mounted on the ceiling swiveling to track their movement
logan and hines stand at the top of a steel staircase forty feet above the concrete floor of a massive cavern
created in the s by an underground hydrogen bomb test the alkali lake cavern is the second biggest in the country smaller only than the salt caverns of the gulf
coast home of the strategic petroleum reserve
the sheer scale of the place is staggering
three times the size of the super dome with walls of rough granite the cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and high powered machinery
heavy steel pillars support the ceiling of the cavern
ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor arrayed in a grid each tank slightly larger than a coffin
technicians walk in between the tanks checking gauges writing notes in clipboards
more technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the cavern overlooking the eleven entering information into the computers that monitor the sleeping army
logan is awed by the sight
hines has descended the staircase ahead of him
he follows after her
welcome to weapon eleven
i thought it was just gonna be one guy
they reach the cavern floor and walk amongst the eleven
hines contd stryker says mutants and humans will fight a war soon
gesturing to weapon xi this is his army
the camera glides over the isolation tanks as hines continues to speak
we catch glimpses of the eleven inside comatose soldiers with needles and wires protruding from their skin exactly like logan during the weapon x procedure
the men all look identical and they all look oddly familiar
hines contd they incorporate the most successful features of the previous weapons
enhanced skeletons heightened senses healing factor f r nttnttf
logan stops beside one tank and looks at the man inside who floats in his chemical sleep
his eyes widen when he realizes what hes looking at
he looks inside another tank
same cruel face same powerful body
only their shaved heads distinguish them from victor creed
logan contd theyre all creed
strykers most successful mutant hunter
they cloned him years ago
the colonels been planning this for a long time
logan walks through the midst of this vast sleeping army surrounded by ten thousand replicas of his worst enemy
they get into the world its genocide
i think thats the general idea
logan stops in mid stride head raised in the manner of a hunting dog who has just caught wind of his prey
hines contd whats the matter
logan moves walking quickly nearly knocking over a technician entering data into one of the stasis pods
hines hurries after logan smiling apologetically at the annoyed technician
where you going
logan never turns
f ronttnut n
dont follow me
hines stops standing alone in the middle of the eleven
logan walks rapidly down the hallway his pace accelerating as he nears a closed doorway
he rests his head against the door for a moment before putting his hand on the knob and entering the room
stryker sits behind his desk smiling at logan
but logans not looking at the colonel
hes looking at the young woman who sits across from stryker her back to the door
she doesnt turn
her long black hair cascades down her back
hello old friend
weve been waiting for you
logan walks toward the desk slowly now a man in a nightmare he cant wake from
stryker contd did you really think we just let you walk away three years ago
youre a dangerous man my friend
we like to keep an eye on dangerous men
when logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her shoulder
kayla silverfox turns and stares up at him tears streaming down her face
im so sorry
an aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air smashing the back of logans head
logan falls to the floor unconscious
victor creed stands above him staring at the flattened barrel of the baseball bat
mans got a hard head
hell only be out for a couple minutes
creed tosses aside the bat and lifts logan onto his shoulders as easily as a normal man would lift a child of six
he carries logan out of the room winking at kayla
logan still unconscious sits on a chair that looks far too similar to an electric chair his arms and legs bound with titanium manacles that prevent any movement
the room looks like an execution chamber complete with a viewing window
he opens his eyes and blinks in the bright light
stryker and creed stand in front of him but logan doesnt look at them
cornelius and an assistant stand near a machine that is wired to the electric chair fiddling with the controls but logan doesnt look at them either
he stares at kayla who cannot meet his eyes
who are you
very quiet you know who i am
no i dont
shes real old friend
your eyes are telling you
logan ignores stryker staring at the love of his life
i asked you nicely to join the program
and you were so stubborn
but i knew if nothing else could motivate you revenge would
stryker smiles at kayla a proud professor beaming at his student
stryker contd tell him
tell him about the day you died
kayla head bowed is silent for a long count
when she speaks her voice is a strange monotone devoid of feeling
they gave me a syringe full of hydrochlorothiazide
perhaps the colors are desaturated to let us know that this is a scene weve witnessed before or thought we did
kayla sits behind the wheel of her pickup
victor creed walks toward her black talons raking five gashes on the hood
kayla has been expecting him
she pulls her backpack out from behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle and a plastic iv bag filled with dark blood
creed tears the trucks door off its hinges and tosses it twenty yards
kayla injects herself with the hypodermic
reduces the heartbeat to almost zero
breathing virtually stops
makes you flatline for six minutes
kayla hops down from the truck
she holds out the iv bag to victor who casually pierces it with his claw
contd id been drawing my own blood every night for the past week
i had four liters ready that morning
her own blood on her body and empties the rest of the bag on the pavement
she lies down in the puddle in a fetal position her breathing already beginning to slow
i same as victor
stryker gave me a i choice spend the rest of my life in prison or come work for him
kayla finally raises her head and looks directly at logan
shot my daddy when i was eighteen
should have shot him when i was seventeen
you told me he died of a heart attack
maybe he had a heart attack after i shot him
sat there and watched him bleed
after what that man did to me i wish he died slower
logan stares at her for a long time
kayla contd that sweet little girl you lived with in the cabin
that was all make believe
you loved me
i know you loved me
kayla blinks and looks away
im a good actress
no ones that good
c onttn tf
everybodys a sucker for something
figuring out what it is thats the trick
for you its a womans love
an easy weakness to forgive
but still a weakness
stryker signals to cornelius
the doctor and his assistant attach a nasty looking copper halo to logans skull
the halo is wired to the electric chair
logan never takes his eyes off silverfox
stryker contd dont be angry at her
she was just serving her country keeping the mutant menace in check
she and victor have been a real credit to their race
it takes logan a moment to understand this comment
youre a mutant
my daddy found out when i was twelve
said a freak like me deserved whatever i got
my kind of guy
shes a gifted girl
she can plant thoughts in anyones mind make them believe what she wants as long as she stays focused on them
he strokes her long dark hair proud of his protege
kayla doesnt seem thrilled by strykers touch but she endures it
stryker contd a useful tool in a seduction
to logan spent so much time getting you to love me by the time the colonel showed up i couldnt get you to leave me
r nrtn f
cornelius finishes calibrating his machine and adjusting the halo brace
were good to go
the truth is youre a real pain in the ass
but weve invested far too much time and treasure to terminate you
were starting over
cornelius checks the digital gauges on the machine
if ive calibrated correctly well leave intact the hard wired functions walking and talking all that good stuff
you mean i dont get to potty train him
but every memory youve ever had will evaporate
just like it never happened
logan never takes his eyes off kayla his personal judas
to cornelius let me know when hes clean
i have to look in on our other guest
stryker exits the room followed by victor
to kayla that story you told me
about the guy who goes to get flowers for the moon
i cant get it out of my head
except i had it all backwards
i thought you were the moon and i was your wolverine
but youre the trickster arent you
logan contd and im just a schmuck who got played
kayla is silent for a moment
my mother told me that story
she takes a deep breath and turns to go
kayla contd it doesnt matter
you wont remember any of this
you didnt trick me into loving you
the last two months you werent playing around in my skull
you werent using
your powers on me
i thought you were dead and i loved you more than ever
maybe it makes you feel better to think it was all fake
but it was never fake for me
kayla lowers her eyes
you dont know where i come from
you dont know what it was like
i know exactly what is was like
i come from there too
i didnt have a choice
course you did
you still do
kayla stares down at logan
the tenderness returns to her face
she could free him right now if she wanted
the moment passes and kayla shakes her head
t c nttnttpti
yeah you keep saying that
to cornelius come on
turn on the juice
lets get this over with
whenever youre ready miss silverfox
kayla turns and walks out of the room
cornelius and his aide follow shutting the door behind them
logan takes a deep breath
he looks like a man who is ready to forget everything
hines sits alone on a metal cot
the cell door slides open
stryker and victor step inside
victor and i were just discussing how to kill you and we thought you might have some suggestions
silverfox steps out of the re education chamber
she hears voices from the holding cell and approaches
when the turks captured a traitor they strapped a steel basket to the mans stomach
inside the basket was a rat
now even a rat cant chew through steel
but it can chew through a stomach
so it would
right through the skin and the fat and the muscle and the intestines right on out the other side
l cdnttni et i
hines looks like she might be sick very soon
kayla steps into the doorway
stryker contd victor thinks the turks were soft letting the rats do the dirty work
hes looking forward to spending your last night with you
please colonel stryker pats hines on the cheek and nods to victor
please dont do this
victor drags the screaming hines off of her cot
kayla watches with growing unease but stryker smiles and waves goodbye as he turns the key that shuts the cell door
logan sits in his electric chair staring straight ahead preparing himself for the pain
cornelius stands behind the glass viewing window with his assistant
he puts his hand on a red switch
thousands of volts surge into logans skull forcing his body to arch
after several seconds the power shuts off
tendrils of white smoke rise from the copper halo
logan opens his eyes and stares at cornelius
that all you got
to his assistant this could take a while
raise the amperage by forty percent
stryker signs a memo and hands it to his aide collins
kayla stands by the window picking at her fingers
youre going to let victor kill that woman
stryker and collins ignore her
kayla contd when you got me out of prison you told me we were going to help people
stryker continues to sign papers never looking up
were saving humanity
from the mutants
the phone rings
stryker answers it
im coming down
hanging up to collins the eleven is ready
he stands and heads for the door
in the doorway stryker stops and fixes his cold blue gaze on kayla
stryker contd dont worry my sweet
youre one of the good ones
ill protect you
he and collins exit the room leaving kayla alone with her misery
logan sits panting in the chair gripping the ends of the arm rests with white fingers waiting for the next surge of electricity
it comes and he arches again all the muscles in his body contracting the veins in his neck bulging
cornelius and his assistant watch logan with no detectable sympathy
they turn when kayla walks into the room
is he clean yet
cornelius and the assistant face front again
hes stronger than i thought
we could be here all night
kayla watches logan in his agony
a glimmer of remorse passes over her face
he was good to me
cornelius fiddling with the amperage dial curls his lips in a sardonic smile
you have a funny way of showing your gratitude
logan thrashes in his chair
kayla chews her lip
for a long count she watches logan suffer
you should turn it off now
cornelius turns and stares at her
i should what
i guess thats
i guess thats a good idea
he turns off the electricity
you two have always hated each other
you should fight
the assistant blinks and begins to scowl turning toward cornelius just in time to get punched in the mouth
the two men brawl on the floor with the lack of skill youd expect from two scientists
kayla steps into the room
logan sits slumped motionless in the electric chair
she detaches the copper halo
the skin beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal
kayla stares at the man she betrayed hesitates for a moment and exhales
she unfastens the titanium manacles
logan is still unconscious
kayla shakes him gently
logan opens his eyes
he is clearly disoriented as if waking from a long coma
he stares up at kayla
kayla contd are you okay
logan stares at her groggy and confused
kayla contd do you understand what im saying
do you remember me
in one blinding motion logan snatches kayla by the throat and roughly pulls her to him
she does not resist
i would have done anything for you
do you hear me
creeds killing your friend
victor creed holds hines against the cell wall with one hand
her feet kick in the air as she struggles
he splits her blouse down the middle with a long black talon
ive always had a thing for human chicks
youre all so soft and helpless
maybe its time i did a little surgery on you doctor
the woman said no
creed turns his head and sees logan and kayla standing in the doorway
he grins and tosses hines aside
she crashes into the wall and slides to the floor dazed
to logan starting to think youre addicted to pain
you keep coming back for more
this is the end
amen to that
kayla stands in between them holding up her hands
we shouldnt be fighting each other
strykers using us
a little late for the mutant power crap
we hunt freaks for the man
thats why were free
whats he gonna do with us when the other mutants are dead
put us in a zoo
creed hesitates considering the logic of her words
a fanged smile splits his face
dont try your head games on me
ive gutted better telepaths than you
creed rears back to hammer kayla a blow that would separate her head from her body
logan catches creeds fist inches from kaylas face
time you quit picking on girls
oh im happy picking on men
creed swings at logans head logan ducks and the fight begins
this is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted
every lunge would kill any other adversary
every parried blow would shatter a normal mans arm
kayla bleeding from the nose staggers to her feet
she helps up hines and pushes her toward the door
get out of here
hines doesnt have to be told twice
creed sees his plaything running out the door
he snarls in frustration
youre ruining my party
he grabs hold of logan and hurls him headfirst through the cell wall a concrete support wall
logan crashes to the floor covered in rubble
creed steps out of the cell licking his fangs
creed tries to stomp logans face but the smaller man rolls out of the way and gets back on his feet
the mutants battle down the corridor claws whistling through the air
a team of sentries charge around the corner wearing tactical armor and carrying xm assault rifles
they level their rifles at the battling mutants
down on your knees
logan and creed trying to punch holes in each other ignore the sentries
kayla staring down the barrels of the big guns
holds up her hands
she concentrates staring into the sentries eyes
were here as guests of colonel stryker
the sentries hostility shifts into apologetic obeisance
very sorry about that
you boys are no longer needed here
go back to barracks
you got it
see ya later
the sentries wave cheerfully and depart
creed and logan are equally skilled but creeds superior size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down
creed slams him into the wall opening fissures
holding both of wolverines wrists up with one hand creed grabs wolverines face with his free hand
his black claws slide toward wolverines eyes
how you gonna fight without eyes little man
logan brings his knee up hard smashing his adamantium enhanced kneecap into creeds groin
the big man groans
logan spins creed around jamming him against the wall
he tries to skewer creed with the claws of his right hand but creed moves his head at the last moment
logans claws are buried to the hilt in the wall
he strikes at creed with his left hand but creed dodges again
all six of logans claws are deep in the solid rock wall
he brings his hands
together the adamantium blades slicing through granite as if it were cheesecake
creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him
he grabs logan in a bear hug
a large section of the wall behind them falls out and unable to halt their momentum logan and creed tumble through the hole disappearing from sight
kayla runs over and stands at the jagged precipice looking out onto the gargantuan weapon xi cavern
logan and creed fall seventy feet clawing at each other in mid air
logan hits the floor hard the impact blasting a small crater in the concrete
creed manages a rolling fall cat quick and dexterous
stryker stands on the raised podium in the center of the cavern overlooking his vast sleeping army
he cannot believe what hes seeing
to lead technician i want the eleven combat ready
we cant rush them
theyve been in stasis for i want them ready
the lead technician flinches and barks orders to his subordinates who enter commands into their computers
the lids of ten thousand isolation tanks slide open
as the camera roams among the eleven needles and hoses detach from their bodies releasing their metallic grip
the cloned creeds begin to stir in their stainless steel coffins
creed pounces on logan who is still severely injured from the fall
creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly slinging him around the cavern gouging him with his black talons
creed batters logan with a series of savage blows
logan falls his healing factor overwhelmed barely conscious
creed plants one heavy black boot on logans face and presses down hard
he leers at his defeated foe
your pal wraith pissed all over my boots when i crushed his spine
smell like fear dont they
something changes within logan a fury so overwhelming it cannot be contained a rage so vast it could only be called berserker
logan rolls toward his tormentor sweeping his claws straight through creeds ankle severing the foot
creed screams and falls to his knees
logan stands grabbing a handful of creeds dirty blonde hair
this is for the ones who couldnt fight back
the adamantium blades are a silver blur in the overhead light
stryker standing on the podium sees his chief henchmans head tumble from his shoulders
he grits his teeth and surveys his army
ten thousand enhanced warriors begin to step out of their steel coffins baring their fangs eyeing their surroundings
to the lead technician activate the pa system
the lead technicians flips a switch
stryker speaks into a microphone his voice booms from speakers mounted on the pillars throughout the cavern
the eleven snap to attention with machined synchronicity all ten thousand facing stryker
logan bloodied but healing stares down at his fallen enemy
kayla runs down one of the steel staircases that clings to the cavern wall like fire escapes
kayla contd if we get closer to stryker i can work my magic
logan stares at stryker his true enemy the
man who destroyed his life
ten thousand clones
encircle stryker who stands on the raised podium in the caverns center
i dont want him hypnotized
i want him dead
never taking his eyes off his enemy logan advances
i c nttnttf t
stryker sees logan walking toward him toward the hordes of clones
stryker shakes his head and smiles
the mans committing suicide
he leans into the microphone
the eleven listen to their commanders voice amplified by hundreds of speakers stryker contd no army that ever marched could stand against you
you will never abandon your mission and your mission is simple
kill the mutants
kill them wherever you find them
stryker points at logan
stryker contd ten thousand cloned murderers turn on logan soulless black eyes focusing on their target
logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars
that supports the cavern ceiling
to kayla get the hell out of here
what are you doing
bringin down the house
he sweeps his claws clean through the pillar at an angle
the uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for thirty feet around the impact site
stryker realizes what logan is doing
the eleven charge
from above we can see the full scale of the onslaught wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in
logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it
creaks and groans sound overhead as the tremendous weight above exerts pressure on the remaining weight bearing supports
most of the ten thousand cant get close to logan but they all want in on the first kill
whirling slashing stabbing kicking logan scythes a circle of devastation spray painting the floor with the black blood of the eleven
he reaches a third pillar and chops through it
kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit
stryker contd even logan cant hold back the tide for long
talons rake his face his arms his chest
but still he battles slicing through a fourth pillar a fifth
tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling
dust and rocks fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen
logan sees that the caverns collapse is imminent
he can no longer hold off the elevens assault
an instant before the clones can shred him he jumps using his claws to scale one of the still standing steel pillars with the grace and speed of a leopard
climbing a tree
one of the clones follows using his black talons in the same fashion grabbing at logans feet
when logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth gnashing clones he severs the pillar below his feet
the clone chasing him can climb no farther can do nothing but roar and hiss at his escaping prey
logan swings himself onto the steel staircase where kayla waits beside the open door
he races up the stairs
stryker sees his dream in ruins
he runs for the nearest exit
kayla and logan are a few feet from the door from safety when the cavern ceiling gives out
thousands of tons of stone and steel come crashing down
logan grabs kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before she would be crushed
the compound has essentially imploded the major structures falling into the massive pit created by the caverns collapse
severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater into a raging fire pit
smoke billows up from the molten core
a few dazed survivors soldiers and scientists have escaped the carnage but alkali lake no longer exists as a military base
thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind
logan and kayla walk away from the burning crater never looking back
they head through the woods toward the lake that glitters in the sunlight
one of them could have survived
logan glances at her
kayla contd the clones
theyve got your healing factor
logan looks back at the devastation
unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel they aint going anywhere
they stop at the edge of the lake
paper from the destroyed base drifts through the air falling on the water and the shore
almost looks peaceful from here
theres something i want you to know
he looks at her
fl kayla contd maybe nothing i say matters anymore
but im going to say it anyway
a blossom of blood opens up on her chest
she stares down at it in wonder before sinking to her knees
logan turns and sees stryker walking toward them
kayla contd no
stryker fires again
the adamantium bullet rips through logans forehead with an unholy sound
logan falls to the ground
stryker stands above him and fires another bullet into logans head
stryker turns the gun on kayla
kayla contd you dont need to waste another bullet
im already dead
stryker blinks and hesitates
kayla coughs her strength beginning to fade
kayla contd maybe you should turn that gun on yourself colonel
stryker nods pointing the gun at his own head
kayla contd it would be good for the mutants if i made you pull the trigger
why do you hate us so much
strykers finger trembles on the trigger
kayla contd is it because your son is one of us
for the first time perhaps we see something human in the cold blue of strykers eyes
kayla contd enough killing colonel
throw your gun in the lake
stryker does as hes told
the revolver sinks into the water
kayla contd leave us
keep walking till your feet start to bleed
stryker turns and walks away
kayla crawls over to logan
she lifts his head onto her lap
hes unconscious but breathing
the bullet holes in his skin have already healed
she strokes his jaw
and smiles sadly
one of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her leg
she takes it and looks down at the blank page
she has no pen
she touches her chest just above her heart wetting her finger with her blood
she writes four words on the page blows on it to dry it folds it once and places it in logans hand
she kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground
fighting the pain a dying woman kayla manages to stand
kayla contd if you ever remember what i did to you try to forgive me
i was a fool
and you were right
i always loved you
she turns and walks toward the lake never looking back never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees above her waist above her shoulders above her head
logans eyes flutter and open
for a moment he squints into the blue sky
he sits up looking around
the woods are empty
he stands completely disoriented a stranger in the world
he realizes that hes holding a piece of paper in his hand
he unfolds it and reads the message written in blood
you are my wolverine
he stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and putting it in his pocket
f c onttniird
he takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west toward the falling sun
he doesnt know who he is
he doesnt know where hes going
but the wind blows through his hair the last of the sunlight feels good on his skin
he is a free man
he walks toward his destiny
