written by michael butler dennis shryack mike gray john mason story by michael butler dennis shryack thundering north through the glass canyons of the loop the elevated train screeches through
the city awakening
as it races north across the river past ancient factories giving way to high rise splendor lights glistening against the dawn we see the complex business of bringing a city
to life in the morning
on the near north side an assortment of revelers are winding up their night on the town
the pressmen loiter outside the tribune loading docks and fishing boats are outbound through the chicago river locks
a streetsweeping crew moves through the fulton market chicagos central meat and produce distribution center
at the merchandise mart platform the elevated train picks up two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas
the el train rumbles north past the aging tenements of uptown into the belmont avenue station
and down below a garbage truck is slowly working its way up the alley
a garbage man in city overalls whistles to the driver and the truck stops
he rolls a can to the grinding jaw as the driver sits tense and alert scanning the street
theres something odd about this driver
and the garbage man too for that matter
spider a nervous looking black man steps out onto the platform
as the train pulls away we see him reach into his shirt pocket and clicks his ball point pen a couple of times
he whispers into it
it is a concealed radio transmitter
say hey cub fans i hope to hell yall down there cause we got a big game today
he heads for the stairs and the street below
the truck cab is equipped with a police radio
the driver rich donato adjusts the volume
over the speaker heavy with static we can hear the sound of the receding el train
from radio the school bus be waitin
donato motions for the garbage man
eddie cusack jumps up on the trucks running board and sticks his head in
on the seat beside donato is a sledgehammer and a sawed off automatic rifle
the two men stare at each other as they concentrate on the crackling radio
from radio shappenin doc
from radio hey i got it all right here my man
jus be waitin on you
from radio we aint got far to go
doc is at the wheel of a late model cadillac
spider gets in and they pull slowly away from the curb
at the corner in a beat up pontiac are officers music and brennan
the two rough looking detectives follow docs car through half closed eyes
they also hear spiders transmitter
the quality of the reception improves as spider and his antennae clear the steel support structure of the el platform
from radio this early bird shit just aint my style
from radio dig it
too close to real work for me
doc and spider talk in a nervous false bravado
eddie nods to donato who grabs a walkie talkie from the seat
to walkie talkie o
ready in the bullpen
from radio copy shortstop
were with him now
from radio centers in
eddie looks at donato
two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from the el
cragie a weathered twenty five year veteran and nick kosalas the new kid on the team
cragie sits on a crate with a styrofoam cup of coffee
kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off and still hold on to his walkie talkie
from radio talk to me left field
to mike ready sir
left field in position
cragie pulls a pint of whiskey from his pocket and sweetens his coffee with a healthy shot
he notices kosalas who has set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to leg
have a shot kid
a little nerve tonic
whats the matter with you
cragie grins and raises his cup to drink
his hand shakes and he has to steady it with the other
the radio crackles
from radio o
guys runner on first base
a spotter kobas covers the scene from an abandoned building across the street
to walkie talkie just turning on paulina
from radio double play you got him in sight
from radio yeah we got the on him
hes headin for the alley
eddie wrestles another garbage can into the trucks hopper as docs car cruises slowly past
eddie and spider lock eyes for a split second
the car moves on and stops at the far end of the alley
the lights switch off
after a moment spider and doc leave the car and check out the scene
doc carries a satchel
from radio i say nice and simple now
from radio we real cool doc
we jus doin a little business you know
aint no big thing
the two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement
they pass through a gangway to the front of the building and climb the front stairs
though we can no longer see them we hear a door opening a greeting in spanish and feet founding up the steps
the garbage truck grinds forward and halts again
eddie comes up to the cab
he is wearing a gun under his overalls
he and donato listen on the radio to the conversation coming from inside the building
a muscular latino pompas comacho leads spider and doc down the paint peeling corridor
the sound of babies crying and families waking gives a sense of teeming humanity behind every door
the latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar bars
the door opens
the bars are unlocked
how yall doin
from within its o
pompas leaves the two men and heads down the stairs toward the front door
doc and spider enter
theyre patted down
a sleepy eyed latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom doorway
victor comacho barks at her in spanish and she disappears into the bedroom
eddie stands on the running board of the truck with donato at the wheel
they listen to the radio
from radio hey man were clean huh
we aint fools
you do that real nice pancho
what say we get married
eddie tosses a soiled rubics cube into donatos lap
found you a present
shit those things will fuck up your mind
cragie is watching over the wall with his binoculars
he looks back at kosalas who is hopping from foot to foot
if you gotta take a leak do it now
i cant go wading in with my shlong flapping in the wind
sure you can
its called diversionary tactics
cragie laughs and swigs straight from the bottle
the radio from radio whats going on in the ballpark
from radio dont get froggy
wait for the green light
a painters van passes brennans pontiac and parks in front of the building half way up the block
music doesnt like this
what the hell is this cat up to
going to work asshole
what do you think
at this hour
they got a hardass for a boss
as music and brennan watch from their car the four painters get out of their truck unpack their ladders and tools and begin to carry their equipment into the building
next door to the stakeout
the room is small and bare
a selling den
victor comacho and two cousins all young and vicious are sitting around a formica table with the two buyers doc and spider
the comachos are heavily armed
there is plenty of tension all around but doc seems a little more nervous than the rest
this is an enormous buy
doc has placed a bowling satchel full of bundled s s and s on the table
victor is counting it rapidly
this be better than jukin seven elevens huh victor
to cousins in spanish this ones got some balls huh
to spider i dont juke anybody
victor nods and one of the cousins brings in half a dozen brick sized bundles of cocaine from the next room
doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife he drops a bit into a glass vial
he adds clear liquid with an eye dropper and it instantly turns purple
i say awright
the royal colors
eddies eyes scan the scene as he sorts through a garbage can with a stick
the painters carry their equipment down the long corridor and enter a vacant apartment
a door opens in the corridor and a naked toddler steps out
a latino teenager comes out to retrieve the child
he sees the backs of the painters and carries the toddler back inside
the painters are not what they seem
working quickly silently they open their tool kits and lay out their hardware machine guns and automatics
tony luna a barrel chested italian mobster is running the show and its well rehearsed
his boys gus vito and eenie move like oiled machinery
vito turns on a radio to a latino station to cover the sound of their preparations
they remove the whole window from its frame
then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge
three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and silhouetted against the shade we can see the drug deal
lunays check their weapons
they put on painters masks and goggles
okay by the numbers
he puts on his goggles
over the idling engine of the garbage truck eddie and donato hear the deal going down on the radio
to walkie talkie everybody on your toes
from radio their right fields clear
those painters are out of the way
to walkie talkie what the hell you talking about
from radio we got a painting crew of painters just went in the building next door
eddie looks at donato
that buildings gonna be condemned
like a coiled spring eddie leaps from the truck and runs for the rear gate gun in hand
shouts play ball
play fucking ball
to mike home team
were goin in
tony and his men face the window across the gangway
two of them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns
tony counts it down and they all fire as one
one giant blast tears into the window
the four men toss aside their empty guns and grab other guns
eddie hears the gunfire and hits the wall
he sees the glass showering down around him
he vaults over the backyard fence and head for the porch stairs
kosalas is finally pissing against the wall
i knew it
cragie is using the crate to climb the wall
he is up and over and falls to the ground on the other side
hes still trying to get to his feet when kosalas comes over
they start running yanking their guns out
doc and spider are blown backwards in their chairs
one of the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs
victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor
the woman in the bedroom is screaming
through the jagged glass around the window frame tonys boys shove a broad plank
three floors up we see the painters rush across the gangway to the other building
efren comacho the heavyweight guarding the back door is distracted by the shouts and gunfire upstairs
eddie crashes through the door and efren spins just in time to meet eddies blurring attack
the struggle on the landing is brief
efrens size is no match for eddies speed and power
with a grunt he sags to the floor
eddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps
brennan music and kobas are now on their way using parked cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the comacho building
eddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look up the porch stairs
the door to the second floor apartment starts to open behind him
he spins and kicks it
there stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of his gun
no se mueve
he spins and bounds up the stairway
the woman is huddled in a corner still screaming
tony comes to stand over her and coldly shoots her
then he rips off his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop up the drugs and money from the table
victor comacho lies slumped against the wall one side of his face and one shoulder bloodied
he appears dead eyes open
but then he blinks once
eddie has entered the rear of the apartment
he moves cautiously forward
tony and his partners start back over the gangway to the other building
vito is bringing up the rear
suddenly victor comacho comes to life
he gets off a burst with his automatic
vito catches it in the back
donato is moving down the gangway when vitos body followed by the scaffold plank falls from the sky and crashes into the pavement right in front of him
eddie jumps into the living room doorway gun drawn and takes in the carnage
he kicks the gun out of victors hand and bounds to the shattered bay window and looks down in time to see donato jumps over the broken body running through
the gangway toward the front of the building
theyre goin out the front
the bridge to the other building is gone but there is a large drainpipe running down the outside of the building
eddie climbs out on the shattered window sill and stretches for the pipe
the pipe is just out of reach
pushing off from the ledge he jumps for the drainpipe grabbing it on his way down
as he slides down three stories
the painters run down the stairs toward the front of the building
music brennan and kobas rush the front door of the comachos building and enter
eddie lands on his feet and heads for the front
cragie and kosalas brace themselves on each side of the rear door to the painters building
cragie is white with fear
kosalas kicks in the door
at the front of the building donato emerges from the passageway and hes met by a hail of gunfire
he jumps back and takes a more cautious look
tony luna and gus make a run for the van
donato steps out from between the two buildings and raises his gun
but he hasnt seen eenie just coming out of the building next door
eenie fires and donato goes down wounded in the foot
but before eenie can get off another shot eddie leaps from the gangway and drops eenie with a burst from his automatic
luna pulls out peeling rubber but hes nearly surrounded
squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street
another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump out and start firing
luna hits the fender of the squad car head on knocking both officers to the ground
he spins the van around with cops firing from every angle jumps the curb and roars past the roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all directions
heart pounding cragie leads kosalas blindly up the darkened steps
a door opens behind cragie
he whirls and fires into the darkness
the riddled body of a mexican teenager eyes wide with shock pitches into the hall
kosalas down the hallway hugs the wall petrified
i got the sonovabitch
kosalas creeps ahead gun drawn just in time to see cragie pull a small handgun from his pocket and lay it in the boys hand
cragie looks up at kosalas and their eyes meet
lunas van its windshield shot out takes the first corner on two wheels
behind him the police scramble for their blue and whites
half way down the block the van lurches into an alley
the van hurtles down the alley splashing through puddles past the loading docks of a packing company
parked along one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the opening montage
a loading ramp leads to the gaping rear doors
the thieves have done their homework
the luna gang slams up the ramp into the rear of the meat truck
a bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butchers smock pulls several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck
with the van concealed the line of police cars roar splashing by
cragie kneeling over the body looks at kosalas eyeball to eyeball
screams come from within the boys apartment
yelling into the apartment police
stay where you are
they hear footsteps pounding up the front stairs
cragie and kosalas look up
eddie appears at the front of the hall gun drawn
he sees the boy on the hallway floor
he approaches cautiously taking in the body the gun cragie sitting against the wall and the distraught kosalas who stands transfixed by the dead kid
eddie goes to kosalas
take it easy kosalas
the kid didnt dust him
eddie looks at cragie
him or me sarge
pause the kid saw the whole thing
both eddie and cragie look at kosalas
tell him nick
it almost sounds like an order
kosalas looks like hes going to be sick
softly yeah thats how it went down
pause stay here
to cragie take care of your partner
eddie walks away
the gangway is now filled with squad cars ambulances and cops
as the paramedics walk victor comacho to the ambulance bloody bandaged but very much alive he and eddie lock eyes for a brief instant
several ferocious looking comacho relatives have been allowed inside the police lines
one of them steps close to victor
to relative call luis
the lab technicians arrive
the throng of streetwise punks and horrified commuters are across a roped off area
get these people back out of here wouldja
kosalas and cragie are still with the body
the corridor is blocked off by uniformed patrolmen
kosalas is shakey
cragie is tries to calm him down
look its no big thing kid
a friggin dog and pony show
some dumb ass questions by dumb ass bureaucrats
whens the last time you were at the range
crap like that
it was a fuckin accident
why cant you just be stiffens you born yesterday
these aint cops
theyll roast our ass just cause we carry a badge
both of us
menacing we stick together on this kid
were partners right
donato sits on the ground as two paramedics work on his foot
eddie crouches beside him as one medic cuts away donatos ankle boot
aw man dont do that
you know how much these things cost
he gasps as they draw the boot off
donato grabs for eddies hand and squeezes against the pain
a bait shop
dont even need real worms
got those rubber ones you know
yeah what about the winter
we winter in florida
rubber neck the beach bunnies
aw look at that
ruined my brand new fence climbers
hand made in italy
someone points eddie out to partida an attractive no nonsense woman who heads for him
donato sees partida coming
oh fuck partida
im gonna tell her you shot me
the resentment the other cops feel against partida is readily apparent
you were in charge here
does it look like it
partida looks at the covered body nearby
to donato and you were a principal in one of the shootings
a goddamn dr
eddie smiles at donato who with his good foot kicks at the medic bandaging the wound
wheres the officer who was involved in the other shooting
pointing third floor rear
as partida heads for the building another suited civilian comes over to meet her
the civilian escorts a mexican grandmother
the old lady is agitated jabbering in spanish and pointing at the cops
eddie sees this and then is pulled away as he helps one of the medics lift donato and carry him to the ambulance
eddie helps donato into the ambulance
catch you later hopalong
the two comacho lookouts who survived the raid efren and pompas have been brought in for questioning
the interrogation is taking place in a small room
officers brennan and music are here with eddie
the comachos sit silent as stones
to efren you know that efren
when your big bad brother luis gets the word your ass is freeze dried and fried
efren stares ahead
music looks at eddie who is fiddling with the rubics cube to little success
brennan takes musics place
he kicks pompas chair hard
talk you hemorrhoid
in spanish your mother fucks dogs in the street
you wanna tune up
hey sarge you know why a comachos like a cue ball
cause the harder you hit em the better their english gets
its not a joke but a threat
pompas spits at brennan
brennan is enraged but eddie pushes him back with a hand
eddie faces the comachos
were jerking off here
eddie goes out the door
as eddie emerges he bumps into the camachos lawyer sanchez thirty eight well dressed smooth as silk
sanchez sees the tableau in the room
as cusack walks down the hall the attorney follows him
lets cut the shit cusack
eddie ignores him
option you can send em downtown
if judge collins didnt get laid last night you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway
hell set bail
ill take care of it
option release them here and now and well call it a day
pause up to you
i like to see you earn your money
sanchez backs off
we follow eddie down the hall
the head of area four commander kates is grilling cragie and kosalas
we come up the back stairs
we start cleanin the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a automatic
i tell him to drop it but hes comin
we had no choice
kosalas here saw the whole thing
kates turns to kosalas
kosalas looks haggard
i was on another doorway
but you saw the action
i saw him fall

thats the way it went down
and you saw the weapon
nods yes sir
i saw it in his hand

kates looks up from his desk

pause partida has demanded a formal hearing
you will be under oath so the department will provide you with a lawyer unless youve got your own
stands an ops review board member is waiting to talk to you

cragie gets up
kosalas sitting through this interview in stunned silence stands also

kosalas and cragie exit

kates sits sighs suddenly tired
we got a bigger problem

the animals are out of the cages
just what i need
a goddman war
eddie turns to leave
keep track of this business with cragie
the phone rings
ill deal with upstairs
eddie starts to leave again
kates picks up the phone and puts a hand over the mouthpiece
just get me some answers huh
thats my job
kosalas without an attorney is being interviewed by partida
a court stenographer is silently typing
you have the right to remain silent
you have the right to have an attorney present at all times
anything you say may be used against you in a court of law
eddie and kosalas are parked on an airport access road watching private planes land and take off
eddies car a five year old chevy is wreckage
the quarter panels are rusted the radio antenna is a coathanger and when kosalas pushes a tape into the cassette player the windshield wipers start moving
kosalas pops the cassette out the windshield wipers stop he throws the cassette into the glove compartment
but now he cant get the door to stay closed
im going to have to fix that
eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane passing directly overhead
eddie glances at kosalas who looks uncomfortable
you know its kind of interesting
that year old in the hallway with the gun
partida told me he doesnt have a record
the kids never been arrested
yeah well you know if you read the papers cops only shoot honor students
sole support of the family and all that
the airport bristles with corporate jets departing and arriving
lear lima kilo number for landing wind south altimeter two niner niner two
and now comes a mystery jet wearing no company colors banking in over lake point tower and whistling low over the planetarium to a touchdown
the white learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field as an undistinguished buick rolls down the ramp to meet it
eddie and kosalas stand by their car parked across the runway from the learjet
the jets engines shut down the door opens and a grim but handsome man emerges
luis comacho a cruel and uncompromising survivor has arrived
with him is an incredibly beautiful exotic woman
he is met by pompas and efren comacho the two lookouts who survived the raid
and victor comacho who was wounded in the raid is here with his shoulder bandaged
from where eddie and kosalas are standing it is impossible to hear the conversation at the learjet but it is clear that luis comacho is upset
they see luis slap pompas and efren
then he grabs victor by both arms ignoring his wound and screams at him
nice fellow this luis comacho
donato says they call him the angel of death
victor grimaces in great pain and his knees buckle
in the dining room diana luna a pretty year old helps her year old grandmother theresa decorate a happy birthday banner some red and green crepe paper
diana and her grandmother grin at each other
they are done
theresa stands back to admire their work
daddy would you get that
diana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a birthday cake and sets it on the table next to some presents
diana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands over her eyes

she leads her mother to the dining room
molly luna opens her eyes
theresa and diana beam
diana kisses her mother who almost cries

diana hands molly a card from the table

molly heads for the stairs leaving behind the half opened card
but tony why

tony goes to the phone dials gets a busy signal and slams it down
theresa sits down watching sadly
diana goes to stand in front of her father

tony sorts through the closet looking for a jacket
gamiani comes in puffing with a clumsily wrapped present under his arm

victor comacho is alive

diana is really angry at her father ignoring her

he slaps her
she slaps him back turns grabs her purse and runs out
tony watches her go and turns to gamiani

he nods out the door

molly comes down with the bag
tony takes it from her and starts out the door
suddenly he turns back snatches gamianis present from his hands and thrust it at his wife
tony rushes out the door
gamiani goes to the phone
molly is left alone in the doorway
eddie parks in front of his apartment building leaves the car and enters the building
dead on his feet eddie reaches the top of the stairs and an object comes flying at him out of the shadows
odell a slim year old black kid fakes a series of karate kicks at eddie
bow to your master
its been a rough one
y tellin me
we all seen it on the odell
bow to your master
odell takes off
here make yourself crazy
the kid stops and eddie tosses him the rubics cube
eddie nears his apartment we hear a male voice singing
the door is ajar
eddie lives in a modest apartment
fred pirelli a great bear of a man sings at the top of his lungs
he is bent over the space heater tearing it apart
you look like shit
they had a shot on the tube of you guys comin out in front of the building
eddie collapses on the sofa
pissed cause he lost a shoe
pause luis comacho is in town
hell collect himself some scalps before this ones over
your answering machine is on the fritz again
some woman with a fantastic voice was callin about comin over this weekend ta help you with somthin and then the tape went nuts
want somthin to drink
does the pope shit in the woods
is a bear catholic
odell shows in the doorway
eddie gets up and the kid tosses him the rubics cube all done
eddie looks at it and the kid goes into the kitchen
i hate smart ass kids
gonna get down in the s tonight
your pilot light is out
eddie tosses the cube into the waste basket and opens the refrigerator
ive been told that more than once
seriously so who you figure pulled out the rug
eddie comes back into the living room hands a beer and a soda to odell and flops back on the sofa with his own beer
somebody knew what they were doin
they blew the top off an anthill
pirelli reaches for his drink and odell hands him the soda
pirelli grabs the beer before odell can drink and switches
id figure the mob but scalese aint that stupid
sombody put the valve in backwards
pirelli and odell turn to eddie who tries to look innocent but fails
eddie purposefully studies the answering machine on the coffee table in front of him
i aint calling you again
pirelli finishes with the heater and gets up
what was the cubs final score
eddie punches a button on the answering machine
it spews tape across the table
machines just dont like you
pirelli grabs the machine unplugs it and carries it out the door toward his own apartment
maybe i dont like machines
the machine in question looks like a miniature tank
this is the prowler a robot anti terrorist vehicle that is being maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for the citys law enforcement agencies
the prowler is amazingly agile
and its bullhorn voice breaks everybody up
from speaker arretez
do not move
no se mueve
the machines three video eyes searching the crowd independently give it the appearance of an extra industrial bug
one camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends to give it the perspective of a giraffe
the thing seems almost alive
commander kates is here leading a contingent of departmental brass
with them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of city councilmen
the prowler is being put through its paces by the factory engineer
he controls the machine with a pistol grip device that looks like a small tv camera
after the gyros are locked any movement of the hand controller is duplicated by the prowler
he turns his hand to the right and the prowler yards away sweeps its turret to the right aiming the twin calibre machineguns at the politicians
they move aside
this simple control system means that even semi skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training
as they say even a child can operate it
standing with chief kates eddie watches the demonstration with contempt
kates turns to him
hes talking about you cusack
youre all gonna have to be qualified on this
its the future
just what the world needs another gun without a brain
youre looking at the perfect cop
the damn thing follows orders
eddie has seen enough
i got better things to do than play with toys
kates is about to say something when the demonstrator interrupts
if the commander will pick someone to try and elude prowler we can show how our various target acquisition systems function
kates points to eddie and smiles
instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on eddie as he walks across the astro turf
close up of the prowlers hand controller
the monitor screen shows the crosshairs on the back of eddies head
on the screen the digital readout says locked and from speaker bang
eddie keeps walking seemingly oblivious to the prowler
suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the prowlers sight
he pops up with his gun pointed at the prowlers controller
the controller scared shitless drops the hand control
the prowler dies the plug pulled
eddie smiles at kates and exits
the curtain is drawn back from the viewing window and the comachos see the bodies of their cousins
luis is here with pompas efren and victor
their attorney sanchez has joined them
they are speaking spanish
subtitle a war does no good for any of us
it can only make what is bad worse
luis says nothing
he looks through the window at the bodies
finally he speaks
subtitle get them out of here
fix them up
i want them to be beautiful for their mother
he kisses his fingertips and touches the glass
subtitle i promise you my brothers there will be blood for blood
luis comacho storms out of the room into the corridor followed by the others
eddie and kosalas are just entering
victor spots eddie and turns to luis
subtitles this is the cop
the comachos slow down
the two groups survey each other luis hatred oozing from his eyes
and eddie without slowing looks the vicious colombian over with cool contempt
eddie walks by
how much did they pay you to set up my brothers pig
eddie freezes makes a slow turn and meets luis eyes
suddenly eddie moves faster than anyone else can react to and he has luis pinned to the wall choking him
stay off my streets asshole
or ill bite your head off and shit in your neck
he releases luis just as quickly and turns to walk out kosalas backing with him hand on gun
luis gets some air back and starts to scream
subtitle youre meat cop
the other comachos have to restrain him
retired detective hank flannigan runs the high tech morgue where the bodies are stacked on trays like bakery buns
flannigan a trim bespectacled mr
clean clicks his false teeth between thoughts
the body on the exotic lab table is the gunman eddie shot during the raid
eddie is here to confirm the identification
his new partner kosalas is with him very uncomfortable in this setting
eenie verona is the gentlemans name
looks down you did a hell of a job on him
i was motivated
flannigan has already pulled veronas record
he hands it to eddie who passes it on to kosalas without looking at it
kosalas concentrates on the file uneasy with the dead
hes a punk
looks like he graduated
he had a brother in law
they were tight
served time together
eddie looks at kosalas who glances up from the report triumphantly
if i was you id sit on him
you figure hes connected
eddie just smiles
looks like youre gonna be busy cusack
uh you gonna be using those cubs tickets
eddie reaches into his pocket and tosses a ticket to flannigan who grins
eddie and kosalas cruise the rush street area at night
they search the neon lit crowds on the sidewalks for a glimpse of lou gamiani
on a tree shaded block of classic brownstones the unmarked car is parked at the corner
eddie is at the wheel wearing a sportscoat and sweater scanning the sports page
kosalas is nervous and chatty bubbling
hes still reading the records from the morgue
this ganianis a swinger huh
hes just makin up for the time he spent in the joint
lou gamiani italian and huge comes out the front door of a brownstone and gives a perfunctory kiss to his aging playmate who stands in the doorway in a housecoat
gamiani comes down the steps and jumps into a car
in the car with gamiani a fat man tito is at the wheel
they pull into the street passing the unmarked car
trailing gamiani and his partner through the north side neighborhoods they wind up in lincoln park
with considerable skill kosalas and eddie manage to stick to them undetected
gamiani and tito park by the botanical gardens and stroll past the fields of flowers into the zoo
eddie and kosalas follow
they selling protection to the bears
strolling among the baby elephants and fuzzy rabbits the two heavies could not be more out of place
tito has a racing form
lou tall enough to see over heads looks like a loose gorilla on the prowl
he is searching for somebody
surrounding the incubators filled with hatching chicks is a cluster of schoolchildren
they are having a ball
eddie has noticed diana a lovely year old who is in charge of the children
and she has noticed gamiani
shes visibly upset
kinda young for that old fart aint she
just watch kid
diana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer
be back in a minute
she crosses to the two goons and looks up at gamiani
what do you want
your papa worries about you
get out of here lou
leave me alone
gamiani shrugs his pal tito seems embarrassed but they dont move
the children scream and lulu the half ton baboon flies into frame swinging down from the artificial branches of an iron tree in the three story central cage
the children clutch at diana in delightful terror
the gorilla inches away kisses the thick glass that separates them
lulu swings to the upper branches and sits arms crossed staring eyeball to eyeball at her human counterpart gamiani
tito eats popcorn
eddie and kosalas walk behind a mother and child each holding a balloon
diana is on the front steps of the library saying good bye to two of the children from the zoo
she hands them over to their mothers and goes up the steps into the building
gamiani and tito pull over and park down the street
eddie comes around the corner and follows her in
the sign on the door tells us this is the citys special education program office
diana enters the office and confers briefly with another staff member
through the open door of the special education program office eddie observes diana chatting with her co workers
eddie follows as diana walks through the great hall past long tables and out the other door
diana comes down the steps wading through the swarm of homebound commuters and catches a cab
and head and shoulders above the crowd scanning the tops of heads is lou gamiani
tito comes around the corner in his car and pulls up to the curb
gamiani jumps in and they take off after dianas cab
eddie and kosalas follow in eddies car
diana enters an apartment building
by the time diana exits it is dark
she is with a friend and both are in some kind of halloween costume
they catch a cab
the taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building
diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked door
the door opens and they disappears inside
gamianis car cruises past
it pulls up at the corner and its lights switch off
eddies car pulls up
eddie hops out
kosalas slides behind the wheel
eddie leans down to the open drivers window
hold here a second
eddie goes to the back of the car and kosalas follows him in the rearview mirror losing sight when eddie pops open the trunk
kosalas watches the party goers enter the building
there is a tapping at the window
eddie has donned a baseball uniform matching cap and now carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from it
keep with gamiani
eddie tosses the keys back to kosalas and heads to the building
kosalas calls to him
bang a few for me
in the darkened stairway eddie joins a group of outrageously dressed characters
the door at the top of the stairs bursts open on a punk funk art student halloween party
a hundred people are jammed into the studio
it feels like the star wars saloon
the live musicians match the look of the party
the costumes are outrageous
everyone is dancing
eddie looks the place over
he spots diana
eddie walks over to her grabbing a drink along the way
he sidles up to diana
wanna play ball
she looks him over taking in the outfit the bat
are you pitching
some people say ive got a pretty good inside curve
i dont know
you look strictly minor league
i make it eddie the cop
youve had a lot of experience with cops
she is angry now and walks away from him
eddie watches her go and is about to follow
he sets his drink down and turns to find a girl luscious as hell dressed like a fredericks wet dream making eyes at him
she takes his bat and gives it a long lascivious lick
youll get slivers
he walks by her
eddie steps over and around an assortment of wasted witches and gooned out goblins snorting lines on the coffee table to get to diana who is tensely by herself
he grabs her purse
hey what the hell do you think youre doing
i thought you knew all about cops
you dont put anything up your nose do you
eddie searches dianas purse
he find her drivers license
pause youre tony lunas daughter
he drops the license into the purse and hands it back to her
she stares him in the eye defiantly
i dont know where he is and i dont really give a shit
tired when are you people going to realize i dont have anything to do with my father
eddie tries to give her his card
for when you need a friend
she wont take it
ive got all the friends i want
eddie puts the card into her purse
but do you have all the friends you need
she walks away angrily
eddie watches her leave and then steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone on the drug laden coffee table
to phone this is sergeant cusack
i want a team to cover a house on the southwest side
pause l u n a anthony
crazy tony luna
i dont think hes around but if he shows up bring him in
the dope smoking party goers stare at this cop in shock
one of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a magazine
eddie hangs up the phone and pushes past them to the door
nods catch you later
he is out the door
several plainclothes officers some of them women stand on either side of the door with their backs to the wall guns at the ready
one of the men reaches out and pounds on the door
they rush the door and smash it shouting and scrambling into the apartment
from bullhorn awright awright hold it
the instructor kobas walks in criticizing their style
for christs sake
you tryin to get your partner killed jackson
this is not the real thing only practice
the apartment is only a mockup set in the corner of this vast skylit city warehouse
runners race around the track at the perimeter
on the wall are large photos and diagrams of the prowler
below the photos are sign up sheets for the required training sessions
in another corner is the weight room the ring and the workout area
eddie is here working out sparring with a partner who has large padded mits on each hand
brennan and a couple of buddies approach kosalas as he ties his gym shoes
brennan is carrying a petition
he hands it to kosalas and looks around the room
he spots another cop
cragie is in the background putting on his jacket
shouts across the room hey mahoney
i want you to help me get some signatures on this letter for cragie
brennan looks down at kosalas who is hesitating
kosalas looks back at cragie
there eyes meet
cragie comes by and slaps him on the back
way to go partner
we see music talking to several cops working out the exercise machines and getting signatures on cragies petition
eddie gives his sparring partner howard a furious series of blows driving him back
they are kickboxing
lets try the mitts for awhile
he sees cragie cross the gym and exit
as cragie goes out donato comes in on crutches
everybody shouts a greeting
eddie sits down to change gloves and take his footpads off
how ya doing richie
two gs we get a sausage and beef stand stand outside wrigley field
you pass the beef i take the cash
i got a contact downtown
how you gonna watch the game if youre hawking sandwiches
never thought of that
hey i tell you about this nurse i met
talk about physical therapy
the sparring partner returns and eddie goes back to practice
shes got this friend just dying to meet you
brennan comes up to donato and hands him the petition
donato signs quickly
to eddie later partner
eddie nods to him concentrating on the sparring
how about taking the gloves off long enough to sign this for cragie
this about the hearing
angry what the fucks the matter with you
hes burnt brennan and you know it
he was a good cop but he aint now
eddie hits the mit so hard that howard is knocked back a couple of steps
get off your high horse cusack
he made a couple of mistakes ok
the guy was a hero
what the fuck does a bunch of civilians know about comin up some shithouse stairway day after day scared outta your shorts
with a whirling kick eddie knocks the mit right out of the howards hand and across the gym
eddie turns to face brennan nose to nose
were all scared brennan
cragie should have been off the street a long time ago
hes gonna hurt somebody else with his bullshit
maybe even you
eddie goes back to punching
brennan storms out
a funeral cortege makes its way sedately down the street past the comacho owned pool hall
two hearses a flower car a limo and several other cars with funeral stickers on their windshields pass bye
the slain comacho cousins from the raid are being escorted to the cemetery
luis comacho is in the limo along with the woman from the airport
brennan and music are following the procession
brennan is on the radio
to mike the funeral director says they plan on cruisin right past lunas house
tito one of tony lunas bodyguards watches from the steps of lunas porch as a procession of cars follows the hearses slowly up the street
at the end of the block an old man is selling produce to the neighborhood housewives off the tailgate of his truck
they watch the procession in wonder
the cortege passes the unmarked car down the block from tonys house
eddie is watching
kosalas is with him
to radio theyre wastin the show
tonys not even in town
hell get the word
across the street we see another bodyguard joint tito on the front steps
they stand arms folded watching the procession
luis comacho takes a flower and tosses it out the window as he cruises past the two goons
their eyes lock
tito walks up and grinds the flower into the ground with his shoe
brennan and music bring up the rear in their ummarked car
tito the body guard picks up the phone
at the pay phone next to a lakeside bait shop tony luna is getting the word
to phone what the fuck are you talkin about
nobodys gonna touch nothin
just stay put
pause i give a shit about their fuckin parade
a floozy slides up next to him and he puts an arm around her waist
to phone they wanna throw flowers we can fix it so theyre pushing up daisys
the girl joins in like shes supposed to
a tan dodge rolls over the rutted scrapyard roadway bouncing toward the immense old warehouse along the rivers edge
the city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area giant grain elevators rusting freighters and vast scrapyards surround us
pompas and efren comacho drive through the gate and enter the warehouse as the door opens for them
the car halts in the vast empty chamber
it is quickly surrounded by members of the comacho family
they begin to unload the car
the trunk is filled with cases of heavy ammunition
at the back of the warehouse other comachos are test firing their weapons
luis is directing things as they are preparing for battle
the weaponry spread on the table is astonishing
eddies beat up chevy is parked beyond the line of yachts toward the end of the pier
eddie gets out of the car
kosalas looks worried
i can back you up
stay by the radio
eddie walks to the foot steel cruiser tied to the end of the pier
eddie walks up the gangplank
an ape in a suit rocco appears
what the hell you doin here
rocco goes for eddie
a couple of quick blows and rocco is in the water
eddie continues up the gangway to the rear of the boat
eddie finds felix the rail scalese sitting on a chaise lounge reading
a beautiful girl lays on her stomach on a deck pad typing at a personal computer terminal
scalese looks up at eddie
he is momentarily discombobulated but recovers
referring to computer the modern ages answer to the crystal ball
if you know how to read it
if you have some extra cash buy oranges
the price is low and i can promise you the threatened trucking strike will be avoided
we talking about a bribe scalese
its a prediction
another beautiful bikinied girl comes by and gives scalese a tall cool drink
i wouldnt try to bribe eddie cusack
he drops the name with a smile
eddie doesnt react
i hear they call you stainless steel on the street
me i think youre a fuckin pain in the ass
frowning its not a compliment
im looking for your nephew
tony lunas none of your business
tony just made himself my business
no he didnt
we take care of our own
just like the cops
just like the comachos
eddie sits down next to scalese and looks him in the eye
he shit on my turf old man
and im going to nail him and anybody else tied to him
you understand felix
with cool rage nobody threatens felix scalese
softly its not a threat
its a prediction
on the shore kosalas is honking the car horn to get eddies attention
theres a shitstorm coming
you better get yourself a good umbrella
the girl at the computer terminal watches him leave
eddie walks by as rocco soaking wet is pulling himself from the water
eddie pushes him into the water again
kosalas is still sounding the horn
eddie runs toward the car
a body lies in the flowers in the service area next to the giant greenhouse
several unmarked cars and two blue and whites are parked in the dirt drive as eddie and kosalas pull up
the cops have roped off the area
music and brennan are there
eddie looks at the body as music comes over
tony lunas bagman
kosalas looks at the body
they call that a columbian necktie
they found the manager of tonys restaurant hanging from a hook in his kitchen
looked like someone tried to carve a canoe out of him
tonys used car lot on ashland is burning as we speak
the head salesman is a fried zuccini
eddie stands to one side
a kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree lined street tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block
around the corner at the end of the block the produce truck starts slowly forward
as it turns onto lunas block a car pulls up behind it and stops blocking the street
the produce truck parks at the curb in front of the luna house
a neighbor from across the street approaches
the front door of lunas house opens and tito emerges helping tonys aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables
on the floor near the wheelwell is the dead produce man
the rear doors of the produce truck swing open
the neighbor tito and tonys mother are instantly killed
from outside three comachos enter the open front door of the luna house
we hear the sound of muffled gunfire from inside
bits and pieces
a shattered orange juice container
eggs cooking on the stove
a womans vanity
on the floor a womans legs a housecoat slippers
a silhouette of a comacho in the hallway raking one of tonys guards
a family photo on the mantle which includes diana and her father is blasted to bits
one of tonys men tries to escape through the back of the house
he is pursued by a comacho who guns him down
luis comacho sits in a car in the next block surveying the scene
the cousins are walking briskly out
they jump in a car and drive off
luis nods to his driver
they pull away
the street is quiet again
next door a neighbor wearing only his underpants and carrying an old pistol stands trembling in disbelief
pines reflect in the dappled lake as tony luna rows slowly for shore
he ties up at the dock
hes taking his tackle out of the boat when one of his boys comes running down to the dock
we cannot hear the conversation but we can see tony drop the tackle box and we can hear his scream echo across the water
eddie runs down the rear stairs to kosalas unmarked car
he opens the drivers door pushes kosalas across the seat and gets behind the wheel
he peels out
musics at the scene
eddie picks up the mike
to mike was there a girl
on radio two male caucasians two female
one mid to late forties
the other a grandmother
with the siren full out leaning on the horn he simply puts his foot on the floor and sends the car into a four wheel drift that slides into a
neat u turn
eddie leaves the car running and burst through the main entrance flashing his badge at the stunned security guards
eddie races through the corridors and reading rooms searching kosalas arriving at his heels
gamiani tells diana about her mother and grandmother
three comachos pompas efren and angel search for diana
lou gamiani emerges from the building with diana
she is terrified
he checks out the scene then descends the crowded steps and crosses the street keeping a sharp lookout
luis and victor comacho loiter by the outdoor flower stand next to the library
they watch the activity on the library steps
distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers lou fails to notice the two comachos who have fallen in step behind them
he goes down with a gasp almost silently a knife sticking from his back
a comacho grabs dianas arm
she jabs him in the eyes and runs
diana disappears into the crowd
hysterical citizens scatter in all directions
a woman stands in horror unable to keep from looking at gamianis body lying on the sidewalk
eddie and kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the museum
the girl isnt here
eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block under the el station
he dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic screeching to a halt
kosalas flags down a blue and white and barks for backup then tears out after eddie
in the shadow of the el tracks diana runs for her life racing north on wabash through crowds of shoppers with the comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind
opposite marshall fields she abruptly cuts across traffic and runs into an alley between the giant mens and womens stores
with terror in her eyes diana runs searching frantically for a guard a policeman somebody with a gun
but the comachos are closing in on her
she dives through a revolving door into the building
diana runs past the perfume displays notions and lingerie and out the randolph street exit
two camachos who stayed on the street spot her as she leaves
racing through the alley eddie spots them running in the next block
running east on lake street she glances over her shoulder
she doesnt see them
she ducks into the alley
but the comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of her
this alley leads to the lower level of michigan avenue
she turns back to find the exit blocked by the comachos
she flees downward
the green flourescents of the emerald city give a deathly cast to the underground street as diana rounds the corner and collapses against the wall
her heart pounding like a frightened deer she has run as far as she can
pompas comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around the corner
they spot her crouched against the wall
she starts to scream but angel grabs her by the collar and pulls her up to his face and she stops wide eyed with terror as he touches her throat
with his knife
come on chika
we gonna have some fun
you gonna take us to your father
we hear a loud metallic click
we see the barrel of a huge revolver
they wheel to see eddie crouched gun drawn in the alley entrance
pompas youre getting to be a fucking pain in the ass
the boys put their hands up but eddie doesnt see the third samo coming up behind him
angel grabs diana by the hair shielding himself and starts backing up the stairs that lead to the street
let her go pooch
samo jumps eddie and the gun goes flying
it hits the pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street
in a staggering blur eddie takes out the comachos kicking the last one end over end
but angel and the girl have disappeared to the street above
eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps
with a knife at her side angel comacho leads diana up the steps of the old el station
they pass through the turnstyle out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in
angel forces her onto the train
eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just in time to stop the closing train door with his foot
eddie wedges his way aboard and the train pulls out
the passengers looks at him like hes crazy
eddie works his way through the cars toward the rear
angel spots him
knife still in hand he pulls diana from car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is cornered at the end of the train
angel searches frantically for a way out
diana sees him
another step and i take her head off
you dont have the balls
eddie takes another step
diana slams her elbow into angels groin and breaks free
angel jumps back
he breaks open the rear door and climbs out
angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof
eddies right behind him
the spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the speeding el train is witnessed by startled second floor secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof
of the passing cars
angel and eddies figures appear as specks roaring through the canyon of skyscrapers
a low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train
eddie recovers first and grabs angel pulling him down
they roll from side to side on the roof nearly slipping over the side
with a desperate shove angel breaks free
eddie points his gun at him
the train is now over the chicago river
angel dives into the water
eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him
we see dianas looking out the window of the train
she follows eddies decent with her eyes
dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as eddie swims toward angel bobbing in the middle of the stream
a hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and angel is directly in his path
the skipper showing off for his passengers doesnt notice him until he hears the sickening thunk under the keel
the boats wake is suddenly red with blood
eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby
he stands there soaking wet looking around
a crowd is gathering
we hear sirens in the background
then he spots her
diana is standing on the bridge watching him
eddie walks to diana and she folds into his arms
he holds her a second
eddie now in dry clothes and diana walk along the lagoon
they talk argue and she sits on a bench and cries
eddie comforts her
where are you taking me
then im gonna place you in protective custody
the hell you are
youll be safe ill take my chances
note ad lib dialogue throughout scene for possible later use
note radio newscast describing the luna killings can be mixed with the above dialogue
eddie and diana climb the stairs
the doorbell buzzes repeatedly
shouts keep your goddamn pants on
pirelli padding across the floor in his shorts looks like a bear called out of hibernation
he has a service revolver in his hand
he peers through the peep hole then unbolts the door
this your idea of a social call
eddie enters with diana
fred pirelli this is diana
pirelli reacts to the name
diana is in a daze close to shock
pirelli takes her and leads her to the couch
lets get you off your feet
eddie motions him aside
can you put her up till i find her old man
does a bear
am i putting you on the spot
i spent years on the spot
what ever you need
eddie starts to go and diana reacts suddenly frightened
ill be right across the hall
im just gonna clean up
eddie falls fully clothed onto the mattress
the phone rings
he rolls over in disbelief staring at the ceiling
it rings and rings again and again and again
he finally picks it up
this is the after hours watering hole for the police force and half the cops weve seen so far including cragie are clustered at the bar or playing darts at
the back of the room
there are a half a dozen women there also
three of them are cops
kosalas is here too
hes been drinking
he leans against the wall talking on the pay phone by the mens room
to phone say eddie
why don you come by and tip a few
pause cause i gotta talk to you
pause yeah i know
but we gotta talk
pause yeah at mikes
he hangs up and heads back to his table passing officer music at the bar
you oughta crash man
you had a helluva day
two tough looking guys are watching the entrance to the bar from a car parked across the street
we can hear the noise from the bar
love it flash
gonna be a slide
easy in easy out
just a quick and dirty
yeah yeah nothin to it
you know the drill
they check their weapons
everybody but kosalas is having a good time
donato flanked by two girls foot up on a chair entertains a small crowd
he picks her up on forty third and hes takin in
she says say baby

an she pulls back her skirt
so the dumb shit climbs in the back an takes a piece
starts to chuckle an leaves the keys in the front and locks the two of em in the squad
and he hasta kick out the window see an she starts screamin rape
an they charge him with rape an every other fuckin thing in the book
internal affairs is gonna give him a kayak and a lantern an put him out in the lake
a group laughs at the story
there is a stillness at the front door
one of the hoods from outside steps in
he wears a leather coat
the heads at the bar turn
he walks the length of the bar and enters the john
he is obviously out of place in this saloon
nobody has both hands on the bar
the front door opens
the other hood steps in walks up to the bar and orders
gimme a black russian and a courvoisier
the first hood comes out of the bathroom and walks up to the bar
suddenly he whips a sawed off shotgun from under his coat
get your hands up motherfuckers
this is a ho thirty hammers click
thirty guns are drawn
the room is frozen
only the jukebox makes a sound
the two hoods eyes fixed on the array of iron pointed at them cant even swallow
to partner you stupid motherfucker
the cops swarm the hoods and in an instant they are on the floor being cuffed and roughly handled
kosalas is at the end of the bar frozen his gun still in his holster
eddie gets out of his car and heads for the front door
the place is in an uproar everybody doubled up with laughter as the two luckless hoods handcuffed together are lying on the filthy tavern floor under a table
they continue to berate each other
my old lady tol me you was fucked up in the head
do i listen
piece o cake you say
snap you say
nothin to it you say
shut up over there
donato spots eddie and calls to him
and this is
she works for a proctologist
marlene swats at him
i got a proposition for you
not now donato
but just let me plant two words in your brain
eddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where kosalas sits hunched over a drink the only man in the room not laughing
he looks up whens eddie pulls over a chair
eddie nods and kosalas signals the waitress
there is a long beat at kosalas fidgets and eddie waits
looks like im caught between the rock and the hard place sarge
eddie just looks at him
you know i really wanted to be a good cop but
its hard enough sometimes just to stay alive
comes so easy to you
you got all the fuckin answers
me im still tryin to find the questions
eddie is still silent
kosalas takes a swig of his beer and finally blurts is out
cragie planted the gun on the kid
just wasted him and then i
i dont know what to do about the hearing tomorrow
tell the truth
its all so nothin for you
if i talk straight every cop on the force will shit on me
if i dont
cragie gets away with murder
and the chance to do it again
next time he might take away a cop
that make any difference
hes my partner
your partners selling you out kosalas
he kills an unarmed kid and now hes risking your ass to save his own
it was a mistake
it cost an innocent kid his life
i know that
i know that
he is too loud and attracts attention
i see that kids face every time i close my eyes
tell em like it is nick
ill back you up
eddie gets up and walks away
the two amateur holdup men are being hustled out to the paddy wagon as eddie heads for the door
someone grabs his arm
its cragie a little drunk
nice to see you out with the boys for a change sarge
they tell me my sergeant wouldnt sign for me
you want to tell me why
you know why
gently you were a good cop for a lot of years
youve passed your limit now cragie
where do you get off
right about here
eddie walks out the door
eddie buzzes the door
pirelli opens it
he lets eddie in scans the hall and closes it
pirelli sets down his gun and pours eddie a cup of coffee
shes havin a bad night
gave her a shot of brandy
maybe shell sleep
giving liquor to a minor pirelli
he turns to leave
ill be back right after the hearing tomorrow and you can get some sleep then
eddie cracks the door and peeks in
diana sits on the bed a lonely forlorn figure
she looks at eddie and tries a smile that fails
eddie walks over to sit on the bed next to her
she falls apart and lies down on the verge of crying collapsing so that her head rest in eddies lap
they are quiet like that for a moment she curled into a ball eddie stroking her hair
what do you do when you dont have anyone
you find someone
she looks up at him
hold me for a while
eddie lays on the bed beside her
she curls up in his arms and closes her eyes
eddies eyes remain open
the civilian review board is in the office of professional standards
the panel consists of eight civilians
it is a real cross section of the city of chicago
leon partida chairs the proceedings
we recognize several faces from the opening bust
an old mexican woman is on the stand facing the panel
cragie sits at a table with his representative facing the officials
a female panel member is questioning the old woman
how far were you standing from where your grandson was shot mrs
the question must be translated by a bumbling clerk the old woman answers in spanish then the answer is translated
in the next doorway
the room is packed
in addition to the police officers character witnesses and friends of the dead kid there are a dozen reporters
eddie enters and looks over the scene
he nods to donato sitting at the rail with his foot propped up
how you doin sarge
whats the score
nods toward witness kids grandmother says cragie threw down the pistola
eddie takes a seat
officer cragie is called back to the witness stand
to steno officer cragie has already been sworn
pause officer cragie you have heard mrs
murillios testimony yes sir
cragie is neat as a pin humble cooperative to a fault
you have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in her grandsons hand
he feigns compassion
im not saying the woman would make this up
but theres no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark
pause like you said shes the boys grandmother
if it was dark officer how were you sure vega had a gun
we were lucky
there was a glint of light a reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon
a carload of comachos including luis cruises down the street and parks in the alley next to eddies building
the hearing is in recess and the hall is filled with smokers and coffee drinkers
eddie is getting a busy signal on the pay phone
you think hell get a pass
you heard it all
what do you think
if the hearing was over id have to put my money on the old lady
smiles but kosalass next
my bets on cragie
the kid may surprise you
eddie dials the number again
still a busy signal
pirelli has eddies answering machine plugged in and is tinkering with the insides
diana comes into the living room toweling her wet hair just out of the shower but in her street clothes
kosalas is on the witness stand
and right after you heard officer cragies gun discharge what did you do then
i immediately advanced down the hall
and what did you see
the deceased vega lying on the floor
officer cragie was checking his vital signs
what happened then
we recovered a
calibre automatic from the teenagers right hand
did you see that weapon in vegas hand before officer cragie fired
cragie leans back
a ripple is felt in the crowd
the reaction of the boys relatives delayed by translation is one of outrage
no more questions
as kosalas steps down he keeps his eyes on the floor ahead of him avoiding eye contact
eddie leans back in his seat
a couple of people get up and head for the door
eddie gets to his feet and heads for the door
partida hits the gavel
id like to now call sergeant cusack
eddie halts with his hand on the knob
pirelli works on the answering machine but the phone is reconnected
diana is looking at photographs on the wall
you made that uniform look good
pirelli looks up
that good looking gorilla next to me is eddies father
better than good cop
killed in the line of duty
pause another cop shot him
he goes back to the machine
the comachos come up the stairs led by luis
they stop at eddies door
they pull out their guns and kick the door in
across the hall pirellis door opens and pirelli holding his pistol steps into the hall
the comachos turn and fire blasting pirelli back into his apartment
through the open door we see diana dash across the living room
luis and his men burst in
diana runs for the phone
a comacho takes it from her and rips it from the wall
diana is caught by two comachos
eddie is on the witness stand
i cant comment on that
it was over before i got there
you are his superior officer are you not
cragies in my unit yes
did you give the men their various assignments
did you request that officer cragie be on your tac team
no i didnt
partida lifts a document from the table
i have here a department document dated september of last year
it is a request by you to your superiors to have officer cragie transferred to another unit
are you familiar with this document
the room listens to every word
why did you request his transfer
maybe years is too long for anyone to look at the citys guts mr
what happened to this request
it was denied
partida lifts another document
this is a letter of support for officer cragie
hands it to him everyone in his unit signed it but you
eddie glances over the letter and hands it back
i dont agree with what it says
are you saying you do not believe officer cragie is fit to work the streets of chicago
thats what im saying
the reporters are clustered around eddie as he emerges but he walks past them back to the pay phone
he puts in a quarter and dials
the cops in the corridor are passing the word about eddies testimony discussing it in little clusters
their appearance is frightening
eddie dials another number
to phone i just dialed and i get this funny buzz
check the line for me
cragie backed up by a couple of buddies comes up to him
seems to me the mans got his tongue stuck to his asshole cragie
hey that dont bother him
hes the fuckin white knight
to eddie you wanna take on the whole world by yourself
now youre gonna get your chance sarge
they walk down the hall
from phone sorry sir that number seems to be out of service
ive reported it
eddie drops the phone
eddie races down the hallway past hostile clusters of former friends
roaring north on the boulevard without regard to traffic eddie speeds toward his house in his rattling chevy
eddie rockets through the red lights leaning on his horn
eddie runs up the stairs and slows when he sees odell
the boy is sitting on the floor head in his hands crying
just past odell several uniformed policemen are standing over pirellis body
they step back as eddie approaches
he was a friend of yours wasnt he
eddie hurries to the bedroom and back
he rushes out of the apartment
eddie runs for the chevy and peels away from the curb
eddie is on the radio speeding west on diversey parkway
to mike squad this is
i need a backup
have and from tac meet me at the billiard parlor on th near halsted
music is standing on a streetcorner talking to a couple of hookers
down the street brennan waits in their unmarked car
from speaker and unit requesting assistance at the poolroom on th street near halsted
questioning a suspect
brennan picks up the mike
to mike ten four dispatch
music returns to the car and gets in
i could use a cup of coffee
eddie squeals to a stop hops out of the car starts for the pool hall
eddie enters the poolhall
the place is busy
everybody in sight is either mean or ugly
eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him
the pool players not connected with this confrontation take one look at him hang up their cues and split
eddie heads for the back of the room
a pair of heavyweights fall in behind him
one of them grabs eddie
hey you aint got no business back there
i want your opinion ill beat it out of you
eddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid step and they go down like gut shot rhinos
he heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path
he steps up to the door in back and kicks it in
a startled camacho degas looks up straw in hand with a line of coke on a mirror on his desk
where is luis
get the hell out of here
eddie grabs degas by the hair and starts slamming his face into the mirror which shatters with every blow
talk to me degas or ill hit you with so many lefts youre gonna beg for a right
he holds up degas head to look him in the eye
blood and cocaine stain the mans face
hes coming here
hes on his way
eddie lifts the head once and gives degas one punch in the face that sends him ass over teakettle across the floor
beneath the lighted map of area the police dispatcher trying to raise eddies backup
we need a verification on a back up for unit
the dispatcher at the next panel overhears the call
thats cusack right
first dispatcher nods
good luck finding a backup for that character
eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room
a dozen comacho goons have gathered
behind them are another two dozen hostile spectators
but no sign of the backup
he pulls out his gun
the remaining innocent bystanders split for the exit
eddie walks forward into the room
the comachos and their soldiers stand around him
several have guns
eddie keeps them under the point of his gun
he gets to the door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his sights
a gun is pressed into eddies back
he drops his gun
luis kicks eddie across the room
eddie lands at the feet of the gang
take him apart
eddie springs to his feet and in the same motion decks his nearest attacker
the battle is on
hardwood pool cues crack around him
the first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on him
battered and broken they litter the billiard tables and floor
but eddie is outnumbered to
cragie and kosalas sit at the bar
the tv is off and the few customers pay attention to the police monitor
from radio request verification for backup for unit
patrol are you in the area
from radio squad
were having vehicular problems
not able to respond
kosalas looks ashamed
two uniformed police sit in a cruiser
from radio need backup at th and halstead
one cop turns to the other
coming at eddie now from all sides the comachos wear into him
finally they begin to connect
blind sided he goes down and they are on him like jackals
they drag him to the top of the rear stairs and kick him down to the alley
it seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly all is quiet
the crowd parts
eddie looks up through swollen eyes to see luis comacho standing above him cool as ice
luis reaches down and pulls eddies head up by the ear
the sun comes up
you give me luna or the girl dies slow
luis kicks him in the face
eddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings
he moves a joint at a time checking himself out
staggering to his feet he opens a spiggot on the wall
he lets the cold water wash over his head
donato hobbles through the deserted pool hall his pistol in his hand
donato comes out the back door of the poolhall and finds eddie sitting on his haunches and resting against a wall between two garbage cans
i would have been here sarge
they kept it from me
youre ok hopalong
donato holsters his gun and helps eddie to his feet
listen im havin a drink with this friend of mine name of mickie
she works on a computer over in the federal building fbi
i got here as soon as i heard
they got diana luna
thats what im tryin to tell ya
mickie told me she read on the wire tony lunas comin into union station at ten tonight
eddie runs down the alley toward his car
eddies car pulls up
he gets out and runs inside
a train sits at the platform
tony luna is walking down the platform
eddie runs through the cavernous lobby
eddie arrives in time to see tony step into a waiting cadillac that immediately takes off
eddie races up the ramp to his car
eddie jumps into his car and roars away in pursuit of the cadillac
tony settles in and then sees scalese sitting calmly in the back seat
surprised hello felix
tony moves for his gun
the hood next to tony relieves him of his gun using his own for persuasion
sighs you see tony
you make no sense
you start a war
youre like a kid tony
youre a bad boy
tony is scared
the driver spots something in the rearview mirror
the cadillac rockets through the empty orange lighted canyons of the financial district with eddie in hot pursuit
roaring north on wacker past an astonished group in front of the civic opera house the cadillac drops out of sight on the down ramp to lower wacker
this bi level street is as different as night and day
the lower levels eerie green lights make us feel like were under water
iron girders and concrete pillars support the street above
the cadillac races through this vast man made cavern past the sub level loading docks and service entrances of skyscrapers above
city work crews and all night commercial deliveries dot both the upper and lower levels of the chase
eddie is gaining in the battered chevy
the cadillac rockets up the next ramp to the street level
the cadillac zooms up from below crosses the intersection and immediately takes the next down ramp
eddie flies up from below briefly airborne barreling after them into the tunnel
a block later the cadillac heads topside again
eddie takes a gamble and goes straight ahead
at the next down ramp the cadillac descends and tonys boys find themselves doing knots side by side with eddie in the other lane
in the narrow concrete tunnel the two cars battle each other like bulls in a chute each one trying to cut the other off bouncing from each other into the
walls and back again
the goon next to luna is trying to get a shot off at eddie
this sonovabitch is crazy
tony sees his chance and he lunges for the gun
in the struggle the gun goes off and drills rocco the driver through the side of the head
the cadillac roars out of control its dead drivers foot pressing the accelerator to the floor
scalese in the front seat tries to grab the wheel
eddie is all over the road trying to avoid them
the river and the curve are ahead
scaleses car hits the median at high speed rolls and slides screaming into a concrete pillar and explodes
eddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the flaming wreckage
eddies car is on fire now and the doors have been rammed shut
he kicks the window out on the passenger side
eddie runs for his life
the explosion knocks him to his knees
he gets up and moves away looking back at lunas and scaleses spectacular funeral pyre
the fire engines and police cars are arriving from every direction
with the flames still lighting his face eddie is making a call
you tell luis i got tony luna for him
get me a time and place
diana is in bad shape
she is tied up
numb with terror she listens not comprehending as the comachos discuss their plans for her in spanish
luis comes over to her and with his knife begins cutting off part of her clothes
your cop friend is smart
too smart and he dies
then i take care of you personally
eddies car is totally ablaze
he walks past the streaming hoses and slips into a parked blue and white its mars lights still flashing
he roars off
the giant door opens and a lone blue and white pulls in and parks
the place is deserted except for the duty officer who sits in his tiny office watching television with his half naked girlfriend
eddie enters silently glances into the duty office and heads to the other end of the large hall
in the background we see the practice apartment set the boxing ring and several special task force undercover vehicles seen before
eddie opens his locker and takes out his sawed off automatic shotgun
he checks the action
he loads it
he fills a duffle bag with ammo and drops in another gun
he closes the locker and heads out
the duty officer is still occupied
eddie eases past him and checks the key board at the desk
he finds what hes looking for
he lifts a set of keys from the hook
from inside we hear the sound of a truck starting
this city garbage van an immense blue semi trailer is moving south on the dan ryan at incredible speed pushing traffic out of the way like a battleship slicing through
eddie is at the wheel
among the dockside ruins of the old facility luis carefully checks his snipers and lookouts
shouting in spanish he directs them into position
from the distance we see a signal from the comacho stationed at the top of a huge grain elevator overlooking the calumet harbor
the place is in chaos
he joins the crowd gathered in the center of the facility
brennan and cragie are here
so is music
commander kates has just arrived
what the hell is goin on
cusack made off with a truckload of armour
shakes his head hes a fucking one man army now
whatd i tell ya
the sonofabitch is crazy
kosalas wanders through the wreckage
he is stunned
he is starting to wake up
no more games
the men all look at him silently
kosalas turns on them
i cant swallow this shit
eddie cusacks out there takin on the world by himself
and you fuckin heros are gonna sit on your goddamn asses
he is mad and loud
cool it kid
dont you fuckin tell me to cool it
i wont cool it
im not going to fuckin lie for you any more
to kates i lied commander
he laid a gun on that kid
i saw the whole thing
you little fuckin bastard
cragie jumps at kosalas but kosalas is ready for him and braces cragie against the wall
with one hand kosalas slams cragie again and reaches down with his free hand lifting cragies pants leg and extracting a drop gun from its concealed holster
whats this for partner
your next fuck up
kates steps in and separates them
to the others get someone in the air
were gonna find cusack
diana now hanging from her wrists like a slab of beef is guarded by a couple of luis boys eyeing her hungrily
subtitles take off the gag
i want them to hear her
luis scans the daybreak sky
he and efren take up positions
above them and around them every line of fire is covered
from the lookouts pov atop the towering grain elevator we see several garbage trucks moving in and out of an adjacent dump
one of them seems familiar to us
eddies eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly alongside a rusting freighter
he stops and gets out
eddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp
here we go partner
he picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads out
the comachos are ready and waiting
luis walks through the middle of the vast empty plant toward the front checking on his troops one last time
against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next crouched low advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the dock
he lays down his duffle and pulls out a halliburton case
he opens it
from inside the garbage truck we hear an engine starting
it revs a couple of times
and from within the container compartment of the truck emerges the prowler
it clatters down the ramp
the lookout spots the prowler moving down the dock
he cant believe his eyes
he sights on the machine and fires
and in the distance the prowler senses the insult and immediately turns its camera eye up to him
the lookout fires again
immediately the turret swivels and the twin machineguns roar
its a long way down
the sound of machinegun fire from outside galvanizes the comachos
luis runs through the long building toward the front with half a dozen of his men all shouting
eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the prowlers hand controller
on the monitor we can see the comachos running out in the front of the factory from the camera on top of the prowler
eddie gets up and moves toward the factory
he looks up at several high broken windows
the prowler is having a field day
its electronic sensors trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding scenery and several comachos to pieces
but eddie has not figured out how to control the prowlers bullhorn voice command system
it continues to bark orders to the dead hoodlums in three languages
luis runs through the empty plant toward the office screaming to dianas guards
do it now
diana tied to the chair is momentarily alone as the guards rush out to the floor of the factory to see whats happening
the two guards their guns flying from their hands are hammered back into the room by eddie who blasts through the door after them
diana is petrified
kosalas and kates are in the same car
kosalas is driving
from radio harbor patrol reports gunfire and explosions in the vicinity of calumet harbor
kosalas spins the wheel into a u turn
the prowler rolls around the corner its brutal turret bristling with firepower
it is driving luis and the other stupefied comachos further back into the building
eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller
the comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank with automatic fire
but they are no match
two continuous streams of hot lead chew up the place splintering the loading dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the structure churning the comachos to hamburger
eddie goes down and the prowler hand controller falls to the ground shattered
the prowler goes berserk spraying death in a degree circle until all the ammo is gone
eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg
its not serious
it appears everyone is out of ammunition
but a few comachos are still hidden in the factory
eddie is after them like a tiger
victor shoulder still bandaged never has a chance
he goes down battered and broken
but luis has crept up behind eddie
he jumps over a steel plate
hes going for diana a long knife in his hand
eddie reaches for a reload
puts it in his magnum
aims and blows luis away just as he reaches for diana
across the littered battlefield eddie escorts diana toward the light streaming through the factory entrance
he takes off his jacket and wraps it around dianas shoulders
the pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every second
a fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the prowlers incendiary ammunition
the bodies of the comachos lying everywhere astound the arriving home team
officer kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car
brennan and music are running down the dock
donato a cast on his leg hobbles after them
emergency vehicles are arriving and more squad cars paddy wagons and fire engines
eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance now carrying diana
kates calls out after him
eddie stops slowly turns around
there is a long pause
im glad you dont follow orders
eddie hands diana over to the waiting medics who put her in the ambulance
we pull back further and further until we see the rest of the home team
the ambulance carrying diana pulls away with its lights flashing
eddie walks down the pier alone
