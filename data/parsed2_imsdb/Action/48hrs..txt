unknown draft writers endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway
a road gang clearing brush by the side of the road
twenty five men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid afternoon labor
flank the working prisoners
mountie hats shotguns sidearms sunglasses they look like they mean it
a battered pickup appears
suddenly it coughs shudders stalls
a big blackfoot indian named billy bear gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle
then he begins walking toward the road gang
brady is the guard near the center of the work gang he smiles at the oncoming man pokes a prisoner beside him
wonder what reservation they let him off of
the prisoner is ganz who looks up grins at brady
yeah there goes the neighborhood
brady laughs as billy bear closes in on him
say buddy my engines overheating and i got miles before the next station
could i get some water out of your cooler
ganz leans on his hoe speaks as billy passes
maybe you shoulda stole a better truck tonto
you got a real big mouth convict
its okay chief
hes just joking
how about the water
is that what you
billy whirls swings at ganz
both men roll to the ground
seeing the commotion they run toward it
as they struggle billy slips a pistol into ganz hand
thats a state prisoner asshole
brady pulls billy away from ganz just as one of the other officers arrives
ganz suddenly whips out a pistol shoots brady at point blank range
before the other guards can even react billy comes out with his own pistol caps the second guard
still forty yards away
in mid draw be howls as a bullet from ganz breaks the nearby ground
he fires then turns and runs for the prison bus
smiling fires twice
but the range is too great for pistol work
then they all scatter in different directions
hefts his weapon
he and the big indian run to the pickup climb in and roar away
the third guard making a call on the police radio
apo unit to apo t apo t unit to apo
go ahead unit
escape in progress
two officers shot off rail crossing
two men one six four pounds dark an indian the other albert ganz five ten
several miles from the escape
a big semi parked by the side of ttie road back doors to the closed trailer open
a station wagon parked across the road
the pickup appears approaches the semi slows down and drives up the ramp into the van
ganz and billy jump out shove the ramp up inside the truck and close the big doors
ganz and billy climb inside ancl roar off back in the direction of the road gang
takes off his hat puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses
get ready to duck
ganz dives for the floor
three police cars go by sirens blaring lights flashing
they pass the road gang
ganz reappear smiles
you know something
im having a real good time
the station wagon blasts down the pavement
becomes a small dot on the landscape
the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge pistol jack cates s
a large and powerful man
he stealthily moves up a stairwell
he stops at the top of the stairs
listens gun still ready
a continuous sound of running water
cates moves toward the bathroom
rips the door open
the shape behind the shower curtain freezes
cates gun held level moves forward
rips the shower curtain open
revealing a young and very beautiful woman elaine marshall
inspector jack cates s
and youre wanted
elaine stares at him as cates turns off the water
what am i wanted for
i dont answer questions i ask em
a moment as she continues to stare at his pistol
i dont think your guns loaded
this is a
magnum the most powerful handgun in the world
you gotta ask yourself just one question
are you feelin lucky
i still dont think its loaded
elaine shakes her head and smiles folds her arms over her breasts shivers a little
cates looks at the cylinder spins it
hey youre right
thats the way i see it too
be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink embraces her
im all wet
whats wrong with that
they both smile
cates in bed with elaine
she wears his shirt
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
whatd you do
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b id just poured him
then i tried to deck the sucker
i guess he got the message
then i sit back and i think i mean whos to say im not a dumb bitch
i work in a bar right
i cant read a list of my academic credentials to every booze hound that comes in the place
you are what you do
positive self image problem all over again
you are who you decide you are unless youre the type that lets assholes decide for you
arent you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit
but just because i think its bullshit doesnt mean i dont know something about it
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ill take brutal indifference
hey you know what i really think
tell me im dyin to hear it
i think youre ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear
you pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best pina coladas ive ever had
i think that if you need bigger and better things
then go for em
she smiles at him after this
it looks like theyll kiss
their faces are close
then she lightly moves back
you oversimplify every
he stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her then pulls back
some things are simple right
their faces are very close
but they dont touch for another second
tugs churning across the bay
quiet city streets
parked cars covered with early morning dew
a newspaper truck slowly grinds by drops a bundleand moves on
the station wagon pulls up to a young punk henry wong on a motorcycle
billy bear smiles and leans out the drivers side window
you got somethin for us henry
henry produces some credit cards
billy passes them to ganz for inspection
how hot are they
hey theyre not even room temperature
ganz snorts derisively
how ya doin
we got a lot to talk about
yeah old times
well follow you
take it slow okay
ganz pockets the credit cards as henry wheels away
i want to drive awhile
i aint tired yet
maybe after we get done with him im gonna buy us some girls
whaddya mean buy
ganz stares at billy
i never paid for it in my life
its better when you pay
they let you do anything
they always let me do anything
i dont want to pay for it
i never paid for it in my life
just do what i say okay
well pay for the girls and have a good time
dont you trust me
sure i trust ya
they drive off
first light breaks over telegraph hill
a quiet row of victorian townhouses now converted into apartments
cates is sprawled across the double bed elaine is on the verge of falling off the edge
cates eyes snap open
a second later his wrist watch alarm goes off
he turns it off gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants
elaine sits up in bed still wearing cates blue shirt
cates picks up a robe as elaine gets out of bed on the opposite side throws the robe to elaine
she takes off the shirt swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to jack
you know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place
he buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen
cates brushing his teeth at the sink elaine making coffee
you know thats my toothbrush jack
he keeps brushing
maybe you ought to buy me one
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back
he stops brushing turns and looks at her
and ive been coming back for quite awhile
lets not hassle okay
and can i have a cup of coffee
she pours some coffee hands him a cup and saucer
cates pours some whiskey into it from a flask
thats a fairly crummy way to start a morning
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead
maybe that makes a nice excuse
maybe you dont know what the hell youre talking about
cates picks his holstered
off a chair back and begins strapping it on
when you start with that attitude
its like i dont know who you are
what do you want to know
what difference does it make
im the guy in your bed the last three months
i make you feel good
you make me feel good
what the hell else do you want from a guy
i wish youd stop trying to make me mad so i wont care for you
i wish youd give me a little more of a chance
he turns away moves into the corridor near the stairwell
i dont have time for this
i gotta go to work
she stands frozen
he turns back and looks at her its hard to apologize
continuing look im glad im in your life
and hell with an ass like yours i figure anything might be possible
she is warmed up by the first part amused by the second she approaches
you know something jack you really are hopeless
thats the way i see it too
call me later
you sure you want me to
yeah for some reason im sure
he moves closer kisses her
thanks for the coffee
i think you forgot this
hands him his wallet and badge
guess people ought to know who i am
he turns to go down the stairwell
she puts a scarf around his neck
continuing its cold as hell out these mornings and you know what the man said the coldest winter i ever spent was the summer i spent in san francisco
they dont kiss
he nods appreciately the scarf in hand as he turns and goes
cates comes out of elaines apartment building crosses to his whipped and battered cadillac convertible notices a parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper
son of a bitch
shoves the ticket in his coat pocket gets into the caddie puts the scarf around the rear view mirror starts the engine and guns away
cates driving the convertible he comes down a hill and turns toward the east bay
henry wong seated on a park bench
now very dead a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead
billy bear is seated next to him on the bench reading the race form
using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the bench
luther and rosalie a young couple turn a corner
a dark parody of all american young marrieds
they are bickering as usual
i liked that carpet we saw
we cant afford it
dont remind me
whaddya want me to do go out and steal for the money
i hated the color anyway the color sucked
suddenly billy and ganz descend on luther and rosalie and pull them into their station wagon
billy has rosalie by the mouth gagging her with his big paw
ganz has his gun at luthers neck
i thought you were locked up i want the money asshole what do you think
the money that reggie hid
i dont know what youre talkin about
you want that indian to snap her neck
he mimes the gesture
continuing instead of worryin about reggie you better worry about me

billy go ahead break it

i can get you the money
i cant get it until monday
you chickenshit punk
the place we stashed it opens monday morning
i cant get it till then
monday morning thats when it opens
after that ill get the money to you right away
ganz finally takes the gun from the neck
i always liked you luther
you were always a lotta fun to hang out with
rosalie is rubbing her neck now that shes been released
ganz gestures to billy
continuing were gonna keep her
luther desperately doesnt like this
come on you can trust me
you try to mess with us or go to the cops i promise you ill put holes in her you wouldnt believe
he smiles at luther pinches him on the cheek shoves him out of the car
stands shivering as it powers away
a small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind union square
pulls up across the street
tha car arrives in front of the hotel
nice place huh
rosalie is very nervous
what are you gonna do to me in there
ganz gives her a casual smile
maybe thats where im gonna cut your throat
hes just kiddin you just keep doin what i tell ya youll be okay
they move out of the car head for the hotel
a frizzy young blonde sits behind the desk in a mirrored entrance hall
she reads a lurid paperback
morning traffic streams by outside as ganz billy and rosalie enter and approach the desk
we need some rooms for a couple of nights
she smiles at ganz
we dont get many real customers ya know
most people only stay an hour or two
passes a form across
ganz signs it frizzy glances at his signature then takes a key from the rack behind
i want her young
legs are important
then real thin
no jeans a dress
a nice summer dress
you know i want her fresh
ill tell you why because i been hoein weeds and makin license plates for a couple of years
yeah i know you dont get it
sees a couple approaching he shoves the dead man down on the bench and spreads the newspaper over his head
the body now looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night
billy walks over to ganz
hey what about me
and i need one more for my pal
make her an indian
no not a turban you know a squaw
billy smiles takes the polaroid
a close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his forehead
takes the photograph back from billy and slips it into his jacket pocket
third near broadway
tell them to ask for
he takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket the name embossed on the plastic
just be a couple of hours
the two men head for a green plymouth
number twenty seven mr
put them next door okay
she gives him a slightly knowing look
sure hey you got the whole floor to yourself
ganz sends her back a sharp look
keep your filthy ideas to yourself lady
ganz picks up his suitcase walks over to the nearest stairwell
billy and rosalie follow
bars starting to fill up with mid day customers
a black chevy cruises past and stops further up the block
two plainclothesmen vanzant and algren get out of the car
as they start toward the walden
pulls up near the two men
cates climbs out of his car and walks over to them
hey fellas whats happening
radio said you guys had something on
not much jack
salesman named polson had his credit cards lifted
algren nods over to the parking lot opposite
continuing one of polsons cards rented that green coupe
not too much for a big rough tough gunfighter like you to do on this one
cates smiles at the verbal positioning hes used to with his colleagues
suspect packed or is this a laugher
five and dime stuff
polson said a kid with a switchblade mugged him and drove off on a motorcyle
yeah well i guess you two are experts at taking boy scout knives away from teenagers
yeah we are that means you can stay outta this one
we dont have any big need for the artillery vanzants turn to smile
hey im just offering to help out
i like to watch real pros work
sometimes your kind of help tends to leave the suspect in bad shape
soothes the competitive situation
jack you wanna come inside fine
you can stake out the lobby
cates a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment nods
fine its your show
the three men move toward the walden
frizzy blonde still behind the desk
still reading the lurid paperback
unaware as vanzant and algren approach
she looks up as they flash their badges
aw you guys were in last week
you better ask around
im not supposed to be hassled
i got friends
hey park the tongue for a second sweetpants we just want to search a room
not unless you got a warrant
maybe you should of been a lawyer instead of a dumb skirt workin behind a register
frizzy turns to find cates standing beside her
he nudges her aside
starts going throught the register book
aw come on what the shit is this
were looking for a guy going under the name polson
frizzy sits back down in defeat
okay big deal
get it over with
cates finds the name
is he alone
naw his sister went up an hour ago
vanzant turns to cates
okay like we said you stake out the lobby
youre not missing out on dillinger
this punk just stole some credit cards
cates watches the two detectives head for the elevator
vanzant and algren move down the hallwaystop at the far end
both detectives draw their pistols and approach a door
summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor
lisa lies naked under the covers
she matches ganzs earlier requirements
smoking a cigarette staring at the ceiling
ganz remains on top of the blanket
still in his shirt and pants watching tv
three sharp knocks at the door
ganz reacts as if hes received an electric shock
his hand goes under the pillow
comes up with an automatic
shoves it hard into lisas stomach
what the hells wrong
i didnt do anything
ganz makes her move to the door
continuing what do you want
whats goin on
she grabs her dress and tries to pull it on
continuing now ask who it is
shoves harder with the pistol
continuing come on ask
she calls out
who is it
vanzant and algren stand back from the door
guns held ready
lisa looks from the door back to ganz
then at the gun held against her
what do you want
come on open up
a smile on ganz face
almost as if hes enjoying the moment
alright im coming
ill just be a minute
vanzant and algren waiting
sounds of movement from within the room
cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell
looks across at mirror on the wall opposite
the entire lobby covered from this spot
every angle including frizzy
ganz gestures to lisa
just a second
ganz belts her with his gun she falls
ganz goes through the connecting door
slips into the adjacent room
another hooker cowers in the corner pulling on her clothes
shes a mexican girl in a ridiculous indian outfit
que esta pasando
billy goes to where rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with an electric dord
he pulls her to her feet as ganz moves by
continuing when i say jump girl you better jump
continuing vanzant reaches down tries the knob
algren moves back preparing to kick the door down
ganz opens the door behind the two cops
raises his pistol and fires
billys shots follow immediately
algren rolls just as ganz fires again
wounded he gets off three shots then moves inside ganz room
ganz and billy run for the elevator
exchange two more shots with algren
the mexican girl begins screaming in spanish
cates draws his
races up the stairs three at a time
frizzy starts to frantically call the police
cates stops at the landing
vanzants body sprawled across the hallway
algren back in the corridor still losing blood
leans against the wall for support
lisa staggers out of the room screams
algren points the gun toward the elevator
indicating where ganz and billy have just fled
cates starts back down toward the lobby
ganz and billy guns ready as the carriage jolts downward
rosalie is terrified sobbing
arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase
he takes the next flight in two jumps
as the doors open ganz gestures for billy and rosalie to wait as he heads for the lobby
cates literally flies into the lobby just as ganz appears
he slams ganz against a column belts him across the neck with his pistol
ganz screams with pain drops his gun
cates again slams him with his pistol felling him
slides across the floor
cates senses something
moves just as billy appears behind and fires at him
the bullet takes out a window
cates dives over the desk
another bullet chews up the wood
frizzy has been standing beside her desk screaming
cates move and the accompanying bulletspanic her
she dashes for safety
cates gets to his feet behind cover
sees billy holding rosalie by the throat
frizzy begins to scream
hell blow her goddamn head off
cates doesnt miss a beat
he slowly levels his
takes careful aim and starts to fire at billy
cates shot narrowly misses rosalie
the bullet smashes into a mirror above billys head
cates keeps moving closer gun pointed straight ahead
billy pushes the pistol against rosalietemple
for the first time cates hesitates
they face each other across the length of the lobby
struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby
he still holds his revolver
dares not raise it towards billy and rosalie
covers algren from near the entrance
hes confused doesnt know what to do
he keeps hold of rosalie
his eyes catch algrens
drop it and we wont kill her
algren tosses his gun to the floor
continuing now tell him to drop his goddamn piece
do it cates
continuing do it cates
goddamn it do it
cates lowers his gun
finally lets it drop to the floor
kick it over here
cates does ganz picks it up smiles looks at billy
continuing get the car
then back to cates as billy runs out the entrance with rosalie
continuing your guns just like mine
hes going to kill cates
but first be glances at algren
then almost casually shoots him twice with cates
algren staggers back
dead before he hits the floor
cates twists sideways just as ganz fires
the bullet misses
again frizzy starts screaming and struggling
ganz swipes the woman across the head with the gun
her body slumps to the floor
police sirens can be heard in the distance
cates makes an attempt for algrens gun
a bullet splatters against the floor only inches from his outstretched fingers
the gun skitters out of reach
you lying son of a bitch
what are you talking about
we didnt kill her
with your own gun cop
how does it feel
cates leaps into a wooden phone booth
ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth with both his and cates gun
two bullets crash into the booth
ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are ominously near
ganz finally retreats out the entrance
billy and rosalie weave their way across street to the cougar
they make a u turn
ganz runs out
car pulls out then the police cars and vans begin to arrive
chunks of wood on the floor
shafts of light through a dozen bullet holes
shattered receiver dangling from a cord
cates wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle
he drops to the floor
the police arrive
swarm into the hotel
all eyes on cates as he rushes to algren
cates realizes algren is dead
he cradles algrens head as he stares at the arriving tac squad and patrolmen
cates walks in
several detectives gather around him
read the report
two cops blown away by a credit card booster
that dont figure
they were good cops
they were good cops who fucked up and got careless
a snotty young cop paces
thats what you say cates
but thats what you say about all of us all the tine
were always the ones fucking up when you tell it
the truth hurts doesnt it buddy
cates looks at the old cop
it dont figure
i need to borrow a piece
the old cop shrugs
looks in his desk
somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report
are you gonna tell me about police procedure
do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
cates loses it for a second lands on him with both hands pushes him against a wall
the room goes quiet
cates cools down
just shut the fuck up
the other cops dont intervene
they just watch
cates cools down straightens up
haden walks by or rather speeds by
cates ill need to see you in five minutes exactly five
the old cop hands cates a gun a traditional army
best i can do
dyou read me cates
haden continues moving away
i heard you your voice carries
as cates is examining the gun ruth a lab technician enters and drops three x s on the desk near cates
theyre still wet
cates lifts the blow ups each one showing a different aspect of a spent bullet
continuing lots of people getting shot with s lately
last year it was saturday night specials
now its heavy stuff
people must be getting madder about something
cates starts pinning the blow ups onto a large bulletin board on the wall
nearby at the same time within cates line of sight within earshot lisa the hooker is being interrogated by a police woman who pulls the statement off the typewriter
nearby the indian hooker is being interrogated in spanish
youre an accessory to murder one so youre going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here honey
gimme a break huh
look i got there
he was a trick just like any other for all i knew
thats all there is
he didnt feel like sitting and talking
he was in a big hurry to get laid
i was with him about an hour
cates has gotten interested in the last part of this
drifts toward her
a detective comes through begins distributing i
printouts to cates the other nearby officers
we got a print from the hotel room
guys real name is ganz albert ganz
a hitter from back east but he worked out here a few years back
broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards
a real animal
waitll you see this
cates reads the printout then smoothly imperiously he takes over the questioning of lisa
did he give you a return match
he wasnt interested
maybe he didnt like your performance
ill take a raincheck
from the side ruth is pointing at the photos
thisll interest you jack
weve got something here from your gun
and these are from the first weapon ganz used
i dont get it
she turns produces the third photo
pins it beside the one from the walden hotel
a perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used
but not from the walden hotel
fired at least six hours earlier
at point blank range
right between the eyes
found him on a park bench
she shows him two more pictures
police forensics shots of henry wong
very dead on the park bench
continuing ya know there are some very bad people out there in the world
look at it this way ruth
if there werent what would there be for us to do
lisa continues with the policewoman
so i got there and took him down
he started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door
hes gonna give you guys a hard time
cates looks up as he hears that remark
notices kehoe another detective entering with a long suitcase
what makes you think so
i think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid
cates watches kehoe unpack the box
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel
every last bit of it
the big guys room was empty
ill help you out
cates and kehoe start going through the suitcase
kehoe produces a speed loader for a
this guy must have had a
like yours jack
now hes got yours
kehoe next produces several boxes of shells
this cat was real serious about his artillery
an attendant comes through hands kehoe a file
he opens it shows the file to cates who reads the name under the mug shot
backup man from the east bay
worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang
kehoe opens the second file
four mug shots are inside
who are all these
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago
wait a minute wait a minute
wong henry wong
he was in on the same job
cates spins the file around so that both ruth an kehoe can see it throws the forensic shots down beside it
tell me thats not the same guy
did ganz have a grudge against his old friends
haden comes out of his office
get in here cates
cates ignores him
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking
can we find them
heres the file
cates checks the file
one of ems in the slam
damn you cates
get in here
cates walks into hadens cubicle
i want to be left alone on this one
algren was killed with my gun
yeah i read the report
haden shuffles some papers seems to ignore cates
hey the bastards got my gun
i want it back
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings
cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian
in other words we cant seen like were in the revenge business
i know we all know the truths a little different
cates almost smiles at haden
anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
it bothers me when cops get hurt while im makin a play
i dont like it
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one jack
being a hot dogs worked pretty well for me so far
besides i got a lead
youre not a team player
you gotta do things your own way
nail this guy and make us all look good
but you better watch your ass
if you screw up i can promise you youre goin down
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude
he starts to go
try not to get your ass shot to pieces
we got enough dead cops on this one
ill keep it in mind
heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic
cates stands near a hot dog stand
elaine joins him
cates is eating a hot dog and studying a police file
great place for lunch
yeah one of my favorites
you made the front page
he hands her a dog
yeah guess it must have been a slow news day
jack are you okay
sure okay fine no problem
see theres this kid in jail
first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows
he points to the file
i thought you might come over to my place to recuperate
i dont have to go to work until the day after tomorrow
they begin to stroll down the street
i got nothing to recuperate from
theres a guy out there with my gun and i want it back
shes not happy with this attitude
look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
ill tell you about bullshit
my guns a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it
it isnt my macho bullshit thats killing people my gun is
look jack if you make everything your personal responsibility youll turn into a bad cop
its not a practical way to function
i didnt get burned two cops did
listen ill tell you about personnel responsibility
i like to get the job done right
and if i dont get my job done right
im for shit
here it comes again
the sacred job
im not like you
im not gonna sit on my ass wondering whats right and whats wrong
theres a psycho out there killing people with my gun and im gonna get him
because its my job
and if you dont get that
i get that
the job first
everything else especially me second
i get it
i dont like it
no one asked you to like it
but thats the way it is
cates and a guard on the upper deck approaching the door to the cell block
the guard shouts upward
with a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens
cates and the guard go through the door
they move forward together
continuing its number twenty two
you want company
no no thanks
the guard shrugs stays by the door
he walks down the cell block
inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells
they dont know who he is but they can smell a cop
cates stops at twenty two looks inside
a bit startled
obviously reggie hammond has connections and taste
the paint is fresh theres framed prints on the wall instead of pin ups and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison
cates turns nods to the guard at the end of the cell block
he throws a switch and the door opens
cates steps inside
hammond is at a table wearing a sony walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen
hes boogeying in his seat to the music
sprawled on a bunk nearby is leroy another black inmate close to hammonds age
leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine
he doesnt even look at cates
cates steps inside the cell
cates leans over hits the override button on the sony
hammond jumps grabs his ears in pain
he pulls the headset off and glares at cates
you got a name cop
and lets talk in private okay
sure anything you want
he tosses the walkman to leroy who dutifully puts it on
look convict i know all about you
no fixed address
no known relatives
one previous conviction
six months to go on a three year sentence
you here to write my life story
not likely reggie
maybe i just need some help
cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket passes it across the table to hammond
he looks at it hardly reacts
my old pal
hes looked better
he passes the photo back
continuing look i got just six months before gettin out of here
six months between me and freedom after bein here three years
and im not gonna do anything to screw it up includin pee in the prison yard knock up the wardens daughter or rat on my old partners
cates swings the cell door back open
too bad reggie
i thought maybe you were a smart boy
but i guess if you were real smart you wouldnt be a convict
he smiles decides to play his card
continuing i can see a second rater like you wouldnt be any help at all goin up against a real hard case like ganz
hammond jerks his head around
continuing ganz the one who shot henry
cates i asked you a question
yeah i noticed
ganz is in jail
hes gonna be there two years after im on the street
didnt work out that way
he busted out with a big indian
they capped two guards on a road gang
nice meeting you reggie
he turns goes out
the door clangs behind him
hammond jumps up and bangs on the bars shouts at cates back
cates come back here
cates turns saunters back leans against the door

cates typing several of official looking documents while seated across from a rather dour looking bureaucrat named bob
let me borrow your pen bob
handed over by bob

he begins signing the documents
jack just remember one thing

he hands over the papers
bob you got him for hours
bob studies the sheet
continuing you got a big career as a forger if you decide to go that way jack
ill ring security
the guard leads hammond to a steel cage
harmnonds now wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit
the guard shouts to another guard on the far side
send him through
the gate slides open
the guard geztures for hairmond to enter
hammond walks to the far side of the pen
the first gate closes the second one opens
hammond turns and walks over to cates
the guard comes up to cates double checks his orders then unlocks hammonds cuffs
gotta sign for him
he looks over at hammond who smiles at him
then looks at harmonds clothes
continuing this prison gives out suits
what are you talkin about
this suits mine
hammond dusts off a sleeve
were supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers
listen it may be a little out of date
you know i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
cates hands some papers to the guard
hes all yours
the guard walks away as hammond feels cates lapel
we could change this for something good
get you lookin sharp for pussy
cates gives him a look
i dont need to hear your jive
i already got that department taken care of
you got a girl
the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
cates slaps a cuff on hammonds outstrethand then puts the other on his own wrist
continuing hey no way

there isnt any deal

no way to start a partnership

and if ganz gets away youre gonna be sorry we ever met

cates yanks on the cuffs
they move away

as they approach the car

a guy named luther
ganzll be paying him a visit
we go to him right away
luther was part of the gang
what gang you talkin about jack
i can read a police file shithead and quit calling me jack
just an expression man dont mean nothin
cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over
i dont give a damn
it happens to be my name
then whatre you complainin about
at least nobodys calling you shithead
i may call you worse than that
cates drives off
cates cadillac purrs into view entering a deserted street within a rundown neighborhood
hammond seated next to cates
just up the street the other side over there
now dont bother knockin on the door
luther aint the kind of guy that looks for company
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
luther aint the reliable type
i dont want you shot yet cates
not before you been a help to me
im helpin you huh
didnt you know that
the caddy pulls to a stop
cates double checks his
continuing you better let me borrow one of those
sure thing asshole
handcuffs hammond to the door handle
grabs the car keys
continuing you just hang on
and hope this big move of yours turns out to be something
opens the car door
continuing cates knocks at the door
from inside he hears a faint noise but no response to the knock
in one hand cates tries the knob with the other
the door opens
cautiously cates steps inside
long corridor ahead
no sign of luther
moves down the corriaor checks the rooms off to one sides
slips into the hallway behind cates
cates turns just as he gets to the kitchen
luther holds a gun
cates drops to a crouch and aims the
luther whirls and fires at cates
as wood and plaster fly out all round him cates makes a running dive for the floor
luther runs out before cates has regainehis feet
luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the cadillac
watches as luther heads down the sidewaltoward him
as he starts to pass by
hammond steps out suddenly
flattens him with the car door
luther drops stunned
hammond still restricted by being cuffed to the door handle reaches and grabs his pistol
hammond drop the goddamn gun
hammond looks up
he sprints across the pavement
aims his gun at hammond
quit playin cop and undo this cuff jack i need to talk to this man
im tellin you to drop the goddam gun
i got a whole thing about people pointin guns at me
just throw me the goddamn gun
then hammond smiles and tosses him luthers pistol
cates puts his foot on luthers belly and pulls himself into a standing position cuffs him
luther i always told you the physical side of life wasnt your gig
look at you all messed up
course you never were much in the snappy dresser department were you
cates now has luther ready to be questioned
come on talk to him
hammond turns to smile at luther
whats happening luther
i thought you were inside
meet my travel agent
luther leans forward looks straight at cates
i sure aint his fairy godmother
now im looking for ganz
where is he
havent seen him for years
thats the truth
you just took a shot at me asshole
i think you do know where he is
who gives a fuck what you think
cates grabs the still open cadillac door slams it into luther
he falls backwards
cates looks at hammond
hey this works pretty good
want to try it again
luther sits up again glares at cates
ganz and billy got my girl rosalie
i think i met her
now tell us something we dont know like where they stashed her
i dont know
cates slams the car door agains him again
i gotta tell you hes having a ball with this car door luther
youd better think of somethin to tell him
flashes a look at hammond who sends him a silent fleeting reply
maybe cates sees this
he wants me to help him skip town
hes gonna call me
another look at hammond
continuing hes gonna call me on
somethings wrong with all this
cates isnt sure just what
he looks at hammond
what do you think
i think you better put him on ice man
hes gotta take that call
if there is one
if you let him run around till tuesday hes gonna run right to ganz and warn him
aint you motherfucker
luther makes a play toward hammond who laughs doesnt even flinch
continuing luther are you angry with me
cates wrestles luther into the back seat turns to hammond
i dont know what the hell youre smiling about watermelon
your big move turned out to be shit
hammond just stares at cates keeps smiling
two uniforms follow a sullen luther cates and hammond to the duty sergeant
cates speaks to him through the small window
assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon
carrying a concealed weapon
resisting arrest disturbing the peace
the sergeant begins typing out an arrest form
continuing ill think up a few more and file the report tomorrow
cates looks back at hammond as luther is hauled away
continuing come on i gotta make a phone call
as they move through the honeycomb of office partitions
continuing you stay with me
cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking desk
waits for a response as two hookers are led past by an arresting officer
hammond gives them the eye
continuing this is jack cates
elaine is on the kitchen phone speakingwhite putting her coat on over her uniform for the evening
one look at the way it is cut and you know why she hates her job
some lady called
said shes a little hot headed sometimes
but she still wants her occasional roommate
shed like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight
if its humanly possible
elaine look im in the middle of sone stuff right now
im not gonna have time to come by
i dont know when i can get there
her face falls
making the offer was hard enough
come on jack
youre making me work too goddamn hard at this
jack is very irritated by this turn of events
listen goddamn it if you think im happy about it youre nuts
i just gotta take care of a few things okay
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave
cates says nothing
she hangs up angrily
hammond is working on the girls
excuse me ladies you seem to be in need of assistance
look we got enough problems we dont need no tight ass court appointed lawyer trying to bullshit us
sweetheart im not trying to bullshit you
i dont know whether or not you ladies heard but the city is coming down real hard on people practicing unlawful carnal knowledge
so what are you trying to say fella
im trying to say that youre not just walk in that courtroom and get gonna slapped with a fine and be back on the street turning tricks tonight
you both are going to do some time
about days each
unless of course we talk real business
so where do you want to do it honey
you wanna hop up on the counter
no we can go to the back room
cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder
were on the move
as they walk toward a corridor
do you know how close i was to getting some trim
and you fucked it up
yeah well my ass bleeds for you
and i didnt get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt
speakin of moans my stomach is startin to growl
we eat when i say we eat
i aint moving till i get something to eat
youve been treating me like shit ever since i came out here
if you dont like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good bye
and i want some food some place nice
some good people nice music
yeah im hungry too
i know of a place
lets go eat
yeah i want mandolins flowers
they move off down the corridor
cates and hammond at a candy machine
cates drops in a quarter throws hammond a candy bar
theres your god damn dinner
now lets go
they move toward a row of parked cars
whod you call on the phone back at the booking station
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
hammond gets in the car as cates readjusts elaines scarf on the mirror
must of been your lady friend
cates frowns at him
continuing you really do have onoe huh jack
whats her problem besides you
shes got the same complaint as half the goddamn population
she cant get the job shes trained for and it pisses her off
anyway what the fuck do you care
cates climbs in behind the wheel of the cadillac
no man tell me about her
in jail they got me surrounded by guys wearin blue suits twenty four hours a day
and i aint built for that
with the clothes you got on you look like youd love it
cates takes a belt from his flask
now where we goin convict
gonna find us an indian
cates starts the motor slams it into gear
accelerates out to the street
cates and hammon booming along in the caddy
come on jack
i want to hear about your girl
when were you with her last
you get what i mean
cates smiles back at him almost cruelly i dont give out the details
last night two nights ago three
cates keeps smiling
you have a good time
pained expression on cates face as he comes back to reality
then we had a fight this morning
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you
tell me a little about her
she got great tits
cates gives him a hard look
i get the feeling its going to be real long night
they keep driving
the cadillac drives slowly past a bar called torchies
stops at the end of the block
its a long shot but
billy used to tend bar here a few years back
i heard him talk about it
this part of town theyll make us for heat the second we walk in
just back me up like youve got a piece
back you up
now why would i wanna do that
if they kick my ass theyll sure as hell carve yours up
but you can handle it all right huh
real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
attitude and experience get you through
cates and hammond step out glance toward the bar
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers
all those clowns ever had going for em was a gun and a badge
you need five years training to handle a joint like
hamnonds had enough of this debate
hey you wanna bet
i got two problems
number one im not playin games
number two you got nothin to bet with
if we come outta this joint with ganz phone number or a dead indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while
i get laid
anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably cant get it up anyway
thats never been one of my problems
now stop stallin man or else admit all this professional stuff youre talkin about is a crock of shit
ill tell you what happens if you lose
you tell the truth for once
what are you talkin about
you tell me what ganz busted out for hes after a lot more than just gettin out of jail
and whatever it is youre part of it
i dont know what youre talking about
i just wanna see ganz nailed
the bets off
hammond thinks it over
okay if i lose ill tell you anything you want to know
cates reaches into his pocket
im gonna enjoy this
here ill even loan you my badge
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
he takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance
they step inside
hammond reacts to
longhorns mounted over the bar rebel flags lone star beer armadillo posters
even the waitresses wear stetsons
rockabilly pounding from the jukebox
a cowgirl stripper is doing the grind on a small podium
this place dont seem real popular with the brothers
my kind of place
i always liked country boys
cates smiles finds a table in the corner
a cowgirl comes over to take his order
takes a deep breath moves toward the bar
smiles at the good ol boys
they dont smile back
he sits down at the bar
maybe you better have a black russian
no man i think ill have a vodka
hamnond looks around the room
places a glass in front of him picks up the dollar as harmond flashes cates shield
you know a big indian named billy bear
he used to work here
the bartender shakes his head gives him a scowl
never heard of him
hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror behind the bar
sudden silence throughout the room
now hows your memory doin
i dont know what the hell youre talkin about
maybe i better ask around see what your pals think
i dont give a shit who you ask
the bartender walks down toward cates
moves away from the bar
he stops at a booth occupied by one a very big man
hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls him up
up against the wall cowboy
the punk breaks free aims a massive haymaker at hammond
gets a right to the stomach for his trouble
continuing now i said get over there by that wall
you hear me motherfucker
looks at the others
continuing move it rednecks
on your feet
he grabs the next by the arm yanks him up
continuing over there
move your ass
some of you rednecks seem a little hard of hearing so ill repeat it for everybody
i need word on the whereabouts of an indian that goes by the name of billy bear
its a police matter and you all look like youd just love to cooperate
cates quietly sips his beer
the other occupants of the bar watch hammond herd the four punks to the end wall
when hammond isnt looking he dashes toward the exit cates puts out a leg
sends the cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable
turns around at the noise
continuing that wasnt necessary buddy
i got this under control
some of us citizens are with you all the way officer
the redneck punks are now spread eagled against the wall
hammond searches the first
he drops a wallet on the floor and moves to the second
a switchblade some credit cards and another wallet fall to the floor
the last punk has only a roll of bills
hammond holds the money up to his face
youre in trouble big trouble so you better start talking
whered a boy like you make a score like this
its mine what the hell
you must a rolled somebody
they dont let punks like you take jobs that pay this much
you sure you dont know a dangerous indian because unless you start talkin i may just have to start looking down your pants with a flashlight
what kind of cop are you anyway
i am your most terrible nightmare a bad nigger with a badge that entitles him to kick your ass
hammond turns to the bartender
continuing one of them is under age
another attacked a police officer
and you know i aint found what i came lookin here for yet
walks back to the bartender
continuing the tall one had a weapon
you want me to keep on makin a list or you got the picture yet
he reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses
jerks the towel the pyramid capsizes onto the floor
huge crash as the glasses break into a million fragments
continuing looks like youre on your way to bein outta business redneck
now lets see what can we fuck with next
the bartender doesnt have the look of a happy man
the indian hangs out with a girl down the block
right where chinatown starts
she lives on top of the hardware store
hammond turns grins at cates
as far as hes concerned hes won the bet
cates nods slips out the door
i dont give a damn about his girl
look give me a break youre going to have to settle for her place
its the only thing i know
he looks desperate
continuing im tellin ya im giving you all i know
try obeyin the law once in awhile and i wont have to hassle you
turns to go then turns back
continuing but remember this cowboy theres a new sheriff in town
smiles turns and goes
hammond steps out of the bar
he crosses to cates by the car
i think you got something for me
continuing the gun you took off that redneck in there
you made that move huh
while youre at it you can give me the switchblade too
hammond reluctantly takes out a
automatic slams it down on the hood of the car
continuing credit cards
hammond hands them over with the knife
you already got a gun and you owe me a piece of ass
ill settle for the gun you just took
a long moment
then cates slowly lifts the
you did a real good job
guess you deserve a reward
removes the clip
throws it across the street
hands hammond the automatic
he throws the gun away
i sure am
now lets go get us an indian
they walk up the block
neon signs with sino lettering
walk down the street spot a shop with a window display of tools
look up at the darkened apartment windows
they walk to the end of the block
stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops
cates and hammond move along the buildings
arrive at the back of the hardware store
quietly they start to ascend the stairs
the metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door
cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent window
between the drawn curtains a flickering glimmer from a tv set
on the tube various poses from stridently exercising women
what the shit is that
a female form passes by goes out of the room
must be billys girl
cates gestures to the door lock
hammond fiddles with it for several moments
the door swings open
they step into a darkened room
cates takes the
from his pocket
he stops near the open bedroom doorway
he looks at hammond and then both men step quickly into the room
hammond reaches for the light switch
takes a heavy blow
slumps against the door
a womans voice screams out
continuing stay where you are
the light goes on
cates gun points at a young woman casey in a flimsy dressing gown
saturday night special held between her palms police style
a second woman sally stands beside hammond at the light switch
larger and slightly older than the first she wears a mans shirt
holds a baseball bat in her right hand
you better drop it or hes gonna get another one
hey talk to here jack
i dont feel like gettin number two along side of the head
i said police
now drop the goddamn gun
dont give me that police shit
you drop it
okay look dont shoot
im just reachin for my badge
cates takes out his badge shows it to casey
i dont like this bullshit
ive seen fake badges before
ill tell you something lady this guy is a real nervous cop hes just liable to pull the trigger
cates takes two steps toward casey
naw im the calm type
i know you dont want me to shoot you and i know that you dont want to shoot me
he takes two more steps toward her
continuing shooting a cop puts you away for a long time
holds out his hand
you assholes better be real
she hands cates the gun
sally prods hammond with the baseball bat
just wait a goddamn second here lets see your badge
he snatches the bat out of her hands
dont have one
i knew it
call the cops
casey walks over to the phone
tell them its cates detective st district
then put your clothes on
if you dont answer some questions im taking both your asses in
after a moment casey puts down the phone
continuing now lets cut out the crap which one of you sees billy bear
none of your business cop
the son of a bitch isnt here and he isnt coming back
you can do better than that
turns to casey
continuing how about it
i used to go with him
i dont know where the hell he is
i havent seen him for two weeks
and i dont think i will
he owes me money
hes a goddamn lowlife the way he treated her
sounds like a real stormy romance
i dont much care what it sounds like to you cop
all i know is that i went a few laps around the track with him and i ended up with nothin but the short end of the stick
cates looks over at hammond
wait a minute
maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us
how about it
i been nearly three years in prison and
hannond starts for the door with cates
if you find that bastard billy tell him to stay out of my life
i dont need any more of his macho bullshit
the two men walk among the bright neon lights
neither of them very happy
a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it
so instead of me being where i oughta be which is in bed giving my girl the high hard one im out here doing this shit roaming around with some
overdressed charcoal colored loser like you
you wanna leave man
let me take care of ganz all by myself
dont make me laugh
you cant take care of shit
youve been dicking me around since we started on this turd hunt
all youre good for is games
so far what i got outta you is nothin
im impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
luther knew more than he told me and so do you
now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about
i gave you hours to come up with something and the clocks runnin
a long look at hammond
maybe i dont like the way you ask
who gives a goddamn what you think
youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass
youre not even a name anymore
just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
they walk past
they two men walk toward the cadillac
okay reggie im done playing around
i want to know whats going on and im going to beat the living shit out of you until you tell me
hammond goes into a street rap
you beat the shit out of me
dont make me laugh sucker
you dont know how id dance on your face
ill hit you so hard so many times youll wish youd never been hatched
ill turn your face into cottage cheese
ill make your girl think you been takin ugly pills
she wont even know who you are sucker
they stop by the car
cates takes the gun out lays it on the hood
hammond stares at him
cates next takes out his wallet shows hammond his badge then lays the badge on the car fender
i guess the first thing i ought to explain to you nigger is i fight dirty
hits hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face
hammond sags grabs onto the car fender for support
and hammond kicks out sending the partially open car door slamming into cates
so do i
hammond aims a kick at cates head
cates blocks it with crossed forearms grabs twists
hammond tumbles rolls away from cates
both men struggle to their feet circle each other
hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from cates a bit sooner than he expected
hammond dances in and out
cates breathing becomes more labored
his windmill attack penetrates cates defense
cates clears his head charges bull like
his rush and greater bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a brick wall
hammond is faster
cates is much stronger both men on their knees
they look at one another
silently they move to their feet
hammonds back is to a wall
cates keeps him there negates the lighter mans agility
they slug away each now arm weary
exchange a dozen blows
finally cates steps back arms at his side
breath coming like a bellows
hammond has to hold on to the wall one more punch would put him out
now you bastard you going to tell me whats going on
continuing do i have to kick the shit out of you some more
they stand facing one another
a black and white comes roaring up the street
sirens howling red lights flashing it slides to a stop
two uniformed cops jump out guns drawn
all right you two
get your hands above your head
he keeps his gun trained on cates and hammond
my gun and badge are over there
and im too fucking tired to raise my hands
hammond rubs the side of his face
cates falls back against the patrol car
still fighting for breath
the first cop lifts cates wallet off the cadillac and looks at his badge shows it to the other cop
what the hells going on here
cates walks over pockets his gun
ive got a burglary call
two women say a couple of hoods broke into their place posing as cops
i was following a lead
we rousted them
go up and sweet talk em
you can straighten it out
the first cop checks out cates badge and i
why dont you do it
we got better things to do than straighten out your messes
so do i
ill file a report tomorrow
the first cop takes out his book starts writing
i gotta file a
report tonight asshole
goes with the territory
he grabs hammond and they head for the cadillac
cadillac parked behind the service area
hammond looks up at his bruised face in the mirror then washes up
cates is one step ahead of him
he rolls up a piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum
too bad we got interrupted when we did
i was getting ready to finish you off
cates straightens up from the wash basin
you want to try again
naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
they saved your ass convict
one things for sure jack
thats how youll tell the story
cates dries off his face starts out of the washroom
ill even put it in my report that way
the door closes behind cates
hammond leans back toward the mirror nudges a tooth with his finger
cates leans on the cadillac as hammond emerges
hammond starts for the passenger side
wait a minute
continuing you come clean or were going to go again
right here right now
a long moment hammond decides be has no choice
i been waiting a long time for some money
half a million
hammond smiles his meanest smile
hows that for a number to give you heart failure
guess you might start to get the picture after all
mlaybe youre on the wrong side of the old law and order business
cates is unmoved
just tell me about the money
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale
its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen
i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job
some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun
hes after your money
you catch on real fast
okay jack lets talk deal
how much of my money you gonna let me keep
cates just looks at him
continuing we split
not likely convict
you gonna let me keep any of it
depends on how things work out
i believe in the merit system
so far you havent built up any points
okay from now on im gonna be real good jack
cates smiles back
wheres the money
in the trunk of a car
a lot better than under a mattress right
we aint partners
we aint brothers
we aint friends
if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met
they get into the caddy
the cadillac moving through the city
clock on the dashboard showing a
cates at the wheel
continuing wheres the goddamn car
youre a real case you know that jack
continuing thisll show you how smart i am
i got it parked
for three years
lets hope it wasnt a tow away zone
you just drove by it
the cadillac makes a screeching u turn i swings into the curb
cates leans out looks at
narrow multi storied with a garage like opening and signals
proclaiming weekly monthly long term
okay now what
hammond gets out of the car
stands on the sidewalk
then gets into the back seats
since youre wired on benniest you get to stay up and stare at the building
im tired so im going to sleep
they take sunday off
place opens at seven oclock monday morning
wake me up at a quarter till
cates stares at the place
you son of a bitch
you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait
i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing
i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther
you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack
beyond the skyline grey streaks of dawn etch the sky
the cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block from the parking sections cates walks in through the lot entrance
threads his way between the lines of parked vehicles tired and haggard he carries a paper bag filled with quick order food
hammond stretches on the back seat
cates slams the door shut
i dont want you sleeping on the job
hammond yawns eases himself into a sitting position
the place opens in five minutes
ganz ought to be here soon
cates tears the paper bag open
passes a cup of coffee and donut back
he sips his own coffee adds some whiskey from his flask
pops another bennie
you took a big chance leaving this here all this time
i figured ganz was put down for a long time
and i knew luther would never job me on his own
hes too chickenshit
luther just got in line
hammond sits up
musta got some primo bondsman
thats a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and hes out in hours
i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door
luther walks up to the window where a bored attendant reads a comic book
i want to pick up my car
he passes across a faded form
the attendant examines the form surprised
this is three years old
yeah ive been busy
the attendant opens a key file begins rummaging in it
we dont wash em ya know
how about chargin the battery
that we do
and we put air in the tires
ill even sell you some gas if you need it
great just great
the attendant finds the key exits the booth
luther follows to an elevated stack of cars
the attendant throws a switch the stack of cars begins to move
luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated porsche convertible
the car is covered with a uniform coat of dust except for the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean
luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic drives out
another street luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly cates cadillac appears
starts to tail the porsche
cates follows luther through several turns
the porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down
jesus christ look at all the dust on my car
why in the hell dont he take it to a car wash
didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
i had no choice
some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
tryin to save his girl man
hes in another world
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id just leave town
im tellin you the mans in love
he wants to be a hero for his girl
oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you
i let women get to me
the quest for pussy is the meaning of life i got my own personal philosophy about em
keep women separate from guns money and business
women are for spending money
they got nothing to do with helping you make it
that aint philosophy
thats common sense
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
say do you always work people over like you did luther
if they dont tell me what i need to know
doesnt it get
im not in this cause its fun
im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either
i do it cause it works
you got a very depressing view of life man
you gotta smile once in awhile
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money
if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain
that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job
what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks
class isnt somethin you buy punk
look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife
the caddy follows the porsche
as they follow luther
were getting too close
cates whats the matter you been takin dumb pills
yeah most cops are pretty dumb
but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you
luther pulls over to curb and parks
suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in driveway of parking lot
he goes to the trunk
picks up a flaming red suit
that goddamn suit is yours
that was in style a couple years back man
if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set
under the suit is a nondescript attache case
luther takes it closes the trunk
beads down the sidewalk
thats the money jack
they jump out of the car follow on foot
luther hurries along the sidewalk
he reaches the corner turns quickly
following a little way behind
they pause at the corner watching the pedestrian traffic move by
then turn down the cross street after luther
follow him down a stairwell
escalators and open stairwells
luther enters and pauses by the doorway
commuters crowd the counters and congregate near the stairwells
more people are seated along hard plastic seats
but no ganz
and no billy
luther moves further into the station
cates and hammond enter
they keep luther fixed between them feet ahead
luther seems to be wandering he walks through the shop area and back toward the escalator
hammond remains near the arcade while cates blends in with the commuters
luther puts the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter
next to him a loud troop of boy scouts marches by
a crowd of people from the train area below flows through the lobby obscuring luther from hammond and cates for a moment
cates steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots ganz moving through the crowd toward luther
be looks over at hammond across the station and motions
then they both start moving in on ganz trying to intercept him before he gets deeper into the crowd
ganz moves cautiously through the station
a crumpled newspaper held absently in his hand
he scans the faces of the commuters and spots luther
fails to notice cates and hammond closing in on him from two directions
a patrolman comes up
starts chatting amiably with a boy scout next to luther
ganz hesitates in his approach
he motions luther to move awaye but luther starts to panic when he sees cates and hammond closing in
ganz reacts to luther turns and spots the two men
he makes an immediate break for open ground
the patrolman sees ganz start to run
the newspaper is thrown to the floor
ganz swings cates
ganz whirls his feet slipping on the marble floor
his shot at hammond goes plowing into the ceiling
the crowd starts to panic and run in all directions
the patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out
levels it at ganz
continuing put it down
suddenly appears rosalie at his side
blasts the patrolman onto his back
ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons
he billy and rosalie head toward the escalator
cates has already brought out his
cant get a clean shot through the chaos
hammond pushes his way through the crowd to cates
shoot the sons of bitches
cates cant risk it
continuing you dont want to chance it then give me the gun
then im staying with the money
you stay with me
hammond starts after luther
cates turns starts to aim at hammond
panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman with the gun
ganz and billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd tugging rosalie along
cates gun in hand creates further panic as he moves after ganz
ganz grabs a man beside him
shoves him hard into the passengers in back
the man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock
ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains
cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the terrorized passengers
the usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard
the patrons huddle in fear against any available wall
cates bursts out of the stairwell
red and green signal lights
the light goes red a train roars up and the doors hiss open
billy and ganz fight through the passengers getting off the train jump on board billy pulls rosalie behind him
running for the doors
suddenly a security officer appears riot gun in hand
there they are
just put it down real slow
the train doors close
im a policeman you asshole
dont even try
now drop it or youre all done
he means it points the riot gun even closer
the train in front of him moves away
cates carefully places the
on the pavement
then raises his hands in the air
witnesses stand in nervous little knots
give versions of what happened to notepad toting patrolmen
hospital attendants minister to various and sundry complaints
cates sits on a passenger bench obviously dejected
a voice comes echoing from behind
haden silhouetted against the light from the street
continuing what the bell happened
i lost them thats what happened
how did they get away
as fast as they could
caught a train
haden watches the morgue personnel wheel out the body of the patrolman
which one pulled the trigger
i was about yards away
you couldnt get to him
continuing what a screw up
i screwed up
i fucked up
i messed up
anybody could have done better especially you
i bet youre real good at hitting targets through crowds
haden starts toward the street
looks back at cates
dont duck the bullet cates
why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play
i didnt have the time
too bad it wouldve covered your ass
now youre in the shit and sos the department
in case you havent noticed this wasnt our finest hour
i told you everyone was watchin on this one
maybe you better start thinkin about writin tickets off a three wheel bike
cates looks at haden for a moment
turns and walks away
hammond across the street from predmore
standing in a phone booth talking into the receiver
he turns and looks acain at the hotel
walks into a nearby bar
punk dancers all over the floor
a rock group blasting away
new shoes vocal at a back booth
a man sosna approaches carrying a small suitcase
how you doing man
not bad not bad
puts the suitcase down on the table
continuing you want to go outside
naw right heres okay
dancers sliding and jerking in front of them
everybody heres looking at everybody elses ass
sosna pops open the suitcase
lid shielding the contents from the patrons
i got some real nice merchandise
all of its clean
suitcase arranged like q salesmans display case
tightly spaced rows of handguns mounted in their holsters
i like this one
pockets a revolver with a deft move
continuing how about some ammo
i got some shells in here
opens another compartment
hammond helps himself to two boxes
this is clean shit
no serial numbers and never been used

this aint a credit business

i havent got the money so what are you gonna do about it

a long moment

hammonds heads for the bar
stands next to a good looking woman rita
nods to the barkeep
with a twist
and i want to run a tab
he knocks half of it back turns to the woman
continuing my names reggie hammond
big personality smile
she turns away as he takes a drink
he looks at another pretty girl angela
im reggie hammond

she turns away
this aint my night
he drinks up
several detectives are working at desks
kehoe walks into the office
he moves slowly to cates desk and slumps down in a nearby chair
you look awful

kehoes phone begins to ring
cates watches hopefully
okay hang on
offers the phone to cates
continuing its for you
cates excitement vanishes
he takes the receiver
kehoe begins to clean off his desk

he slams down the receiver leans back in the chair
continuing bullshit red tape

cates shakes his head
i got to wait for a call

you know you ought to get some rest
he walks out the door
cates stares fixedly at the phone on the desk
hoping hammond will call
across the room another phone starts to ring
cates stares at the plainclothesman who answers
yeah hes here
cates snatches up the phone shouts into it

he said he rousted a bar with you last night
why the hell didnt you tell me before

cates speaks back into the receiver
elaine i gotta put you on hold
just a second thats all
he hits the bold button starts rummaging through the desk
paperwork scatters in all directions
kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves
cates begins to dial
you son of a bitch where are you
listens for a moment
hammond on the phone as the band rocks away
monkey mash track only hey jack how ya doin

he dashes back to the phone hits the other line
hears only a buzz
continuing oh shit
band blasting away on another number the boys are back in hammond now in the middle of the floor dancing his ass off with a girl named candy
as the song ends

the band starts up again
love songs are for crazies yeah well even us non pros expect the guy to pay for the room
cates suddenly appears
steps between them
yells above the bands noise
this is candy
she looks at hammond
well maybe ill see you later
heres hoping baby
candy leaves and melts into the crowd on the dance floor
what about luther
what about ganz
luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street
made a phone call
maybe we should pay luther a visit
let him get some sleep
hes going to need it
they move to the bar
continuing they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an am wake up and put up the dont disturb sign
hes trading his girl for the money
all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind
so you took the rest of the night off
we dont have too many cheerleaders in prison
i though i might indulge myself in a little trim
cates orders two drinks
tell me something
why didnt you just take the money off luther and split
i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you
he opens his jacket slightly
reveals a shoulder holster and accompanying
a long moment
i dont know why but im going to let you keep it
maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because im too tired to argue
you sure thats the reason
thanks for callin in
and i guess maybe
look im sorry i called you watermellon nigger
those kinds of things
i was just leanin on ya doin my job
bein good at your job dont explain everything jack
hammond gives him a big smile
as long as youre feeling like abe lincoln how about payin me on our bet
we got time and all this pussy around heres drivin me crazy
see that one over there the one i was with
he nods at candy across the way
yeah i see her
i can just take her right across the street to luthers hotel
all i need is some money for the room
continuing big smile as cates produces some cash
hammond counts it eagerly
candy suddenly appears like a trout seeing a lure
she grabs the money
i just struck it rich
i think we can do a little business
as a matter of fact i think we can have a party
hammond smiles leads her out of the bar
cates watches them go downs his drink
he fishes in his pocket for a coin moves to a wall phone
a cocktail waitress answers the phone as elaine pours a drink
its for you
hands her the receiver
hi its me
she slams down the receiver
hammond and candy exit the rock club
a line of young punkers waiting to get inside
hammond and candy are in a tight clinch a little giggly
what did you have in mind
suddenly hammond sees luther emerge from the predmore across the street
oh no not now
luther moves down the street with the briefcase
hammond pulls candy back inside vromans
rock group still blasting away
love songs are for crazies vocal continues hammond and candy reappear knocking aside a waitress about to refill cates drink
that was quick
when you been in prison three years it dont take long
luthers on the move
cates jumps up runs out
hammond looks at candy
continuing ill be back
he kisses her
runs off after cates
she stares at him in disbelief
luther checking over his shoulder for shadows walks down the block
turns into a narrow street
luther waits impatient
checks his watch
looks up and down the street
he double checks the bus stop sign over his head
just as a bus pulls to a stop air brakes hissing
sees that the driver is billy bear
the bus starts up
luther hesitates in the front
on the wide rear seat is ganz
rosalie beside him
open your coat
he shows hes not packed
let her go
first the money
luther takes a step
continuing just show me
luther puts the case on a side seat opens it for display
commuters look up expectantly
one of two drift toward the curb
jump back in alarm as the bus roars by
ganz is satisfied
luther closes the case
rosalie you okay
what are you talkin about
i said i wouldnt hurt her
and then he shoots luther
right between the buttons
continuing i never break my word
laughs as rosalie begins to scream
barreling down the street ignoring red lights
hammond shouts over the wind
notice something funny about that bus
it missed the last four stops
cates pours on the gas
his eyes fall on the rear view mirror
a white caddy dances in the vibrating glass
billy looks over his shoulder at ganz
swerves into cross traffic makes a big press forward
comes abreast of the drivers side of the bus
smashes a side window with the two handguns
cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun
looks up as glass shards sparkle down
he speeds up
he is neck and neck with the bus
hammond has a clear shot of billy bear who gives a side glance at him hammond doesnt shoot
cates slows down and fires
billy is hit in the shoulder
ganz runs up and fires again
hammond is hit in the arm
cates grabs hammond by the shirt
yanks him close
throws the wheel over
swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side
stuffing flies out of hammondis still warm seat
the right hand windows explode
then the caddy spins out
skids into a traffic sign demolishing some newspaper machines
cates curses tries to start the car
the engine wont turn over
he looks at the distant bus
pounds on the dash
whats left of the windshield falls in at the impact
cates at his desk
hammond seated nearby now with a bandaged arm
haden in front of cates furious
a bus you goddamn whiskey mick cop you lost a stolen bus
we got five deaths related to ganz all of em law enforcement related and you blow it for a lousy nigger convict
cates says nothing
continuing thats rights i called him a nigger
you bet i did
i saw the report on that little piece of shit
if he spent one legal day in his whole life itd be a record
this is it for you
suspension review board
youve had it
when it gets round you protect a con rather than nail a cop killer
cates stands up
hes got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop ive worked with
just cause you say it with conviction dont mean shit to me
how you gonna take to a pink slip huh
moves to hammond
handcuffs himself to him
continuing where the christ do you think youre going
im taking my prisoner back to jail
hammond looks at haden
goin a little hard on him arent you
go fuck yourself convict
you know for a man you have very pretty brown eyes
cates and hammond walk out
cates and hammond walk stoically along a row of cars arrive at hammonds porsche
hey howd my car get here
i had it impounded
come on well use it for haulin you back to the slam
back to jail in my own car
ganz got away
got all my money
it just dont seem right
i dont know about you but i could use a drink
ill buy you one
itll be my good bye present
takes off hammonds cuffs
looks at them
throws them away
sorry we didnt do better jack
i feel like i let you down
naw you didnt let me down
it was a long shot all the way
we gave em a good run at it
yeah but we didnt get em
they get in and drive off
the porsche blasts by
these men want a drink
cates and hammond walk in
its late the place is almost empty
the bartender is a woman with her back to them conferring with a waitress about something
its late theyre closing
dont worry about it
the barmaid turns around to take their order
hey i dont believe it
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out
weve had a hard night
i can see that
pardon me for saying so but you look like shit
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours
hammond looks at her
he nudges cates
who the hell are you
names hammond reggie hammond
i heard a lot about you
and any friend of jacks is a friend of mine
gives her a big smile
im not so sure i can say the same thing
you dont look like a cop
well i been workin the other side of the street for the last few years
and you dont exactly look like a shrink wearin that dress
shrink major not a shrink
she pours three glasses of cognac
a straggler at the end of the bar pipes up
hey lady a drink here
hey what the hell
elaine turns to him its short and sweet
drink your drink pay up and get out
you cant do this
hey just fuck off
my friends have guns
cates holds up his pistol
the mans eyes widen and he turns his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar
elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches
continuing you real down
ive been better
no ganz no indian
he finishes his drink puts down the glass
continuing i gotta call the station
looks back at hammond
continuing dont run off anywhere okay
ive already got enough to worry about
hard man to live with
how would you know
hey two days with him is enough
thats no bull
she looks at him carefully
they both grin
in the phone booth
is there any report
just tell me
yeah i figured
no sign of ganz
no sign of the indian
ganz is going to be hard to track
just a pure schizo
wires all crossed
totally without any pattern
how do you know
jack its all over the papers
hes an obvious type
but this indian
hammond cuts in
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend
he was loyal went all the way for you
in all due respect he sounds kind of pathetic to me
the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend
have you two ace detectives checked that out
yeah well the only woman of the indians we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend
i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet
they both looked mad enough to kill him
yeah too bad
they were real nice lookin too
in bed together hardly any clothes one watching tv
what makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes
come on they were a little old for a slumber party
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions
i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian
now if this indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him
when a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible
hey come on shrink times over
they wouldnt go see some old girlfriend
oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out
shes got a point there jack
cates reflects for a moment
its the only thing we got
he looks at elaine
continuing whaddya think
what do i know
im just a bartender
lets go reggie
he kisses elaine
do i get to kiss her too
if shes right and if you dont screw up
they exit the bar
cates and hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a good view of the alley landing to casey and sallys apartment
what if your girls theory turns out to be bullshit
i mean they could be in rio de janeiro
ive got to play it rough with them
if they know anything im gonna know it
a woman appears turning out to be casey carrying a shopping bag
hey there she is
whatever play i maker just back me up
if we run into billy first let me try and talk him in
sure ill give you a shot at it but ganz is mine
you know that big indian plays it for keeps
yeah and i know ganz sure aint no sweetheart
i wouldnt like it if this partnership ended before it gets started
well you got to admit we come a long way
cates gives him a smile
lets just do it
as casey opens the door and starts toward the
stairs cates and hammond come through the door and grab her
they are now on the ground floor stairwell
i hear youve got visitors
would you guys
no time for any of that crap any more lady
ill rip your lungs out if you dont answer fast
cates has her by the shoulder and arm he twists her like a vise
he means it
she looks at cates knows hammonds correct
dont kill him
please just dont kill him
a long moment
you and the other one youre still billys girls
you always were his girls
sure im crazy in love with him who wouldnt be
youre gonna help us take him
he can live or die
you let us in and hes got a chance to make it
otherwise he gets ventilated
caseys face is seared with pain at the thought of billy dying
if you help use hes got a chance lady
billys in the first room off the hall
hes makin her happy tonight
you dont understand about the way it is with him do ya
in the back
down the other corridor
cates looks at reggie
looks like youre gonna get your chance
they move upward
cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor of the kitchen and living room area
that corridor turns at a sharp angle and goes to the back
hammond is at the very front of that first corridor
at a door
he shoves it back
there is a bed and rosalie undressed is in it
billy is seated on the edge of it
pants on shirt off pulling on his boots
suddenly hammond is pointing a gun at him
give it up billy
you got no shot at it
dont let him hurt met billy
youre not gonna let em hurt me are ya
he wont hurt you
he aint gonna do nothin to you hes just after me
im tellin ya billy give it up
i never was much for bein rehabilitated
billy looks at hammond
with lightning sudden quickness he reaches and produces a huge bowie knife from behind his back
billy smiles laughs
then with a sudden awful roar he leaps at hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol
the big slugs stop billy cold and throw him back against the bed as rosalie shrieks
ganz half dressed asleep gun in hand throws himself off the bed pushes sally out of the way
opens the door and starts firing furiously down the corridor
he grabs the briefcase and runs to the window
cates has ducked the bullets
he is inching toward the door
he pulls it open
ganz from the window fires another shot which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape
sally gets to her feett yelling runs at cates as he appears and futilely tries to hit him
he throws her down on the bed as if she were a doll
he goes to the window
ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground
he stops for a second
then cates appears ganz fires a shot then starts to run
cates keeps coming
hammond hears the gunfire runs out of the room
dives down the fire escape
hammond enters to find it empty of ganz and cates only sally crying hysterically
he runs out
ganz runs out the back alley
hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building
ganz runs turns out of an alley onto a street baked with neon light
hammond runs out turns down the adjoining street
following ganz holding him in sight but unable to get a shot off
hammond running down a street near the one where ganz is being chased
cates fires at ganz
ganz ducks in a doorway
on his street hears the shot
he runs toward it down a narrow alley between two buildings
ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of cates
they move very close to where be is crouched
it is hammond coming toward him
ganz suddenly rolls a garbage can in his path dropping him like a stone
comes toward where he expects to find ganz
ganz has his arm around hammonds throat and his gun to his ear
you come up against me youre gonna lose
hammond drops his gun
continuing hey cop come on
l got something for ya
cates comes out of the doorway from which hes fired
and comes into the middle of the street gun up
he puts it down when he sees ganz with hammond in jeopardy
the hand thats around hammonds throat also holds the black bag
cates walks forward his gun down at his side
after i get outta this cop
im gonna live forever
i dont think youre gonna make it
i got your gun
i got his money
i got everything
hell kill us both
cates still walking
he wont try it
hes a fucking chickenshit cop
theyre all fucking wimps right cates
they are now closer to each other
ganz holding hammond and the money
continuing okay cop
give me your gun and ill let him live
come on cates youre real good at giving up your gun
cates keeps the same methodical pace
suddenly he crouches and fires twice
hammond twists as ganz also fires
ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet backward
his grip on hammond drops hammond dives to the ground looks at cates
jesus christ i didnt think youd really do it
you are crazy
ganz gun still in his hand but his arm useless at his side
cates is frozen in the crouch ready to fire again
ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest
a look of childish disbelief passes over his face
i got hit
i cant believe it
i got shot
end of story
i aint gonna beg for my life
it aint cool
he runs at cates full speed screaming roaring then is stopped by two more bullets that tear fist sized holes in his chest
cates rises from his crouch
takes his gun out of ganz now lifeless hand
then goes over to hammond
cates raises the pistol
continuing you okay
but i wasnt there for a second
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own
just tryin to get the money jack
just tryin to build up a few points on that merit system
cates smiles back picks up the black bag as they move off
cates in the tub steam rushing from the water
elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps
howd they take it back at headquarters
you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend
you know somethin shootin guys sucks
especially compared to this
ive been waiting a long time to hear you say that
yeah bein a hard ass all the time is a real drag but it works
he reaches out lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on the floor
continuing three more hours
where is he
promised id turn my back while he
ah never mind
hes takin care of the same business ill be takin care of soon as i dry off
elaine smiles leans close
thats what i always say
minimal crummy hotel room accommodations
hammond is kissing her at the door finishing buttoning all his buttons
he reaches for a wallet gives her several bills
here you go baby
hey dont do that
i said i wasnt a pro remember
hey no im tryin to be nice
buy yourself something pretty
id do it but i got to go
i got this cop waitin for me
its pretty romantic
she opens the door for him
she stands at the top of the stairs as hammond walks down he calls back to her over his shoulder

maybe ill make an honest woman of you
he gives her a big sniile
continuing ill buy ya the best dinner in san francisco
howd that be
then well go dancin okay
now youre talkin
he moves off still smiling holding the black briefcase
on a picturesque hill above the haight
cates standing near the wheel of hammonds porsche
hammond comes down the porch steps from the hotel
okay reggie start bustin my chops
tell me how great you were with that chick
hey jack real men dont have to go in for that macho bullshit
but i was fantastic
as a riatter of fact i was so good i may have my cock done in bronze
cates holds up the black briefcase
i guess this is what you want to talk about
all the pretty money thats inside here
cates takes the case to the trunk opens it deposits the case locks the trunk
wait a minute cates
ive been waitin three years for that
i dont think its fair man
what about the merit system

another long exchange of looks
then be hands hammond the keys to the trunk
continuing its your money

cates gives him a very skeptical look as they head for the car
hammond gets in behind the wheel cates on the passenger side
cates takes out a cigarette starts to light it
hammond takes the match does it for him
no trouble jack
but listen suppose i stay a crook
whered you get the idea that you could catch me
they both smile
hammond socks it into gear and they drive off into the far distance
