written by gavin oconnor anthony tambakis cliff dorfman a beautiful blue collar city approaching nightfall
the working class poetry of the burgh
paddy conlon exits the doors of a run down church holding a step book
he is followed by a cluster of other people in the program and says his goodbyes
paddy grips the steering wheel with labor calloused hands and drives over the p
mcardle bridge and up a winding hill
he listens to moby dick on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away
with rosary beads swaying from his rear view paddy turns and eases the olds past row houses in a blue collar neighborhood high above the city
tommy conlon hard miles on a handsome face sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat
a duffel bag is at his feet a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands
he reaches into his coat pocket pops a handful of prescription pills and stares off into the approaching night
paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house clicks off the tape kills the engine and climbs out of the car
as he approaches the stairs paddy sees tommy
cant believe his eyes
tommy gives a drunken crooked smile
whatre you doing here
i was just passing through
figured why not have a belt with the old man
father and son look at each other
its obvious its been a long long time
tommy takes a bemused look down at the car
she looks good
patting car hood yeah shes hanging in there
well you always did take good care of her
man of priorities
paddy grins uncomfortably
lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh bottle of jameson
he offers it to paddy
got a little something for ya
mom always said never go anywhere empty handed
but thats not for me anymore tommy
you change brands
paddy shakes his head
tommy looks at him
paddy conlon not drinking
cmon lets go inside
paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused tommy follows
paddy and tommy walk through the front door
the house is clean yet all the furnishings are from the late s
tommy stands in the den and looks around breathing the old place in as paddy makes his way into the kitchen
i like what youve done with the place
the sound of glasses clinking in the kitchen as tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home
he glances down at a bible on a table beside a weathered barca lounge chair
theres not much of a womans touch around here
no more women for me tommy
must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays
tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old photographs lining the walls as paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers
on an old wicker tray
tommy looks at him incredulous
here you go
you havent seen a guy in years and youre not gonna have a drink with him
i told you im off it
im coming up on a thousand days
cmon just one drink
takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos
he takes them in
tommys eyes are drawn to another picture likely taken at a mall photography studio of a man and woman late s posing with a young girl
the man looks like the second boy in the other photos
his brother brendan
hes a school teacher down in philly
tommys face registers surprise
theyve got two beautiful little girls
tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of the woman
obviously his mother
he puts it down glances at the bible then stares hard at paddy
so you found god huh
mom kept calling for him but he wasnt around
i guess jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks
paddy sips his coffee
tommy keeps pressing
so you gonna ask about her or you just gonna sit there all sober
oh you know
what do you know
do you know it wasnt enough just to drive west to get away from you
when we hit the water we drove north too
when i got sober i hired a man to find you
taking a swig is that one of the steps
or does a guy like you get
did your guy tell you what you needed to know
just that your mother died in tacoma
and you were in the marines
that was all
that was enough
thats too bad
you couldve gotten some good details
tommy plops himself into a recliner
glances at the coffee table where a stack of classic books on tape sits
crime and you couldve heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat
having me rub her down with holy water because she didnt have no insurance
all the while waiting for your pal jesus to save her
did your man tell you that
im sorry tommy
its good to know youre sorry pop
goes a long way
paddy chokes up
tommy looks at him
closes his eyes
i think i liked you better when you were a drunk
an overwhelmed paddy sips his coffee and looks at tommy who is fading
the pills are kicking in
he tries to open his eyes but its no use and after a few moments hes out
paddy glances down where some pills have fallen out of tommys pocket and scattered on the rug
he watches his son
relieved and heartbroken at the same time
a chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle class home in the suburbs of philly
a cluster of year olds run about some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree some whizzing down a large blow up slide some getting their faces painted by
a make up artist dressed like a gypsy
tess conlon bounces around the yard multi tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a video camera
she trains the camera on brendan conlon who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf hat and womens make up
whats going on here
well im not sure but i think daddy is now a princess
brendan looks at her with a help me out here expression
em you want to open your presents
the make over ends abruptly at the mention of presents
emily little sister in tow runs over to a table filled with gifts as parents and children gather around
brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows tess over to the gift table
amidst all the presents is one box covered in pink wrapping paper that is far larger than the rest
off pink box this an awfully big box
its her birthday
tess turns the video camera toward brendan again
he couldnt look more ridiculous
and he obviously didnt clear the gift with his wife
he grins at her as she lowers the camera
i know but thats why you call it a budget
you set it and you dont budge
brendan smiles in his make up
kisses his wife
the remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn
tess in a cocktail waitress outfit says goodbye to her mom and the kids who play on the swing set
she walks toward the garage and enters to find brendan pressing free weights on an old bench
brendan continues to lift as tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin
a deep cut hidden earlier by the make up is visible on his cheek
hey babe im late
moms saying goodbye to the girls
shes gotta get on the road
theyve been fed
they just need a bath
im on it
can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight
brendan kisses tess
looks at her outfit
wheres the rest of that skirt
listen if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call okay
off his cut yeah
just like you gave me a call when those temple frat boys decided to smash up your face
i told you most nights i sit on the stool and grade papers but every now and then i need some action
alright well wait up for me tonight
ill see what i can do about that
tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car
a big old school warehouse where a handful of guys whale away at mma punching dummies and roll around on sweat saturated mats
sun slants through a dirty industrial skylight
a no frills kind of gym
behind the front counter fenroy s rolls hand wraps and watches espns mma live on a laptop
and we return here on mma live jon anik alongside billionaire fight promoter j
the tapout crew is also here
punk and skrape are in the building
what led to this project that is redefining mixed martial arts here in the states
well mixed martial arts is a sport that ive always been incredibly passionate about
as for where the idea for sparta came from ive always kind of dug the grand prix format so i tracked these guys down to help me out
came to us he said he wanted to create the super bowl of mixed martial arts
and he decided to put up the five million dollar purse too
well there you have it
it shall be done
hedge fund king j
riley going from the lions den of wall street to the cage promoting the biggest winner take all tournament in mma history
as fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming sparta tournament tommy walks into the gym surveys the room with curiosity and approaches the front desk
fitzy still own this
dont know no fitzy
colt boyd owns this gym
fenroy goes back to his computer
tommy stands there
notices a sparta poster on the wall reading the war on the shore
can i help you with something
hows it work here
thirty five a month with locker
were open at lights out at
you wanna join
fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the counter in front of tommy
put your name and contact info on the card
brendan stands in a classroom surrounded by high school students wearing safety goggles and raising cain
a block of wood sits wedged in a vice and a student tito stands over it with a louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates cheer him on
whoa whoa whoa
theres a lesson in this too ok
so we have a body at rest and you have the bat which needs acceleration
if you have enough acceleration you have might have a chance to break the body at rest
brendan sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face watches as tito brings the bat down on the wood
as it cracks in half the other students cheer wildly
tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with newtons nd law of motion printed on it
there we go
alright tito well done
remind not to mess with you
sit down everybody
dial it down
as tito high fives his way back through the group things settle down and the kids take their seats
so have we got it
a room full of affirmatives with the cocky voice of nash a skinny white kid in a flyers jersey standing out
force equals mass times acceleration
we got it
the third law a black student stephon looks up from his desk
how many laws this dude got
the dude has three
newton the dude says that for every action theres an equal and opposite reaction
brendan looks toward the classroom door where two red and white clad cheerleaders are peering in then walks over to kc a blonde cheerleader seated in his class
she is working a blackberry and doesnt notice him approaching
for example if kc does not stop the action of sending texts in class
brendan stands directly in front of her desk
she quickly shoves the blackberry under a stack of books
and tell her posse outside to beat it
he turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window
then my reaction might be to send her down to principal zitos office
thus setting our world back in proper balance
c i put it away
the class busts on kc as brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it
its clear from the vibe in the room that hes a very popular teacher
then the bell rings
alright before you go i have your tests from last week
fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer
watches mma live and another feature on the big upcoming sparta tournament
tommy wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats works a bag and eyeballs an entourage that surrounds a ring
inside a heavily muscled fighter with a mohawk mad dog grimes s is putting a beating on his sparring partner
the obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that mad dog is somebody important
in the ring the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin goes down in a heap and doesnt get up
colt boyd s clearly in charge throws up his hands as mad dog laughs
where do you find these girls
colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter
glances at mad dog
we got a tournament coming up
you gonna kill every guy in the burgh
get me some ice
and call that puerto rican kid the one that fights outa the bottoms
if hes here in minutes he gets bucks
yo ill fight him
colt turns around and looks at tommy
as does mad dog who smiles down at him from inside the ring
do me a favor guy go back to your bag
we dont need anybody else getting hurt
take a walk
tommy walks back to his bag
mad dog smiles
looks at tommys outfit
yo rock what happened
you leave mick and paulie at home today
walks back to the ring as fenroy approaches
his phones disconnected
then go through the list
get me joe bones
all im saying is if you need somebody to help you im happy to keep your boy warm for you
colt looks at mad dog
what do you think
the mohawked fighter looks at tommy
its his funeral
you ever fought before
colt studies tommy
sees hes serious
this guy sign a waiver
whats your name
you get tuned up in here its on you tommy
sure no problem
come on in
colt boyd waves tommy into the ring
mad dogs entourage starts whispering amongst themselves
snickering at what lays in wait for tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped out of the ring
a trainer tapes tommys hands and gives him some mma gloves
he slips them on then at the sound of a buzzer he starts moving toward mad dog who smirks at tommys aggression and then starts circling him
tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest
grimes staggers back and shakes it off
gonna be a hero
he crouches down gets serious
he throws a right
a leg kick
tommy snaps his head with a jab
then he does it again
then he decks him with a hard right sending mad dog to the canvas to the shock of his entourage and colt boyd
fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring
within moments everyone in the gym stops what theyre doing and watches as tommy grabs the back of mad dogs head hauls it down and launches knee after knee into
tommy starts throwing mad dog around like a rag doll striking him with vicious punches and kicks as fenroy pulls out his cell phone and starts filming the action
as colt boyd screams at mad dog to cover up tommy shoves him against the ropes and blasts away
tommy continues to pound
its a full fledged beating going on in there
finally he crushes mad dog with a vicious left hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes unconscious
silence in the gym
what the hell just happened here
the entourage rushes to mad dogs aid but hes out cold
colt boyd looks on in disbelief as tommy walks across the ring and approaches him
you owe me two hundred bucks
brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer dan taylor s
theyre mid meeting and going over documents
this is the new appraisal figure and this is how it effects the monthly
as you can see that puts you upside down on your mortgage
thats the problem
its the country that did the assessment not the bank
so the numbers are what they are mr
the numbers are what they are brendan
i mean youre a math teacher you can appreciate that
i teach physics
but the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures
according to these figures youre upside down on your mortgage you said that three times already
i get that

because you advised us to do that
i presented you with that option

taylor looks at brendan

off stack of files on desk lot of stories
brendan glares at him
so my option is ive got no options
youre not even gonna try to help me
i am trying brendan
look i can get you days to get even days is not enough
my wife and i have three jobs between us and that doesnt cut it
so what do you suggest
let me ask you a question have you considered bankruptcy
its a viable option
theres no shame in it these days
thats not how i do things
well then youre looking at foreclosure
brendan gets up and storms out of the office
utter domination by tommy conlon the undefeated freshman from pittsburgh
paddy sits in front of the tv and watches an old video tape of a wrestling tournament
the bottom of the screen reads the prodigy has yet to yield a single point in the entire tournament
its just unprecedented
tommy trained by his father since the age of five
youre talking about paddy conlon
the controversial paddy conlon
say what you will about the methods of the former marine but hes led his son to six straight junior olympic titles and now just moments away from a high
school state championship
and there it is
theres just no limit to what the future holds for this kid
as paddy watches the doorbell rings
he makes his way to the door as the tape continues to play
tommy told me that hes chasing the record of theogenes apparently a mythical greek fighter said to be unbeaten in over bouts
paddy opens the door to find colt boyd standing on the stoop
how you doin sir
im looking for tommy riordan
paddy registers the name riordan
my names colt boyd
what business you got with tommy
thats why im here
i manage fighters
colt looks at paddy
jams his hands in his pockets
hes obviously waiting for an invite inside
it doesnt come
tommys been working out at my gym
he put a beating on the number one middleweight contender in the world today
i want to know more about the guy

i have a lot of contacts mr
and anything you want to know about tommy you gotta ask him yourself
im just looking for some general information here
like i said anything you want to know about tommy you gotta ask him yourself
look i dont mean to interrupt your night
he put this address down when he signed up at the gym
he doesnt live here
paddy closes the door on a frustrated colt
brendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and talks on his cell
listen kiddo i need you put mommy back on ok
i love you
im just pulling in
oh theyve got this open mic night thing
should be a quiet one
brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club
a white tent is set up outside and the parking lot is overflowing with cars
something big going on
aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring where two amateur fighters go at it under a bank of sodium lights
hundreds of rowdy locals swill beer and boo lustily when the action slows
mike moore s a fighter sporting sleeves of demonic ink paces in his corner as a cluster of bikers cheer him on from ringside
an announcer walks to the center of the ring with a cordless microphone
its time for our next contest
introducing first fighting out of the red corner from ripley west virginia please welcome mike the mutilator moore
some hollers from the crowd
and in the blue corner
he fights out of philadelphia pennsylvania
please welcome irish brendan conlon
lo and behold theres a shirtless brendan standing in the corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts
on his right shoulder an elaborate tattoo of the conlon family crest
this bout is scheduled for three five minute rounds and when the action begins your referee is mr
the referee enters the ring and stands between brendan and mike moore
fighters to the center
i want you to obey my commands at all times
if you have no questions touch gloves back up and wait for my signal
come out fighting
brendan reaches out to touch gloves with mike moore but his opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner
he means business
brendan looking less sure of himself retreats to his corner
fighters are you ready
the bikers raise hell as the bell sounds
moore comes out bombing
brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers then gets caught in the side of the head with a right hand
he stumbles back into the ropes and moore presses into him swatting at him with his huge hands
brendan absorbs the blows ducks down grabs moore by the legs lifts him and dumps him on the mat with a resounding thud
obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching skills brendan sits on his opponents chest and starts raining down shots banging and banging pulverizing his face and body
its a full on ass whooping going on in there until finally mercifully the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture of cheers from the crowd and boos from the
a winded brendan walks to his corner touches the side of his head wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts and climbs out of the ring where a
two more wins and you take home the bacon
the bedroom door opens and brendan creeps through the room and into the bathroom
its dark except for the moonlight glowing through the window
an exhausted brendan takes off his shirt and begins washing his badly swollen face
then the door opens and tess shuffles in
how was work
brendan doesnt answer
tess slowly wakes up
as she does she gets a look at his face
oh my god
you said it was going to be a slow night
tess studies his face
brendan looks at her
reaches into his pocket and hands her in cash
im not bouncing at a club
what do you mean youre not bouncing
she looks at him
looks at the money
puts it together
youve been lying to me
i went in to apply
they were only paying nine bucks an hour
then i saw a sign for this other thing
tess cant believe what shes hearing
theyre putting us out of the house in three months were running out then theyll put us out of the house in three months
id rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again
i thought we agreed that we werent going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living
were not giving up the house
this is our home
were not going tess reaches up and touches his battered face
calms herself down
embraces her husband
well figure it out
but this is what were not going back to
a steady rain tumbles down over an old school diner in the shadow of the railroad tracks
paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee
judging by the spent sugar packets and the half eaten club sandwich hes been there a while
the front door swings open and tommy enters wearing his watch cap and sweats
he makes his way over to the booth and plops himself down
its clear somethings on his mind but he doesnt say anything
finally paddy engages him
you wanted to talk
im gonna start fighting
dont play babe in the woods with me
i know that guy from the gym came to see you
i didnt tell him anything tommy
we wouldnt be sitting here now if you did
tommy grabs a fry off paddys plate
theres this tournament
a big tournament
top sixteen middleweights in the world
winner take all for a lot of money
im gonna do that
but if im doin it then im gonna need a trainer
now that much you were good at
off paddy grinning no no no
this doesnt mean anything
paddy tries to tether it down but hes happy
tommy looks at him sternly
i dont wanna hear a word about anything but training you understand
you wanna tell your war stories you can take em down to the vfw
you can take em to a meeting or church or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays
what about colt boyd
what about him
i told him i dont train with people i dont know
ah the devil you know
the devil you know is better than the devil you dont
tommy looks at him
grins for the first time
itll be kinda like old times
i just told you this doesnt mean anything
you get that through your skull right now or im walking
paddy calmly sips his coffee then leans in on tommy with a stern look
the old lions got a few teeth left
but you get something through your skull too
you called me
so dont go threatening to walk every five minutes
and since this is about training you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned
i dont want to see em
tommy gives him a hard look but the old man doesnt shy away
in fact hand em over right now
i know theyre on you tommy
you sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door
tommy considers then reaches into his pocket and slides two bottles across the table
thats not gonna do
when you came through that door it was chhh chhh chhh
holding up fingers three
tommy looks at him
fishes another bottle out of his pocket and flips it on the table
off french fries and another thing you dont eat crap like this
this is for losers and old men
and were gonna have to bunk up
if were gonna do this right you gotta stay at the house
i watch your diet we follow the old regimen
the two men stare at each other
tommy looks furious but he doesnt get up
a silent tenuous agreement is reached
brendan his face bruised badly from the night before walks down the hallway toward his classroom
students watch him as he passes and whisper
the class is filled with the kind of buzzing that can only rise off a major rumor
tito nash kc and stephon discuss
my brother said he was at the strip club and saw mr
c fighting mma whats mma
mixed martial arts
like different styles of fighting
your brothers a liar
brendan enters the room
the kids look at him
take your seats
brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class
he is not amused by the murmuring in there
the kids pipe down
then tito speaks up
my brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out
is it true
i mean did you really work on some fools or something
you have to tell us
before brendan can answer he sees principal joe zito s gesturing to him through the window of the classroom
zito taps his watch and points
come see me after class
zito puffy faced hair getting thinner by the hour hangs up his phone as brendan pokes his head in
zito waves him in
eyeballs the marks on his face
cmon its not as bad as it looks
are you being literal or figurative
because literally it looks bad
and figuratively it looks even worse
the superintendents coming by in a few minutes
so gimme a little help here brendan
can you explain to me what the hell you were doing
i need the money joe
yeah but we cant have this
this isnt moonlighting at applebees for christs sake
zito stands up and runs his hands across his head
leaving everything else aside which we cant are you out of your mind
youre gonna get yourself killed
i mean youre a goddamn teacher
youve got no business in the ring with those animals
actually i used to be one of those animals
zito looks at brendan
i fought for a living
guess i forgot to put that down on my application
yeah i guess you did
zito sits back down
look im sorry joe
its just listen the school districts not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs
it was the parking lot of a strip club
wherever it was you cant be doing it alright
i mean this is a serious shit hes here
zito sees the superintendent enter the foyer outside his office
hes looking none too pleased
this is a serious problem
guy hasnt been inside a school since
what are we gonna do
you say yes sir
and you say no sir
and you say itll never happen again sir
and then we just pray to god hes in a good mood
brendan and joe stand up
zito cant tether down a slight grin
joe shakes his head
brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kids bedroom putting glue on the leg of a toy piano
tess enters the bedroom where the girls sleep and leans into the playroom
they speak in whispers
what are you doing
the girls have an important piano recital in the morning
got an equipment malfunction
howd it go
theyre gonna review your case at the end of the semester but until then youre suspended without pay
joe gave me the number of his attorney
how the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney
tess crouches down and enters the tiny room
she sits on the floor
he talked to me for free
as a favor to joe
that was nice
he said theres no precedent for this
youll be back by next semester
they sit in silence
there are no easy solutions
finally brendan speaks up
they have these smoker fights all over
theres one in lancaster next week
theres two in dover the week after
it could keep us afloat
youre gonna put yourself through this over and over for five hundred bucks a pop
some of them pay a little more than that
i would have had to bounce for a month to make what i made in two hours last night
brendan looks at his wife
and these guys theyre not real fighters
theyre just guys who have seen too much ufc on tv
if you have a better solution im all ears
tess sits quietly
knows they have limited options
what are we gonna tell the girls
itll be fine
ill just leave the house as usual except now ill be going to the gym
they look at each other
this is the plan
paddy climbs the stairs with a poster board tucked under his arm and a cup of coffee in his hands
he enters tommys room which is also a monument to the past
old wrestling trophies steelers posters and an empty second bed that obviously once belonged to brendan
oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo and the old red rooster says cock a doodle doo
cock a doodle doo
paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as tommy stirs then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster
its yellowed with age and covered with a boys handwriting
look what i found in that disaster of a basement
whattya say we sit down and update this sometime
you can fill me in on how close you got to that record
tommy says nothing
not a nostalgic bone in his body
the dreams on that poster are long gone
did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother
tell me something
yeah ill tell ya something
you can take that thing back to where you found it
and you can leave the coffee in the pot
i can pour that myself
i can wake myself up too
paddys stung but covers it amiably
hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway
coffee pots on til then i dump it
marine base camp in the middle of the iraqi desert
blackhawk helicopters floating in the sky
marines rushing about
marines of various rank huddle around a computer screen fired up about something theyre watching
damn dude thats brutal
lance corporal mark bradford s walks up to see what the commotion is all about
mad dog grimes gettin tuned up by some dude in a gym in pittsburgh
whos mad dog grimes
the stuff you dont know amazes me
oh my god did you see that
bradford stares at the screen his eyes widening as the marines raise hell about the footage
wait rewind that
one of the marines rewinds the video
bradford looks at the image in disbelief then races out of the tent
bradford hustles outside into the searing sunlight
bradford enters a barracks where private av simers s plays cards with other marines
av i need to see the tape
av drops his cards rushes to his bunk pulls out a steel container loaded with videotapes and sifts through it
they are labeled by day and month
av finds what hes looking for loads it into the camera and hits play
av holds the pause button down as bradford looks at the screen in disbelief
its definitely tommy
in a top mma gym frank campana s works in a ring with brazilian superstar marco santos s and other fighters
the sound of classical music fills the air
let the music sink in to you
this is beethoven
as frank teaches brendan walks in the door
the great trainer notices him and walks over
do i know you
i think i know you
they embrace warmly
long time brother
liking the place frank
thank you brother
off brazilian fighter you see this beast
im training him for sparta
come on back
the two head for the offices at the back of the gym
they walk into an office filled with photos of frank in his fighting days
he was obviously somebody
the walls are also adorned with sparta posters
frank reaches into a mini fridge pulling out a couple bottles of vitamin water
he hands one to brendan and motions for him to sit down
you look good brother

frank looks at his old friend

frank considers what hes hearing
ive got most of my dough tied up in this joint but how much do you need
i didnt come here for a loan frank
i was hoping youd train me

frank starts smiling
leans back in his seat

brendan stands up
shakes franks hand
i appreciate it
let me know when youre coming down
well im just gonna go get my stuff from the car
brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as frank shakes his head
brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home gets out of his camry and looks to the street where paddy stands outside his olds leaning on the passenger door
brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes
hes clearly not happy to see paddy who stands there uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street lamp
its me pop
whatre you doing here
i have some news for you
something wrong with your hands
paddy shakes his head unsure what he means
if theres nothing wrong with your hands then theres no reason for you not to phone
thats the deal
yeah i forgot phone or mail pop
paddy holds his hands out palms down
hey brendan have you ever seen my hands so steady
im going inside
ive got a thousand days
a thousand days sober today
well thats great pop
but it doesnt change anything
what do you mean it doesnt change anything
have a heart brendan
paddys words set brendan off
a side of him we havent seen before emerges
he approaches his father fiercely
you listen to me
you take your have a heart bullshit and you run it down the road
run it out on someone who doesnt know you like i do
i thought maybe we could break bread
open some lines of communication
you got two lines of communication the telephone and the post office
just because you decide its a special day it doesnt make it one for me
i got a wife and kids inside and theyre waiting for me so i dont have time for whatever this is
i know you got a wife and kids in there
i got a grand daughter i havent seen in three years and another i havent even ever met
why is that pop
why is that
do you remember having anything to do with that
casts his eyes down in shame
that shit you pulled
and all the shit i saw growing up
that doesnt happen here
brendan looks at the reformed paddy a measure of sympathy on his face
then he heads for the house
take care of yourself
as hes halfway through the yard paddy calls out
brendan stops in his tracks
he turns and looks at his dad
hes in the burgh
tommys in pittsburgh
he came to see me
he came to see you
hes over at the house
were doing a little training at fitzys
it aint fitzys anymore
brendan walks closer
you and tommy are training together
hes using your mothers maiden name now
i know what her name is
i thought youd want to know hes back
thats why i drove all the way over here
i thought you came to break bread over a thousand days
brendan looks at him
did he say if he wants to see me
he doesnt say much
hes just not that happy kid he was
wow look at you
mister inside man
you and tommy training together like nothing ever happened
this is unbelievable
now i know what youre really doing here
you came to gloat
i did not come to gloat
i came to get my son back
well there you go
you got your son back
im talking about you bren you got your son back
brendan starts to walk away then turns around again
you know part of the reason i stuck around was cause i thought id finally get you all to myself
but you didnt have any interest in training me
tommy was the one
i was a drunk
i mean you know
you were always a front runner
you never had any interest in underdogs
but i was your son
you are my son
yeah you are
im just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me
i forgive you
but i do not trust you
tell tommy this is where i am if he wants to see me
but theyre not different things
youve gotta trust to goodnight pop
paddy looks toward the house where emily rosie and tess stand at the door
my god is that emily
boy shes grown brendan
is that rosie
brendan keeps walking
opens his door to step inside
daddy who is that
just some nice old man
brendan closes the door leaving the heartbroken paddy alone in the yard
tommy his hoodie drenched jogs up the sidewalk and enters the gym
fenroy watches mma live on his computer as tommy walks in the door and heads into the gym
huge news breaking here at espn
koba is coming to america and will fight at sparta
universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived the mighty mythical russian has never fought on u

mad dog grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of colt boyd
when colt sees tommy approaching he turns his attention away from mad dog
got some news for ya
i got you into sparta

off no reaction from tommy thank you and percent is customary
tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging colt though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips
tommy pulls a crumpled piece of paper out of a beat up wallet and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall
more of a shack than a house
pilar fernandez s a pretty but tired mexican girl watches a grainy tv with a six year old boy and a four year old girl as the phone rings
the table it sits on has a framed picture of tommy and another marine on it their arms around each other in the iraqi desert

tommy hoodie up runs in the darkness as paddys olds trails behind him the sound of moby dick playing in the car
frank watches as a team of fighters races up a steep hill
marco is ahead of the pack brendan in the middle
tommy runs hard through an industrial area along the allegheny river
the sky the steel the bridges everythings hard and gray

weve never seen this kind of grand prix tournament in the country before
tell us why the unique format
well jon you know as well as anyone that in mixed martial arts anyone can beat anyone on a given night
brendan takes steady blows from an opponent in another smoker then turns the tables slams his man down and chokes him out
his skills are improving
but with this type of format its gonna be tough to deny who the champion is
in an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long haul rig tires
theyre roughly the size of hot tubs
his strength is astonishing
youve got four fights in two nights sixteen fighters down to one
winners gonna be the last man standing
everyone charging up the hill with frank pushing them
marco leads the charge again but brendan is gaining and a close second
tommy runs across the bridge as paddy follows behind in the olds right at his heels
the pace is relentless
tess and the girls run up the stairs as espn plays on the tv in the den
only five weeks left til sparta and the hype continues for the war on the shore
fourth of july weekend in atlantic city and you know what that means the great koba bringing his act stateside
let me ask you about the other guys
what are they thinking entering a winner take all tournament against a guy that seemingly cant be beat
theyre thinking five million dollars and five million dollars is a lot of money but theyve gotta remember one thing theyre going against koba
tess comes back down the stairs and looks at the screen concern on her face
frank lets himself into the gym at the crack of dawn
finds brendan already there training alone with ferocity and listening to classical music
tommy pounds on tires with a sledge hammer as paddy exhorts him on
its a brutal regimen
fenroy watches mma live on his computer
the pittsburgh beatdown has become one of the most watched videos on youtube this year

it is what it is and hes gonna pay for it next month in atlantic city
brendan works over another fighter in a smoker
he looks fantastic and submits the guy with slick jiu jitsu
up the hill they race brendan now leading the way and marco struggling to catch up with him
tommy and mad dog work out each jumping rope at blinding speed
they eyeball each other the hate increasing
with sparta now only two short weeks away j
riley and the tapout crew returned to the u
after a world tour that saw them visit ten fighters in ten different countries
as marco and brendan train j
riley skyskrape and punkass walk into the gym and warmly greet frank
all obviously old friends
they stopped in philadelphia today to check in on renowned trainer frank campana and top contender marco santos
tommy keeps running paddy in the olds right behind him
youve gotta relax and stay calm in there
the cage is your home
you set the pace
brendan and marco grapple
theyre evenly matched
frank looks on impressed by brendan
you set the rhythm
feel the beethoven
be smarter than him
wait for him to make a mistake
and when he does thats your moment
brendan turns marco and gets him in a knee bar
marco has nowhere to go and is forced to tap
frank jumps in the ring all smiles and slaps brendan on the chest
no he did not tap you
thats the best in the world there son
tommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches the end of the yard
frank brendan and group of other fighters stand at the bottom of the hill and tend to marco santos who has just badly injured his knee
an ambulance pulls in front of the er
a sorely dejected frank walks through an underground parking garage with brendan
you gonna be ok

ill call you tomorrow
frank heads off through the lot
brendan reaches his car stops considers
calls out to frank while jogging toward him
hey i know this isnt a great time

brendan looks hopefully at frank who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his ford bronco
you talking about sparta
you got a better chance of starting a boy band
ill talk to you tomorrow
its a grand prix tournament
which means anything can happen
you know that as well as i do
frank looks at him

brendan grins and walks back toward his car
i love my coach
brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as tess walks out of the house talking on a cordless phone
yeah the girls are good

youve been spending so much time with brendan these days its like youre part of the family or something
yeah hes right here
handing phone to brendan its your boyfriend
i cant thank you enough
i dont know what to say
alright listen ive gotta call you back
brendan hangs up the phone
looks at tess
a look of serious concern crosses tesss face
she puts her hands on her hips
so thats your decision
cause i really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together
brendan doesnt say anything
knows shes right
and that hes about to get laid into
you told me you were gonna fight guys that watched too much ufc
i saw that koba dude on tv and hes the guy theyre watching
its a lot of money tess
i dont give a shit about the money brendan
i told you that

you dont think i can do it
i think you can get killed
im not gonna get killed

but can you promise me youre not going to get hurt
youre not gonna end up in the hospital
youre not gonna end up paralyzed

tess i can promise you this if i dont try theyre gonna take the house

no response from tess who has tears in her eyes
so im gonna go ok
but id really love it if youd be with me on this
tess looks at her husband
wants to support him but cant
im not gonna watch you fight again
im gonna get the girls breakfast
tess starts walking back toward the house
she marches up the lawn without turning back leaving brendan alone in front of his house
he looks at the toys strewn across the yard
surveys the neighborhood
hes going to sparta
fourth of july weekend doesnt officially start until tomorrow
sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches hotels and boardwalks of ac
thousands of people jam the outside of the majestic boardwalk hall
it seems as if everyone on earth is in town
but fight fans are already descending on atlantic city for the super bowl of mixed martial arts sparta
billboards heralding the arrival of the sparta tournament are everywhere
ceremonial fourth of july banners hang cars jam ocean avenue early fireworks pop
the buzz is electric
the greatest show on earth has hit the shore
limousines pull up in front of the boardwalk hall rotunda as mad dog grimes orlando midnight le karl the dane kruller and other fighters make their way down a long
red carpet swarming with fans
in the middle of it all is j
riley greeting press and guests and running the show as the tapout crew colt boyd and others mill about and talk shop
announcers bryan callen s and sam sheridan s corral j
for an interview
youve made a fortune with your hedge funds yet you turned your back on wall street and dedicated your life to making sparta happen
tell us why is this tournament so important to you
growing up we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was right
i wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is
thats why i put this together thats what all these people are here to see and come saturday night thats what were gonna find out
thank you j
and heres something fans never thought theyd see koba is here
the legend arriving to fight on u
soil for the very first time
the great and mighty koba emerges from a white stretch limo trailed by his entourage of tough looking russians
it looks like a movie premiere out there and kobas the star
as workers set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory tommy and paddy hug the corner of the room and wait
not in their element at all
moments later brendan comes walking through the doors
as he moves through the crowded room brendan and tommy make eye contact
they havent seen each other in years and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didnt expect to see each other today
paddy is just as shocked
brendan begins to inch toward tommy but is intercepted by frank who was caught up in the media storm outside
whered you go
you cant leave me like that
they wanna talk to you not me
brendan looks past frank
tommy has risen and headed toward the exit trailed by paddy who calls after him
the sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of atlantic city and sinks into the sea
paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a sparta program and looks proudly at a picture of brendan
he listen to moby dick on his headphones as a tv plays in the foreground
the only fighter missing from the event was dark horse entry tommy riordan
paddy notices the picture of tommy
puts down the program and takes his headphones off
recent revelations that riordan was not only a united states marine but a hero in the iraq war has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to
have come out of nowhere
lance corporal mark bradfords web testimony to riordan who saved his life earlier this year in iraq is spreading like wildfire throughout the media
paddy stares at the screen intently
the bridge just crumbled
the amtrack was upside down
water was coming in from everywhere
the water pressure was too much
we couldnt get the back hatch open
we were all drowning man
it was a death trap
tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite and stares at the tv
i couldnt have had more than another minute
suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off and there he was
before i could get out and thank him he was gone
he just vanished like a ghost
paddy is dumbfounded and looks at tommy who glances at him and back at the tv before heading toward the door
im takin a walk
you saved my life brother
anybody seeing this at sparta anybody out in pittsburgh reach out to tommy riordan
tell him mark said thank you
footage taken from a helmet camera on the ground captured the heroic incident
then the phone rings
paddy grabs it
brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the atlantic ocean lap at the shoreline
boats bob on the water
stray bottle rockets trace through the night sky
in the distance the neon lights of an amusement park flash and zip
behind brendan the big casinos loom advertisements for sparta filling their billboards
brendan continues walking then spots tommy coming toward him
the brothers make eye contact
then approach each other warily
been looking all over for you
hows it going
i was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee
i dont drink coffee
you dont want to go sit down somewhere
im good right here
brendan looks at tommy
sees how rigid he is
a long silence
finally brendan cuts right to it
how was i supposed to know i was never gonna see you guys again
you were briefed
you had the information
you chose the old man and the girl
she wasnt some girl
i married her
shes my wife
brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent christmas photo of tess emily and rosie from his wallet
handing tommy the picture thats tess
and thats emily and rosie
theyre your nieces tommy
tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back
dont know em
i know you dont know them
of course you dont know them
why am i looking at pictures of people i dont know
because thats my family
and who are you exactly
im your brother man
you were in the corps
i said i didnt know you were in the corps
i wasnt in the corps
then you aint no brother to me
my brother was in the corps
with that tommy walks briskly away from brendan and up the beach
his brother runs after him
i was a year old kid
what the hell did i know
i dont know what you know
why dont you go ask your girlfriend about it
shes my wife tommy
so thats it
i stay with tess and i never get to see you guys again
not a single phone call
no response from tommy
hes a wall
god man i dont understand this
you wont forgive me but youll forgive pop
hes just some old vet i train with
he means nothing to me
from what i hear he means nothing to you either so you got balls talking about forgiveness
thats got nothing to do with forgiveness
ive got a family to protect
everything i do is for them
walks away again
but i forgave pop
just like i forgave you and mom
you forgave us
im not surprised you made the tournament brendan
you got some stones
i fell in love tommy
what the hell was i supposed to do
you were supposed to stick to the plan
you were supposed to come with us
mom needed you
i needed you
you were my big brother and you bailed on me
the words hit brendan hard
hey im glad you stayed and everything worked out for you brendan
see you leave you get the opposite
you leave you get to bury people
youre not the only one who suffered tommy
i didnt even know she was sick
i never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother
you had no right to keep that from me
that was not your decision to make
you know what
you walk around with your pictures in your wallet and youre all i forgive you i forgive pop
i forgive everyone
but you know what
youre full of shit
tommy and brendan are right in each others faces
standing on the knifes edge of violence
they hold the stare down for a few long seconds like two fighters about to go to war
are we done brendan
are we finished
tommy and brendan look at each other with burning intensity
too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say
finally tommy turns and walks on down the beach
and a nearly abandoned school parking lot
nash tito and kc wait outside the principals office
its quiet and aside from one secretary theres no one around
after a moment stephon comes walking in and they all stand up and head into the principals office
the kids walk in
zito looks up and shakes his head
you realize youre supposed to seek my wise counsel when schools actually in session right
all four of them laugh nervously
working their way up to something
we want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch mr
c in sparta
what do you say
let me get this straight
you want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for
am i hearing this correctly
i gotta talk to your parents
you guys might need to be in summer school after all
but everyone wants to see it
the gyms the only place thats big enough
its never gonna happen
what if we get a petition
well get the whole school to sign it
the power of democracy
look i appreciate that you guys love your teacher
i really do
but there is nothing i can do for you
zito turns and heads back to his desk
the kids dejected leave the office and walk off down the hallway
the goodyear blimp sparta is here blinking on it floats over atlantic city
fireworks explode majestically above boardwalk hall and fall into the sea where hundreds of boats bob televisions tuned to sparta visible from many of them
thousands of people cram the beach and boardwalk crane their necks toward the sky and watch the stunning pyrotechnics
in the streets limos line up on ocean avenue
even from a distance the excitement and energy are palpable
the roof is about to blow clean off boardwalk hall arena
it might be fourth of july weekend but this is christmas eve for fight fans
this is atlantic city
this is the war on the shore
and this is what everyone has been waiting for
enormous electronic billboards flash outside of the giant seaside casinos
on one koba hangs off the side of a ferris wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a replication of the iconic king kong movie scene
sixteen of the baddest men on the planet duking it out over a hour period for the largest purse in mixed martial arts history
in the town everyone knows from the game of monopoly weve got ourselves a winner take all affair
buckle your seatbelts roll the dice and take riiiiide on the reading
play by play announcer sam sheridan and color analyst bryan callen stand cageside
the arena is packed to capacity and buzzing with anticipation
welcome im bryan callen along with best selling fight author sam sheridan
sam when j
riley conceived sparta he wanted to create quite simply the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle in history
five million dollars bryan
five million dollars
riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen
its unprecedented sam
as is the hoopla surrounding tommy riordan the war hero who has become an overnight sensation
tommy lays on the ground near the showers collecting his thoughts
as paddy watches a tv monitor showing callen and sheridan an official pokes his head into the locker room
five minutes paddy
fenroy and a group of fighters gather around a tv in the gym
a very fired up group
it looks as though the moment of truth has arrived because here comes tommy riordan
as tommy makes his way toward the cage and the strobe lights sweep over nearly screaming fans not one of them sitting
tommy riordans captured the medias attention but the question still remains who is this guy
and more importantly can he compete in this talent pool
can he win
i wish i knew bryan
i wish i knew who he was and ive gotta say the fact that i dont know is strange
in an internet age where there are no secrets this guy is a complete mystery
i cant find out anything about him
tommy riordan is officially google proof
tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and focused look on his face
he seems to want nothing to do with paddy
training is over
its time to fight
you gotta love this guy sam
no walk out music no sponsors no interviews
he skipped out on the press conference
wouldnt have his picture take for the program
hes breaking every rule
the only reason that tommy is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up mad dog grimes in the gym
but the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video which is even more stunning than the mad dog grimes video
let me describe it for you folks for the few who havent seen it and i dont know anyone who hasnt but tommy riordan ripped the door off a tank
in the heat of battle saving lives in the process and then walked away without claiming a medal
he ripped the door off a tank
tommy riordan is a genuine war hero im not taking anything away from the guy
hes a very very tough guy bryan but the tank dont hit back
weve seen youtube sensations fail on the big stage before
tommy stands outside the cage and has vaseline applied to his face
he looks like hes ready to murder someone
he ripped the door off a tank
frank holds mitts for brendan as a tv plays
tommy riordan definitely has his hands full in his first opponent francisco barbosa
barbosa is nothing to scoff at
yeah hes the real deal
very tough guy
very high caliber fighter
tommy riordan came out of nowhere and i imagine hes going to disappear just as quickly
great story but i think your boy is about to be exposed as a youtube sensation
on tv screen referee josh rosenthal s gives instructions to tommy and his opponent francisco barbosa s
the tommy and barbosa face to face as josh rosenthal instructs
gentlemen youve been given your instructions
i expect a clean fight
obey my commands at all times
defend yourselves at all times
touch gloves go back lets do this
in the crowd two sections of marines in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for tommy who returns to his corner
paddy attempts to give him some advice but tommy is not listening
were about to get the big answer to the big question is tommy riordan for real
and here we go
the bell rings
and tommy comes out fast and hard
barbosas gonna be looking for a take down
definitely gonna be looking for a take down
there will not be a take down
tommy ducks a blow then levels barbosa with a massive and brutal left hook
the brazilians head snaps sideways his mouthpiece goes flying and he does a face plant on to the canvas
barbosa is down
barbosa has been knocked out
tommy riordan is most definitely for real
as the crowd erupts and josh rosenthal waves to barbosas corner to get a medic in there tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement
and now hes walking out of the cage
hes leaving the cage
there goes another rule out the window
fenroy and the boys fired up
they cant believe the ferocious knockout theyve just witnessed
francisco barbosa is out cold and he is out of this tournament bryan
the official pokes his head into the locker room where frank and a nervous brendan sit alone
on the tv monitor tommys annihilating knockout of francisco barbosa plays
then in the distance the strains of classical music can be heard
brendan looks at frank who smiles and puts his hands on brendans shoulders
you can do this
he grabs the nervous brendans head between his hands
i want to hear you say it
i can do this
then lets go do this
buzzing in the crowd
another fight close at hand
riley had less than hours to fill marco santos spot and he basically had to rely on the word of frank campana
and he chose brendan conlon which quite frankly is something i just dont understand
brendan and frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena where paddy is waiting his all access pass around his neck
brendan notices the old man as he approaches
go get em son
brendan barely acknowledges paddy and keeps walking
frank looks at brendan with a who the hell is that
as they approach the dark lights of the arena beethoven continues to boom out over the loud speakers
i can understand coming out to no music by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance
this is beethoven bryan
this is ode to joy
my apologies mr
you want to talk about renaissance men you gotta talk about frank campana
very unorthodox trainer and one of the best in the game
hes well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm to remain patient and to remain composed under pressure
brendan and frank make their way through the crowd and toward cageside where bryan callen reaches beneath his seat
classical music is about as fitting to this setting as brendan conlon is to this tournament
in fact let me show you something
callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a goldfish inside
this is brendan conlon
hes a feeder fish and hes about to get dropped into a shark tank
brendan gets greased up then climbs into the cage
cmon give the guy a break
at least weve seen him fight before
he was in the ufc
we remember him
i remember him too
i remember him being very unmemorable
a nervous tess sits at the table failing to concentrate on folding laundry
the tv in front of her is off but she glances at it anyway
in front of her sits a cell phone
she glances at it repeatedly
brendan stands in the corner as his opponent orlando midnight le climbs in shoulders bulging and abs shredded
midnight le getting ready to climb into the cage and go to work
when the brackets were announced midnight thought hed be going up against marco santos
hes gotta be thrilled to be seeing brendan conlon standing across from him
brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive midnight le
frank smiles at him
you asked for it
brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd
brendan retired from fighting some years ago hes actually a high school physics teacher now and midnight had some fun with that at the press conference
he said he was gonna give the teacher a serious lesson and that getting killed was no way to spend a summer vacation
josh rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the cage for instructions
alright gentleman youve been given your instructions i expect a clean fight
obey my commands at all times
defend yourselves at all times
touch gloves go back lets do this
the fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell
have some fun baby
at the sound of the bell midnight le comes out hard and strong
he repeatedly kicks brendan in the leg and batters him with strikes
his power is overwhelming brendan
paddy stares at the tv monitor
tommy lays on the rubdown table his eyes closed
no interest in brendans fight
joe zito sits on a couch in his suburban home and watches brendan on tv
hes a nervous wreck
you gotta move
frank exhorts brendan from cageside telling him to relax but its no use
its an unholy beating going in the cage
zito drinks a glass of scotch
midnight is all over brendan
this cant last much longer
this wont last much longer
the teacher just has no answers
zito leans forward
he looks as if hes going to have a heart attack
cmon brendan get outta there
midnight le takes brendan to the ground
brendan tries to escape but turns his back allowing midnight to sink in a rear naked choke
he puts the strangle hold on brendan and squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps
get out of there
get out of there
brendan tries to pry midnights hands off him
and now hes got the hooks in
the end is near
can he make it to the end of the round is the question
midnight squeezes for all its worth as frank screams at brendan imploring him not to tap
seconds left and brendans face is turning purple
conlons whole world is about to go from day to night
brendan is on the verge of going unconscious but he refuses to tap out
then the horn blows ending the round
the crowd cant believe brendan hung in there and neither can midnight le who slams the canvas in frustration
as midnight walks back toward his angry trainer who expected him to finish brendan early the teacher heads toward a smiling frank
he doesnt know what hit him
brendan grins at franks positive spin on things then looks across the cage at midnight le who glares at brendan
the frazzled zito continues to root for brendan
an excited paddy watches brendan on the monitor
midnight continues pounding on brendan but brendan starts giving back working a few leg kicks of his own
he seems to be gaining confidence
from cageside frank hollers words of encouragement as the battle continues
back and forth they go
midnight rocks brendan with a right hand
brendan recovers and fires back
then midnight shoots in for a take down but brendan dodges him reverses position and suddenly takes a shocked midnight down to the ground
the crowd is on its collective feet
hes got a kimura locked in
are you kidding me
brendan locks up midnights shoulder
the bigger fighter struggles to get free but he seems to be trapped
from cageside frank screams instructing brendan on how to finish the move
midnight is in big trouble
i dont think hes got anywhere to go
this isnt happening
this cant happen
midnight taps and the crowd explodes
shock and mayhem throughout the arena
it just did bryan
brendan conlon tapped midnight
i cant believe it
principal zito leaps off his couch screaming in celebration
zitos wife s drying dishes pokes her head in the room as the principal pumps his fist over and over
he tapped him out
he tapped him out
he did it
he did it
he did it
this is what makes mixed martial arts so great
theres so many ways to lose
one tiny miscalculation at any time and thats it
frank campana embracing his man brendan conlon
i dont think either one of them can believe what just happened
frank and brendan embrace
the arena is buzzing
midnight gets off the canvas and brendan approaches him and bows
the dejected midnight bows in return
great show of sportsmanship from the teacher
thats a hallmark of frank campanas philosophy right there
midnight le is shocked
he thought he had a free pass into the second round but instead hes going home
he dominated the fight the entire way but fell prey to a very technical finish
very technical finish but come on thats a fluke
a jubilant brendan raises his arms in victory
the crowd responds to the gutsy underdog
you call it a fluke
i call it a guy maintaining composure and waiting for his opportunity
conlon beats midnight
as the celebration continues callen looks at sheridan and shakes his head
was he ever wrong
i hope you got a receipt for your goldfish
tess sits on the couch tv still off
her phone beeps
she grabs it quickly
a text reads i won
she starts dancing around the room kissing her phone
tommy and paddy sit and watch the monitor
were down to eight fighters soon to be seven as koba prepares to go to work for the second time tonight
at the sound of the bell koba sprints across the ring and delivers a flying kick to the chest of his already retreating opponent
he picks him up with incredible strength then slams him into the ground and pounds his brains in
the whole thing is over in under seconds
that was quick
once again koba does not break a sweat
im afraid he might have broken something else sam
its certainly possible bryan
koba moving on to tomorrow night
brendan and frank stare at a monitor
they look worried
on tv screen kobas opponent getting attended to after the tommy and paddy sit on stools opposite each other paddy taping him up
tommy keeps a lazy eye on a monitor where mad dog grimes is fighting
mad dog fighting like a man possessed
like a man with something to prove
mad dog said he had a message for tommy riordan and there it is right there
brendan and frank stand in the tunnel as the house lights go down in the arena
here comes the underdog brendan conlon
the teacher miraculously passed his first test but now hes gotta face the dane
paddy stands amidst the crowd in the tunnel and gives brendan a thumbs up
you can do it brendan
brendan glares at him and marches toward the cage
tess now watching the fights on tv stands in front of the screen and bites her nails
she looks like shes about to throw up
kruller s who pounds on him without mercy
halfway through round three now and the beating continues
i honestly dont know how brendan conlon is still standing sam
he has been absolutely battered in both his fights tonight
karl the dane kruller presses brendan against the fence and knees him repeatedly in the midsection
tess can barely watch the beating
frank shouts instructions as brendan and the dane tangle against the fence
take him down
brendan grabs kruller and flips him to the canvas
then he spins for an arm bar a move similar to one seen earlier in the smoker fights
zito now joined by his wife
both on the edge of the couch and sucked into the action
brendan twists krullers arm
hes got him in a terrible position much like midnight
the dane squirms
looks for an escape
its not there
with brendan applying tremendous pressure to his arm he taps
paddy watches from the tunnel as the crowd goes insane
thats it brendan
tess does a wild jig in front of the tv
zito and his wife arm in arm in celebration
do it one time its a fluke do it twice thats something else
frank and a victorious brendan embrace
pull the bandwagon over i think im hopping on
i think im a believer
paddys waiting in the tunnel for brendan who comes through full of adrenaline
way to go brendan
id doing this

fenroy and the gang around the big screen again
the crowd catching fire for war hero tommy riordan
he doesnt seem to want anything to do with all this adulation bryan
hes just here to fight
tommy climbs into the cage
a mexican fighter diego santana s is waiting for him
josh rosenthal points at both men
gentlemen you ready
lets go to war
the bell rings and tommy goes right after santana and starts administering a beating
he bullies him into the cage and starts raining blows all over him
here he comes again like a buzzsaw
tommy is all over diego santana
the crowd raising cain for tommy
josh rosenthal pulls tommy off the brutalized diego santana before he kills him
once again tommy marches straight out of the cage
there he goes again
storming right out of the cage
tommy marches past paddy again then off through the crowd
tommy riordan marching through the crowd and straight into the final four
the arena is on its collective feet chanting tommy
as paddy looks on and tommy disappears into the darkness of the tunnel the sound of cheering fades
dawn breaks over atlantic city
a cleaning woman vacuums as an elevator door dings and opens
out comes paddy
the casino is nearly empty the only sounds coming from the tinny ringing of a handful of slot machines
from a distance paddy spots tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of triple american glory slot machines mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver
and pulling the lever with a thousand yard stare
paddy approaches tommy who doesnt acknowledge him
cant sleep huh
tommy feeds the machine and pulls
paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to tommy
i know that other things bothering the hell out of you but im proud of you
what you did for that kid in the tank
that was really something
how about deserting my unit
is that really something too
i was on my way outta country when i came across those guys
what was i supposed to do let em drown
whatd you do
whatd i do

paddy starts putting things together
thats why you go by riordan
thats why the press cant find your service records
tommy doesnt respond
what the hell happened over there tommy
that is none of your business
come on kiddo
ive been there
ive done it
ive seen it
you can trust me
spare me the compassionate father routine pop
the suit dont fit
im really trying here tommy
where were you when it mattered
i needed this guy back when i was a kid
i dont need you now
its too late now
everythings already happened
you and brendan dont seem to understand that
let me explain something to you the only thing i have in common with brendan conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you
he cant fathom the anger in tommy yet he knows hes responsible
its written all over him
tears well up in his eyes
they seem to make tommy madder
look at you
yeah i was right
i think i liked you better when you were a drunk
at least you had some balls then
not like now
tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out
take it somewhere else old man
tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic cup made for holding coins and dips it into his tray filling it with in fact you know what
heres a cup
why dont you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes
go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about
go on get outta here
get the fuck outta here
tommy whips the bucket toward his father splashing coins into his face
a stunned paddy tears streaming down his face walks off
a handful of late night gamblers look at tommy who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his slot machine as his destroyed father limps away
fourth of july weekend in full swing down the shore
paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained v neck clutching his walkman and a bottle of whiskey
moby dick plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off
liquor bottles are strewn everywhere
he has obviously fallen off the wagon
god pity em
all shall perish except me
stop the ship you bastards
he staggers around the room giving a fragmented soliloquy to no audience
god pity em
stop the ship
please stop the ship
somebody help em
suddenly the adjoining door swings open
tommy hair disheveled looks in and sees paddys state
the old man thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at tommy
you godless sonofabitch
paddy staggers over and gets in tommys face his own face blotched and contorted
the old paddy conlon revealed
the monster from the past
you stop the ship you godless sonofabitch
theres no anger in tommy
he simply walks toward the old man and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand
as he struggles to take it the walkman falls to the ground
faint dialogue is heard coming from the earphones
stop the ship
for the love of god
the old man is running out of steam
he begins weeping
please stop the ship
paddy wobbles tears streaming down his face
tommy looks at him
the first time weve seen anything resembling compassion on that relentless face of his
he hugs his father and pries the whiskey bottle from his hand were lost
were all lost tommy
well never make it back
tommy pulls his father back on to the bed
puts his arms around his chest and tries to quiet the old man
its a tender moment and it seems as if tommy is only able to relate to the brutal former version of the father he knew
i always loved you
you know that dont you tommy
i always loved you
you and your brother
my two boys
tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into the room
the end of a very long night
a bigger even more bombastic fireworks display than before explodes over atlantic city
if its possible the crowds on the beach and boardwalk have swelled
it seems as if the entire east coast has descended on ac
outside boardwalk hall the giant electronic billboard has a new motif
koba still swings mightily from the side of a ferris wheel but now tommy in a camouflage superhero outfit flies right toward him
on a collision course
mad dog grimes holds on to tommys cape trying to slow him down and below the three of them in miniature is brendan holding a sling shot
the crowd at a fever pitch
two sections full of marines in dress uniforms cheer insanely
so does an entire section of girls wearing camouflage tank tops and holding up signs reading tommy girls
everyone in the arena chants tommy
a cult hero has been born
tommy riordan coming down the tunnel without his trainer
colts is packed
people off the street
vets in fatigues
a bigger crowd than before
once again no walk out music
i wouldnt say no walk out music sam
listen to this
the marines are on their feet singing halls of montezuma at the top of their lungs
from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli we will fight our countrys battles in the air on land and sea
at cageside sheridan leans over to callen raising his voice to be heard above the marines
it sounds like vj day in times square bryan
ive never seen anything like it
tommy climbs up the stairs and into the cage
he turns and nods at the marines
tommy acknowledging his comrades for the first time and climbing into the cage
the crowd at the gym both cheers and jeers at the tv
mad dog grimes has been looking for revenge ever since the day tommy riordan walked into his gym in pittsburgh and turned his life upside down
its been a very long very miserable few months for mad dog to say the least
mad dog and tommy in a stare down as josh rosenthal attempts to give them instructions
unless mad dogs mother is in the building every single person in the boardwalk hall is rooting for tommy
mad dog mocking tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight and the marines are really letting mad dog have it
the marines hoot and holler at mad dog as josh rosenthal goes over his instructions with the two fighters
alright gentlemen youve been given your instructions
i expect a clean fight
obey my commands at all times
defend yourselves at all times
touch gloves go back lets do this
in the center of the cage mad dog is practically spitting in tommys face
tommys eyelids droop
he could not be less intimidated
its not gonna happen again
callen and sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners
the anticipation in the arena is incredible
mad dog predicted an early knockout
said he was gonna knock tommy out with one punch
lets see what tommy has to say about that
josh rosenthal looks at tommy and mad dog
gentlemen you ready
lets go to war
and they are off
tommy goes after mad dog like its the last night on earth
what tommy did to him at colts gym was an exercise in restraint compared to whats happening in that cage
tommy tackles him and hes on top
hes raining blows
someone has to stop this
mad dog is on his back and being pounded on
tommys rage is shocking even by his own brutal standards
from cageside colt boyd screams at josh rosenthal
stop the fight
its such a savage beating so malicious that rosenthal has to climb on tommys back to get him off of mad dog
if his mother is indeed in the crowd she couldnt recognize him now
beaten to an absolute pulp
thats the fastest knockout i think ive ever seen
mad dog grimes has been poleaxed
he is not moving
tommy marches out of the cage and past colt boyd punkass and skyskrape who cant believe what they just witnessed
neither can anyone else at boardwalk hall
in the cage a medic tends to mad dog
ill tell you what you do that to someone on the street and theyd lock you up and throw away the key
break out the yellow tape sam
tommys walking away from the cage like hes leaving a crime scene
ode to joy is heard coming from distant speakers as rows of cars line up at the entrance and pull into the lot
pull back to reveal an enormous old drive in movie theater packed with a raucous crowd
on the gigantic movie screen brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage
as he does cheers erupt in the parking lot
stephon nash kc tito and some of the other students from brendans class root him on
they came up with a pretty good plan b
as the kids get fired up for the fight theyre joined by a familiar face that emerges from the crowd
tito shakes his hand
look whos here
brendan climbs into the cage to a major ovation from the crowd
theyre completely on his side now
brendan conlon came into this tournament as a to underdog and now here he is in the final four
the crowds showing their appreciation
theyre giving him quite the reception
hes getting a huge reception
i mean this guy shocked everybody last night
brendan stands in the corner
frank leans over the railing of the cage and smiles at him
youve got a visitor
second row oclock
buzzing in the arena
the lights about to go down for the entrance of koba
before they do brendan looks up to see a familiar face at cageside
he cant believe his eyes
you alright with that
brendan looks at his wife
she smiles broadly
mouths the words i love you
kisses his glove and presses it against the cage
as he does the lights go out inside the arena and ominous russian music blares
and here comes the great russian koba
koba is so intimidating
his reputation is larger than life
the crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his way toward the cage
so does frank
tess takes a quick glance at koba then looks away
she cant bear it
i want you to look right at him when he comes in here
dont take your eyes off him
brendan nods then looks at tess
frank leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter
im proud of you brother
this is your cage
finally the creepy music subsides and the great russian climbs into the cage
hes massive and the crowd stares at him like an exotic animal
josh rosenthal calls brendan and koba to the center of the cage
the russian looks at brendan with the cold dispassionate eyes of a killer
brendan does his best to hold his gaze
alright gentlemen youve been given your instructions
i expect a clean fight
obey my commands at all times
defend yourselves at all times
touch gloves go back lets do this
brendan retreats to his corner
takes a deep breath
should i be nervous for brendan
cause i am
i want to stop the fight before it even begins
gentlemen you ready
lets go to war
koba comes straight at brendan
his speed and strength are astonishing
now the question is how long can brendan conlon stay alive
franks screams at brendan to keep his distance
tess watches through her fingers
and koba keeps coming snapping brendans head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an uppercut to the chin
the russian is doing whatever he wants to brendan
he slices him up with strikes
bruises his legs with kicks
works him against the fence
power slams him
koba just pounding on brendan conlon
hes pounding on him like a side of beef
thousands of people staring at the drive in screen and you can hear a pin drop
zito can hardly look
kc buries her head in nashs chest
koba gets brendan in a bear hug lifts him off the ground carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of laundry and body slams him on
kobas got him in the air
as frank screams for brendan to remain calm a mortified tess watches
mercifully the horn sounds and brendan survives the round
he barely makes it back to his corner
frank campana has to think seriously about stopping this
how much abuse can one man take
the minutes passes in no time
its time to go again
lets go to war
koba comes right after brendan and its soon more of the same
brendans face is carved up and battered
he tries to go for a take down but koba snuffs it then lifts brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air
frank screams but theres nothing he can do
brendan is brutally slammed into the ground
uh oh brendans going for ride
that one shook the entire building
as brendan writhes on the ground koba grabs him and slings him against the fence like its nothing
brendan flies through the air and rattles against the cage
then koba climbs on top of him and starts whaling away
tess cant even watch it
once again just as rosenthal is about to stop the fight the horn sounds
everyone has gotta be concerned about brendan conlons bravery getting him into trouble here
his bravery can get him killed sam
hes got nothing more to prove
hes already lasted two rounds against koba which is more than anyone else can say
you wonder whats keeping this guy up
brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool
frank enters the cage
his usual positive attitude is gone
he comes at brendan with aggression instead
grabbing brendans face look at me
look at me
why are we here brendan
why are we here
are we here to win this fight
you tell me cause if were not ill throw in the towel right now
well get tess and we will go home
you dont knock him out you lose the fight
you dont knock him out you dont have a home
josh rosenthal claps his hands
frank takes his cue to leave but not before giving brendan one last look
its now or never
brendan looks across the cage at koba
lets go to war
brendan comes out and meets koba in the center of the cage but the russian resumes his supremacy
conlon somehow answering the bell for round three but kobas all over him again
koba roughs the battered brendan up some more but then brendan starts responding
throws a couple effective leg kicks
a decent punch or two
brendans giving back bryan
there are signs of life in brendan conlon
hes starting to mix it up
the parking lot is quiet and tense
zito and the kids stare at the movie screen
the russian squeezes away
kobas got him caught in an iron vice squeezing for all its worth and trying to choke the teacher out
frank screams at brendan to stay calm
to wait for his moment
koba continues to squeeze
brendans face turns more and more red
finally he grabs kobas shorts musters up all the strength he has left and tosses the russian on his back freeing himself from the choke in the process
he just launched koba
can you believe this
conlon just shook off a guillotine
brendan jumps on koba and attempts his own choke
conlons staying after him
hes squeezing him
the tables have turned and the boy scout is squeezing the bear
koba shakes off brendans submission attempt and stands
brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of blows
brendans giving as good as hes getting
conlon standing and trading with the russian
ive never seen this
this is a fight
weve got ourselves a fight
brendan snaps kobas head back with a left but the russian responds with a combination
brendan stumbles backwards and koba grabs him and tries to take him down
brendan throws a left elbow that connects with kobas temple
the russian is momentarily stunned long enough for brendan to take him to the ground and wrap his arms around kobas knee
conlon going for a knee bar
hes got it very deep
hes deep on that knee bar
brendan wrenches his body for all its worth
frank pounds on the apron of the cage
the russian tries to squirm away but he cant
his face is contorted in pain
the cageside official indicates theres only seconds left in the fight
brendan conlon wrenching that knee for all its worth
hes putting everything he has in it and koba is screaming in pain
grimaces in agony
brendan keeps wrenching his knee
he cant take it
he did it
brendan conlon has tapped koba
i cant believe it
he cant believe it
frank campana cant believe it
this whole place cant believe it
the drive in crowd goes absolutely berserk
tito leaps into nashs arms
stephon hugs kc
zito pumps his fist in the air
thats gotta be the biggest upset in mma history
brendan conlon has tapped the great koba
tess stands on her seat shrieking
brendan climbs on top of the railing and lifts his arms in the air a look off shock on his face
the arena goes bananas
brendan conlon the physics teacher
brendan conlon the civilian
hes done the impossible
hes pulled off a miracle
this place is going crazy cause weve just seen a miracle
pure bedlam in boardwalk hall
frank going wild
the tapout crew
just an extraordinary scene
finally the noise fades away
this is cnn breaking news
riley the tapout crew and a few officials stand over a computer screen on press row
they wear headphones and shocked expressions
a surprising turn in the story of iraq war hero tommy riordan
cnn has learned that riordans true identity is that of marine staff sergeant thomas conlon who went awol from his unit earlier this year following the friendly fire death of
his brother in arms sergeant manny fernandez
fernandez wife pilar fernandez spoke with me in an exclusive interview moments ago
riley and the others look at one another
they cant believe what theyre hearing
bombs started dropping
they were coming from u
tommy and manny were waving their flags to let them know they were americans but they didnt stop
everyone except tommy
you know my manny used to say tommy was the brother he never had
two marine mps stand guard outside tommys locker room
conlon who is fighting in the mixed martial arts mega tournament sparta is expected to be taken into custody by military police following tonights winner take all finale in atlantic
tommy sits in his locker room
another mp stands behind him
if victorious he has pledged his five million dollar purse to the widow of his fallen comrade
riley sidles up between callen and sheridan and whispers in their ears
theyre stunned by the news as well
tito and the kids sit on the hoods of cars eating hot dogs and waiting for the final fight
joe zito looks up at the movie screen where bryan callen makes an announcement
weve just got some incredible news that im having trouble putting into context but here it is the two men fighting for the championship tonight for the five million dollar
prize for the middle weight championship of the world are brothers
stunned expressions from zito kc nash stephon tito and everyone at the drive in
the wild night has taken an unexpected turn
brendan frank and tess sit in the locker room
on the monitor callen and sheridan continue to discuss the situation
brendan has ice packs on his shoulders and knees and his face is a mess after three brutal wars in hours
what are you gonna do
im gonna fight him
tommy sits by himself in his locker room the weight of the world pulling his shoulders down
his black hoodie is over his head
he couldnt be more alone
a sobered up paddy runs out of the hotel and climbs into a waiting taxi
brendan and frank make the long walk down the tunnel and into the arena
unlike previous trips there is no joy on their faces
its a grim march to the cage
people stand on cars
each others shoulders
tito kc nash stephon and the other students start chanting mis ter c
mis ter c
mis ter c
tommy rises and walks toward the door
he marches out the door and into the bowels of the arena moving past mps as he goes
his march is as grim as brendans
brendan and frank embrace
one more time
brendan climbs into the cage as the house lights dim
the crowd is going bonkers
and they explode when tommy appears at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his march toward the cage
the marines shower him with cheers and hoo ahs
the girls scream
the rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants his name
but he acknowledges no one and the hard look on his face never wavers
fenroy and the crew on the edge of their seats all staring at the big screen
a nervous paddy sits in the back of the cab as the driver navigates through holiday traffic
and here it is
the two brothers face to face in the middle of the ring staring each other down
tommy with his usual controlled fire brendan intense searching his brothers eyes for some flicker of recognition
gentlemen this is the final
i expect a clean fight
obey my commands at all times
defend yourselves at all times
touch gloves go back lets do this
as rosenthal finishes his instructions brendan peers into tommys empty corner
tommy turns without answering
brendan returns to his corner
looks at tess
so much emotion on her face
gentlemen are you ready
are you ready
lets go to war
tommy comes right after his brother
just like with his previous three opponents
a natural wrecking machine
frank screams at brendan to stay calm but tommy is all over him pounding on him with savage intensity
as bad as the other fights were for brendan this one is worse
the crowd is tense and subdued
its not going well
fenroy and company thoroughly enjoying themselves
tommy continues to batter brendan then he swoops in picks him up and slams his big brother into the ground
then he does it again
brendan the wind knocked out of him is on his back trying to protect himself from tommy who mounts him and starts blasting away with a blur of lefts and
the only thing that saves brendan is the horn
which tommy ignores blasting his brother with a brutal cheap shot to the jaw well after the round had ended
what was that
brendan lays on the ground as josh rosenthal pulls tommy off him and admonishes him for the cheap shot
tommy stares at brendan
you want more
frank runs into the cage with the stool and brendan limps over to him and sits down
brendan stares at tommy who paces in his corner like a caged animal
look at me
look at me brendan
let it go
hes coming hard just like we planned
i want you to angle out hit and move
angle out hit and move
hes not your brother right
hes just a guy whos in the way
josh rosenthal claps his hands
frank glares at him as he picks up the stool
im taking a little more time for the cheap shot
do your job josh
tess sits uncomfortably in her chair
her husbands face is a mess
in front of her callen and sheridan commiserate
the tapout crew and colt boyd look on
the electricity in the crowd is greater than ever
they want a champion
very quiet at the drive in
its tough for everyone to watch whats happening to brendan
the marines in the crowd are all on their feet screaming for tommy to end it
the chant starts up again
frank tries to instruct brendan but he cant hear him and hes too overwhelmed
tommy presses brendan against the cage and does the same thing koba did
he lifts him off the ground carries him on a dead run and body slams him so hard the cage shakes
then tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again
the horn sounds ending the round but this time its brendan who pops up and pushes tommy
tommy shoves him back
rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its approval
here we go mom
time to lock up your china the boys are at it again
fenroy and company watching the big screen
again tommy is on top of brendan trying to ground and pound him into submission
frank leaning on the apron nearby screams at brendan
tommy tries to pound brendan out but brendan latches on to tommys arm wraps his legs around him and reverses position just as he did with midnight the dane and
tommy is in deep trouble
brendan pushes him face down on the canvas and cranks his shoulder
theres no escape
oh my god thats a deep omoplata
hes doing it again
conlons doing it again
this is going to be over
brendan applies intense pressure
tommys shoulder is contorted wrenched backwards and his face is a mask of pain
tommys in agony but he wont give in
tommy shrieks like an animal but still wont quit
in fact he elbows brendan in the face in defiance
brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more
its at the breaking point
the shoulder twists
and then audible only to tommy and brendan crack
then the horn ending the round
brendan worried he hurt his brother leans over to see if tommys alright but tommy like a wounded animal leaps up and grabs brendan around the throat with his one
he shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence and it takes rosenthal and frank to separate them
the crowd fired up by brendans comeback and mesmerized by whats taking place in the cage between the brothers
its complete and utter chaos in there
sheer amazement that tommy didnt submit
tommy flap down tears of pain pouring down his face stands defiantly in his corner
in the other corner frank attends brendan
in the crowd tess covers her mouth
she cant believe what tommy allowed to happen to him
frank puts the stool down and gives brendan some water
brendans face is wracked with guilt and concern over his brother
i popped his shoulder
i heard it tear
you popped his shoulder
i want you to pop his other shoulder
this is not what brendan wants to hear
he looks over to josh rosenthal
grabs brendan by the face
look at me
you got two rounds left
you need both rounds
go in there kick him in the head take him down and finish him
rosenthal claps his hands
frank exits the cage
the wounded tommy stands in his corner his ruined left arm hanging low
brendan makes eye contact with him
what are you doing
what are you that crazy
lets go to war
the bell sounds
round four begins
tommy throws useless right jabs
hes one handed and has no chance
brendan stays away from him not wanting to hurt his brother
what are you doing
frank screams at brendan from cageside to take the wounded tommy out but brendan is reluctant
its over tommy
we dont have to do this
tommy and brendan circle each other
tommy throwing rights and wincing in agony at any movement
brendan stares at him
everything about him says quit tommy
but tommy wont
paddy runs up the tunnel his all access pass around his neck and enters the arena
sees brendan and tommy in the cage
quickly figures out what the situation is
zito and the kids staring at the screen imploring brendan to take the helpless tommy out and win the championship
brendan continues to circle and not engage
frank is livid
he knows hell lose the fight on the judges scorecards if he doesnt do something
you finish him
tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at brendan
finally with no choice brendan fires back
he batters the defenseless tommy up against the cage and pounds away at him blasting his left shoulder with punches that make tommy wince in pain
its anyones guess how he can take it
brendan presses his brother up against the cage
begging him to quit
but tommy merely responds by elbowing brendan in the face again
this sets the older brother off and he resumes pounding on tommy until the horn sounds and rosenthal pulls brendan away
brendan heads back to his stool as tommy leans against the cage in agony
the marines scream for him but his eyes are glazed over
its unthinkable that he hasnt broken yet
from near cageside paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with brendan
they exchange a small look of understanding
they both know what needs to be done
the crowd wants a victory
tito and the boys start the mis ter c
tommy and brendan stand for round five
tommys face is battered after round four and brendans face is ruined
in the crowd the tommy chant begins in earnest
in fact it may be louder than ever
having done the impossible and carried on with one arm tommy is more superhuman and heroic than ever before
but his face tells another story
soaked in pain and anguish
all his stoic walls crumbling down
all eyes riveted to the screen where the brothers circle each other as in the fourth round
brendan slams tommy to the ground
his face is contorted in merciless pain
brendan slips his forearm under tommys neck and squeezes
tommy struggles but hes got one arm and theres no escape
his face getting red from lack of oxygen
as an anguished tess and a shaken paddy look on brendan chokes his brother
as he does he pleads with him
im sorry tommy
tommy continues to struggle
tears pour down tommys face
brendan is crushing his wind pipe
tommys eyes bulge
i love you tommy
i love you
tommy about to pass out no more air to breathe slowly opens his left hand looks at brendan and taps his shoulder on the conlon family crest
while most of the crowd erupts in celebration and the kids leap into each others arms joe zito stares at the screen
frank makes eye contact with the jubilant tess
indicates she should meet them in the locker room
meanwhile people pour into the cage
frank pushes them aside keeping them away from brendan and tommy who remain on the ground exhausted
tommy to begins to weep
silence at colts
everyone spent from what theyve seen
tommy buries his head in brendans chest
a torrent of sobbing gushes from him years of pain pouring out in heavy bursts
from the crowd paddy stares into the cage and watches as brendan comforts his little brother then helps him to his feet
callen sheridan and j
riley make their way inside for the post fight interview cameras trailing behind them
with frank continuing to run interference brendan pushes through the crush of people arm around tommy and exits the cage
the crowd parts for tommy and brendan
paddy watches them a tear in his eye
hes overwhelmed by the sight of his two boys together again
as the noise from the arena fades the brothers walk through the wild crowd and continue on through the tunnel arm in arm
