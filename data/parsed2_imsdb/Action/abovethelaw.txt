burbank california all rights reserved photographic stills show us nicola toscani as a city boy in various growing up shots circa s with street chums wearing a wyatt earp t
shirt in a communion suit
then in his first qi a youngster studying the martial arts he grows we see news clippings of him winning trophies his name on contest posters shots of him in
nico now in his teens studying with real masters being dumped on his butt posing smiling beside japanese martial artists then himself as an instructor
now a few military uniforms enter the picture we see security clearance documents with nicos picture and name on them
then nico near draft age with an american friend nelson fox on some kind of training base
blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight at camera helicopter rotors rise to a deafening pitch
super viet cambodian border
jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as with us army markings becomes discernible
the chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness
we glimpse cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the lz
watch from the edge of the landing zone
we recognize nico and fox now in their twenties dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a cia spook
three older americans rough looking in their mid thirties all carrying some kind of medical bags disembark into the howling rotor blast
they hit the ground nimbly as if theyve done it many times before
wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl handled
dont know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness
you ever see chemical interrogation before
nicos eyes stay on the approaching cowboy kurt zagon for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity
these assholes are agency
follows the medical bag in the cowboys hand
were all c
but these guys are from a page that aint on the map
nico in the point leading fox and the three cit chemical interrogation team men down an unmarked twisting trail
we see from nicos gait that he is athletic a born leader and totally at home in the jungle
snakes along a ridge line high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies
how long till were across the border
weve been over for the past hour
the group continues along the ridge
the sky glows from nearby bomb attacks
listening hard and even sniffing the air glances back at zagon who stands impatiently drawing on a cigarette
what are you looking at hotshot
indicates cigarette glow why dont you light a bonfire
irritably zagon ditches his smoke
just drive the taxi ace
as the party moves out fox flashes nico a look as if to say dont fuck with these guys
a pocket fortified position
armed cambodian lookouts several hooches radio equipment
nico leads the party in through the perimeter
zagon eyes the layout like hes seen of them
fox indicates a hooch
to zagon theyre in there
the three cit men start for the hooch
nico casts a concerned glance around at the base camp troops looking sloppy as hell
i dont trust these yo yos
we see nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another checking the perimeter
we can vaguely hear him rousting the cambodian lookouts speaking in dialect
hears a sound looks back toward the hooch
two asian prisoners stripped to the waist babbling in coherently are dragged out the back by a pair of cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness
voices can be heard inside the hooch
a single lantern glowing inside gives the hut a creepy frightening aspect
hes extremely uneasy about whats about to happen inside the hooch
on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes drug vials and surgical instruments
zagons hand picks up a hypodermic squirt tests it
are on their knees shirtless handcuffed with heavy nylon tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the hooch
one of the subordinate cit men moves in grabs the first prisoner by the shoulders
zagon injects the first prisoner
instantly the man begins shivering convulsing
zagon watches with professional satisfaction
thats the nice thing about modern technology
you dont have to wait for results
he moves close to the first prisoner
to first prisoner where is it charley
you got six tons of our shit the prisoner tries to speak but hes in such torment all that comes out is a blood curdling wail hears this horrifying cry
he starts swiftly toward the hooch has moved as close to zagon and the first prisoner as a fight referee to two boxers
the prisoner is convulsing wildly
zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair
dont you die on me fucker from the side what the hells wrong
throws the prisoner down this pussy cant hold his liquor
the first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm
enters at this point
he takes in the scene quickly moves to a spot beside the entrance
zagon doesnt look at nico but its plain he is aware of nicos presence
it is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid and prove it to the others too
above the law rev
dies in agony on the ground
watches with eyes like flint
he is in his mid forties scarred missing several fingers
probably a colonel or higher he looks like hes been fighting these round eyes since the french in the s
he is plainly one tough customer
the second prisoner meets zagons eyes as if daring him to use the drugs on him too
zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred
the prisoner doesnt back down an inch
to second prisoner so my little doctor bag doesnt scare you eh
well i dont need it to open your yap
zagon reaches to a scabbard on his western belt pulls out a fearsome serrated blade a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel
he steps toward the prisoner displaying the blade in the lantern light
to prisoner wheres our load you sack of slime
what did you do with my shit
punches the prisoner full in the face holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify him with the proximity of the
the prisoner crashes sideways face bloody im gonna teach you good
im gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium seem to know exactly what this is about
didnt know but the new kid on the block is catching on fast
nico has difficulty containing his emotion
zagon stands over the prisoner as if daring him to get back up
the prisoner gets back to his knees bloody eyes meeting zagons with defiance to prisoner youre a hard nigger arent you boy
you took it from the chinks
you took it from the french
youll be fucked if some yankee peckerwoods gonna start your gums flapping nico watches zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner
well youre gonna chirp for me tough guy
youre gonna sing like a choir nico takes a step toward zagon
what the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence
your orders are assist and observe cherry zagon turns to face nico to nico back off partner zagon turns from nico
he moves close to the second prisoner close as a lover displaying the blade in the lamplight
to second prisoner im gonna start carving at your ankles
well throw your feet in that box right over there
then im gonna take off your arms one of the cit men yanks the prisoners leg forward clamping it to the ground with his hands
the prisoner still hasnt flinched
he seems as locked into this dance of death as zagon
cant take much more fox shut up nico
you can disappear as easy as this slope kid zagon starts for the prisoner
here comes the blade
suddenly nico grabs zagons shoulder
zagon spins with terrifying quickness cocking the blade to slash at nico
before zagons blow even starts nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw
zagon literally comes off the ground nicos blow is so terrific
zagon drops in an unconscious heap
in a flash the two other cit men move to jump nico
the second cit man is swallowing his teeth
fox leaps in the way of the third shoves nico out of the hooch fox wrestles nico away from the hooch are you crazy
as nico jerks free what the fucks the matter with you
nico is shaking with rage and fear
he takes several steps away from the hooch then draws up abruptly
nico pulls his from his holster pops the safety starts back for the hooch nico
i dont cap him now hes gonna do me later
the last cit man appears gun drawn in the hooch doorway
fox grabs nico hauls him back again ill cover this
get back to the as nico resists ill fix it
get the fuck outa here
the cit man calls out to the cambodian troops in dialect pointing at nico
the soldiers start toward nico as if to seize him
fox too starts yelling to the troops in dialect apparently countermanding the orders of the cit men
the troops confused hold up for a moment
to nico ill call for a chopper
get outa here
above the law rev
nico gives a last look turns and takes off down the jungle trail
fox seems abandoned
the distant bombing continues
nico disappears into the darkness
tilt down to reveal st
elizabeths a huge parish church in an italian latino neighborhood in chicago
the church looks festive we see a few formally dressed people hurrying in then a squad car pulls up
the cops run upstairs as if theyre late a baptism in progress
nico years older than when we last saw him is standing beside sara his lovely wife watching a ish priest father genarro finish the final ritual on nicos infant son
the priest straightens the babys baptismal garment tugging the cloth around the little fellows crotch
smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around
several cops some in uniform are amongst them
nico grabs his son from genarro with a theatrical protective motion tugs up the little boys garment kisses him smack on the bare butt
laughter from all as nico holds the lad high and proud
he puts his arm around sara
huge trays of italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several old country type women
wine is poured from generous carafes
friends and relatives are everywhere laughing and enjoying themselves apparently the party has come here straight from the church
presents for the new baby are being opened by nicos wife sara and nicos mother rosa
mama look at this all done by hand
sara lifts a cute baby outfit

holding the baby
realizes that his little son has pooped in his pants
he turns for help to sara
above the law rev
i think we got a little problem here
winking at the women i carried him for the last nine months you take him for the next diaper
assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as nico tries awkwardly to deal with the problem
to all thats what you get for not marrying a sicilian
sara lets nico struggle a moment then takes over
my brave husband
hes not afraid of thieves and muggers but hes terrified when his son poops in his pants
toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby
three chicago cops lukich and henderson in plain clothes and lieutenant strozah in uniform wolf some italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives
indicates nico across the patio toscani holds the record
for havin more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in chicago
branca and luigi who look like they have been on the other side of a cops work are in turn eying lukich and henderson plus a cluster of other cops
in civvies hovering around the buffet table like vultures
look at these stiff dicks
a free meal and they come out like flies
an unmarked police car pulls up
dolores jackson jax another undercover cop tall black and elegant enters the driveway leading to nicos back yard above the law rev
shes impeccably dressed and radiates intelligence
shes greeted warmly by lukich henderson strozah and a couple of other cops
i didnt do nothing counselor

look at this face
six foot four pretty as the statue of david
and hes a cop
from a distance watanabe watches missing nothing
across the porch lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen
this face should be sticking up from a white shirt
it should be a banker a businessman someone who earns a decent living for his family
nickels and dimes
your wifes a woman with class
what did she run a ballet school

jackson watches nico trying to keep his good humor

jackson and lukich crack up
the others follow
for the moment the tension is dispelled
nico comes out of the bedroom adjusting his shoulder holster tugging his jacket over it
he sees his mother standing near the head of the stairs just outside another bedroom door
concern on her face
what are you doing in here mama
go join the party
nico comes down the hall tucking in his shirt stops to give his mother a squeeze
from the bedroom the sound of quiet sobbing
nico glances in
sara and another woman sit on the bed comforting a ish grandmother zingaro who is crying
nico comes in
he kneels before mrs

bad looking hombres on stoops street corners

the unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar
as it parks
jackson gives nico a look what are we stopping at this dive for
i gotta take a quick leak
he gets out of the car starts for the bar
dim smoke choked dangerous characters at the bar
above the law rev
his silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy working class attire of the bars denizens
hard faces check him out subtly ignore him
nico approaches the bartender shows a photograph
the bartender bad dude shakes his head
why the fuck dont you assholes leave me alone
he continues mouthing off to nico
nico moves to one stool then another the same exchange is repeated
a hulking bruiser with an earring
he watches as approaches him
three army jackets look up sullenly
beefy arms tattoos greasy mustaches
one jacket treats him like he doesnt exist and begins to pick his nose
to others i thought this was a kosher bar
they didnt allow no pork in here
the two others snicker then so does the rest of the bar
nico holds out a photo of a young girl lucy
you seen this girl
i seen the top of her head
above the law rev
nico takes a step away as if moving on to the next stool
from behind the bar the bartender swings a sawed off baseball bat into view
other bodies move ominously toward nico
suddenly he spins and in a move almost too quick to see he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket
beer bottles fly bodies crash
nico slams the first jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded
blood sprays onto nicos silk shirt
he hauls the second jacket upright nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs
a savage elbow blasts the third head over heels out over the bar and careening into the sink
in three seconds pounds of fat has been put in cold storage
the rest of the bar is on its feet
four huge men confront nico
nicos jacket and shirt are ripped blood spat tered his eyes are like an animals daring the men come on
show me something
no one moves
above the law rev

one man nico lunges for the bad dude grabs him like hes about to tear his face off upstairs
in terror shes upstairs
nico drags the dude from behind the bar
holding him nico turns glowering to all
you cocksuckers are brave enough with year old girls
nico throws bad dude down the hallway in front of him
the door bursts in from a jackhammer kick
nico stands in the hallway
bad dude stands next to him hurt shaking
to bad dude get outta here
we look in the apartment
above the law rev
a young pimp quite handsome in a boyish way stares up in panic from a grimy mattress on the floor

nico walks her inside
above the law rev
the zingaro family is busy preparing for the nights baking
grandpa and grandma zingaro leave their work and receive their waif like granddaughter
with eyes watering they thank nico
they disappear upstairs with lucy
jackson standing in the doorway has seen all this
nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery
jackson in the passenger seat studies her partner for a few moments shaking her head at the contradictions in this man
educated classy an elegant dresser yet underneath an out and out wild man
i dont get you toscani
beat what the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop
with your background
for a long moment nico says nothing
then quietly look ing straight ahead when i was overseas i saw some things
things that eat your guts out
things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded
he turns to jackson
you can walk away from them jax
you can quit but you know its still going on
you try something anyway smiles a moment i know im not going to change the world
i cant stop the tonnage coming in i cant fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons but maybe here huh

above the law rev
behind the desk a few detectives man the phones
a latin attorney abandano is at the counter

the girl con tinues to spit curses at nico gesturing with her hands with latin flamboyance
nico grabs her by the elbow as a jailer opens the lockup door
more curses are being flung at nico from various females in the cage
nico heaves carla in among them
carla flops down on a bench next to a tall black hooker
move in on the black hooker
its nicos partner jackson dolled up like a street walker playing her undercover role to the hilt
to nico why cant you sons a bitches ever treat someone with a little respect
walking away take it easy sister
i aint your goddamn sister

carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities then sags back among the women
carla starts to cry
jackson comforts her carla responds lets herself be comforted
jackson back in her normal daytime wear exits a building
she gets into nicos car
jackson checks her makeup in the rearview mirror
nico sits behind the wheel
the two are on some kind of stakeout
the lawyers name is abandano
hes on the third floor
i got a look at him
i couldnt get how hes connected but according to carla hes a lousy lay
maybe we can bust him for that
jackson spots something gestures subtly out window above the law rev
a short slick looking latin man in a business suit emerges from the building
thats our stud
nico and jackson leave their car and follow him on foot
abandano meets a striking looking middle aged woman in front of a stately financial institution
they go in
jackson remains out on the street while nico follows the couple in
jackson has been waiting sipping some coffee
nico emerges from the bank signaling to his partner to follow him
abandano and the woman exit from the banks revol ving doors and immediately jump into a cab
nico and jackson look at each other and step in front of another cab
nico opens the cab door flips his badge open then asks the occupant to leave
jackson gets in the front seat next to the protesting cabbie
abandano and the woman are crossing the plaza as nico and jackson run up the block
near the entrance to the federal building a small but vocal group of protestors are gathered carrying signs and chanting slogans
the frus trated cabbie watches them in the background
jackson and nico watch abandano and the woman pass the crowd of demonstrators and enter the building
jackson acts indifferent almost frustrated nico keenly senses something
the main dining room
no customers just busboys readying tables for the evenings business
we notice one of the busboys is the pimp nico found with lucy
the owners table
stacks of dining checks a cashbox and calculator full ashtrays wine glasses
bautista salvano a heavyset swarthy venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open glowers across the table at a mus cular scar faced latin busboy the kind who looks
like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables
the busboy nardo is nervous apologetic above the law rev
pissed off i brought you in for your muscles nardo not your mouth
scared im sorry boss
your english is getting good

instead he reaches over playfully chokes the busboy then releases him as if all is forgiven
make yourself useful
indicates empty wine bottle on table get downstairs bring me one of these
as nardo stands starts for back hallway then get back to work
nardo enters at the top of the stairs radiating relief
he trots down into the empty basement toward a floor to ceiling wine rack
to himself i thought i was dead man
whistles with relief i thought i was fucking dead
he crosses to the wine rack
its dark hard to see
he searches for the bottle
suddenly a metallic sound behind him
nardo turns chi chi testamente a wiry pock faced latino stands in the shadows it is clear he has been waiting there hiding holding a small silencer automatic
you were right cabron
above the law rev
one shot between the eyes and nardo crashes backward into the wine rack eyes wide with shock and bewilderment
chi chi shoots him again nardo drops like a stone
coolly professionally chi chi pumps four more shots into the prone busboys head
chi chi ejects the clip into his palm unscrews the silencer holsters the gun
salvano appears at the top of the stairs
two busboys are behind him
one of them is the young pimp
the busboys hurry down the pimp scared shitless but playing it macho cool
salvano comes down the stairs
chi chi stands over his work
to busboys clean up this mess
who knows who else is talking he was a young fool
salvano and chi chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth
were crazy waiting for this bullshit shipment

salvano puts a hand on chi chis shoulder
this will be done the way it was planned
rusting cyclone fences surround a mud lot repair yard in a dingy industrial section
young lation and black workers finish up for the night through the dirty security barred office window we can see chi chi talking on the phone
the lawyer abandano is also there
nico finishes connecting a small transmitter which has been hastily wired to the entering phone line
nico and jackson in the shadows down the street from the body shop
nico wears earphones a small tape recorder on the seat beside him
jackson does not look happy
above the law rev

gestures for silence chi chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone
he starts writing it down in unmarked car

the place is packed with fashionable people of all races
a band plays salsa couples dance
nico and jackson pass easily as a hip uptown couple
a pretty latin hostess approaches them
two for dinner
two for drinks
they elbow up to the packed bar standing
nico squints toward the rear dining room
looking past numerous patrons we see chi chi whisper something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table the same owners table where salvano sat before
the waiter hurries off into a back hallway
jackson moves to the salsa beat
a barmaid approaches
gimme something stiff

nicos eyes never leave chi chi
from the back hallway salvano emerges in his tux looking prosperous
he sits down beside chi chi and abandano
a waitress brings two drinks
after a few words chi chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket hands it to salvano
youll have your engine block next tuesday boss
as the barmaid brings their drinks
jackson sees her peaceful week to retirement flying out the window

van pulling up swiftly beside one another men getting out nico and lukich draw their guns running full tilt
into hidden miki its going down now
the station wagon men heave their rear door open the van men start to open their side door
the lincoln is stopped at a distance
suddenly burst from the rear door of the packing plant guns drawn
grab for their weapons come highballing around both sides of the packing plant open fire
there is confusion and mayhem its not clear whos a cop and whos a criminal
dive for cover returning fire
the dea men in one truck also open up
one of the van men is hit between the eyes
machine gun fire rakes the dea truck it spins out of control flips
lukich shoots the machine gunner
shouts points nico
starts to peel out
we glimpse chi chi in the drivers seat salvano on the passenger side
steps in front of the accelerating lincoln raises his
salvano and chi chi dive below the dash and continue forward
salvano in the passenger seat raises his gun fires blindly trying to hit nico
nico unloads his
into the windshield and the firewall
the lincoln keeps coming down the narrow alley
brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives grabbing onto the roof
salvano cant believe it
he screams something in spanish
he fires again this time through the roof
bullet holes appear
nico narrowly misses being hit
nico reaches over the side of the car and smashes the pas senger window with his fist
salvanos face is bashed
nicos huge hand grabs salvanos throat he wont let go
he hangs on with one hand
nicos fingers now dig into salvanos larynx he may never talk again
salvano now points the gun at chi chi
chi chi makes the decision to stop the car in order to save his boss
above the law rev
leaps off the roof pulling salvano past the broken glass out of the window
screech into the lot
officers pour out guns drawn surrounding the lincoln and the other vehicles
jackson joins them weapon in hand
drags salvano by the neck across the lot to the van slamming the drug dealer up against the vans side
lukich jackson and strozah are there with the dea cops all covering the other men
to salvano how many kilos you got in there skivuzo
salvano couldnt answer if he wanted to
the other cops look at nico with awe
lukich whips the van door open yanks a tarp off the cargo
the engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame wrapped with industrial plastic
nico climbs into the van rips the plastic sheeting off grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame tears them off
in the background ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals
from the cylinder heads emerges a full load not of drugs but of plastique tubes labeled u
army c high explosive
react with surprise and shock
rips open one of tubes and smells it
what kinda fuckin high is this
above the law rev
opening on salvano in a chair looking bruised and swollen and wearing an expression of fuming indignation
ill tell you what this cop is
hes a fucking menace
face salvano chi chi and the lawyer abandano apparently representing salvano and chi chi
neeley is on the phone
pictures of reagan and meese are prominent on the wall
you see what he did to me
your problem is being handled right now mr
well it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago
i dont know whos running this outfit but somebody better get his goddamn wires straight
into phone yes sir
yes sir i understand that maniac should be wearing a number not a badge
salvano knows what the call is about
he straightens the tie beneath his bruised neck assuming the attitude of a respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged
into phone count on it sir
youll have our full cooperation
neeley hangs up
glances dubiously to halloran
then turns grimly to salvano chi chi and the lawyer abandano
youre free to go
the hoods and their lawyer smugly walk past a cleaning woman
above the law rev
opening on agent neeleys face
composed clean cut but intense wearing a light colored business suit
pan to agent halloran the same upright clean shaven bureau look
the two men are seated to one side of lieutenant fred strozah
sit and stand in various postures in front of the lieutenants desk
to nico dea aif this is no reflection on the work you officers have done
i feel and the whole department feels extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry
that spare me the horseshit look on nicos face
strozah sees nicos bitter expression
its on the others faces too
as all of you are well aware possession of these explosives is a federal offense and under jurisdiction of the f
nicos eyes meet lieutenant strozahs
theres respect between the two but its plainly under a helluva strain
with all respect to our brothers in the bureau biting sarcasm turns to neeley thats no answer
its no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now free as a bird
agent neeley stiffens
keep it in your pants nico
these men have a job to do just like us
nico stifles his outrage
the other cops exchange glances upset and angry
agent neeley clears his throat
lieutenant i think these officers are entitled to a fuller explanation
above the law rev
theyve risked their lives
i understand one man is in the hospital
he speaks to the officers
what im about to say doesnt leave this room
is that clear
assent from everyone
salvano has been working for some time in cooperation with certain federal agencies
stunned and furious at this royal fuck up
im not at liberty to divulge the nature of mr
salvanos involvement i just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago
but one thing i can tell you mr
salvanos role is crucial to an extremely sensitive ongoing investigation
any further surveillance harassment or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden
i must order you gentlemen looking straight at nico with all respect for your work and your courage to stand down
lukich shakes his head nico is devastated
jackson takes it all in
opening close on a desk drawer being opened
aside from rounds of ammo notes and an aging eggplant parmigiana sandwich there are half a dozen hand labeled audio cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging devices
jackson and lukich watch nico take out the notes hand them to lieutenant strozah
above the law rev
the tapes too
mocking thats my lawrence welk collection
i want everything you got on this one
reluctantly nico hands over the tapes
the lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires
i know you dont give a shit about yourself toscani
a glance to jax but youre gonna put jacksons ass in a sling too with these illegal wires
above the law rev
agent halloran edges up to jackson whos grabbing coffee on the far side of the squad room and watching from there as nico gives strozah more of a hard time
whats the story on your partner jackson
did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass
jackson checks halloran out
hes black too and despite herself theres a certain rapport
he has ethics
unlike certain others on this case
halloran watches the illegal bugs and tapes come out of nicos drawer
his ethics are gonna cost him his badge and his gun
this white talk gives jackson a pain
she slips into her jive mode
you dont wanna catch him without no gun
hallorans look asks why not
cause what he do with his hands
make bullet holes look pretty
across the room nico turns over the tapes
above the law rev
nico and jackson come down the stairs
jackson has had ample excitement for her last week on the force
is that enough
can we do something normal now like eat lunch
anything you say jax
how about salvanos
let it be nico
nico and jacksons car pulls out into traffic
jackson and nico are eating some fast good
nico reaches to his jacket pocket takes out a cassette
you kept his tape too
nico already has it in the player
we hear fragments of the telephone tap from the body shop in spanish and english
jackson looks frustrated
nico listens care fully to what appears to be the taped phone conversation
poetry aint it
the pimp busboy comes out and dumps a load of garbage
nico and jackson case the restaurant from down the alley
from the restaurant door salvano and chi chi emerge
they get into a black cadillac and pull out
and now for some dessert
as nicos car tails salvanos through various streets
above the law rev
salvano comes out of a fancy flower shop with a bimbo on his arm
he kisses her goodbye and puts her in a cab
and that must be mrs
so nice to see married couples still in love
are hidden waiting
emerges from a dry cleaners with a suit on a hanger
salvanos caddy pulls up outside the same church where we saw nicos son get baptized
salvano and chi chi get out look both ways up and down the street
salvano holding flowers makes eye contact with a car down the block
nicos car backs out of sight around the corner
salvano and chi chi seeing nothing enter the church
a smattering of older women and men praying
salvano and chi chi stop at the head of the aisle genuflect to the altar move in take seats toward the front
nico and jackson slip in the front door glide silently into the shadows at the rear of the church
this is your mothers church isnt it
but i bet shes never seen these boys in the choir
salvanos head is bowed but chi chi is looking around quite carefully
nico and jackson fade into the shadows behind the huge pillars
above the law rev
after a few moments the pair rises
they cross them selves start out for the front door
as they walk they continue to look for something
nico and jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a day care center and a rectory
they head toward the front of the building
jackson planning on picking up their tail on salvano is stoped by nico
he wants to stay and look around
that cant be you in church without the family
nico turns to see father genarro perspiring in a baggy sweatshirt a handball glove on his hand
the courtyard alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area
the priest seizes nicos hand warmly smiles at jackson
this must be your partner in crime
shakes her hand im father genarro
i saw you at the baptismal party
with a wink to nico what a partner
dolores jackson smiling but impatient nico we gotta go no please more serious now its good you stopped by
i have to show you something
the priest begins leading nico and jackson
jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see salvanos car slowly driving by
this is an old building
the dark corridors resemble an underground bunker
old trophies and furniture are stored along the walls
the two cops and the priest walk
another priest emerges from a door nods passes
nico and jackson glance in through the door as they walk
they reach a door with a broken handle
it looks like a break in has taken place
the rats are getting bigger
when did this happen
two nights ago
i didnt call the police
above the law rev
father genarro knocks on the door pauses then knocks again
the door opens
a twelve year old who looks like hes from central america stands in the doorway
in spanish its all right son
these are friends
the boy steps back and we move into a largish room no exposed windows everything boarded up
newly constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner various cots
a number of latin refugees families mostly react shyly as father genarro introduces nico and jackson
sister bonifacia is there and a youthful priest father tomassino
we will see both of them again
referring to the cops these are friends
to nico this is father tomassino
how do you do
nico shakes the young priests hand
there is a moment between them as nico meets tomassinos eyes liking what he sees
the refugees are relieved however when father genarro nico and jackson take their leave
continue down the hall
i didnt know this church was a sanctuary father
but perhaps not such a safe one
how long have they been here
at least the kids can go to our school
who did it father
above the law rev
significantly maybe worse
its not the first time
we can have a car check by every hour
police frighten these people
above the law rev
the three are outside taking their leave
a big smile and a hand on father genarros shoulder
the priest is greatly relieved
really i dont mind coming by
tell me nico
when was your last confession
im a married man father
ive got no sins to confess
youre a police officer you have many sins to confess
nico and jackson start off
calls after nico you come back sunday
i feel better when i see nicola in church
calls louder you dont show im phoning your mother
high angle from across the street neighborhood people dressed in their sunday best fill the sidewalk filing in for mass
we hear an organ from inside the church
an italian neighborhood becoming more hispanic
as the churchgoers file in we see families women kids babies
are among the crowd exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors in english italian and spanish
sara holding julian slips into a pew
as nico and rosa follow father genarro passes heading for the front
above the law rev
i have you to thank for getting my son back into church
its amazing what shame can accomplish
father genarro smiles and continues on toward the pulpit
building to the finish of a hymn
also singing balancing baby julian and a hymnbook
sing with full gusto
makes the sign to be seated
we notice a young intellectual looking man alan singletary wearing wire rim glasses sitting in the front row
we will see his face again later
he looks out of place and glances around surprised as
moves into the pulpit opens his bible
in nomine patris filius et spiritu sancti
etc the little one starts to cry she comforts him
nico reaches over to try to help
the baby continues fussing
nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church
he notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front of the church and turn heading down one of the side aisles
examines julians diaper way to go julian perfect timing
above the law rev
she cynically smiles at nico
nico sees the woman in black pass toward the exit of the church
it is the same woman nico and jackson were following with abandano the lawyer
the woman has left it in front of the votive candles directly before the priests pulpit
his head spins from the shopping bag to the doorway the woman is hastily sneaking out
instantly he pushes his family to the floor covering them with his body
a powerful explosion erupts between the priest and his congregation
fragments of plaster wood and marble come blasting past nico and his family
churchgoers in the first rows are blown off their feet by the shock wave of the blast
pews overturn smoke everywhere is shrieking hysterically
stone and plaster dust rain down on them from the ceiling
is in total pandemonium
screams cries panic has been blown to oblivion
where father genarro had been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble
prone covering sara and the baby groping frantically to protect his mother as well
clutching baby were okay
nico checks them and his mother swiftly
above the law rev
in italian help the others
help them nico
splattered with real blood
everyone is down reeling from the concussion dust and smoke
nico rises alone from this scene
forcefully help each other move outside
from a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth
we hear screams from inside
nico on his feet plainly the leader in this moment of terror
worshippers shattered and bleeding pour past him toward the door
nico grabs a stout looking church goer
tell em to send everything they got
turns to his wife sara get the baby and mama outside
nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst
the congregation streams out in terror stricken disarray
we see nicos family theyre all right
appears from the church carrying a young choir girl
he hands the child over to two older women races back into the church
the first paramedic van comes speeding around the corner siren blaring
police cars appear right behind above the law rev
nico appears through the backlit smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of father genarro
he desperately tries to maintain the priests life
the aftermath of the blast
doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control but theres still plenty of pain and misery
nico stands his back to the wall a scary blank look on his face
a doctor and several nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of father genarro
a nun is crying a fellow priest is blessing the father
nico talks to her aside
i want a list of everyone thats been treated here today
then find those sanctuary people the ones we saw in the church basement as jackson makes notes
find out where theyre from why anyone would want to harm them
jackson flips her notepad shut ready to go
where are you gonna be
just stay near a radio
ill find you
sits on a bench with a bandage over one eye
sara and julian are sleeping beside her
nico kneels beside his mother deeply concerned
nico takes his mothers arm helps her to her feet
above the law rev
sara wakes and picks up julian
mama knows father genarro has died
she begins sobbing softly
other members of the congregation are in the hallway mourning
nico with his family takes several steps toward the exit
suddenly nico stops
he sees agent neeley entering the fbi man who ordered him off the case accompanied by lieutenant strozah and two uniformed officers
go down to the car ill be with you in a minute
he hails neeley
i need to talk to you
a glance to strozah and others alone
nico leads him off the corridor through a fire exit door the door closes behind them
nico and the fbi man are alone on the stairway landing
impatient what the hell is it toscani
without warning nico grabs neeley by both lapels slams him furiously into the wall
thats what the hell it is

neeley tries to shake free nico wont let him
you let salvano walk

above the law rev
nico stalks off
the door slams
nicos unmarked car whips in front
nico storms toward the front door of the restaurant
nico storms through toward the restaurant rear
the employees are getting ready for the evening crowd
he flashes his badge checks the kitchen salvanos office
the man is gone
jackson has her list from the hospital
a coroner and his assitant show her a body on a slab
the body is that of alan singletary the man we saw in the front row of the church
jackson takes notes
the dead man is definitely not the ethnic type youd expect in st
the same place where nico and jackson wire tapped chi chi
nico interrogates the shop boss several workers
all shake their head gesture emphatically
salvano not here
takes polaroids of the dead mans i
and personal effects
as jacksons flash pops
we see clearly a u
senate staff id a u
senate office building parking pass and an illinois drivers license with address
nico comes storming out
a maid and a bodyguard follow after him screaming
the door slams
we see it is missing a panel

above the law rev
jackson at the blast scene
police tapes rope the area off while a tv news crew photographs the damage
jackson talks with neighborhood people asking questions
nico in the alley grilling several tough guys we saw be fore when he raided this bar
the answers are all zero nicos disgusted worn out frustrated
he starts out the alley at the edge of the street a battered van pulls in
a jacketed latino man leans against it an unlit ciga rette in his mouth
as nico approaches turning toward his car polite casual cuse me sir
can i bum a light
nico slows eyeing the guy dubiously
as he reaches to his jacket the side door of the van flashes open
a is leveled straight at nicos head
instantly three other latino hoods leap to the sidewalk
machete under jacket dont even think about it motherfucker
machete man first latino snatches nicos gun from its shoulder holster
two hoods shove nico back into the alley
nico checks out his assailants quickly
four of them
machete crowbar ball bat gun

the five advance on nico
we aint gonna shoot you man
we gonna beat you to death
you gonna learn what it means to get down
a nico is trapped
the hoods advancing
nico has a moment of stillness as if all senses are clicking out of normal gear and into some hyper combat readi ness
b gun and machete man are side by side
as machete man starts to move nico spins in beside him seizes his wrist twists it violently wrenching the machete away keeping machete man between him and gun man so
gun man cant shoot
in a flash nico swings the machete slicing over the top of machete man half severing the wrist of gun man
gun man falls clutching his wrist in agony the gun skitters away beneath a chain link fence out of reach
nico flips machete man who has nicos gun in his pocket sending him crash ing half unconscious
c instantly pipe man aims a home run shot at nicos head
nico uses the machete matches the angle of the oncoming blow slides under and in the same arc blocks the blow and turns it into a strike slashing pipe mans
tendons behind the knee
pipe man goes down on one knee writhing hamstrung crying out in pain
d now ball bat attacks
nico intercepts the blow flips bat man ass over teakettle sending him sail ing feet first through the side window of the van
bat man crashes through the glass hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free
e nico is spread out feet wide in a crouch
crowbar man sees his chance
he is the fiercest of the four and the savviest fighter
he throws three consecu tive vicious blows at nicos head nico drops to one knee dodges the blows then intercepts the third machete in hand matches the arc of interception
and whips the blade up straight into the crotch of crowbar man
crowbar man cant believe it
he re mains frozen a moment staring at nico then down at his own groin
f machete man the first to be flipped struggles des perately to regain his senses
he tries to get nicos gun from his own pocket but nico bats it a way
machete man scrambles to his feet in terror bolts
g nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk glances to bat man who is still half dangling from the van window
nico gives bat man one parting punch to the head then tears off after machete man shrieks from passersby as machete man hurtles past straight into the street
a car nearly hits him he vaults its hood
here comes nico in hot pursuit
he too leaps the car whose owner is staring cursing an all out foot face
machete man is a speedster he hurdles a row of trash cans
two young girls on a stoop whistle as he passes
tears after this human cannonball
amazingly hes gaining machete man highballs off the sidewalk straight into a mom and pop groceria
customers scatter in shock as the hood blasts past them out the back door
here comes nico
patrons curse in spanish as he barrels past machete man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs
he leaps the fence into the next yard which belongs to a funeral home
he hurdles the headstone inventory clambers up the fence on the far side pursuing along the same route
claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame work of two by fours which form an arbor like canopy a bove the third back yard
plastic sheeting is tacked between the beams
machete man glances back at nico starts out tightrope style across the two by fours
nico reaches the fence behind the hood starts also onto the two by fours
we hear female screams from below as the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously
machete man reaches the far side
a fire escape is ad jacent he grabs for it starts up
nico catches him by the ankle
the two crash together back onto the two by fours which give way sending them plunging into four young oriental women potting plants react with terror as the two bodies
machete man scrambles away from nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door
the flower girls cant move either nico and the hood are too near the door
the girls retreat to the far corner squealing in fright
to nico in terror no hermano
nico starts menacingly toward the hood breathing hard from the chase
who put up the money
nico grabs him by the hair
you didnt come after me for a piece of ass
twists the youths neck who paid you
i told ya
nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs
the hood doubles over gasping
the flower girls shriek even louder
nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare
shouting shut up
the girls instantly go silent in terror
nico turns back to machete man spins him violently face down jacking the punks right arm straight out behind him
we see that nico can break his elbow with one blow
give it to me
nico raises his fist to strike
nico shoves the hood into the ground tearing the hoods wallet from his trouser pocket
nico rips the wallet a part seizes the kids identification and holds it up
he grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand
machete man is staring up in terror wondering what this means
if youre lying to me ill come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen
nico dumps him on the ground and walks away
instantly machete man changes his tune
above the law rev
nico walks back his foot smashes into the punks face
he hits the ground with a thud
nico walks away
nico at the kitchen table spread with notepads old add ress books x cards

i got a call last night
an old agency friend
he told me my family was in danger
jax and lukich cant put all the pieces together yet
but if its drugs cia senate its got to be heavy
you got a weapon
lukich knows he doesnt
he glances up and down the street makes sure no ones watching then cracks the drivers door of his car
theres a bulge in the map pocket
nico pulls out a sig saur
try this on
jackson watches luke slip nico a clip
opening close on the faces of the sanctuary refugees
they are faces that have known fear and tragedy
the kind of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been burned and family members murdered
the refugees have been moved from church basement to a back room in the day care center
nico kneels facing them
jackson in the background
a nun sister bonifacia and a priest whom we saw in genarros hospital room watch over the people
nico is frustrated he cant crack the refugees fear
to nun sister
you know me
tell them theres no need for fear
there is rubble all over the yard nicola
to refugees i was there
in the church
they tried to kill my family too
several of the refugees look like they want to speak but they are terrified
i know there was a man here from an american senators office
who was he going to speak to
the refugees become increasingly anxious
to one woman was it you senora
to a man was it you
glances among the people
finally the priest
the others shrink
the woman glances to them
gently father genarro
the other one
nico looks to the american priest standing there
the young one
from costa rica
sister bonifacia sighs
jackson has her pad out taking notes
bonifacia knows too much has already been revealed she must speak
he came alone
two weeks ago
he had papers
papers to give to the senator
nico tries to contain his excitement not scare anyone by losing his calm
but the bomb
the bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit
father tomassino was going to give the mass that day
shaken father genarro talked him out of it
the refugees faces confirm this
understands it was father tomassino they were trying to kill
bonifacia starts softly to cry
nico puts his hand on her shoulder comforting her
where is tomassino
where is he now
the nun shakes her head
nico looks to the refugees
they dont know either
he run mister
he go he gestures who knows where
if you know where he is youve got to tell me
i want to help him
i can help him
the refugees lower their eyes
bonifacia continues her soft weeping
nico glances to jackson her look says enough lets leave these poor people alone
nico stands touches bonifacia one more time on the shoulder nico and jackson come out
nico has made a decision
youre outa this jax
above the law rev
displays her notes you see this list
well im not done
nico admires his partners guts but hes worried
im not a rookie toscani
now go home
get your family out of here
the pair starts to split
calls after jackson just paperwork you understand
nico drives a jumble of emotions on his face
urgency fear exhaustion
hes deep in thought nicos car pulls up at a stop light
he looks around without really seeing
an old lady pulls a shopping cart while a crossing guard takes some kids across the street
roars up out of nowhere without two men inside screech ing to a stop head on to nicos door
its doors spring open dives toward his own passenger door leap out open fire with pistols and automatic weapons
nicos car riddled with a furious fusillade
windows blow out the drivers door is shredded above the law rev
crawling frantically shoving the passenger door open as a firestorm of lead and flying glass blazes all around him
firing point blank to ten feet into nicos car
the men are cool professional
spills from the passenger door onto the ground scrambles like mad under his own car toward one of the attackers cars
scream and scatter in terror
firing as shells spew from the ejection ports of their weapons
being chewed to pieces crawling at full speed from the cars front to its back
on the ground alongside the car spent cartridge cases rain like hailstones
as their magazines empty
the last shells spring free gun barrels sizzle blue smoke fills the air
the leader waves two men forward to check their kill
at that instant springs to his feet behind the men the sig saur
clutched in both hands
he has crawled under both cars to envelop his attackers
over here you sons a bitches
nicos rage is superhuman
the men stare in conster nation
one of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon above the law rev
eyes like an animal try it
be my guest
the man lets the magazine clatter to the street
the others raise their hands
it takes all nicos strength to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot
his gaze swings wildly around the intersection
he spots a corner grocery store
a phone inside
gestures with gun over there
the men are scared shitless
they put their hands in back of their heads trot jelly legged a pakistani counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter ing his store and bolts for the
a customer exits as nico herds his captives in
hands on the counter
three men do it the fourth is slow
dont tempt me asshole the fourth obeys
nico moves to the pay phone on the wall covering the men with his
he grabs the re ceiver in his free hand tries to dial
adrenaline makes his hand shake the dials spin wrong one of the men sees nicos dilemma
to hit nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives
as nico turns again to the dial a free standing sales display hurtles toward him crashing into his gun hand
one of the men has lunged into the display now he dives atop nico a second later
the whole human pile crashes thundering into a glass freezer
somehow nico gets to his feet
one of the men grabs nicos gun nico swings one of the freezer doors wham
smack into the mans face
the glass shatters the man drops like a rock
now its three against one prime odds for nico
he wades into his attackers
a coffee stand goes flying
a body sails into a makeup display
one fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies nicos nose he pays with a shattered forearm and a head first heave into an ice cream locker it
looks like a tornado has hit the interior
magazine racks crash mayo jars fly through the air the ice machine seems to explode as a mans back careens into it above the law rev
two police cars heave into view sirens wailing nico takes the last man lifts him up and drives him like a battering ram straight through the glass
wild eyed and bloody sees the cop cars whipping into the corner
he spins to see his
on the floor too far away to race for
he bolts down a gangway
the phone rings next to lukich
sara starts towards it
lukich stops her with a look he picks up the phone
into phone yeah
into phone get their stuff into the car now
do it in the alley not the driveway
ill be there in five minutes
squealing around a corner entering the block where nico is
lets them pass keeping low
he sprints across the street and down the alley
sara grabs a handful of dresses from the closet and angrily throws them into an open suitcase on the bed
nico watches hoping to ride the storm
above the law rev
your job and your family in one day nico
youre batting a thousand
sara is at the dresser pulling open drawers dumping her clothes haphazardly into the suitcase
she stops suddenly
she pulls out a handgun and ammo from her panty drawer
she starts to weep
nico steps up behind her puts his arms around her
youll be safe with uncle branca
its gotta be this way
he turns her around to face him
dont you think id rather be with you
he holds her passionately
rosa coughs loudly in the doorway
no longer angry mama

dont forget the babys sweater i know about babies
we glimpse other relatives in the hallway nico hands them a pair of suitcases they hurry off of nicos bloodied shirt you sure youre all right
i am if you are
trying to lighten up dont worry touches him we needed a vacation anyway
sara takes her suitcase hurries out brancas sedan is half loaded branca adds a few more bags
lukichs car is parked behind it
above the law rev
crossing yard with sara ill give you five minutes start
we have to do it this way
they get their suitcases into the sedan
mama and the baby are already aboard
sara gets into the passenger seat
lukich comes around from the front glancing around like a lookout
she thinks there may be documents at some guys apartment
nico starts toward the rear basement door
lukich falls in with him
nico and lukich enter start down the steps
they killed the wrong priest
lukich doesnt understand
there was a second priest
from costa rica
hiding at the church
he was the one they meant to kill
nico starts to remove a large piece of ducting from the basement heater
and you know where to find him
the hole in the foundation holds several shotguns and a couple of pistols some passports and some cash
youre gonna need help
nico grabs the pistols starts to strap them on
just stay with my family nico replaces the piece of foundation starts back up the steps
above the law rev
what are you gonna do
you dont want to know
branca starts the sedan
sara looks back pained
rosa lukich and julian are also in the car
nico grabs another hand carried case from the basement hurries into lukichs car
two police cars pull up to the front of the house
lukichs car continues off
we see uncle brancas car and lukichs car out front
branca leads nico sara rosa julian and lukich down a corridor
two older italian women open a door leading to a basement rec room
my sisters cousins place
youre safe not even i can find this joint
the family enters the back room
they take in their sanctuary
agent neeley hurries across the lot toward his car
he gets in starts the engine
as he puts the car in gear nestles behind his right ear
rising from rear seat dont forget your seat belt
above the law rev
nico walks casually beside agent neeley holding his gun out of sight in his pocket
they proceed down a corridor
be hind them we glimpse a security checkpoint manned by two uniformed guards through which they apparently have already passed
the two walk past floor to ceiling warehouse shelves packed with labeled boxes film cans etc
which are visible through a heavy wire mesh screen
you just made number four on the most wanted list
above the law rev
keep walking another nudge im bucking for number one
above the law rev
a pot bellied naval retired type clerk looks up from his desk as nico and neeley come up to the counter
we see a sign evidence holding depot you must have your requi sition number
the clerk stands chomping a cigar wad dles to the counter
we see his arms covered with tattoos
what can i do for you lads
neeley presents his id
there was a quantity of c explosive brought in four days ago hell thats gone
right away pardner
they scooped that stuff outa here before we even got it tagged
who took it
casual nico reacts nudges neeley once more
to clerk wed like to see the paperwork
the clerk has an accordion file right under the counter
he indicates a sign in book
you gotta sign
neeley signs the book
the clerk starts leafing through his files searching for the release form
i remember that guy
flew in special from langley
real nice fella finds the form lifts it from file here it is
above the law rev
snatches the release form
stares at the signature stunned
neeleys car parked in the boondocks along the lake
from car radio here it is sir
coming in from langley now neeley holds the radio mike as if about to say something
nico shoves his gun against the guys temple
from car radio that agent has been with the central american desk uh since into mike thank you
thats what i wanted
nico takes the mike clicks it back into its cradle
neeley freezes unsure what nicos going to do with him
motions with gun dump your shoes
ditch your i
on the floor
nico watches the fbi man obey
so you think im a lousy cop huh neeley
maybe i am
but i havent got my face buried up washingtons ass
nobody buys me toscani
then somebody pulled the plug on your brain pal
you didnt come up with the second priest did you
or harrisons dead aide
as neeley fumbles with his laces hurry up
as neeley obeys you heard the radio
the agencys pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies
you assholes are missing half the case
above the law rev
despite his animosity toward nico neeley is beginning to realize this cop is onto something
toscani nico grabs neeleys shoes heaves them into the back seat
he shoves the agent out the door swings himself behind the wheel
watch your step
nico drives off leaving the fbi man miles from nowhere
with score and v
from out of an elevator and down a busy corridor march the brass deputy superintendent crowder included
lieutenant strozah lags slightly behind
they enter an auditorium where a large contingent of press cameras ready wait
jackson outside an apartment door in a yuppie esque condo complex
she looks both ways to be safe then slides a credit card behind the lock
the door opens
nico parks neeleys car in a huge packed lot
a towering marquee sign reads computer expo
nico starts on foot toward the convention center entrance
jackson enters looking guilty as hell
she picks up a framed photo from a piano the dead senators aide posed smiling beside a distinguished looking man senator harrison in front of the capitol building
jackson sets the photo down starts rummaging through desk drawers
the officer is alleged to be involved in illicit drug trafficking racketeering and kidnapping above the law rev
nico in the crush of convention goers pauses before a booth promoting a tv manufacturer
the latest model tvs are set up in a sales display with visitors gawking at the pictures of the church bombing aftermath
on tvs police sources also speculate that toscani may be connected to the suspect in the bombing of st
elizabeths parish church a police composite rendering of the woman who placed the bomb at the church is shown on the television
on tvs the suspect is likely to be armed and considered to be extremely dangerous nicos police id photo appears on the news
he blends back into the crowd
in other news senator ernest harrisons presidential bid has
nico moves swiftly through the convention center floor which is packed for thousands of square feet with sales booths each manned by technicians and pitchmen all displaying the latest in
high tech data processing equipment telecommunications etc
jax stuffs a wad of offical papers including appoint ment books notes and tapes into her briefcase
at the apartment door she looks both ways then emerges starts away down the hallway
nico in the crowd in front of the booth of a japanese computer manufacturer
watanabe nicos friend whom we remember from the baptism picnic scene is the chief engineer at the booth showing off some high tech equipment to several brainy looking executives
watanabe glances up spots nico
nico makes a subtle sign to indicate he must speak to watanabe
watanabe crosses at once to nico
above the law rev
so good to see you again sir
shakes nicos hand come back near closing
well place your order then
nico nods fades like a shadow into the throng
music all customers gone lights being turned off
janitors sweep up the last booth people shut down for the night
emerges with nico from behind a booth divider leads her old friend at a brisk pace across the deserted floor
you know i wouldnt call in a favor above the law rev
of course not
just because you kept a few friendly tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as pad thai
with a wink watanabe escorts nico into a back area off the floor
carpeted office dividers set off a small area packed with super sophisticated computer equipment
watanabe boots up a terminal sits down with relish
the last six years ive been risking nothing but money
its a kick to risk my ass again
nico eyes the equipment and watanabe impressed
the old spook
jackson has the senators aides papers spread before her cataloging them with interest
the phone rings
jackson picks it up
into phone jackson
whoever the voice is which we cant hear it makes jackson forget the documents
into phone yes
yes of course sister i know who you are
where are you
watanabe working two computers simultaneously with the gusto of a rock keyboard player
above the law rev
no way to access covert ops directly
but ornsteins at princeton hes got a database bigger than langley works keyboard lovingly if i cant crack that turkeys code its time to hang up my rock and roll
shoes nico watches watanabe work
heres a little trap door
lets see if we can wriggle up into watches the screen with anticipation personnel files

its a start
nico sits down beside watanabe
watanabe stubs out a cigarette
empty coffee cups all around
nico paces reading a hard copy printout
fox has had a helluva career
reads down page to cambodia laos
operation green mountain
this is all vang pao its all heroin you friend has found his metier
nico circles the operations on the page hands it to watanabe

whistles impressed recruited by agency
trained fort benning counter insurgency
above the law rev
wheres foxs printout

its even later
the last of the janitorial crew is finishing up the huge floor
a few display lights remain on otherwise its dark
nico stands above observing contemplating the information he has received
watanabe crapped out in a chair nico looking weary pacing wracking his brain
theres nothing left nico
weve wrung these files dry
above the law rev
muttering to himself thinking fox is here in chicago
or was here
has an idea listen
can this thing tap into airlines
reservations records i can get you the ball scores too
as he finishes viewing the screen stands
five agents from central american desk
all trained assassins
all arrived in chicago in the last week and none of them has left
nico grabs his coat gulps a last swallow of coffee thanks wat
you finally may have done some good for your country
where are you going
to find a priest
jacksons unmarked car whips into the curb
aboard jackson and lukich
nico steps from the shadows ducks into the back seat
the car takes off
how did ya find him
the nun phoned me
she said two men had been sneaking around the church
she sounded scared nico checks his
two spare clips
i got the papers from that senators aides apartment
everything harrisons been working on
its all at my place
booms past camera only a few feet away from a row of tenement apartment buildings
as train sound recedes camera moves in on one building
we hear loud upbeat rock and roll coming from a third floor apartment from within car once youre inside youll signal us
it is the middle aged woman who left the bomb seen in father genarros church
a police sketch of her was seen on tele vision
she is looking up at the third floor window getting instructions
she turns around occasionally to see whos talking to her
dont be scared
your life depends on this
it is one of salvanos goons weve seen before
he is checking his gun
the woman walks slowly down the hall
she carries a small donation can
she knocks on a door
we hear footsteps from within the apartment
the door opens
its bonifacia the nun from the church though now in civvies
the middle aged woman with the donation can raises it as if asking for a contribution
bonificia looks flustered impatient
she really doesnt want to leave the door open
exusame por favor
tiene dinero para
three of salvanos armed goons appear on both sides of the doorway
they push both women violently into the apartment
he steps quickly surely into the apartment
it flies open
the goon points his gun at the camera
father tomassino the costa rican priest stands at the window he has been trying to open it
he knows he cant escape
the light in the apartment window blinks twice
from two cars emerge the shapes of several men
jacksons car with jackson nico and lukich aboard swings around a corner into a traffic jam
the horn blares
a stereo speaker blasts music from the front room
camera pans across bonifacias bedroom dresser
we see mementos of her life and a photo of herself with father genarro with a group of children
camera continues to pan past bonifacias bed past bonifacias body
camera continues down to the floor where lies the lady who planted the bomb
they both appear dead
he is in a chair his wrists strapped to the chair arms
he is sweating fearful but clinging to his courage
behind father tomassino we see salvano chi chi and two other goons armed with pistols
salvano moves toward the priest sets a small tv table down beside him
the priest glances toward it atop its rickety surface a fearsome array of syringes and drug vials
he glances up from the hypodermics above the law rev
into frame moves kurt zagon
we see clearly the years of aging since se asia
his face is even scarier than when he performed similar atrocities in those days
zagon prepares a syringe tests it shooting a clear liquid skyward
youll be in heaven in a few minutes padre
but first im going to put you through hell
nico lukich and jackson are speeding through the infamous southside
we want to scream at them to get there already
salvano holds the priests arm steady zagon moves in with the needle
you came here to talk to the senators aide didnt you
but you killed him first
who told you about our plans
this is from confession
i tell no one
you wouldnt lie to me father
its a sin
father tomassino says nothing he begins to cry
almost with kindness if you spoke to anyone tell me now indicates hypo and i wont have to use this
the unmarked police car pulls up across the street
nico jackson and lukich gaze at the building
above the law rev
in the shadows by the corner a hulking latino man loiters
thats an eyeball if i ever saw one
nico starts to open the car door
jackson moves to join him
youre our backup
if we come out running then you can shoot
nicos eyes meet his partners
its plain hell break her leg if he has to to keep her safe by the car
jackson accepts this reluctantly
nico and lukich exit the vehicle
nico indicates an adjacent building he and lukich start for it
father tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of zagons chemicals
in spite of this the priests spirit to resist is astounding
speak to me father who did you tell
i know what you are
i know what beasts you are
nico and lukich emerge from the roof door guns drawn
the roof is empty
antennas skylights clotheslines
the pair creep soundlessly onto the next roof
they cross toward the roof door like infantrymen moving one at a time from cover to cover covering each other
they reach the door that leads down into the building
nico checks the far side of the enclosure nods to lukich
lukich cracks the roof door open nico and lukich creep down the stairs from the roof
nico opens the door leading to the top third floor
the drugs have taken hold
the priests brain is an open memory bank for zagon to probe
i want to know who you told
barely coherent i told them
you make the ninos
castrating their fathers raping
mutilating their mothers and
breaks down crying and sometimes
to the ninos
as he slowly pushes the door open
the hallway is empty
nico and lukich pad in
above the law rev
quickly lukich checks the stairs leading down
nico crosses silently past the first apartment door checks the far end of the hallway
nico comes back toward the apartment door
lukich approaches from the opposite side
they take up positions flanking the door guns drawn
the loud music continues from inside
salvano and chi chi look on revulsed
whatever is happening to father tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill
tell me the truth father the priests eyes roll grotesquely he convulses sweat beading on his forehead
he looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell
close to priest can we kill him
if you told anyone about our plans to kill the senator we cannot do it
we hear another elevated train approaching outside
nico kicks the apartment door in
he and lukich burst in guns clutched two handed
the first goon reacts raises his pistol
lukich shoots him
nico nails the second goon just as chi chi aims his sawed off pistol grip shotgun at nico
nico has a split second to dive behind a heavy upholstered chair
chi chis double barrel blast blows the chair into powder
almost instan taneously nico sees the priest just as zagon slashes the priests throat
salvano shoots lukich point blank in the shoulder sending lukichs gun sailing
nico firing grabs lukich dives out the door with him zagon and salvano open fire from the apartment full tilt
bullets rip through the wall blasting wood and plaster everywhere
nico shoves lukich toward the stairwell go
simultaneously firing back through the kicked in door emptying his gun
above the law rev
in spanish from apartment get him
nico is slamming a fresh clip in lukich is stumbling away toward the stairwell
salvano and chi chi appear in the apartment doorway
chi chi levels his fierce hogleg at nicos head
at that instant a broadside of bullets slam into the wall around chi chi
its jackson on the stairs
chi chi is hit but spins fires
his shotgun blast catches jackson square in the chest blowing her back like a doll down the stairwell out of sight
nico reacts with agony twists on the floor shoots chi chi in the face
nico pulls the trigger as fast as he can sending a hail of fire through the doorway through the walls
salvano clutches his hench man using his dead body as a shield nicos bullets blow chi chi apart
zagon fires back hits nico in the side by the ribs
nico tries to fire back hes empty
nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof clawing for a new clip as he goes
salvano and zagon burst into the hallway shooting at nico
thundering along the tracks adjacent to the building
nico highballs from the stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts all around him with gunfire from the floor below
he dives sideways rolling to avoid the fire he recovers his footing in time to see salvano and zagon burst onto the roof from the stairwell
nicos bullets miss them they separate taking cover behind two walls at the roofs margins
nico is trapped in the open
pop back out aiming at nico leaps off the roof
nico lands on the roof of the speeding el train his momentum nearly carrying him off the far side catches a railing claws at it
bullets rip into the train roof all around him above the law rev
fire for all theyre worth at nicos receding form
crawls to the space between cars lowers himself down
he clings to the swaying chains
nico staggers through the almost empty car and collapses on a bench
hurtle into view under the el sirens blaring
zagon and salvano scramble away
a cleaner more upscale neighborhood
nico labors down the steps clutching his jacket to his ribs
several affluent people look at him oddly he ignores them keeps going he makes his way up the street weakening to a tasteful brown stone
nico climbs the steps in pain nico over the sink shirt off water running applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs
we see jacksons make up stuff along the counter feminine robes hanging on the door law books around a reading stand
nico is in real pain exhausted weakening nico at jacksons desk its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from senator harrisons aides place
we glimpse them photos of central american atrocities dead bodies etc
he tries to study them quickly but his attention shifts nico glances around the apartment more law books jacksons degree on the wall her rowing machine on the floor several
framed photos beside him on her desk
nico turns several toward him
above the law rev
jackson with her sisters and their kids jackson in law class jackson and nico posing smiling at the police shoot ing range he starts to cry
to jacksons photo had to be a hero
another fucking hero
im sorry jax
he reaches for a small calendar looks at it
nico circles meet with father tomassino
nico circles another date senator delivers foreign policy position paper committee for democratic policy fund raiser
nico scoops up the aides papers stands wobbly senator
of papers with scorn dumb fuck
think theyre gonna let you put em outta business several cops frantically clear the way to the emergency room
a gurney is wheeled down the corridor
lukich a shoulder bandaged walks beside the gurney holding the hand of jackson
a bloody flak jacket rests upon the gurney
shes been sedated
she has buckshot wounds on her neck and shoulder but she is alive
to lukich you call nicos goddamn uncle and find out if hes heard anything
above the law rev
wounded himself you just shutup and take it easy pal
closeup of nico riding through the wet streets
lukich is on the phone
his shirt is off and hes being bandaged
in the background jackson is also being cared for
on phone we dont know what happened to him branca
ya shes gonna be alright
branca a bodyguard next to him grimly puts down the phone
he looks devastated
above the law rev
from the darkness nico appears barely making it up the driveway
we hear the sound of the cab drive off
branca and a bodyguard come forward grabbing nico as nico almost collapses
the motherfuckas got jackson
shes not dead
shes gonna make it
she was wearing a vest
nico cant believe it
in spite of it all life comes to him
a little smile
that broad didnt trust me
we glimpse several armed bodyguards in concealed positions
a late model cadillac pulls up
a man carrying a doctors bag gets out and is escorted to the side door
rosa has pulled back the curtain from the second floor bed room window
she witnesses the arrival of the doctor
on the bed behind her sleep sara and julian
a bodyguard stands outside the bedroom door
the doctor tends nico
bloody bandages and antiseptic bottles litter a coffee table
two guards stand by
branca is showing nico an by photograph
it was picked up with your mail this afternoon
a shot of nicos family taken from a parked car in front of the church the morning of the bombing
above the law rev
nicos grim expression shows he knows just what this means
dont worry theyre booked on an early plane
theyll be out of the country tomorrow
nico winces as the doctor finishes applying a bandage
in the background we hear a commotion
a bodyguard tries to fend off the physical and verbal assault from sara and rosa
sara carries julian
sara rushes to nicos side
nico reaches for her but the pain stabs him
oh my god nico
rosa starts forward her face in agony at the sight of her wounded son
the boy has ribs of steel
touching nicos brow enough of your humor
sara clings to nicos arm tears in her eyes
rosa crosses herself
sara begins to weep
the doctor finishes
theres a long awkward moment
then to doctor and bodyguards leave them
leave them alone
rosa sits in a chair
nico on the couch holding julian
sara faces him
tears have stained her cheeks but she is in control of her emotions now
youve got to do it nico
you know you have to
whatever sara is proposing nico is dead set against it
above the law rev
listen to her nicola
dead serious whatever you think of him federico is family
he is our family
nico makes no response
instead he lifts julian nuzzles him tenderly
ever notice how clean babies smell
like nothing in the world has touched them yet
sara glances to rosa
rosa knows what she wants
dis creetly rosa rises exits
sara and nico are alone
if you wont go to him i will
in pain dont push me like this her eyes meet his loving but desperate
branca can put us on a plane but where can we fly to
theres nowhere they cant find us
you dont know what the hell youre talking about
im talking about everything ive learned from you in the past five years
nico is in agony
you know i cant go to him
sara takes both his hands in hers
do you know why i love you
do you know what it is about you that ive always loved
as nico fights his own emotion pride
its what you have inside
you dont live the way other people live
you trust what you see as right and wont let anyone or anything make you stray from it
above the law rev
move in past sara to nicos face
but now that pride may kill all of us
beat youve got to swallow that pride nico
choke on it if you have to
lay it aside
close together with their baby between them
sara buries her face against her husbands chest
nicos arm goes around her
he holds her tight
he wears a suit and tie a hat
is this the attorney
you can come now mr
we hear a metallic sound begin very close pull to reveal bars which slide electrically to the side
a prison door opens letting him through
nico escorted by a prison guard walks down a long blank hallway
waiting in a barren reception room
several benches tables heavy steel mesh over windows a steel door opens on the far side
out steps a small italian man in his seventies wearing the faded denim of an inmate
above the law rev
nico and the small man frederico larusso walk together down a long corridor speaking occasionally the tension thick between them
behind them a discreet fifteen paces walk two armed prison officials
the old man never looks directly at nico yet we sense keenly that he is taking the younger mans measure
i am only an old man
an old man with a cancer
the two are like an old and a young lion appraising each other using all five senses and more
i dont have much time uncle
so i must speak plainly
nico waits for a beat
then above the law rev
this is very painful for him for as long as ive been old enough to think ive hated you and hated everything you stood for
larusso takes this in without a flicker
i was so sure that you and i were on opposite sides of the fence
and that you and your people were destroying this country nico pauses glances away across the grounds
the most painful realization of my life was that the people i worked for and you are not far apart
meets larussos eyes and theres not much difference between what you are and what i was
larusso studies nico a long moment
then takes nicos elbow
continue across the grounds
i will be candid with you
i knew probably before you did that you would be coming to me
i knew what you would ask
and i had every intention of refusing you
he glances to nico
but it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself
he keeps walking
you know of course that this senator harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow
as nico acknowledges you know too that as long as this man
this torturer above the law rev
as long as this zagon lives nothing i can do will guarantee your familys safety
beat ecce non uomine ecce bestie
you know dante
translates these are not men these are animals
larusso stops takes a small note pad from his pocket
he quickly scribbles a few lines
memorize this address
he holds the paper for nico to see
have you got it in your mind
larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds
the old man takes his leave of nico with a warm if formal handshake
the guards stand by waiting
thank you mr
i trust you will give my love to my niece rosa
i will do that mr
sincerely i hope you will be well
then without a word he turns and exits back through the steel door
passengers file aboard a flight to toronto
rosa carrying the baby is among the crowd moving toward the boarding door
leaving with them are two of brancas men
we pick out branca and two of his bodyguards near the fringes looking inobtrusive but definitely on guard
above the law rev
hidden by a bank of phones sara clings to nico holding him as tight as she can
when she releases him we cant hear what she says but it seems like be careful please be careful
nico glances to branca who motions subtly to hurry
he squeezes saras hand she joins the crowd swelling toward the boarding door an air canada plane blasts skyward
watch from an open corner of a parking lot
as the plane begins its bank to gain altitude branca turns to nico
the two bodybuards keep a discreet watch nearby
you got the architects drawings
wiring floor plans nico indicates a briefcase he is carrying
its all here
nico turns to his uncle
regards him with affection
i could help you from here on
its not your business
nico embraces his uncle by both shoulders
grazie tio caro
branca pats nicos cheek
take care of yourself nicola
several shots of high rise cityscapes at night
above the law rev
thru camera pans to the apartment complex across the plaza
focus on one suite on the topmost floor
curtains are drawn on all windows but through one crack we glimpse a man pacing
the man wears a white shirt and a shoulder holster
to the roof of the apartment complex
we see a heli pad
two more men also in suits smoking talking
above the law rev
back to the apartment suite
now another man crosses before the gap in the curtains
wearing a cowboy hat zagon
hes laughing pouring himself a drink at the wet bar nico looking through a high tech night telescope
his briefcase is by his feet open
several architects drawings floor plans visible
lifts his eye from the scope jots a note on a pocket pad
not even you can hit him at this range nico
behind nico the unmistakable sound of a
safety being clicked off
nico freezes his back to the voice
he raises his hands
that wasnt the plan nelson
covers nico from behind with a silencer fitted
he glances to the briefcase and building plans on the floor
close range huh
place is rigged scanned every seconds
back still turned i was thinking of a mine on the roof
remote triggered when the chopper comes in
roofs wired too
sensors every fifteen feet
foxs finger rests ready on the trigger
you can turn now
we see fox clearly now
his boyish features have weathered since his spook days in vietnam
there is grey in his hair now he wears an expensive suit and is alone
above the law rev
i figured youd do your recon from this building
nico regards his old mate across the gun barrel
youre looking fit nelson
getting a bit of a tire
indicates foxs suit your own tailor
youve gone a long way
fox motions for nico to dump his gun nico complies dropping it gently into the briefcase
nico takes half a step toward fox
fox shakes his head in warning
motions nico back i know what you can do when you get too close to a man
i dont believe you fox
nico walks hands behind his head
fox is catty corner be hind him carrying the briefcase
leveled at nicos back
whats so hard to believe
i want to help you you dumb guinea
fox the fixer
if i wanted to cap you id have saved myself this chit chat
make big points for me to bring in your scalp
id be white house material
is that what zagon is
one of your basement boys
above the law rev
zagons a rancher
acres in costa rica
above the law rev
bought with what opium from cambodia
and a ton a week of coke from other places
which he funnels here through salvano
with the company getting its cut
still dodging appropriations committees eh nelson
thats my job nico
they arrive at an elevator
keep your nose in the corner
when we get out stay five paces ahead of me
cross down to the garage
nico and fox emerge from the elevator
nico lowers his hands from behind his head
fox keeps his gun out of sight as he and nico step past
fox maintains a slight distance behind nico as they cross to ward some escalators under a sign to parking level
the senator couldnt be bought could he
he was gonna blow the lid off so you cleared zagon to frost him keep walking
they reach a corner and turn
but the priest found out somehow and ran here
you couldnt do the senators number till you knew if the priest had talked
so zagon flew in with his little medical bag
only by then i was in on it and you thought i might recognize his handiwork
above the law rev
several guests and diners wait by the cashiers booth for their cars to be fetched
valets hustle with tickets
fox and nico come off the escalator
if your name was joe smith i never would have caught it
but how many nicola toscanis are there
you got it off the arrest sheet
fox hands his ticket to the cashier motions nico to the side away from the guests still keeping his distance should nico try to make a move
i tried to warn you old buddy
i knew you had wiretaps
and i knew you wouldnt let em go
only i was too dumb to crack it
i was so busy trying to figure a code i didnt even recognize zagons voice
its all crystal clear to nico now
so we kill our own senators now
the romans did
a cadillac pulls up the valet hops out two particularly florid well fed guests get in tipping the valet
to fox watching the guests are we the romans
were an empire too
fox doesnt like the look nico gives him
would you rather spoon borscht and quote lenin
losing patience im trying to save you asshole
i got a spot for you
thailand deep under no names no numbers
doing what processing heroin
you send checks to your family
zagon wont touch you youll be on the team fuck you
in five years youre out with a fat swiss account and a gs pension
nico stares at his old friend with contempt
he sees the gun under foxs coat but hes too tired and too disgusted to care you know fox right now in israel theyre trying some year old camp guard
for war crimes
and all around our country there are guys on death row for killing one person two people
and probably they all deserve it he takes a step toward fox
foxs hand tightens on his gun
emotion rising but you and i know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what
non military personnel
ticks off the beats viet
librarians teachers doctors
and thats just a sliver of it
fox tries to maintain a hard face
but his own guilty conscience is working presses closer weve wiped out entire fucking countries
and not one agent moves gun into nicos view stop right there
above the law rev
doesnt stop not one c
agent has ever been tried or convicted much less accused of any crimes
closer still you motherfuckers think youre above the law right in foxs face well you aint above mine
nico holds himself trembling with intensity
at that moment o
from the garage entrance ramp the squeal of approaching tires
nico and fox turn to see screeches to a halt in front of them
five men dismount swiftly
salvano bad dude and two agent types from the tenement
zagon and his men are forty feet from nico and fox playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders but the bulk under their jackets is unmistakably
what a team we have here
calls friendly weve been looking for you nelson
i see youve found our friend
fox looks shaky unnerved nicos words have hit too close to home
now nico backs away a step ready for anything
one of zagons agents holds their cars rear door open
thanks for the help fox
i didnt bring him nico
i swear it
have you two been sharing fond memories
reminiscing about the good old days
zagon waves nico and fox toward his car
zagon and salvano start forward
fox glances torn to nico who has backed away another half step
will nico attack
run for it
to nico dont fucking move
fox pulls his
from concealment covering nico
an evening gowned woman waiting with her husband for their car hears foxs shout sees his gun
grabs her husbands arm jack the husband sees
so do the other guests
salvano sees their alarm he swings his jacket open revealing a snub machine gun
someone screams bring in our friend nelson
salvanos muzzle covers fox and nico be a good boy his moment of truth
he fires at salvano
in the same instant salvano pulls his own trigger
salvanos machine gun burst cuts fox down a milli second before foxs
slug blows salvano off his feet
fox dying slings his
to nico who snatches it from the ground just as a hail of machine gun fire thunders around him
nico dives headlong behind a concrete column which is instantly chewed to shreds by gunfire
zagon fires his mac on full automatic
a second agent hurries forward to outflank nico
nico pops from behind the column drills the agent broadside behind the ear blowing the whole side of his head off
guests and valets are shrieking in terror hitting the deck in clusters clawing and scrambling over each other for safety
to first agent advancing move
nico springs from cover firing trying to bolt down the garage ramp toward the lower levels
his path puts the first agent directly in zagons line of fire
zagon doesnt hesitate he opens up on nico cutting down his own man salvano has gotten to his feet wounded but still handling his gun
he joins zagon rushing forward a valet rounds a corner unsuspecting bringing up a car
nico is on him like a cat tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel leaping in above the law rev
tear around the corner at the top of the ramp
both open fire as highballs straight toward them
hold the trigger down full automatic nico drops below the dash driving blind
the windshield is blown apart both front tires explode the radiator blasts reloading as salvano fires
pinwheels out of control its nose facing away from salvano and zagon
the car brakes furiously hits reverse looking back over the seat he sees salvano his clip empty now hurrying to wrestle a fresh magazine in nico floors it in reverse
slamming into salvano lifting him off his feet smashing him with the car into a metal grate wall
a horrible death
from the eighth floor the metal grate of the parking struc ture blows out onto the street below followed by salvanos body
burning rubber furiously away from the wall reloaded turning his gun toward nico when hurtle around the corner from the escalators guns drawn
above the law rev
shouts to zagon you there zagon spins rips both guards with a fierce burst
the guards drop
zagon turns to on his feet charging straight at zagon
nico grabs him slams zagon with incredible force into a concrete column
zagons gun goes flying but miraculously he spins away
nico dives for him gets his neck in a grip that is certain to snap it in half a second
but appears in the torturers hand
it slashes nico right a cross his already wounded ribs
nico cries in agony scampers free
nico gets to his feet bleeding
nico is between zagon and zagons machine gun on the ground
zagon bolts for his car
nico dives for the gun zagon floors it into a scorching blasts up the exit ramp out of nicos line of fire leaps into the other half destroyed car
its two front tires are flat windshield blown out radiator pouring steam
nico does the only thing he can do puts the pedal to the metal in reverse blasts across the ramp divider takes off after zagon in reverse another car is
zagon sideswipes it into a wall keeps going rear tires churning smoke front flats scraping on their rims
he pours on the speed zagons car whips out into the night time commotion
pedestrians police sirens o
zagon looks behind him hurtles into view in reverse
above the law rev
is trapped by the traffic
zagon looks around wildly then floors the accelerator
zagons car bucks straight up the pedestrian steps onto the plaza
strollers scream and scatter as it fishtails wildly careening toward the huge stone fountain follows pouring smoke in reverse
nico cuts zagon off crashes into zagons car broadside sending it skittering sideways into the fountain retaining wall leaps free sprints toward the hotel alley
nico takes off after him on foot zagon races down the darkest of alleys rounds a corner hurtles after him gaining
nico whips around the alley corner straight into waiting beside a plain grey tv remote van
nico skitters to a stop as a shotgun an m and two pistols cover him
shotgun agent raises his weapon to fire no
i want him
i want him alive
a banner reads welcome committee for democratic policy a car pulls up
nico his wrists tied is dragged into the basement of the hotel
sweating windowless concrete
as the camera reveals this airtight dungeon this is bullshit zagon
we got work to do
above the law rev
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
in a metal chair wrists taped in front of him
one agent stands behind him clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around nicos throat
shotgun agent holds his weapon on him its twin muzzles inches from nicos skull
finishes washing his hands in an industrial type sink
he is cleaned up wearing a fresh shirt his hair combed
when he dries his hands he looks like a surgeon preparing to operate
weve got an hour before the honorable senator
hands towel to pistol agent youve got to learn to take time smell the roses
zagon turns to nico
how are you gonna do him zagon
in a motorcade
or passing through a hotel kitchen
the noose agent jerks his cable tight making nico gag and choke
zagon motions to slacken off
he stops at a small table before nico unrolls a well worn felt pouch
zagon watches nicos reaction as the tools of the inter rogators trade come into view drug vials syringes scalpels surgical tools
ive used these little beauties many times to extract information lifts a needle to the light thisll be the first time ive ever used them
just for fun
zagon sets the syringe down slips on a heavy weighted glove
to agents take his arms
pistol agent and bad dude move in one on each side seizing nicos forearms
shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to nicos head
zagon punches nico square in the face so hard the chair reels backward spinning out from under nico hold him up
pistol agent and bad dude lift nico
zagon slams him again
nicos cheekbone is broken blood drains from his nose
zagon aims a two handed blow backhands nico crushing the other side of his face
zagon backs off chest heaving
pistol agent and bad dude plop nico back in the chair gagging choked by the noose
nico looks like the viet prisoner the one we saw in the opening sequence
like the prisoner nico takes his beating still conscious still meeting zagons eyes with defiance
this is where you came in toscani
only now its where youre gonna check out
he takes off his glove grabs the syringe
pistol agent and bad dude clamp nicos right arm down tight
zagon injects nico
reacts instantly to the hypo cursing sputtering under the choking noose
he twists wildly trying to free him self but the agents powerful arms hold him
fight it cherry
fight it so it speeds faster on its way nico struggles more violently
till the vessels burst in your brain
till the arteries rupture in your heart slowly the struggle goes out of nico
his muscles go limp he slumps drooling babbling incoherently
thats my boy
thats what i was waiting for zagon produces his famous knife
he motions pistol agent and bad dude to release nicos arms
noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable
zagon moves in closer gloating cooing
a fool learns from his own mistakes
but a wise man learns from the mistakes of others moves closer blade in hand you should have killed me when you had the chance toscani the blade moves to
suddenly nico springs to life catching noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip grabbing zagon with his taped hands by the throat lifting him bodily slamming
him ferociously into the wall
zagon drops to the floor half conscious
nico spins instantly to find the shot gun agent right behind him raising his weapon to nicos face about to pull the trigger
nico sidesteps grabbing the mans wrist
the shotgun goes off missing nico by inches blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall
the noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster
nico snaps the shotgun agents wrist flipping him through the air simultaneously grabbing the weapon spinning behind the noose agent then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash
the back of his head in
another swing wipes out pistol agent
bad dude now with a clear shot aims his m
nico blows him away with a double barreled shotgun blast
in a flash nico has spun to zagons surgical tool table lifted a rzor sharp scalpel and slashed the tape freeing his hands
he yanks the choke cable off his neck on his feet again
he reaches swiftly to the floor snatches up his famous knife
nico confronts him face battered bloody shaking battling internal spasms
can you feel the chemicals cherry
you cant fight em much longer long enough to finish you
sweating half spitting zagon slashes at nico like an animal nico traps the knife and enters smashes zagon in the face with one lightning blow
we see zagons nose and face completely cave in
nico comes under zagons elbow the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise like grip and bending it backwards slowly against the joint which now starts
to rip in half
zagon is screaming and cursing writhing in agony the drugs have hit nico full force now
hes weakening his eyes are starting to roll
zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself it almost seems hell wriggle free when the elbow joint snaps in half with a sicken ing sound
above the law rev
as the joint hangs dangling grotesquely nico reaches up around zagons neck still holding the dangling limb with one arm
he begins to now do to zagons neck what he did to his arm
we hear a terminal crack
zagons body crumples to the floor
nico in delirium staggers toward the door a woman at a pay phone
she turns drops the receiver in shock as bursts delirious from the stairwell door
a commotion as lukich agent neeley and jackson arm in a sling race in from their car
weaves wildly forward
he drops to his knees
guests react in astonishment and horror
is the first to spot nico
she runs up to him as he collapses
looks at jackson
reach nico and jackson
shouting for anyone is there a hotel doctor
above the law rev
passes out in jacksons arms
behind them we see a banner announcing senator harrisons address
from the ballroom we hear cheers and applause
a fiery address is being finished inside
the senator is now leaving
guests staring everywhere
from a side office a man with a medical bag comes running
the senator sees the group around nico
press vans outside a crush of cars reporters neighbors
newsmen are trying to gain access to the house held back by several cops and some of nicos more strapping relatives
above the law rev
escorted by two police motorcycles pulls in
the press surrounds it as lukich neeley lieutenant strozah and jackson her arm in a sling disembark from the car
neeley walks over and opens the door as a court stenographer carrying her transcription machine case steps out followed by a federal judge clayton alspaugh and shove mikes and cameras
at the senator and the judge shouting questions
lukich neeley and strozah clear a path for them
harrison and alspaugh fend off the questions cross the path and mount the steps to the house
in front of house senator harrison has today issued a statement calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor nico propped up on the couch looking like hell but de
finitely conscious and in full command of his faculties
sara jackson and rosa beside him
a network anchor delivers the headline news
earlier this week the harrison commission delivered its report on the growing c
scandal to congress
the image changes to senator harrison behind a battery of microphones sitting at a senate hearing type table with a plaque reading sen
ernest harrison before him
on tv officially sanctioned deceit murder and corruption will continue until these men are brought to justice
above the law rev
looks up as the real senator harrison judge alspaugh and the others enter the room
tv sound down
harrison stops before nico taking a moment to look with respect and ad miration at the man propped up on the pillows
above the law rev
i wanted to personally thank you
you are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out
he holds out his hand
nico takes it
the senator gestures to judge alspauch
and this is clayton alspaugh of the fifth circuit court
the judge nods to his stenographer who swiftly sets up her equipment takes a seat
rosa makes a face at branca who rises clearing a seat for the judge
sara moves in tight beside nico
are you sure youre feeling well enough
nico glances to sara to the supporting faces around him
to alspaugh if youre ready to listen im ready to talk
as the judges voice begins over slating the depo sitions the stenographers fingers start moving
the full scene
nico telling his story
responsible officials recording it the press corps vans neighbors closing credits begin
to the street the houses and finally the neighborhood
nicos neighborhood to which the truth has finally come home
closing credits continue over
