href b b by mike myers music timpani roll and dramatic sting in his last adventure austin powers a swinging spy from the sixties was unfrozen in the nineties to
battle his archenemy dr
austin foiled dr
evils plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever
or so he thought
elegant double doors with a brass plaque reading honeymoon suite
a do not disturb sign hangs from the handle
from the first movie austin and vanessa snuggle in bed
she plays with his chest hair
i love you mr
and i love you mrs
shot to match existing footage austin gets out of bed
we see vanessa putting on her robe from behind and then existing footage austin and vanessa kiss
lets go out on the terrace
its a beautiful night we can look at the stars
existing footage austin and vanessa gaze at the stars
look how beautiful the night sky is
isnt that the big dipper
yeah and that looks just like uranus
sheepish well you know
hey ive never seen that big star before
yeah what is that
austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look
existing shot the bobs big boy rocket
this isnt over yet mr
i have one more trick up my sleeve dont i mr
the frozen mr
the bobs big boy rocket
suddenly a hatch opens in bobs rear end and dr
evils silver egg capsule poops out
capsule begins fiery re entry to earth austin comes in and shuts the balcony door
oh well i guess it was nothing
a vanessa double crosses carrying a bouquet of flowers which obscure her face
care for some champagne
pouring heres to monotony i mean monogamy
vanessa sits at the vanity with her back turned
what are you doing luv
back turned just putting on my as vanessa turns around she puts her hands up and pulls off her face revealing wires transistors and a speaker where her mouth should
computer voice frightened vanessa youre a fembot
midway through the fight machine guns pop out of vanessas breasts
machine gun jubblies how did i miss those
robot voice her machine gun breasts fire spraying the room in slo mo
then they run out of ammo and click click
austin empties his gun into the robot but to no avail
she rushes at him he gives her a judo chop also to no avail
then austin notices a self destruct switch and hits it
she starts to twitch her head spins and she explodes
fembot parts fly around the room
austin sits on the bed saddened
he holds vanessas hand which has wires hanging out of it
on one of the fingers is her wedding ring
very sad i cant believe vanessa my bride my one true love the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life with another the person who taught
me the meaning of love was a fembot
how will i ever go on
beat wait a tic
that means im single
rich european guests mill about the luxurious lobby
suddenly austin dances through naked
just as we are about to see his bits and pieces a man lifts up his suitcase
yeah baby im free
im naked and free
music soul bassanova by quincy jones pan up austins naked body as he walks down a boardwalk
just as the camera reaches that most sensitive of areas a credit appears starring mike myers
austin gives a big who me
and we european types stare and point
we see austin from behind
his bottom half is blocked by a bicycle
the bicycle moves away
just as austins bum is about to be revealed a credit appears blocking it
austin turns his head around to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an oh my
take and we freeze frame
a man in a raincoat flashes austin his thingy blocked by a credit
austin just laughs
austin goes around a corner
a moment later he returns followed by a nude marching band
a sign on the left side of the screen reads warning
austin enters from the left
we see his naked hairy torso from the waist up
just as he is about to appear from behind the sign a
credit appears moving left to right blocking his penis lengthwise as he walks
a girl sits on a blanket a horizontal credit blocks her bare chest
austin lays on his back beside her trying to be suave a vertical credit appears
the wind blows away a kite revealing a stark naked girl
the credit production design blocks her chest the credit by blocks her you know what
austin walks into frame the production designers name disguises his growing interest
austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress
credits appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of nudity
people leap in all directions to make saves causing credits to appear at crazy angles
a pretty girl watches austin lift weights
her boobs are blocked by the written by credit
austin lifts a dumbbell
the credit mike myers sticks out from his waist
austin looks proud
a buff naked bodybuilder joins them
he lifts a much heavier weight
a much longer credit sticks out from his waist and michael mccullers
austin runs down the beach his bum blocked by the credit directed by
he jumps on a trampoline and does the splits in mid air ad
austin smiles crazily his penis blocked by jay roach
austin does a super duper double flip into his jaguar
shaguar baby yeah
cu on the chrome script on the grill it reads shaguar where it would normally read jaguar
the car speeds off
on the stage we see a klansman father and his klansman son a nazi father and his nazi son and scott evil all seated on a panel
lower third chyron my father is evil and wants to take if you just joined us todays topic is my father is evil and wants to take over the world
now bobby you had something you wanted to share with your father before the break
dad i know youre against race mixing and all that but i met someone
dont say it
the crowd whoops
i met someone
and hes black
the crowd goes crazy
the klansman holds his hooded head in his hands
please welcome tim
a handsome blair underwood look alike enters and hugs the klansmans son
the crowd screams
now scott tell us about your father
share with us
well hes the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination
and where is your father right now
hes in outer space like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a big boy rocket with his cat mr
well we have a surprise for you scott
lets bring out father dr evil
dr evil enters
lower third chyron wants to take over the world hello scott im back
i cant believe youd do this to me on national television
they offered me a free makeover
evil weve seen a lot of the fathers here today open up to their sons sons to the fathers
is there anything youd like to share
yes dont you have any secrets
i have a vestigial tail
everyone is a little grossed out
its more of a nub really
the spine just goes on a little longer than it should
also ive dabbled
i mean perform fellatio once and youre a poet twice and youre a homosexual
i remember once i was being fisted by sebastian cabot but heres where the story gets interesting
he was lactose intolerant
he could eat red meat all night long but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell
and i remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by henry kissinger and you can imagine my humiliation at having hank hear me say mr
french no teeth
one of my greatest disappointments is that i never became a song and dance man
i could have been a quadruple threat kind of like a despotic ken barry
dancer singer actor and i would possess nuclear weapons the latter being the most threatening of the four
i once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle
all i ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex
i love toe cleavage
for the most part i distrust dogs
i slept in a horse once
it was quite roomy
on second thought it was the ritz
i named my left testicle piss and my right testicle vinegar
i wrote its raining men or so the christmas babies told me
oh yes i also made a marzipan voodoo effigy of the fonze while i was in coma after smoking some peruvian prayer hash but who at the end of the
day can honestly say they havent done that
the springer audience is stunned slack jawed and for once quiet
what are you some kind of freak
shut up jagoff
studio audience whoops at this
ill kick your ass punk
crowd goes crazy
no one talks to my boy that way
evil charges at klansman and starts to bitch slap him
security men with headsets on rush in to separate them
im ok im ok
there is a beat then dr
evil charges the guy again knocking him down
come scott lets go to daddys new evil lair
we pan up a modern office building
the camera reaches the top of the building and we see a giant starbucks logo and the words starbucks world headquarters
the penthouse boardroom is adorned with starbucks paraphernalia large logo clear canisters full of beans and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is a starbucks
around a large table are dr
evil number two bandaged and lightly spotted with soot frau scott and a couple of new henchmen
a starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot coffee products
evil as the legitimate frontman of your organization i seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small seattle based coffee company several years ago
today starbucks is a far flung empire with outlets worldwide
oh good number two i do enjoy a good cuppa joe
if i may continue i believe if we shift our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium quality coffee drinks we can increase our gross profits fivefold
evil takes a sip of cappuccino leaving a white frothy milk mustache on his upper lip
perhaps youve confused me with someone who gives a shit
might i remind you that i run the show here
i demand a little respect
evils milk mustache dr
evil i think you silence
i will not tolerate your insolence
remember what happened last time
number two disappears backwards into the fiery pit
number two smiles weakly breaking into a sweat on his brow
may i add i appreciate you reinstating me after our little
wie gehts is einen
we see frau
she looks a little more masculine than before
zehr gut herr doctor
how are things
i have come to embrace the love that dare not speak its name
to my right is my lover
we see a severe looking german woman with one continuous eyebrow
her name is unibrau
i met her on the lpga tour
evil takes another sip of cappuccino making the frothy milk mustache even larger
doctor you have a milk mustache
wiping it off embarrassed oh i know
evil id like to introduce the greek assassin oedipus
we see a swarthy greek army guy
welcome to my private army oedipus
i could give a shit
kiss your mother with that mouth
of course you do
dr evil begins to press a button labelled oedipus on his control panel but number two interrupts
clearing throat dr
evil as you know the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them
i have so few pleasures left to me number two
the key to life is to rotate your vices
one day its executions another day its creamy french cheese
its like frickin heroin
evil perhaps i have the answer
while you were frozen we began a program to clone you
we had a few glitches but i think youll be pleased with the results
shouting send in the clone
music dramatic sting we see the shadow of an approaching figure
the shadow looks like dr
evil only much larger and scarier
he is identical to you in every way except he is one eighth your size
we see that the source of the shadow is a miniature dr
evil just like the creepy mini marlon brando in the island of dr
he mimics dr
evils mannerisms including holding his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth
i shall call him mini me
to clone mini me you will sit to my right
mini me sits down in a miniature version of dr
evils command chair
the bald mr
bigglesworth runs and jumps into dr
a bald mr
bigglesworth kitten jumps into mini mes lap
mini me something to eat
expectant pause no
pause to room tired
gentleman i have a plan
as you know the most powerful man in the world is the president of the united states
but he is just that a man subject to temptations of the flesh like any other man
heres what we do we make it seem that the president has had extra marital oral relations with and this is the kicker with a white house intern
so does mini me
clearing his throat uh hem
what that already happened
number two nods
this is ri goddamn diculous
oh well how about a frickin time machine
does the president have a time machine
have i been scooped on that
no not that im aware of
alright time machine it is
as you know every diabolical scheme ive hatched has been thwarted by austin powers
and why is that ladies and gentlemen
because you never kill him when you get the chance and youre a dope
mini me hops upon the table and tries to push the scott evil button on dr
evils control panel
frau squirts him with a water bottle
mini me glares at scott and gives him the finger
no because austin powers has mojo
the mojo is the life force the essence the libido the right stuff
its what the french call a certain i dont know what
if youve got a time machine why dont you just go back and kill austin powers when hes a baby or something
no no no
evil wouldnt it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market
we could literally make trillions
smug laugh to himself why make trillions when we could make
why think small is all im saying
a trillion is more than a billion numb nuts
unveil the time portal
a wall panel opens to reveal a stargate like wall of shimmering energy
ladies and gentlemen i give you the time portal
as you know austin powers was frozen in
therefore i time travel to two years after he was frozen
security will be lax and ill strike when he is totally helpless
first i take austin powers mojo
then i begin my domination of the world
can i come
no scott daddy has a score to settle
austin powers is the snake to my mongoose or the mongoose to my snake
either way its bad i dont know animals
but i do know this this time its personal
frau number ill see you both in
come mini me
evil walks to the portal
mini me follows imitating him perfectly
they enter the portal
there is a freeze frame effect and they fade away like in star trek
evil and mini me emerge on the other side of the portal into a new lair
it is a large hollowed out volcano room dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces
a younger frau sits with number two now played by rob lowe in an eye patch
ah here we are mini me
number two you look very youthful and healthy
turning to frau and frau you look
evil walks to the center of the room chairs rise from the floor
everyone takes a seat but dr
evil gets caught in the middle as chairs rise around him
he is frightened
one of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch
ok people we now officially have a chair problem
if another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts im gonna go postal
mini me i want you to meet number two
mini me says nothing
mini me still says nothing
low blood sugar
to room gentlemen phase two is beginning
i have an operative inside the ministry of defense
by this time tomorrow austin powers mojo will be mine
evil goes over and looks out the large window
maniacal laugh ha ha ha
ha ha ha
we cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of a mt
rushmore type depiction of dr
evil carved into the side of a volcano on a tropical island
maniacal laugh ha ha ha
ha ha ha
we see austins frozen body in cryogenic storage
above it we see two digital clocks
one reads current date may the other reads date frozen november
one of the scots guards is an immensely fat scottish soldier played by mike myers
weve had reports that theres a spy in the ministry of defense
the contents of this room are vital to the country
be on special alert
thick scottish accent those bastards will have to kill me before i let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle sir
and try and lose some weight for gods sake
they exchange salutes and the colonel exits
sotto after the colonel i outta smash your teeth out with a toffee hammer mr
english colonel telling me what to do and stealing our oil refusing to recognize our scottish independence
the fat soldier begins to play the bagpipes a white vapor comes out of them filling the room
the other soldiers collapse unconscious
he bores through the ice and pulls out a sixties high tech syringe type device with an led graph on the side
he places it in austins navel
the led meter goes from red to green indicating full mojo
austin drives in modern traffic
he is drinking a starbucks coffee and listening to the jags in dash cd player
suddenly austin droops
the car starts to sputter
the fuel gauge reads empty
gor blimey im on empty
thats funny i just filled the shaguar up this morning
austin hits a button on the dashboard
basil exposition appears on the picture phone in the dash
on picture phone hello im basil exposition head of british intelligence
you always are basil
listen the weirdest thing just happened ive run out of petrol
well send a man around immediately
how was your honeymoon
vanessa tried to kill me basil
she was a fembot
ah women who can understand them
moving on lets discuss your new case
very shagadelic basil
youll be doing a photo shoot
we know that one of the models is an ex kgb agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder
that sounds easy enough you know what they say all work and no shagging makes austin a dull boy man
austin sets up his photo equipment
the room is decorated in classic heffner bear skin rugs leather chairs roaring fire
looking around tres chic baby
reg the photo assistant enters
austin the models are ready
bless your cotton socks
hey reg do you have any hobbies
i for one enjoy making models
the models make their entrance
they are real supermodels say cindy crawford rebecca romajin and also one model we dont know
circling austin its him

austin shoots a look to reg like still got it baby
one at a time girls
hi im cindy

indicating the photo gear your equipment is quite impressive
your breasts are amazing
austin comes to the unknown model
she is tall and angular
and whats your name baby
thick russian accent ivana humpalot
and i vanna toilet made of solid gold but its just not in the cards now is it
austin looks over the girls trying to decide who is the spy
inner monologue now which one is the russian spy
cindy crawford rebecca romajin
or ivana humpalot
think man think
austin begins snapping pictures
the sequence is shot like a photo shoot with freeze frames etc
turn and pout for me baby
cindy gets on all fours

full frame rebecca on the cover of national geographic
austin throws his camera to reg who catches it
hel lo you forgot about ivana
i didnt forget baby
miss humpalot and i are going to have a private session
reg shows the girls out as they protest
austin and ivana are left alone
austin claps twice and the lights dim
he claps again and the fire goes up
music im never going to fall in love again by burt bacharach when did you get the clapper
november dutch east indies shore leave
are you cold mr
i once had a bad experience with frostbite
i had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter
ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby
do you know how we keep warm in russia
i can guess baby
we play chess
i guessed wrong
it takes a keen intelligence to play chess
of course you know what they say about men with big brains dont you
they wear large hats
no they make better lovers
ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily like in the thomas crowne affair
i assume you know how to play
she runs the bishop across her lips sexily
moves in an l shape
austin tries to match her sexy moves and chokes on a piece
lets stop playing games with each other
especially difficult ones
may i ask you a question miss humpalot
do i make you horny
austin rolls around on the polar bear rug
ill tell you anything you want to know just make love to me
she pulls his shirt off revealing his prodigious chest hair
you are hairy like an animal
growling and barking grrrr baby
austin takes the head of the bear skin rug
covers the bears eyes wait a tick i dont want him watching me while im on the job
make love to me monkey man
we pan around the room seeing all the stuffed and mounted wildlife who seem to be watching
suddenly the camera stops
so does the music
whats the matter
a tall flower wilts and beds over
a souffle falls
a flag is lowered to half mast
a giant redwood falls in a forest
a hot air balloon deflates and falls
an actual scientific diagram of a penis in the refractory period
to camera crikey ive lost my mojo
an ambulance races through the streets siren blaring
basil hurries through pushing past technicians and workers
where is he
cross between a hospital room and a lab
austin lies in bed hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment
austin i came as soon as i heard
there must be some kind of mistake basil
maybe i was drunk and i didnt know it
austin holds his neck very stiffly
whats wrong with your neck austin
turning stiffly to face basil i took a viagra and it got caught in my throat
ive had a stiff neck for hours
basil is it true
have i lost my mojo
were going to run a few tests austin
dont worry old friend well get to the bottom of this
austin is being loaded into one of those big scary mri machines the mojonator
the mojo meter reads very low
montage time lapse technicians in white suits and masks transform the room into a love lair a pair of latex gloved hands carefully puts a burt bacharach record on a
examination lights are replaced with lava lamps
a tray is brought in with a videotape marked swedish educational film
finally the transformation is complete
austin lies in bed reading a vintage playboy
a candy stripe nurse enters very pretty in a tight outfit
excuse me mr
powers i need to give you a sponge bath before we begin the test
not paying attention to her alright miss just let me finish this article on the suez crisis
an alarm goes off
bright lights come on
whats going on
alright everyone were done
but the test hasnt even started
agent haggerty was the test austin
not only were you actually reading an article in that playboy but a candy stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didnt so much as turn your head
wait i can explain man
i was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating im sorry austin im afraid its true youve lost your mojo
basil shows austin the mojometer which reads empty
crushed without my mojo im useless to the ministry and to her majesty
i think its time to retire
im afraid thats not possible austin
you see dr
evil has returned
austin and basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the largest room youve ever seen in your life
we have evidence that dr
evil has developed a time machine
basil shows austin altered photos of dr
evil with famous villains such as sadam nixon and donald trump
our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed
that means dr
evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decades most despised villains
austin tries to read them and gets queasy
i cant read in the car
i get a bit vomy
austin burps and swallows it
i almost gipped
our data indicates that dr
evil is in the year
luckily we also have a time travel device
after years of research weve developed a machine that will transport you back to the sixties
a bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new volkswagen beetle convertible painted up psychedelic by peter max
but basil isnt that the new volkswagen beetle
thats what theyd like you to believe
so basil if i travel back to and i was frozen in i could go look at my frozen self
but if im still frozen in how could i have been unthawed in the s and traveled back to the sixties
goes cross eyed oh no ive gone cross eyed
to camera i suggest you dont worry about those things and just enjoy yourself
austin gets into the car and turns it on
this is smashing basil
ill go back to the sixties recharge my mojo defeat dr
evil and be back in time for tea
good luck austin
luck has nothing to do with it basil
austin steps on the gas
the car lurches in reverse and smashes some equipment
changing gears swinging sixties here i come baby yeah
the car takes off heading for the wall
it disappears leaving flaming tread marks
the beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop
a london hippie smoking a hukka watches
he throws the hukka down
austin hops out
i feel better already man
austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being terrible
he walks off as a crowd gathers around the car
austin enters the park in high spirits
we pull back to see that austin is being watched through binoculars by a big pull back further to reveal a beautiful mysterious woman watching both of them
from this distance we cant tell who she is
a sign reads be in for peace
hippies mods and freaks of all descriptions dance to the music of a psychedelic band
the bands name is on the drum kit ming tea
alright baby a swinging shin dig
austin gets into the dancing quickly becoming the center of the scene
the lead singer of the band invites him on stage and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number
begins involving the outdoor crowd a la bob fosses sweet charity or hair
singing hip thrusting young mod freaks fosse hump rhythmically
singing austin does various groovy dance moves like the rock em sock em robot and the heavyweight
singing forty austins appear in a kaleidoscope effect
singing three groovy chicks behind austin suddenly have tambourines for the big finale
the assassin and the mysterious woman are both in the audience keeping an eye on austin
all we see of the woman are shots of her boots clothes and a female singing austin holds the note an improbably long time arms outstretched
the dancers crouch walk towards the camera
chanting louder louder shouting the song ends and all the dancers end up on one knee with their arms outstretched panting
austin breathes heavily and smiles smugly like michael flatley lord of the dance
we are tight on austins ass
pull back to see that it is the mysterious woman who is watching austins ass
she smiles behind the binoculars hiding her face
austin walks down the street looking at his new beatles album
sitting in a parked citroen watching him is the assassin
the aryan assassin nods to a shoe shine on the street
the shoe shine boy nods to a business man in a homburg
the business man nods to a bobby
the bobby nods to a woman with a baby carriage
the woman with a baby carriage nods to a mime
the mime nods to a blind beggar with a tin cup
the blind beggar nods to a carpenter on a roof
the carpenter flashes a light to an indian chief
the indian chief gives a smoke signal to a telegraph operator
the telegraph operator sends a signal to the beefeater guard
the beefeater salutes with his pike to a sexy ticket collector on a double decker bus
the sexy ticket collector signals a taxi driver
the taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by
the assassin gets the signal and starts the car
the whole nodding sequence was a circular waste of time
austin walks along
suddenly he sees the citroen coming at him
he dives out of the way and takes off running
he rounds a corner and pretends to be a couple making out against a wall by hugging himself
the assassin sees him and slams on the brakes
he raises his gun
austin turns as he hears a car honk
its austins beetle convertible
the mysterious woman steps out
we see her in her entirety for the first time and what a sight it is
she has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing suit unzipped just enough to show the female symbol medallion
she is felicity shagwell
care for a ride
thats my beetle baby
it was your beetle
austin dives in as the assassin fires
the car speeds off
felicity drives expertly
austin powers i presume
powers by name powers by reputation
felicity shagwell cia
shagwell by name shag very well by reputation
turning to camera crazy baby
the beetle zips along and then the citroen appears behind it
the assassin fires
felicity turns around to look
grab the wheel would you
austin grabs the wheel and felicity pulls a gun
she turns and fires out the window
the assassins tire blows
the car skids towards a cliff and he jumps out as it goes over
the car goes over and tumbles down the cliff bouncing three times before it explodes
the assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand
same shot as the car the assassins body goes over and tumbles down the cliff bouncing three times before it too well austin i think this time you may have
met your match
oh ive beaten dr
evil before and ill beat him again
i was talking about me
she smiles turns and walks away
the room is dark with only a single spotlight providing illumination
suddenly austin and felicity rise on an elevator into the middle of the spotlight
welcome to my shag pad baby
light floods the pad revealing hanging basket chairs hi fi and warhol silk screens of austin
austin blows dust off a table
care for something to drink
austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a wetbar
or perhaps something to read
austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a button
it revolves to reveal a bookcase
how about a hot cup of coffee
yes i rather fancy a grind
austin hits a button and an automatic coffee pourer pours a cup
music girl from impenema by jobim would you like a
a sensssual mas sage
austin hits a button and a series of actions take place the floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed red gels slide into place over the lamps a painting
slides back to reveal a reel to reel an end table revolves to reveal a selection of massage oils
felicity lies on her stomach
austin begins to massage her
how does that feel baby
lowering his voice they laugh
austin continues to massage her
wait somethings itching me
she reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening dress revealing her naked back
austin gulps and accidentally spurts way too much oil on her
austin continues the back rub and felicity stretches out on the bed
talking to his crotch hello anyone home
cmon lads do it for england
austin takes a peak nothing
he is panicked
oh that was so relaxing
felicity stretches very sexily
would you like to see my etchings
sexy i think im ready for bed
she moves close to austin
he slides to the other side of the bed
ill get you some pjs
no im ready for bed
she moves over to him
he avoids her
oh youll want to clean your teeth then
austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush
felicity finally grabs him and pins him to the bed
no i want to have sex with you austin
ive studied everything about you your methods your accomplishments your preferences
youre the reason i became a spy
now ive waited two years to meet you so i say we get busy making up for lost time
austin sits up
reflective felicity i used to think that way too but i guess
i guess ive changed
not to make a short story long or to ramble on and on or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what
i was talking about in the first place but where was i
felicity i cant shag you
ive lost my mojo
obviously disappointed oh
i thought coming back to the sixties would bring it back but it hasnt
austin dont worry
i know just the man to help you
hes my guru
ringo recommended him and hes the best
ill warm up the jumbo jet baby
austins plane in flight
austin and felicity drive against obvious rear screen projection of india
it looks like a mosque with incense tapestries and disciples
austin and felicity enter
there he is
thats my guru
we see the guru pitka played by mike an indian man in a bright red sari
guru id like you to meet austin powers
how are you baby
my chakras are aligned and i am in a perfect state of equipoise
good on ya
i dont know what that means but it sounds fab
guru we need some advice
hold your horses and any other beasts of burden
i must lead my disciples in meditation and then i will help you
the guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples sink to their knees
my name is the guru pitka
i am a spiritual teacher and i have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that i learned from my guru the late guru
shastri a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis
he would say to me sparky love is all life is breath
now perhaps you are wondering where i got the nickname sparky
well when we were young we used to play a game called stinkmop
we would urinate into a bucket dip a mop into it and play tag
i did not care for stinkmop and a very wise old man said to me oh lighten up sparky and i dont know the name kind of stuck
now the reason i am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that therapist often becomes the rapist and that will not help us attain potentiality
now what is potentiality
it is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves
people often say to me that they feel nowhere and i am going to change that to now here
the guru holds up a card which says nowhere now here
and you have many assumptions about your goals but when you assume you make an ass out of u and me

fat bastard slowly draws out the high tech syringe full of dr
evil is mesmerized
mini me fetch

evil who caresses it and places it on a specially number two enters

felicity shagwell suddenly scott evil enters through time portal
scott what are you doing here
i dont know i was sitting around watching the tube and the courtship of eddies father came on nick at nite you know and i was just listening to that

hes evil he wants to take over the world and he fits easily into most overhead storage bins
looking around has anyone seen mini me

evil hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend
gentlemen phase three

evil looks around and sees mini me gnawing on the model laser
evil takes it from his mouth mini me dont chew my laser

well turn the moon into what i like to call a death star
snickering again nothing darth
what did you call me
pretends to sneeze rip off
unsure bless you
anyways since my death star laser was invented by the noted cambridge physicist dr
i thought wed name it in his honor the alan parsons project
scott snickers again
the alan parsons project was a progressive rock band from
why dont you just name it operation wang chung ass
indicating laser when you get your own evil empire you can call it whatever you want
gentlemen allow me to demonstrate the awesome lethality of the alan parsons project
fire the laser
a giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the white house causing it to explode
everyone is shocked by the lasers power
my god dr
evil you destroyed the wihite house with no warning
actually that was just footage from the blockbuster motion picture independence day but it would be a lot like that

without his mojo powers will be
a party packed with dancing freaks of every stripe is in full swing
a girl dances in an oversized birdcage
this shag in is gonna blow your mind baby yeah
the party sequence is shot like laugh in
very fast cuts to the music
austin sees a very pregnant woman drinking a martini and smoking
he gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from her
youll thank me later baby
austin and felicity dancing

felicity slaps austin on the butt as he walks off
austin at the bar with an exotic looking mod chick

an alan zeus type very gay guy
rolling his eyes this is ridiculous
a london cop and felicity are on hanging chairs
have you ever been picked up by the fuzz
no but i bet it really hurts
a guy in a raincoat on a tricycle shot undercranked rides through the party and falls over
austin pops into frame with a book that says austin powers the austin powers sexy dictionary defines an eskimo hooker as a frosty prosty
an eskimo at the bar in a fur parka
to camera i dont get it
the camera pans up felicitys cool hip huggers which are very tight
those are skin tight
how do you get into those pants baby
well you can start by buying me a drink
austin does a spit take
felicity with a viking

austin is wearing a silly spiked german helmet like in hogans heroes
german accent hello i am baron von firstinbed

film running backwards of austin doing a spit take
artie johnson in german helmet behind a plant
verrrrry interesting but shtupid
austin takes his glasses off to clean them
we see his pov which is totally fuzzy
he looks over and sees what appears to be a nude girl two round globes and dark triangle
austin puts his glasses on and looks again
it is actually a girl in a flesh colored dress
in between her and austin were two completely bald men and a triangular martini glass filled with a cosmopolitan
cut to austin and felicity together again
look at that
she points to where fat bastard and his companion are standing
thats not a pretty sight
who is he
until recently he worked security for the mod but we think he might be a double agent possibly for dr
how do you know
weve noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically
hes made a lot of cash purchases hes hanging out with foxes half his age and hes becomes quite a fixture on the london party circuit
whos the girl
i dont know but it looks like hes splitting
fat bastard exits
ill follow him
you see what you can get out of the girl
well rendezvous later
felicity follows fat bastard out the door
austin makes his way over to the girl
who are you today baby
thats an interesting name

my maiden name is spitz
well which is it baby spitz or swallows
either way its a pleasure
the pleasure is mine
she extends her hand
austin takes it and shakes
as he shakes her cleavage undulates like jello
austin is transfixed and keeps shaking far too long
charmed im sure
still shaking her breasts jiggle how do you do
still shaking jiggling yes quite
shakes jiggles i always enjoy meeting new people

is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in danger of popping out of her dress
snapping out of it so who was your friend

i dont know anyone named dr
i said mister evil

robin grabs austin and pulls him close

literally a window in a wall
fat bastard is placing his order
and ill have a fried prawn sandwich with extra mayonnaise two whole chickens a kidney pie a toad in the hole bubble and squeak bangers and mash orders of fish
and chips and
we pan to see felicity beside him
i love a man with a large appetite
and i love a woman with big bleeps so lets shut up and get to bleep ing
felicity swallows hard and forces a smile
can i ask you a question
well whats the question
would you like to shag
id love to mr
powers just come right
robin moves austin into place as they dance
youre a bit of alright
just then austin looks into her eyes and sees the reflection of an assassin oedipus about to throw a knife
just as he throws it austin spins robin swallows around and uses her as a shield
she takes the knife squarely in the back
use the revolver
oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins firing
austin continues to use robin as a shield
she takes six hits
oedipus runs out of bullets
use the machine gun
oedipus pulls out a machine gun and fires
in a robert rodriquez like flurry of events austin dodges while still oedipus throws down his gun and charges austin
austin uses robins body to block oedipuss head butt but his momentum pushes all three of them through a plate glass window of his second story loft
as they fall austin turns robin around so that she is between him and the ground
they land with a thud
robin cushions austins fall
oedipus is dead on the pavement
sorry baby too late
hes as dead as vaudeville
you cant win powers
evil has your mojo and its only a matter of time before he kills you and takes over the world
weak tell fat bastard ill miss him
felicity is in bed naked under the sheets smoking a cigarette
we hear strange sounds offstage
we pan over to reveal shes in bed with a naked fat bastard
he is eating a huge turkey leg his face covered in food
i always get bleep in hungry after i get my end away
i never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a um creative and sensuous lover
you want some chicken
i have more
he rolls over to reveal his huge naked ass
felicity takes a homing device out of her purse looks around for a place to plant it
she sees his enormous butt cleavage and realizes that theres only one place for the thing to go
angle on fat bastards face
he is delighted
frisky are we
alright lets have another go
she is horrified
evil at his table with frau scott and number two
get me the president of the united states
the president appears on dr
evils video screen with his advisors behind him
evil what do you want

president but i will receive
in hours i will destroy washington dc with a giant laser
evil reveals a giant laser
mini me is humping it like a dog
ok mini me why dont you and the laser get a frickin room

the president and his advisors laugh
evil thats more than the entire federal budget for

his advisors laugh
that much money simply doesnt exist
i dont think l billion is even a number
its like saying i want a kajillion bajillion dollars
his advisors laugh

evil looks around smugly
no one laughs

he looks around again expectantly
im sorry i dont understand

they dont know what youre talking about
ok see if you understand this give me the money or im going to blow you to frickin bits ok
the president and his advisors murmur
but making stop gesture talk to the hand
evil signs off
to scott i did love that though
cuba gooding jr
oscar speech very touching
scott looks at him with disgust
okay everybody clear the room
everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his logo
he presses a button the panel opens up to reveal
a in it we see a huge full length photo of austin powers and various magazine covers
he presses a button and an austin wig descends from the ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head
a backless mockup of austins suit rises from the floor
he puts on a pair of glasses
he has become austin powers
evil cautiously tastes the mojo
beat this isnt working
i dont feel anything
we push in towards dr
a yellow submarine like depiction of dr
zoom in on his head which explodes into other small dr
evil heads which rain on a peter max ian valley of flowers
the flowers sprout the word evil
a psychedelic flying austin head with spirals in the glasses smashes the flowers changing the words from evil to vile and to live and then to love
turn of the century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have the word greed written on the shaft smashing the
love flowers into irelo which sprouts into yellow which turns into submarines which becomes yellow penises of huge goose stepping dr
evils each of them peeing creating a rain of urine that falls on the peter max ian valley of a hundred austin powers citizens
they each open an umbrella that says love triumphs over lust
the urine turns into a stream that flows into the mouth of a huge head of dr
pull back from dr
he looks dazed and confused
just then number two re enters the room catching dr
evil with all his austin paraphernalia
evil one last thing
i was just
would it kill you to frickin knock
austin and felicity walk along the street
austin tell me about the nineties
you know i cant tell you details about the future baby it could alter history
not details just what its like
you know whats the scene
wheres it at
thereve been a lot of advances in the nineties baby
the economy is stable people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and um lets see theres an entire television channel dedicated to
its not so bad once you get used to it
the nineties are about responsibility
you know having respect for yourself and other people
i even got married
what about the sexual revolution
well it turns out there were some casualties baby
dont you think youll ever get married
no not until i get a little more experience under my belt
suddenly austin notices something outside and puts his hand to his mouth in fear
wide eyed oh my god
felicity is immediately on her guard
she pulls her gun
looking around what is it
is it fat bastard
no written here on my hand see
austin turns his hand around to show her
he has written oh my god on his hand with the pen
says oh my god
austin and felicity duck into a camera shop and come out an instant later with super cameras
they run down the street filming each other
this is a richard lester like sequence shot on grainy film from austin and felicitys povs
theres lots of speeded up stuff and popping in and out of frame like the monkees tv show
felicity i havent had this much fun since i worked undercover in amsterdam i think it was
you posed as a dutch cheese expert to stop dr
evil from poisoning the worlds water supply
austin is impressed
ive studied your file austin
i want to be a trailblazer just like you
the seventies are right around the corner
its going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology it wont be long before every flying car has its own track
austin starts to say something then bites his tongue
the cia has always been a boys club until now
well move over this chicks taking over
hoarse very impressive
austin your voice
yes i think im coming down with something
austin and felicity stop at an ice cream man with his pushcart
ill get some ice cream

hoarse to ice cream man could i have two scoops of vanilla please
right away governor
would you like chocolate syrup
hoarse yes please
will you have any whipped cream
hoarse i will thank you
hoarse yes please

oh and austin we cut back to the ice cream man to see him pulling off a very fake beard
it is basil though it was clearly another actor before
now with phlegmy throat basil
whats wrong with your voice
still phlegmy throat i just had ice cream
listen to me i have dairy throat
mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin
she tied it to a five bar gate and kicked its little interrupting austin
things are heating up so i thought it best to contact you in disguise
felicity your plan worked
you and austin track fat bastard back to dr
but how can we track fat bastard
i planted a homing device on him last night
yes and were starting to pick up the signal now
basil hands felicity a tracking device that beeps
how did you get close enough to plant a homing device
i shagged him i shagged him rotten
austin and basil are confused and grossed out at the same time
just like that
yes austin we needed that information
well thanks to your effort felicity we now know that interrupting to felicity did you use an elaborate set of pulleys
a block and tackle
anyway you two follow the signal back to dr
evils headquarters and then interrupting to felicity i just cant get my head around it baby
youre so small and hes so not small
the sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling
never mind austin you two have work to do
you must find dr
we hear the beep beep of the tracking screen built into the dash
i got it
a chinese basket with a counter weighted ballast
thats how you did it right
austin it almost sounds like youre jealous
thats not possible baby
beat to himself is it
just then a car pulls beside them
evil private army guys pull machine guns and start shooting
austin reaches back and pulls robin swallows from the back seat and uses her as a shield
were obviously on the right track
re tracking screen it looks like fat bastard is on an island in the middle of the ocean
we hear the beep beep of the tracking screen
the beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach
we still hear the beep beep
austin and felicity have set up a tent with a view of the dr
austin is looking at the mountain through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck
according to the readings dr
evils headquarters is over the next ridge
can i have a look
austin hands her the binoculars
unfortunately the strap is still around his neck pulling his face into her cleavage
question is how do we get in
austin did you hear me
i seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows
where are the topographical maps that basil drew up
i think theyre in the tent
he and felicity enter the tent
a light is on inside casting shadows of austin and felicity on the side of the tent
from the outside it appears the shadow austin is leaning over with his back to the shadow felicity who appears to have her hands up his butt
have you got it out yet
good lord austin what sort of things do you put in there
the shadow felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage links from his ass
oh anything that catches my fancy
how do you manage to fit it all in
oh it stretches to fit
the shadow felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of austins ass
are you almost done
i cant hold it much longer
we see that austin is leaned over holding part of the tent
felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent
here we go one hammer
its amazing how much this duffel bag will hold
we see dr
evil playing a piano
we pan to see mini me on top of the piano himself playing a miniature baby grand
singing we see that number two and frau are the audience
evil that was fantastic but i do have some bad news
powers is on the island
dont worry dr
evil we can get to him by using the girl
i have the perfect weapon
shouting bring in the he bots
music its rainina men by the weathergirls three he bots enter in unison
they are robotic studs in logans run type outfits
evil may i present the he bots
what kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity
their clothes are stylish their posture is ramrod straight and their buttocks are tight like tigers
and each he bot is armed with a secret weapon
a nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours out
a gun barrel flips out form his crotch and fires machine gun style
a nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles out onto the floor where it smokes
and deadly acid
evil is disgusted by the last one
i object to the last one on aesthetic grounds but i dont care how you get powers just bring him to me
to mini me ready mini me
a one and a two and
singing rapidly dancing in step voice unnaturally low we see the shadows again
it now looks like felicity is putting things into austins ass
do you want everything to go back in
listen felicity about fat bastard its my job austin
you of all people should understand that
i know your record backwards and forwards
youve had more sex on the job than a swedish stewardess
the shadow felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into what appears to be austins ass
youre right felicity i cant deny it
but the world changed and i changed too
pull back to reveal that the he bots are watching
felicity shoves the tennis racket extra hard
austin stands up rapidly
beat my back hurts
are you ok
im fine just keeping packing
the he bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent
evil fat bastard scott number two and frau are seated
christ almighty it smells terrible in here
its the volcanic sulphurous emissions
weve put up some air fresheners
great now it smells like someone took a shite in a pine tree
evil the laser has been loaded into the rocket
youre ready for launch
im just waiting to taunt my nemesis
i have so few pleasures you know
austin and felicity are brought in at gunpoint by private army men
shagwell welcome to my hollowed out volcano
we meet again dr
yes the only reason im keeping you alive is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold
evil your plan will never austin trails off as he spots his mojo in the beaker behind dr
oh is that yours
you know what they say finders keepers loser weepers
evil do you like real estate
felicity kicks dr
evil in the balls
now youve got a couple of achers
my stomach hurts
wincing i dont care if he is evil you dont give a man a shot in the pills
its just not cricket baby
take them away
the guards lead austin and felicity away
she just hoofed you in the sack and youre going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard
theyll escape dipshit
you do this every time
youre going the right way for a smacked bottom young man
you dont own me
i do actually
pulling out paper its complicated
usually its illegal but this buddy of mine
but i digress
fat bastard im leaving you in charge
im going up the moon to hold the world ransom with my giant laser i shouldnt be long
what about powers
hes tucked away safely in his cell
hes harmless without that mojo
guard it with your life
to number two number two begin the countdown
the area around dr
evils command chair including the time portal behind it is enclosed by a circular door becoming part of the rocket
steam begins billowing etc
five four three
two one liftoff
the rocket lifts off from the volcano into the night sky
the rocket in flight
the rocket enters the screen
it has the silhouette of a flying penis
colonel you better have a look at this radar
what is it son
i dont know sir but it looks like a giant dick
take a look out of starboard
oh my god it looks like a huge pecker
he raises his binoculars
a rare red billed woodpecker
looks over with binoculars what sort of bird is that
oh goodness its not a bird its privates
we have reports of an unidentified flying object
it has a long smooth shaft complete with two balls
looking up what is that
it looks just like an enormous johnson
get on the horn to british intelligence and let them know about this
austin and felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls
the huge metal door has a window with bars in it
how are we going to get out of here
why dont you just shag fat bastard again
exploding austin that is it
i dont know what happened to you in the nineties but im still here in the sixties and i still swing
dont try to lay your hang ups on me just because you lost your mojo
that one hurts
ouch baby very ouch
im sorry austin that was a cheap shot
no baby youre right
i was wrong to judge you
i guess i am
but the austin powers i knew was wild and crazy and free
he could never be jealous
that austin is gone
i knew someone not long ago a very special woman
she taught me that life isnt about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along its about caring and responsibility
and while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of dr
evil i suppose i really did
was that your wife
felicity is touched
listen austin i cant pretend to understand everything youve gone through but i trust you
ill make you a deal if we get out of here alive ill give monogamy a try
we need to lure the guard inside and get his key
alright what if i pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning
the guard drawn by my cries of pain will come to investigate
meanwhile you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes
the guard falls in bobs your uncle and weve got the key
what do you think
that might work but how about this
felicity charges towards the window in the door ripping open her blouse as she goes showing her breasts to the guard
we however cant see them
giving a wolf whistle what do you think of these my man
the guard is mesmerized by felicity
he unlocks the door and enters
the guard enters an apparently empty cell
we see that austin is wedged spread eagle above the door ready to pounce
seductive to guard its very hot in here dont you think
the guard follows her into the cell
irritated its very hot in here dont you think
the guard advances on her
breaking cover austin
from above im very firmly wedged
if you want something done
she punches the guard right in the face and he collapses
austin falls flat on his face with a thump and pops back up
lets go get my mojo
it is a stark steel girder and glass structure
evil is trying to look dignified but he is floating away
he grabs at the railing of his chair as his feet float up
has anyone seen my gravity booties
honestly all i wanted was a frickin moon base
hello were on the moon no gravity
calling out mini me
are you alright
mini me is stuck to the top of the ceiling along with a lot of debris
my frickin mascot is stuck to the ceiling ok
papa not happy
a couple of henchmen place boots on dr
he drops to the floor
looking up somebody get the stick
hold on mini me
into microphone begin laser hes interrupted by terrible feedback
evil taps and blows on the mic
begin worse feedback
he holds it farther away
into mic begin laser ignition sequence
the lasers coils begin to glow red
lunar alignment in hours
a norad type screen showing the current position of the moon and where it needs to be before the laser can fire
austin and felicity run into the main room
it is strangely dark and quiet
wheres your mojo austin
im not sure
music its raining men by the weathergirls suddenly the lights dim
the three he bots descend from the ceiling on trapezes and acrobatic rings their muscles rippling
watch out baby he bots
the he bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison like a perfect olympic dismount
their crotch nozzles flip up one by one
i cant fight them without my mojo
who said anything about fighting
music seductive music felicity does a very seductive dance with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds
the he bots explode succumbing to her mojo
smashing felicity you were making me very horny man
extremely randy indeed
cmon give the lads a show
take of your top
put em on the glass
make em bounce
lets have a look at your tits
austin and felicity turn to see fat bastard lurking in the background
looking for this mr
fat bastard holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen private army men
give me back my mojo fat bastard
i give the orders bleep for brains
guards take them back to their cells
hold on let me ask you one question

austin is grossed out

austin and felicity run up to the beetle

austin drinks the mojo

sound as a pound my spuds are boiling
fancy a shag
austin we dont have time
cmon luv lets hop on the good foot and do the bad thing
evils taken his laser to the moon
the world is in danger
right the moon
i think i know someone who can give us a lift
the apollo ready for lift off
theres been some sort of delay in the launch of apollo walter but we understand that americas first manned mission to the moon will be blasting off shortly
pan across austin in a spacesuit then felicity in her spacesuit then cameo astronaut in his space suit
they are surrounded by hundreds of gauges buttons and meters
gor blimey youd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out
i am a rocket scientist
a technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins
we will have lift off in t minus seconds
felicity if you get frightened just hold my hand
the rocket lifts off
we have lift off
apollo has cleared the tower and is heading for a rendezvous with the moon
the g forces during lift off are incredible
austins face is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth
his hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted
austin is terrified
he clutches felicitys hand then grabs on to the astronaut beside him
felicity however loves it
yelling yaaaaa hoooo
the stages separate
basil sits at the console with nasa technicians
austin you have achieved lunar orbit
how was that lift off
to be honest it was terrifying
it felt like sitting on top of a bomb
as i punched through the atmosphere i said oh my god
and i soiled myself
happens all the time in that situation
no i mean i soiled myself just now when i said oh my god
basil it was amazing
prepare for moon landing
we only have one hour until dr
evil fires the laser
the lunar module settles on the moon
mission control the swinger has landed
austin and felicity step out in their spacesuits
this is one small step for man but a giant step for shagging
can you imagine it baby weightless
the permutations are mind boggling
austin plants a union jack on the moon
god save the queen
the mission commander shakes his head
this is an american show goddammit
lets roll that footage we shot last week in the studio
a family gathers around the tv watching neil armstrongs real moon landing
evil walks all the way around a tubular hallway up the walls across the ceiling upside down and back again settling into his chair
it is like that shot in space position the laser
the laser shifts into place
an alarm goes off and lights get me the president
president your time is up
this is your last chance to pay billion dollars or see washington dc destroyed
the alarm continues to blare
the president at his desk
i cant hear you
pay me billion dollars or see washington dc destroyed
the alarm blares
im sorry i just cant hear you
louder how about now
the capital will be destroyed the alarm blares
i just cant i think its that alarm
could someone shut off that frickin alarm
im trying to hold the free world hostage here
shouting the alarm shuts off but dr
evil is still shouting
shouting his yelling startles even himself
evil be reasonable
thats more money than is in the entire federal treasury
oh well i guess you have one minute to show me the money
i still dont know what that means
i cant show you the money because we dont have the money
then i suppose youre up shits crick without a paddle
a white room with a bank of old fashioned computers and a tracking screen
basil several generals and other vips look anxiously over the shoulder of the mission control gentlemen austin has landed on the moon
well soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed
austin and felicity enter through a hatch and step out of their spacesuits
lets find dr
suddenly austin notices something
we see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass
it is dr
evils distinctive profile with a machine gun
austin takes careful aim and fires
we see the shadow take the hit and fall
austin youve done it
you got dr
of course i did baby i got my mojo working overtime
austin im going ahead
cover my rear
felicity runs ahead
austin runs over to where the shadow came from
he sees that it was not dr
evil but mini me carrying a little gun
austin is ashamed
poor little bugger
hes so small hes like a dog or something
austin chokes back a tear
poor little bugger
realizing felicity be careful
evil is still alive
austin runs after her
austin rounds the corner and comes upon dr
holding his gun on dr
evil alright slap head turn around
arent you forgetting something
a wall panel in the main chamber revolves revealing felicity enclosed in a glass tube
evil what have you done to her
dont worry shes not dead
brightly colored gas starts to fill the glass chamber
muffled through glass dont worry about me austin
youve got to save the world
it looks like you have a choice powers save the world or save your girlfriend
austin is torn
he looks back and forth between felicity and the laser which is on the other side of the room
ive got my mojo back man i can do both
fire the laser
the woman manning the lasers joystick begins to move it
austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time
hands off my joystick baby
he wrestles with her a moment and then knocks it askew
the laser beam hits the big boy rocket in the crotch and big boys eyes cross in pain
damn you powers
evil hits a self destruct button
an alarm blares
self destruct sequence initiated
the base is rocked by explosions
evil i told you i could do both
perhaps you spoke too soon
austin looks over
felicity has slumped over in the tube
austin bangs on the glass with his fists
please god dont take her away
it is too late
evil runs through the time portal and gets away
felicity you have to understand i thought i had my mojo back
this isnt fair
austin looks up to the heavens
we see a quick of moments they shared austin making her laugh their first kiss of felicity being her beautiful and free spirited self
a tear runs down his cheek
austin presses his face against the glass as if trying to reach her
i love you felicity
i know i couldnt say it before but i really do love you
evil ill kill him
austin starts to chase him but three private army men block his path
austin is like an animal
he charges toward the first soldier rips his heart out and takes a bite out of it
then austin turns to the second soldier and rips his spine out like in mortal kombat
the soldier slumps to the ground
the last soldier is terrified
austin swings both fists simultaneously crushing the guys head which explodes like austin runs over to the time portal set for bc
he runs through
an orgy is taking place
evil is in a toga with a laurel with two young roman men feeding him grapes
you make love to your wife out of duty your mistress for pleasure and a roman boy for ecstasy
noticing austin shit
he runs away as austin appears through the time portal
austin follows dr
evil into another time portal marked
austin emerges from the time portal to see dr
evil getting into a car
austin waves his hands and a red ford torino with a white stripe pulls over
i have to commandeer this vehicle
noticing hey arent you hutch
we see paul michael glaser starsky
austin jumps in and the torino speeds off
evils car disappears into a car wash which is a time portal
the torino follows
a sign at the car wash reads passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with titanic stenciled above it
evil enters through a portal with austin hot on his heels
iceberg dead ahead
suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle
leonardo dicaprio kate winslet and james cameron slide by
im king of the world
evil and austin slide backwards into the time portal they just came from
evil runs into the street with austin chasing him
in slo mo austin dives for a ridiculously long time and tackles dr
evil pinning him
im going to kill you you bastard
breathing heavily before you do that know this austin i am
i cant back that up
i was just grasping at straws
i had nothing
but isnt it interesting mr
powers you really have become a product of the nineties
youre more interested in your job as glorified policeman than you are in love
you won the battle but i won the war
love means nothing youve proved it
i didnt think that felicity was going to die man
what a cowardly response
im disappointed really
you have the power to go back in time and save her but it means letting me go
austin looks over and sees a time portal
through it he can glimpse the lair and felicity
powers which is it going to be
me or the girl
austin runs through
we see the scene from a moment ago
felicity is in the glass tube and the brightly colored gas is starting to fill it
it looks like you have a choice save the world or save your girlfriend
i choose love baby
austin runs over to the glass tube and smashes his fist through it
the glass shatters and austin pulls felicity out
she gasps for air
felicity i love you
breathless but i thought that was another place and another time baby
austin kisses her for a long time
she starts to twitch
she hits him in the head and he finally stops kissing her
sorry baby i got a little over stimulated
fire the laser
what do we do
use your mojo
i dont have it
trust me you do
austin turns and gives a who me
look over his bottom
the woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional control just as it fires
the big boy rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes harmlessly by
he did it he saved the world
calming down of course i thought he might
austin you did it
beat i think i just got my mojo back
austin you had it all along
no one can take your mojo away from you
good bye mr
powers for the last time
evil hits the self destruct button and climbs aboard the rocket which blasts off
evils escape rocket in flight
evils rocket enters the screen
it has the silhouette of a flying penis
sir you better have a look at this radar
what is it
dont know sir
its hard to describe
its just a little prick
the kid cries
out the window good lord what is that
if i didnt know better id say its a wang
one of the students dressed in a green mao suit and clutching a red book is caught looking out the window
im sorry comrade teacher
pointing out window was distracted by that enormous flying rod
pointing to sky whats that
looking up it looks like a giant penis
pointing to her chart the male reproductive organ
also known as tallywhackers wankers schlongs or peters
any word from austin
weve picked up his signal but the lunar base seems to self destructing
on microphone austin if you can hear me use the time portal
theres no time to get to the lunar module
use the time portal
felicity looks at him
austin you have to get to the time portal
come with me felicity
its the only way out
austin will i fit in the nineties
if i did anyone can
lets go baby
the time portal is fifty feet away
austin and felicity run towards it
in the foreground are a stack of conveniently placed barrels
as they run behind the barrels an obvious austin stunt double and an obvious felicity stunt double emerge in their place
the stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross over to the time portal in a dramatic series of acrobatic flips and stunts
the stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed pile of barrels
austin and felicity emerge in their place and run through the time portal
the time portal reads
it is the most up to date modern apartment youve ever seen in your life
there is a large screen tv a dvd player etc
movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other accouterments of moving
felicity puts a cd on an old style turntable
dont worry baby it takes some getting used to
let me ask you felicity do you feel any side effects from the time travel
felicity smiles broadly revealing that she now has terrible teeth like austins
im as healthy as a horse
i love you felicity
and i love you
do you want to get married
