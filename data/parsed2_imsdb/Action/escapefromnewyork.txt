i have an escape in progress
an object in mid bay moving toward the wall

a helicopter flies over the bay towards manhattan island
the two escapees paddle trying to get across the bay

the pilot targets the boat on a computer screen in front of him
two shots are fired directly in front of the escapees as a warning
they ignore them and continue paddling away from the island
the pilot fires again
the boat explodes

rehme walks into a building labeled liberty island security control and picks up a phone
air traffic this is rehme
the helicopter lands
in the background a bus full of prisoners comes up
snake plissken gets off the bus looks around and is escorted by three guards into the base
he looks like the essence of cool
his hair is long wavy and ratty he lost his left eye somewhere along the line and hes got a two day beard thing going on
hes wearing a black spandex kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders and a pair of camouflage pants with lots of pockets
his jacket is a brown leather jacket that has seen far better days and hes wearing a pair of handcuffs that have instead of the links were used to a
straight metal bar between them
hes not resisting anything but the police are not taking any chances
plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main floor
you are now entering the debarkation area
the next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours
you now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises
if you elect this option notify the duty sergeant in your processing area
close up on sign no talking
follow the orange line
close up on snake
he is not impressed
steadicam view of the hall snakes p
guards guards more guards
as snake rounds the corner hold it
snake stops turns directs an impertinent glance at the speaker
hes still not impressed by any of this
rehme waits as a limo pulls up
out steps bob hauk
weve got a small jet in trouble over restricted air space
where is it
seven miles out and closing
the two of them walk away
hauk and rehme walk down the stairs
they turn toward us and walk into the air traffic room
dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission screens wearing headsets and working
following hauk and rehme into the room weve been on the board for the last twenty minutes
we havent been able to reach them
there was a transmission ten minutes ago
he identified as david
then all of a sudden he was cut off
hauk and rehme stand behind a controller
david we are sending air rescue
squawk contact on
to hauk and rehme theres still no reply
to his headset bayonne
i have a mayday in restricted space
new york i have it
hauk pulls rehme aside
who is it
i dont know
you have the code
theres no david on the computer
we telexed washington
still waiting for a reply
i think ive got him sir
hauk and rehme walk back over to the controller
he patches a voice over through
its too late assholes
all your imperialist weapons and lies cant save him now
were going down
were going to crash
the codes coming in sir
hauk and rehme dash over to the codeman
he shows them a display
decode air force one
air force one blinks as hauk and rehme look at each other in shock
the plane is flying over new york
the rebel has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own
tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went
she pulls out a slip of paper and proceeds to read
we the soldiers of the national liberation front of america in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country have struck a fatal blow to
the racist police stick
a secret service agent taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel continues
what better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison
the agent runs back down the plane to the president and his advisers
to nd agent unlock the pod
nd agent immediately runs off
shes bolted the door
cant you shoot off the lock
no sir shes pressurized the cabin
how about lifting the door off of the hinges
close up the presidents wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to it
get me to the pod
the president and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the plane
the pod opens
an expert attaches a locating device to the presidents wrist
sir this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from the pod
im activating it now
screens on the pod begin to light up as the president gets into the pod
he pushes a few buttons
god save me and watch over you all
a guard watches as air force one descends into new york
rehme and hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane
computer simulation tracking air force one
the plane goes down
as the plane smashes into a building a red dot drops through the building
its the pod
its the escape pod
degrees yards from impact
im going in
helicopters prepare for and execute launch and fly into new york
a guard watches them
rehme watches monitors as hauk talks
over the battery
were moving down
direct sight ahead
the helicopters land
a swarm of policemen run out and hauk hangs back
he follows with a second swarm
the first swarm assumes a defensive position near the pod
hauk examines the pod
its definitely empty and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames
an odd laugh from nowhere
weirdo walks out of the darkness
he nods his head to hauk
you touch me
if youre not in the air in thirty seconds
you come back in
weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the presidents middle finger complete with ring
im ready to talk
what do you want
weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the helicopters and hauls ass out of new york
rehme stands behind a desk talking on the phone
hauk is in the foreground looking pensive
yes hes right here mr
hauk picks up a phone
this is bob hauk
if we move in with choppers theyll kill him
were lucky if hes not dead already
they dont want anything yet
by the time they figure out what they want itll be too late
tell him we have to go with your plan now
hauk waves him off
we cant wait until tomorrow
if we have to move in and take the island its a last resort
i want permission to try a rescue
hauk calmly arms a
he looks up from his desk
hes dangerous sir
with quiet confidence i know
ill be ok
we see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure
its snake plissken all right live and in the flesh
the guards leave
snake walks into hauks office and sits down in the chair across from hauk
he raises his cuffed hands to hauk as if to say take these off me asshole but he doesnt actually say anything
hauk shakes his head
im not a fool plissken
coooooool call me snake
hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file
special forces unit black flight
two purple hearts leningrad and siberia
youngest man to be decorated by the president
you robbed the federal reserve depository
life sentence new york maximum security penitentiary
im ready to kick your ass out of the world war hero
snake could not care less
he reaches forward with his still cuffed right hand picks up a cigarette picks up a match with his left hand strikes the match and takes a drag from his
he lets out a calm breath and says who are you
special forces unit
we heard of you too plissken
why are we talking
i have a deal for you
youll receive full pardon for every criminal act committed in the united states
hauk shows snake the pardon
snakes eye lights up
this is something he wants
hes interested now and cant hide it
pressing his advantage there was an accident about an hour ago
a small jet went down inside new york city
the president was on board
re establishing control over the conversation president of what
thats not funny plissken
beat you go in find the president and bring him out in hours and youre a free man
we sense amusement from snake
this is not the first time the government has asked him for a favor
but hes not a soldier or a war hero anymore
he knows they need him more than he needs their pardon
hes holding the cards now and he knows it
twenty four hours huh
im making you an offer
straight just like i said
ill think about it
give me an answer
snake turns away
hauk is pushing way too hard and snake is determined to be in the drivers seat
get a new president
were still at war plissken
we need him alive
i dont give a fuck about your war
or your president
is that your answer
im thinking about it
snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette
next question why me
you flew the gullfire over leningrad
you know how to get in quiet
youre all ive got
i guess i go in one way or the other
doesnt mean shit to me
give me the paper
when you come out
i told you i wasnt a fool plissken
call me snake
rehme talks as we pan across a table full of weapons
we see two guns a belt grenades several pouches full of various stuff a flashlight a uzi throwing stars and more
snake surveys them with a cool expression
some of them have cars
they took old junkers that were left behind and converted them to steam
we think they may also have a gasoline source in there and power
greenhouses rigged up generators
some areas have streetlights
live in the subways
complete control of the underground
theyre night raiders
snakes not into this
hell figure it out when he gets there
he picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it
sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes
you push it we can track you on radar
just like leningrad
but they added something
a safety catch
snake pushes the safety catch
and yes theres the button
this is familiar
snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now
he walks down the hall to the medical room with hauk
rehme has disappeared
where am i landing
top of the world trade center
only place you can land
they wont see it and you can take off from a free fall
on the roof theres a service elevator
its still operational
we use it to infiltrate the prison
theres a power box
itll activate the elevator down to fifty
from there on down you walk
snake shrugs on his jacket
he knows hauk is just trying to assert his authority and its not working very well
you can locate the president by his vital signs bracelet on his wrist
it sends out a sig pulse
he hands snake a homing device
shows directions and distance
snake and hauk walk into the room
theyre met by a young medic
stops bacteria and viral proofs you for hours
snake braces himself against a table
the medic is holding an injection type tech gizmo
take off the jacket
ill be ok
lets go plissken
snake shrugs off his jacket disoriented by the place
his hackles are up
i dont like needles
hauk straps a timer gauge onto snakes left hand
he activates it and the time blinks on
its counting down as we speak
twenty two hours twenty nine minutes fifty seven seconds
we talked about twenty four
in twenty two hours the hartford summit meeting will be over
china and the soviet union will go back home
the president was on his way to the summit when his plane went down
he has a briefcase attached to his wrist
the tape recording inside has to reach hartford in hours
whats on it
you know anything about nuclear fusion
snake turns away
nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise
its about the survival of the human race plissken
something you dont give a shit about
hauk steps aside
the medic swabs snakes neck on both sides
im going to inject you
itll sting for a second or two
he raises a couple of hypos and injects snake with them
snake jumps a little clearly this is not one of the worlds most pleasant things
thats it plissken
snake gets off the table
the medic turns around
tell me what
hauk thinks hes got him this time
snake doesnt like that
that idea you had about turning the gullfire around degrees and flying off to canada
hauk shakes his head
snake puts his jacket down and turns to the medic
what did you do to me asshole
my idea plissken
something weve been fooling around with
two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries
theyre already starting to dissolve
in twenty two hours the cores will completely dissolve
inside the cores are that heat sensitive charge
not a large explosive
about the size of a pinhead
just big enough to he gestures open up both your arteries
id say youd be dead in ten or fifteen seconds hauk stops talking because snake has grabbed him by the throat
theyre protected by the cores
fifteen minutes before the last hour is up we can neutralize the charge with x rays
snake lets go of hauk to look at his watch
this is his life hes watching tick away
well burn out the charges if you have the president
what if im a little late
no more hartford summit
and no more snake plissken
when i get back im going to kill you
the gullfires waiting
snake pulls up in a jeep
he walks up to the tiny plane called the gullfire
two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane and does his job
he throws his cigarette out onto the runway and closes the overhead window
snake turns on his monitors
suppose hes dead hauk
if i come back without him youll burn these things out
hauk and rehme exchange a glance hauks been expecting this question to come up
get them both back plissken
snake doesnt like the response but figures he cant do anything about it
remember once inside youre on your own
oh you mean i cant count on you
a larger plane hauls the gullfire into the air the gullfire is essentially a big hang glider
hauk checks snakes life clock master life clock
snakes watch reads
he starts controlling the plane
he flips the tracer open and hits the button testing it
the master life clock shows the test confirmation
tracer test confirmed at hours minutes seconds
hauk rehme and the vice president nod with relief
snake takes the plane in
snake looks over his monitors
he sees new york coming up
hauk waits at his microphone
are you picking up the target blip
right on course
the plane aims for the world trade center
its been a while
the plane is aiming right at a building
hows your altitude
snake calmly angles the plane up
plissken what are you doing
playing with myself
im going in
snake targets the world trade center
he checks his instruments
the plane comes down
it hits hard
snake puts on the brakes adds a grappling hook and finally comes to a stop right at the edge
snake walks over to the elevator
he uses the power box to get the elevator started
he looks around and the doors open
he gets in the elevator
the doors close
snakes voice comes through the radio
im inside the world trade center on the th floor
just like leningrad hauk
is the glider intact
snake stands with his walkie talkie in the middle of the graffiti covered building
yeah but taking off is for shit
ill work it out
youll have to use the east stairwell
itll take you a little while to get to ground level
snake checks his life clock
call me when you get outside
snake puts his walkie talkie away as someone runs past
he doesnt notice
he walks on
snake walks along with his tracer
he goes through alleys and streets
he draws his gun as he walks by a group of people
hes armed and ready to fight
the plane is still burning
smoke is coming from everywhere
the plane is severed in the middle
the crash is very impressive
snake walks and notices a few people go by
he pulls out his walkie talkie
im at the plane
nobody else made it hauk
wait a minute
he looks at his tracer
a small red dot lights up in the southeast corner
ive got his pulse
right up ahead moving northwest
he puts away his walkie talkie and checks his life clock
snake holding the tracer
he gets closer and comes up to a building formerly a theater
he walks in
the pulse keeps getting stronger
snake walks in
he holds his gun at the ready
theres a truly horrible musical going on
this is hell
this is hate
snake looks around
no sign of the president but there is a cabbie enjoying the show
time to move on
he enters against his better judgment but hes just passing through so thats ok
snake keeps moving but theres a noise
he turns around aiming his gun
cabbie holds up his hands
youre snake plissken aint you
what do you want
snake lowers his gun
i thought you were dead
snake moves on
you dont want to walk around down there snake
the signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer
snake walks past a gang beating up and stripping a semi conscious girl
he doesnt take much notice
he keeps going
he sees a bum sitting by a fire
a guy tries to sneak up behind snake
snake knocks him out and points his gun at the bum
easy now chief
the bum walks away
snake keeps going
a man beats up another man at a sink
the beatee is wearing the presidents life tracer
snake kicks the beater and knocks him out
the man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles
hes a drunk
im the president
sure im the president
if i knew where i got this thing indicates the tracer id be the president
where did you get it
i woke up and there it was just like a miracle
snake slams the tracer against the sink
the presidents life signs all fail
oh my god
it may be just an impact on the mechanism itself
snake pulls up his walkie talkie
im right here plissken
i dont know who you assholes are looking at but its not the president
snake holds the walkie talkie up to the drunk
to the tune of joy to the world hail to the chief
la la la la la la
all right get your machine ready
im coming out
listen to me hauk
the president is dead you got that
somebodys had him for dinner
plissken if you get back in that glider ill shoot you down
you climb out ill burn you off the wall
you understand that plissken
snake stares at his walkie talkie
a little human compassion
snake walks on
hes in an area with streetlights
he keeps going
snake stares at the pod
he looks around
as he comes back up he sets up a chair and sits down heavily
he touches his neck
its like he can feel the cores dissolving
a crazy walks past bangs on manhole covers
snake doesnt know what hes doing but he doesnt like it
especially not when the manhole covers start to rise up
he runs off
snake finds the restaurant and runs inside
no one follows
snake backs into a corner
the floor is weak and starts to go out from under him once
he gets into the shadows
theres someone there
you a cop
snake levels his gun at her
youve got a gun
you got a smoke
snake tosses her his cigarettes
she lights one
keep your hand over it
its all right if were quiet

i can think of lots of reasons why
she makes a move to kiss him but theres a noise
they split up but she gets sucked through the floor
snake tries to save her but its too late
he gets the hell out of there
snake runs through the building breaks a window and climbs up a fire escape to get to a new floor
he breaks a window to get in then pulls a cabinet in front of the window
he shoots through the cabinet causing some crazy to scream
he busts down a door shoots open part of a wall busts through that climbs out a window and climbs down a telephone pole
he then climbs up a wall
on the way he drops his walkie talkie
he runs down an alley and as he does cabbie pulls up
where you goin buddy
snake points his gun at cabbie
he looks behind him then gets in the cab
snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from american bandstand
bad neighborhood snake

ive been driving a cab here for years and im telling you you dont walk around here at night

cabbie knocks on the door with his shoe

the whole camp rolling right across the bridge and the president right out front
oh that would have been so fine
ironically yeah it would have been

the three of them cross into the street

we get one glimpse of the dukes car
then we realize that cabbie is gone and his cab is racing away
cabbie you slime
the dukes car heads right for us
the two of them run off
after a while snake follows
the three of them hide
the dukes car is an old chrysler with chandeliers suspended over the headlights
its in a caravan of three leading the way
a fourth car comes up later
the duke is sitting in the passenger seat of a car with weirdo in the back
the duke gets out of the car weirdo at his side
the duke is wearing a cowboy hat sunglasses a snazzy jacket bluejeans and boots
he looks tough
he sends weirdo to knock on the door

the deal is off just calm down
a lone man sits looking bored
snake subtly goes up to him knocks him out and gets him out of the car
he briefly considers shooting the guy on the hood of the car
instead the guy on the hood of the car walks around
snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get brain and maggie
he knocks the other guy out of the car
panicked i think they saw us
turn left turn left here
brain this is broadway
i know i know the dukell take seventh avenue broadway is five minutes no

people start throwing bricks
snake hands his gun to brain who passes it to maggie holding it like a dead rat or like a macho guy would hold a purse
snake drives as fast as he can gunning off the bystander who gets on the car
a bystander grabs brain
maggie protects him
she shoots the people grabbing at him
snake angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away
he glares at brain
everyone seems visibly shaken
snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars
he takes off the car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on broadway
brain points to the cars as snake watches
hell be in the third car from the end by the last campfire
snake looks around
the dukes caravan passes
there are more cars than there were before
its all right
hes got to go in the front way
itll take him five minutes
if youre not back to the car in four minutes youre on your own
when we get there harold you just keep talking
they drive off
snake gets to the trains
no one notices
maggie and brain get out of the car and snake ducks into the train car
hows it going
cooled off a little huh
what do you want brain
duke told us to wait inside
hes on his way here now
he didnt say nothing to us about it
well you cant expect him to tell everybody in the joint now can you
thats why hes the duke
the camera angles back to show snake walking on top of the railroad cars
he hasnt found the president yet
but he doesnt have time to wonder if brain double crossed him
why dont we wait outside here for him
why dont we wait inside for him
cause i got orders thats why
what are your specific orders by the way
specific orders brain was for me not to let no one go inside
hows the president holding up by the way
any political discussion youve had with him
two guards sit with the president talking
the first guard is by the president
the second is looking out the window
that brain is a real pain in the ass
hes always sniffing around like a dog
he comes up with the gas
the second guard looks out the window
snake grabs him by the neck and breaks it
the first guard doesnt notice but the president does and that tips off the guard
what are you looking at
he turns and snake throws a star at him
it lodges right in his brain but not fast enough
snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow
snake limps over to the president and starts uncuffing him
the president still has the briefcase
this is it this is the big time
snake keeps calm
are you from the outside
who are you
hauk sent me
weve got to move fast
youre goddamned right ill move fast
snake limps away president in the lead
snake and the president keep moving
suddenly snake gets jumped
ten guys surround him and the president and though snake fights well its not well enough
brain comes out with maggie
they got him
now watch him
the duke steps out from the car followed by weirdo
friend of yours brain
he had a gun on me duke there was nothing i could do
not believing it for a second uh huh
weirdo points accusingly as he and duke walk away
duke walks up to snake
snake isnt giving in even though hes pretty sure hes beat

snake doesnt answer
duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right leg and pulls on it
snake writhes in agony
i said who are you
snake plissken duke
the man sent him in here
somethings going down we need him
duke recognizes the name
he is impressed
he lets go of the arrow
snake hates him more than ever
ive heard of you
he raises a crowbar over his head and smacks snake with it knocking him out
i heard you were dead
a helicopter flies over the city
the pilot looks at a grid view of new york
this is surveillance to security control
nothing on the infrared body scan
nothing in the searchlight
there arent any fires on the street
nobody moving down here
hauk rehme and the vice president wait
negative on infrared body scan
no movement in the searchlight
nothing strange going on down there
they look at the master life clock
plissken lies unconscious on a bed crossbow pointed at his head
three guards are at the ready
weve got to go in now
youre countermanding my orders hauk
this is my prison ill give the orders
i override all that
still negative on the scan
this is surveillance to security control
nothing on the infrared body scan
negative on the sweep
hauk stands on the wall listening
still negative on the scan
surveillance still negative
this is surveillance to security control
nothing on the infrared body scan
snake begins to come to
we hear gunshots and cheering
the guards go to announce snakes consciousness
brain and maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering the duke sits firing with plisskens gun at the president whose briefcase is still chained to his arm
snake sits up
there are lots of crossbows aimed at him
dont move snake
snake turns to face him
he stands up
we see for the first time exactly why hes called snake plissken
theres a snake tattooed on his stomach
the snakes tail disappears into his pants but we have a good idea of where it leads and what it becomes
snakes life clock is gone
he has no idea how much time hes got
i want that diagram brain
its at my place duke
duke that plissken said something about a time limit
what time limit
gesturing at president on him
thats a lot of crap
to the president what did i teach you
the duke of new
a number one
i cant hear you
to brain get me the diagram
dont kill plissken
we need him
the duke points the gun at brain but doesnt even give him a glance
get moving brain
brain moves and weirdo laughs that odd laugh
the duke fires at the presidents briefcase
papers and a tape fall out
weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away
he picks it up and holds it to his ear then puts it in his pocket
guards come and unstrap the president
the duke has decided to take snake a bit more seriously than he had
which is not saying much
helicopters fly above ground
a group stands with a car gesturing wildly
people out below in the park
can you see them
surveillance to security control
were getting that readout mostly in the infrared
hauk and rehme immediately check out the monitor
at least somethings going on
we have a visual sighting on it
its a crowd of prisoners in central park
theyre waving at us
signaling us in the food drop area
theyre waving us down
the prisoners wave the helicopters down
a group of guards lands and runs over to the station wagon
they get the briefcase which has been sawed off the presidents handcuffs
snake is awake and surrounded by guards
the cheers are louder
maggie walks across the room loading a gun
its one of snakes
i still cant figure out whether that son of a bitch plissken was telling the truth or not
god i hate that guy
brain stands in front of his maps
he got in somehow
yeah yeah but how
you gotta land the glider and take off
he gestures at the map you cant do it in central park theres too many trees
port authoritys too low to the ground
unless it was some
he gets it
they dont call him brain for nothing someplace high up
world trade center
there we go
the world trade center
and its gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take off than it was for him to land
hauk reads the note left in the briefcase
amnesty for all prisoners in new york city in exchange for president
th street bridge tomorrow noon
no bullshit or hes dead
wheres the tape
he reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles
yeah they were on the table
he never did use them though and only half of them is necessary in his case anyway
so much for your man hauk
this is the last thing he wants
warm up the choppers
were moving in
helicopters prepare for takeoff
hauk sits at the microphone
the master life clock reads
snake slowly gets to his feet
hes still groggy but its time for him to move
come on get up
snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium
boos greet snake as he walks in
in the center of the room is a fighting ring
snake climbs in not without effort
a huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring amid loud cheers
snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock
in the balcony above is the duke
the duke stands up and raises his arms and everyone gets silent
they sent in their best man
and when we roll down the th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom were gonna have their best man leading the way
from the neck up
the crowd cheers
on the hood of my car
lets do it
ugly and snake take bats
they circle each other
ugly strikes at snake
snake ricochets off the ring
he rolls around fighting for his life
brain and maggie walk around
they knock on a door and weirdo answers
hes wearing cabbies hat
whered you get the hat
got it from cabbie
what are you so nervous about
im here to see the president
no he doesnt
ill have to tell him you said that
weirdo doesnt really believe it
if its not true so what
but if it is true the duke will have him tortured to death
wait a minute
hes got something hidden in his clothing
the duke wants it
ill show you
youll tell me
the duke dont want a dead president
brain pushes his way in
weirdo lets the door slide closed
brain starts checking the presidents clothes
the president has been dressed in a wig and tied to a chair with an american flag on it
he might try to take it tomorrow
weirdo walks up to brain
youre not supposed to be in here brain brain stabs weirdo who dies with a gasp
maggie dispatches of the three guards
brain unties the presidents hand
the president snatches off the wig in a rage
snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer
a trash can lid and a bat with spikes on it is handed to him
the next round begins
brain the president and maggie sneak out
a guy in a cowboy hat notices
ugly and snake keep fighting
snake is not doing very well
but hes catching up
as ugly tries to hit him he nails ugly in the groin then in the back of the head
the crowd begins cheering snake
the duke cant believe it
snake runs to the guard with the tracer and activates it
the master life clock begins blinking tracer status activated
tracer activated at one hour thirty five minutes twenty seven seconds
rehme jumps out of his seat
snake limps around getting his stuff back together
he looks at his life clock
he doesnt have much time
the guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the duke and yells for attention
duke immediately gets up and leaves as do his hangers on
the crowd shuts up
the crowd rushes out
snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast as he can
rehme catches up to hauk at the last second
hauk has been stalling
shouting over noise hauk
hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot
get on the radio
keep them down
two monitors show snakes tracer
hes approaching the world trade center
i knew that son of a bitch was alive
snake limps around
he notices a cab
fifty flights of stairs with his leg shot to hell
he hesitates only for a second then starts up
the vice president hauk and rehme all stand staring at the monitors
the signal only lasts for minutes
download the choppers
were in a standby situation
rehme runs off
anybody could have pushed that button
only plissken knew there was a safety catch
now well give him a little more time just to make sure
the master clock shows
snake gets out of the elevator
maggie brain and the president all take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down the glider
it doesnt work
the glider floats away
theyre savages mr
snake runs to get them
they get in the elevator
snake has the president by the arm and is leading everyone out
listen snake i swear to god i thought you were dead yeah you and everybody else
he grabs brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head
thats your car in the lobby
diagram of the bridge
hey hey hey snake takes all the abovementioned items
im the only one who knows how to read that snake stay out of my way harold
besides you cant read and drive at the same time

snake is tired
hes got half an hour to live if that
he doesnt have time for brains shit and he lets him know it
you shouldnt have double crossed me again brain
come on lets go he suddenly notices theres nothing on the end of the presidents chain
he holds it in front of the presidents face
they sawed it off
i dont know where
snake shoots him a look
bullshit his eyes say but maybe brain is telling the truth
swear to god snake i know where it is
just take us to the car and ill take you right to it
he tosses the diagram of the bridge to brain
they go down the stairs
snakes in bad shape but its everyone else whos complaining
come on come on were wasting time
snake gets into the car
it wont start
snake hands the keys to brain
here take these
snake looks under the hood
theres a man with a crossbow pointed straight at him
theyve been caught
snake looks over the hood
theres the duke
with a dozen guards
brain steps out
this whole deal of yours is over snake
you and brain just say good bye to each other
the duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment
at that moment snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent
at the same time maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow
steam flies everywhere enough for cover
the four of them run for it
the duke runs after them
a cab pulls up
its radio is playing american bandstand
guess whos driving
you got it
the group of four runs up to the cab
snake runs around and makes cabbie scoot over
he wants to drive
cabbie looks shocked
the duke and his followers arrive too late
trying to explain the map and then theres three more
snake waves him off
cabbies trying to make conversation
theyre behind us they come in groups of threes
snake pops the american bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts it in his pocket
wheres the tape brain
where is it
the tape from the briefcase
oh that tape
he pulls it out of his pocket
here it is
cabbie hands it to snake
brain laughs trying to cover his ass
you traded away your hat for it
howd you know
snake pops it into the deck
it begins spewing out information
its the right one
he slips it into his pocket
here give me that tape
not just yet
snake checks his life clock
didnt that guy say minutes before the last hour was up
but hauk said theyd been playing with this so the minutes was built in already
thats cutting it pretty fucking close
snake races as fast as the cab can go
snake checks to make sure theyre not being followed too closely
the duke is behind but hes far behind
go for it snake
snake jumps the car over the first obstacle
cabbie looks like hes having a heart attack
snake swerves on brains direction
so far so good
a mine goes off but its behind them
the duke goes forward
hes going by the seat of his pants
but he knows the general direction of how snake went
a mine goes off behind him too
brain reads the map
cabbie continues to freak out
youve got to slow down a little snake
i think there are three mines ahead snake
the duke continues in pursuit
stay left stay left stay left and then jog right when i tell you
youre pushing her too hard snake
the cab explodes being cut right in half
everyone makes it except cabbie
cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years
he died with it
the president snake maggie and brain all keep going on foot
i said jog right
brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge
stay to the right stay to the right now jog left
hold it left
the other three go right
brain goes left and a mine explodes under him
maggie walks up to the body in shock
snake limps up to her
the dukes car is coming
snake checks his life clock maggie
maggie calmly holds out her hand
snake smiles and hands her his gun
his grin grows
its one of respect for what shes about to do
he runs off after the president
maggie walks around to brain then steps in front of him
she points the gun at the dukes car
the first three shots dont connect
the fourth nails the headlight and then the duke runs her over
he keeps going
rehme runs up to hauk and the vice president
they spotted two cars on the th street bridge
is it plissken
taxicab and a cadillac
taxi hit a mine
theres four people on foot
get a jeep with a winch over there fast
he pulls out a phone
get over to station
theyre coming across the bridge
the president and snake run on
a jeep pulls up
rehmes voice comes up over the loudspeaker
the guards on the jeep ready the winch
this is rehme security control
we are in a standby situation
we are in a standby situation
all helicopters down
wall guard do not fire on prisoners
repeat do not fire on prisoners
all vehicles stand by
repeat stand by
snake and the president are close enough to the wall to hear all this
the wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the president and snake
snake pushes the president up to the wall
the winch comes down and snake helps the president into it first
the president goes up and over
snakes life clock reads
but he doesnt have time to watch seconds tick away because the duke is right behind him firing at him
snake ducks for cover
the wall guards die
the winch comes down again and the duke sees it
he starts toward it
snake tackles him and beats him up dazing him but not knocking him out
he grabs the winch
a hand stops the winch from moving
snake comes to a stop
he panics and starts pulling on the winch line
the duke comes to and stands up
but he cant get anywhere because the president has found a machine gun and is now firing away
he is very accurate
he nails the duke right away but keeps firing
manic voice yeah hey number one
youre the duke
youre the duke
the president calms down somewhat
youre a number one
the president starts the winch again
snake climbs up and gets over as fast as he can without injuring himself
hauk and the medic pull up with the machine
hauk interrupts the medic
the tape plissken
snake reaches into his pocket grabs the tape and hands it to hauk
he is furious
as soon as hauk has the tape he lets the medic come back
he holds up two medal pads to snakes neck
they buzz they buzz louder and then he takes them away
snake continues to pant and fume
he stares at them then lifts his wrist to look at his life clock
snake lowers his wrist
a jeep pulls rehme up
he jogs to the president who is being shaved and prepared for broadcast
i radioed ahead mr
they know the situation
theyre waiting for your broadcast
the president nods
oh its all right
snake walks up and looks the president straight in the eye
i want to thank you
anything you want
you just name it
just a moment of your time
three minutes sir
we did get you out
a lot of people died in the process
i just wondered how you felt about it
i want to thank them
this nation appreciates their sacrifice
the president is full of shit after all
snake has reason for his cynicism
the president is uncomfortable with snakes glare and it shows
look uh im on the air in
questioning his aide two and a half minutes
snake lights a cigarette and walks away
snake walks away
hauk stands nearby
snake stops in his tracks
you going to kill me now snake
im too tired
ive got another deal for you
i want you to think it over while youre resting
i want to give you a job
wed make one hell of a team snake
glaring the names plissken
he limps away
the president looks suitably freshened up
hes even smiling a little
youre on camera mr
although i shall not be present at this historic summit meeting i present this in the hope that our great nations may learn to live in peace
he pops in the tape and presses the play button
and out comes american bandstand
the presidents face goes slack
his careers over
snake keeps limping
he pulls a tape out of his pocket yanks the magnetic tape out winds it around his hand rips it to shreds and throws the tape away
