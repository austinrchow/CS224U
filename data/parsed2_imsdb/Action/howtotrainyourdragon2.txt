written by dean deblois inspired by the novels by cressida cowell final draft may th hiccup and toothless blur past leaving a wake that leads
sequence new berk to the island village of berk festively adorned with flags and banners
major new additions alter its familiar skyline
the best kept secret this side of well anywhere
granted it may not look like much but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises
on a cluster of sheep hiding nervously between buildings as shadows of passing dragons race by
the group moves as one receding into a shadowy alley pushing one sheep out into the light
its suddenly snatched and carried into the air
life here is amazing just not for the faint of heart
see where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint we berkians prefer a little something we like to call whoosh whoosh whoosh
a wash of vibrant colors blurs by
dragons barrel past at a dizzying speed
their riders swipe kick and roll into one another while they weave neck in neck between the houses docks and revamped structures of berk
its like an aerial version of the monte carlo race
spectators roar from wooden bleachers fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea
fishlegs now and even larger rides his gronkle meatlug who carries the sheep in her claws until
snotlout also but every bit as juvenile and his monstrous nightmare hookfang steal the sheep from them
deblois final draft
oh im sorry fishlegs
did you want that
snotlout falls back toward ruffnut and tuffnut who lag on their two headed zippleback barf belch
here ya go babe
with a chivalrous grin snotlout tosses the sheep to ruffnut
she snatches it with a sneer and a grumble
did i tell you that you look amazing today
cause you do
come on barf
its starting to stink around here
barf starts to peel off spewing gas
tuffnut mocks snotlout with a mugging grin
still hates you
lets blow this place belch
belch ignites the gas sparking a flashy explosion and leaving snotlout behind in the smoke
as they rush past the main bleachers ruffnut drops her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing
each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon
the barf belch basket filled to the brim with sheep
presiding over the game stoick turns to the frenzied crowd
thats nine for the twins astrid lags with three fishlegs and snotlout trail with none
stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end its backboard painted with an image of toothless
and hiccup is
nowhere to be found
deblois final draft
scared him off with the big talk didnt ya stoick
snotlout still smoldering from the blast gets clipped from behind
astrid rolls in astride stormfly spirited and competitive as ever and beautiful despite herself
what are you doing snotlout
theyre going to win now
shes my princess
whatever she wants she gets
didnt she try to bury you alive
only for a few hours
back to the racers as they peel away pouring on the speed
dragons used to be a bit of a problem here
but that was five years ago
now theyve all moved in
and really why wouldnt they
the racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables
they exit through the far side and circle back through the village blasting past many of its dragon friendly additions
we have custom stables
all you can eat feeding stations
a full service dragon wash
in the village a baby gronkle sneezes accidentally setting one of the viking houses aflame
even top of the line fire prevention if i do say so myself
astrid rolls her eyes peels away from the other dragon racers and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts dousing the flames with a surge of water
deblois final draft
back to stoick amused as he watches the racers round the island searching for sheep
he turns to gobber and nods
its time gobber
aloud to the crowd last lap
a horn sounds
the racers all turn to each other excited
the black sheep
come on stormfly
we can still win this thing
come on barf
gobber loads the black sheep onto a catapult
this is your big moment
have a nice flight
he pulls the trigger launching the black sheep into the air
astrid spots it and steers stormfly into a steep climb toward it
up up up
in a flash fishlegs and meatlug blur past nabbing the sheep
good job meatlug
fishlegs tosses his captured prize to ruffnut
here you go darling
mines worth ten
deblois final draft
the black sheep
snotlout sighs frustrated
you guys are fighting for ruffnut
im totally winning
fishlegs hovers up nest to ruffnut with a starry eyed smile
were winning together
she rams barf into meatlug sending fishlegs into an uncontrolled spin
he slams into snotlout sending their dragons tumbling head over tail
the crowd goes wild
no one can stop me now
except for me
were attached genius
he grabs at the sheep
ruffnut fights back inciting a tug of war
quit trying to steal all my glory
and while theyre distracted astrid steers stormfly toward them closing in
get em astrid
its my glory
no sheep no youre always ruining glory
astrid leaps off of stormfly runs up belchs spindly neck and plucks the black sheep from the twins hands
she tumbles through the air onto stormfly sticking a perfect landing black sheep in hand
deblois final draft
back to stoick beside himself
the crowd roars
gloating to the crowd thats my future daughter in law
eyeing the fast approaching finish line unaware as
fishlegs suddenly rams meatlug into stormfly sending astrid off course
she recovers and sees snotlout flying headlong toward her war hammer cocked aiming at astrid
uh excuse me
snotlout hurls his hammer
astrid ducks and rolls stormfly out of the way
the hammer catches fishlegs in the face with a clang
the crowd collectively winces
astrid and stormfly recover from their roll loop over the water and they blast past the finish line dunking the black sheep into their basket
astrid takes the game
the crowd comes unhinged
astrid flies over the crowd basking in her victory
berk is pretty much perfect
all of my hard work has paid off
and its a good thing too because with vikings on the backs of dragons the world just got a whole lot bigger
scene awol part one a boundless sky
and from it a black speck rockets across the horizon
the image of unbridled freedom
deblois final draft
tucked into his riding position hiccup appears to be part of toothless
they dip roll and dive over a sea teeming with thunderdrums pulling off daring maneuvers with honed refinement making them seem effortless
they jackknife heading skyward rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud scapes and joining high flying timberjacks as they soar in formation
hiccup is bound head to toe in a snug aerodynamic flight suit an asymmetrical functional design of leather and articulated plates
it has an air of viking bike leather
what do you think bud
wanna give this another shot
toothless grumbles in protest
itll be fine
with a click of a lever he locks the pedals in the flared tail position
hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle
toothless snorts unenthusiastically
suddenly hiccup slides off of toothless peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane yelling as he plummets
toothless dives after him
they spiral through the air face to face
toothless is having fun despite himself
hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps
and yanks unfurling sheets of leather as he extends his arms
they catch the wind snapping open like wings
and sending him gliding out of control at first then stabilizing
the turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily
but hes flying
toothless unfolds his wings too catching up with hiccup
the freedom is palpable
hiccup and toothless are for the moment the same
feeling the same rush of adrenaline
they plunge past cloud formations splitting apart then crossing paths again
deblois final draft
impressive as it is hiccup is gliding at a steep angle
toothless launches fireballs ahead of hiccup boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts
this is amazing
a cloud layer washes past exposing a towering rock formation dead ahead
no longer amazing
hiccup tries to steer himself away to no avail
toothless pours on the speed trying to catch hiccup as he hurtles toward collision
his locked tail makes maneuvering difficult
hes unable to pull up at a steep enough angle
at the last second toothless blasts the jagged rocks just ahead of hiccup then wraps hiccup in his wings as they fly through it
the obliterated peak rains down around them
toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and hurtles into the trees of a neighboring peak
they tumble down the uneven terrain coming to rest on a small plateau
hiccup emerges from the cocoon of toothless wings
he switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings
that really came out of nowhere
the blown up sea stack collapses
we gotta work on your solo gliding there bud
that locked up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers eh
hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet revealing a year old hiccup framed by wild hair complete with a viking braid
he walks to the edge of the cliff taking in the new land stretching off into the horizon its tall cliffs and sea stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees
basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight
deblois final draft
looks like we found another one bud
toothless fusses and snorts not amused shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog
hiccup flinches as a pebble whacks him on the back of the head
he looks back to toothless who averts his eyes
do you want an apology
is that why youre pouting big baby boo
try this on
hiccup tackles toothless and tries to put him in a headlock
ya feeling it yet
picking up on all my heartfelt remorse
toothless simply stands on his hind legs lifting hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliffs edge
oh come on
you wouldnt hurt a hiccup looks down seeing the precipitous drop below
toothless flips him over pinning him to the ground
hiccup squirms throwing mock punches
toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to hiccups head
and its ugly
dragons and vikings enemies again locked in combat to the bitter urfff
toothless rests his head on hiccup squeezing the air out of him
toothless then suddenly starts grooming hiccup lapping at his face and covering him in slobber
hiccup fights to get free finally springing to his feet and shaking off the viscous saliva
deblois final draft
you know that doesnt wash out
toothless laughs pleased with himself
shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather bound book
he unfurls it to reveal an explorers map modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever expanding world
drawings indicate new lands new tribes and many new dragons
hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for toothless to lick
hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the maps outer edge then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm
so what should we name it
toothless gurgles as he gnaws under his wing preoccupied
itchy armpit it is
hiccup carefully draws the new islands outline
whaddya reckon bud
think we might find a few timberjacks in those woods
the odd whispering death or two in the rocks
maybe well finally track down another night fury
wouldnt that be something
so whaddya say
just keep going
toothless ear plates suddenly shoot up
he roars and his call is answered by a familiar screech
hiccup turns to see
scene awol part two astrid rising into view astride stormfly
stormfly grabs talon fulls of rock to slow her landing
deblois final draft
where have you been
astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as toothless rushes up to greet them
the real question is
where have you been
avoiding my dad
what happened now
astrid sits beside hiccup inspecting his latest addition to the map
behind them toothless greets stormfly inciting a play fight
oh youre gonna love this
i wake up
the suns shining
terrible terrors are singing on the rooftop
i saunter down to breakfast thinking all is right with the world and i get
he gets to his feet and puffs out his chest
son we need to talk
astrid smiles and adopts hiccups sloppy slouch
not now dad
ive got a whole day of goofing off to get started
hiccup breaks character grimacing at her impression of him
okay first of all i dont sound like that
what is this character
what is that thing youre doing with my shoulders
astrid laughs jostling her shoulders in an awkward way
deblois final draft
a truly flattering impersonation
anyway he goes
resuming stoicks brogue youre the pride of berk son and i couldnt be prouder
continuing her impression aw thanks dad
im pretty impressed with myself too
when have i ever done that with my hands
you just did
she laughs playfully
holding her arms mock hold still
its very serious
she giggles trying to hold a straight face
resuming stoicks brogue youre all grown up and since no chief could ask for a better successor ive decided astrid straightens her face brightening
to make you chief
oh my gods
she jumps to her feet beaming
hiccup thats amazing
and socks hiccup in congratulations deliberately hitting the dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up
she laughs as hiccup reels it back in self consciously
youre gonna wear out the spring coil
the calibration is very sensitive
deblois final draft
theyre suddenly bowled over by toothless and stormfly
this is what im dealing with
astrid helps him up and dusts him off
what did you tell him
by the time he turned around i was gone
astrid picks up the map folding it as she paces around him processing it all
well its a lot of responsibility
the map will have to wait for sure and ill need to fly toothless since youll be too busy
she pauses wincing in sympathy
she turns to hiccup
he nods knowingly taking the map from her
its not me astrid
all those speeches and planning and running the village
thats his thing
i think youre missing the point
i mean chief
what an honor
id be pretty excited
hiccup shakes his head
im not like you
you know exactly who you are
you always have
he shuffles to the cliffs edge gazing out at the new land
im still looking
i know that im not my father
and i never met my mother
so what does that make me
deblois final draft
he sits at the edge looking burdened restless
astrid approaches and settles beside him joining him in looking out at the distant horizon
she weaves another braid into his hair as she speaks
what youre searching for
isnt out there hiccup
she places a hand on his chest
its in here
maybe you just dont see it yet
she kisses his cheek but gets a mouthful of toothless slobber
she grimaces wiping it off
distracted hiccup eyes the horizon keenly
there is something out there
he turns her face to the horizon
a distant smoke plume rises from a misty valley
scene shot down
hiccup and toothless fly over the fjord winding deep through undulating crimson and gold forests
astrid and stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly give way to charred timbers
they fly deeper through ash and wafting smoke
ahead in a sheltered harbor an explosion of ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a trappers stay close
they fly through the suspended remains of the buildings splintered and frozen in mid destruction
what happened here
deblois final draft
its at once harrowing and puzzling
toothless spots an enormous dragon footprint in the muddy shoreline below leaving him uneasy
as they crest the ice formations astrid spots a crew of men at the stern of a moored ship below
the men fire a stern mounted cannon
the projectile unfurls into a net
hiccup and toothless dart out of its way
it hits stormfly tangling her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled
astrid struggles to free her as they hurtle toward a collision
astrid falls off of stormfly but toothless snatches her at the last second
stormfly hits the ground tangled in the net
trappers rush out of hiding piling onto her with ropes and weapons
she whips her tail sending spikes flying
watch the tail
a large raven haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon stormflys head twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy
tie those legs up
eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut wrangling her into submission clearly a pro among pros
he looks up revealing a handsome face and gleaming intelligent eyes that search the sky as toothless tell tale banshee scream rings out
is that what i think it is
deblois final draft
toothless suddenly streaks across the sky banking and landing with a ferocious roar
to the trappers what are you doing
astrid and hiccup leap off of toothless rushing toward stormfly
erets men immediately draw weapons
hiccup extends and ignites his dragon blade a telescoping fiery sword impressive enough to wow erets men
eret steps forward focused only on toothless
soil my britches
that is a night fury
thought they were all gone for good
to his fellow trappers looks like our lucks had a turn for the better lads
dont think drago has one of those in his dragon army
his men sound out in agreement
hiccup eyes astrid confused
look we dont want any trouble
you shouldve thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits
what are you talking about
astrid and hiccup take in the icy destruction putting it together
deblois final draft
you think we did this
dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is without do gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them
what do gooder there are other dragon riders
you mean other than your thieving friend from last night
you tell me
toothless snarls protectively
you may have an ice spitting dragon on your side but we still have a quota to fill
how do you suppose we explain this mess to drago bludvist
drago what fist
does anything you say make sense
hes expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow
and drago dont take well to excuses
eret parts his tunic revealing a large branding iron scar on his torso in the shape of a dragon skull split by a sword
this is what he gave me last time i showed up empty handed
he promised to be far less understanding in the future
look we dont know anything about a dragon thief or an ice spitting dragon or your lunatic boss and his dragon army okay
deblois final draft
just give us back our dragon and well go strange hostile person whom weve never met
eret bows playfully
oh where are my manners
son of eret
finest dragon trapper alive
he pulls a dagger from behind his back waving it cockily
his men ready their weapons and net cannons
after all its not just anyone who can capture a night fury
toothless roars a warning
and this is toothless
he says were going
they all say that
eret lunges toward them
toothless blasts bringing down a massive spire of ice
it shatters as it hits the ground forcing eret and his men to dive out of the way
making quick use of the distraction hiccup re ignites his dragon blade and slashes through the ropes binding stormfly
eret gets to his feet in time to see toothless and stormfly take to the air carrying hiccup and astrid out of reach of the volley of arrows
sequence lock down
deblois final draft
the gang joyrides past gothis house scattering her assortment of terrible terrors
she waves a fist at them as they sweep past whooping and chortling leading us down to
the upper plaza where a gathered crowd of vikings and their dragons are cued up outside of gobbers blacksmith stall awaiting their turns
stoick maneuvers through the crowd spouting jovial greetings in passing
he makes a bee line for gobber who is busily grinding a metal dragon tooth into shape
a zippleback waits patiently his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head watches sympathetically
any sign of him
gobber flips up his welding guard revealing a matching area of unsoiled skin
ah hes probably flown off the edge of the world by now
you sure you want that kid running the village
you can still delay your retirement
oh hes ready
a sudden excitement in the crowd heralds hiccup and astrids return
they touch down on toothless and stormfly
there he is
to gobber proving his huh
the pride of berk
hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward stoick with urgency
who finally decided to show up for work
got held up
privately to stoick hey dad could i have a word
something youre itching to tell me
deblois final draft
not quite the itch youre thinking of but yes
stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk
now lesson one
a chiefs first duty is to his people
stoick changes the rune on the being served placard
forty could we just talk in private for thats me
pushing his way through i was ahead of you
excuse me ive been here all day
starkard reaches the counter giddy with excitement
okay i want one of those high seaters with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment
you got it sir
stoick spins hiccup around steering him back into the shop
dad this is actually a little more important than building saddles
no task is too small when it comes to serving your people
excuse us grump
they step over the tail of a large snoring oaf of a dragon stirring him awake with a fussy start
you let the forge die down again
deblois final draft
grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge
it splatters everywhere igniting a rash of fires
hiccup side steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall
gobber pulls the fire extinguisher dumping water everywhere
thats it grump
youre going up for adoption
stoick fills a toolbox with tools from hiccups workbench
one of these
there you go
but seriously i really need to tell you about this new land we came across
fishlegs walks in followed by the twins and snotlout
any new dragons
stoick slaps a sheet of leather onto a dragon mold and hands hiccup pencil
exasperated hiccup begins tracing an outline as he speaks
we didnt stick around to find out
these folks werent particularly friendly
your night fury and deadly nadder didnt bring them cheering to the rooftops
gobber spins his prosthetic arm dispenser
no this was different
not the standard run for the hills hoo ha ive come to enjoy
these guys were trappers
deblois final draft
you shouldve seen their fort
all blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice
it was weird
ive never seen anything like it
and worst of all they thought we did it
gobber pops off his prosthetic tongs and selects a wire brush from his dispenser
yknow you two are gonna get yourselves in serious trouble one of these days
not everyone appreciates this way of life
which he uses to brush his mustache and eyebrows
stoick takes the sheet of leather to the table saw
gobbers right son
best we keep to our own
besides youll have more important uses for your time and pulls a lever starting it up
sing songy under his once we make the big announcement
hiccup pulls the lever shutting the saw down
they are building a dragon army
silence fills the stall
vikings exchange worried glances
or at least the guy they work for is
dargo bloody fist or something
stoicks eyes widen
he turns to gobber with growing alarm
ill bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon
deblois final draft
youre such a moron
a beautiful moron
ruffnut grumbles revolted by their advances
stoick grabs hiccup by the shoulders wide eyed and intense
you know him
stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast bustling cave that houses the dragon stables
hiccup astrid gobber and toothless chase after stoick
whoa whoa whoa
what is happening
you heard the man
lock it down
behind him the massive storm doors rattle as theyre lowered
no dragon or viking sets foot off this island until i give the word
deblois final draft
because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land
stoick turns to hiccup gravely serious
because drago bludvist is a madman
without conscience or mercy
and if hes built a dragon army
gods help us all
stoick continues on shouting orders leaving hiccup stewing
get them into their pens
hiccup chases around to confront stoick
then lets ride back out there
well follow those trappers to drago and talk some sense into him
we fortify the island
its our duty to keep the peace
peace is over hiccup
i must prepare you for war
dad if dragos coming for our dragons we cant wait around for him to get here
lets go find him and change his mind
some minds wont be changed hiccup
berk is what you need to worry about
a chief protects his own
stoick heads off calling out more orders
deblois final draft
leaving hiccup eyeing toothless as the storm doors close
astrid approaches him seeing the determination on his face
i have to
he gives her a quick peck on the cheek
hiccup and toothless blast past heading for the exit
they try to fly through one door but it seals shut
toothless spins around and dives through the gap in the second lowering storm door
astrid and stormfly blow past stoick and slip through the storm door before it shuts leaving stoick fuming
scene erets lesson erets ship carves a defiant path north leaving the last glimpses of lapland in its wake
eret stands on the bowsprit eyeing the waves intently searching the surface
he turns toward the deck where his crewmen man the gunwale cannons sights trained to the sky
keep your eyes peeled lads
with this wind well reach drago by daybreak so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick
its no time to be picky
not if we want to keep our httyd d
deblois final draft
eret turns in the direction ug is pointing to see a pair of dragons flapping toward them
the crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back lit silhouetted dragons drawing ever closer
net em lads
take em down
eret loads a cannon and takes aim
he spots hiccup and astrid riding the dragons
his eyes narrow determined
youre not getting away this time
nets fly through the air
hiccup and astrid outmaneuver them and dive toward the ship landing on the deck with a clatter
and here i was worried we might turn up empty handed
astrid brandishes her axe in invitation
hiccup indicates for her to lower it then holds up his hands in surrender
its your lucky day
we give up
erets crew exchange confused stares
as does astrid
thats one night fury one deadly nadder and
he dismounts toothless and tosses a net over astrid
two of the finest dragon riders west of luk tuk
that oughtta make the boss happy right
he takes her axe hands it to eret and escorts astrid past the men to the open live well
deblois final draft
he leads astrid down the ladder
she glares at him plainly hating the plan
what are you doing
toothless tries to follow them but hiccup holds him back
hiccup flips the latch lowering the grate as eret watches confounded
the dragons dont really care for cramped spaces so theyll just hang out with you
they wont be any trouble
erets men nervously direct their swords and spears toward toothless
unless you do that
wooden boat big ocean
hows your swimming
a burst of flame erupts from the live well causing the crewmen to jump back
hiccup thrusts his dragon blade through the grate
cant have armed prisoners
how is this a plan
he retracts the blade and offers it up
a crewman cautiously takes it looking it over
the pommel of the hilt is expelling green gas
just what every dragon trapper needs
one end coats the blade in monstrous nightmare saliva
the other sprays hideous zippleback gas
all it takes is a spark and
a curious crewman clicks the lighter igniting the gas
hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck
deblois final draft
oh yeah there you go
toothless paws at the embers
once they see you as one of their own even the testiest dragons can be trained right bud
toothless gurgles and falls over
give me that
eret snatches the dragon blade and hurls it overboard
stormfly bolts after it
what game are you playing
we just want to meet drago
and returns in a flash dropping it at erets feet like a fetching dog tongue wagging
eret throws it again frustrated
stormfly returns with it just as quickly
because im going to change his mind about dragons
eret and his crew laugh
astrid pokes out of the well
he can be really persuasive
hiccup pets toothless thoughtfully
once youve earned his loyalty there is nothing a dragon wont do for you
you wont be changing any minds around here
deblois final draft
i can change yours
hiccup sets toothless tail in the locked splayed position
eret sneers suspicious
suddenly hiccup is snatched into the air
dragons blur past
scene botched rescue the crewmen scramble to the net cannons as a flurry of wings streak past gashing holes in the sails and slicing through rigging
toothless shrieks and bounds up the mast spotting hiccup in the talons of a monstrous nightmare
toothless relaxes realizing that its hookfang
put me down
what are you doing
snotlout looks back to see if ruffnut witnessed the save
see how well i protect and provide
ruffnut grumbles at the incessant courting
a flying net whizzes past her head
what is with all the nets
hey watch it
that was close
ruffnut spots eret firing nets from the deck of the ship
a slow motion sexy pov of erets glistening biceps shuddering as he blasts the net cannon aimed directly at her
deblois final draft
the net unravels in slow motion
enveloping ruffnut as she yields to it blissfully
as hiccup flips upside down in the hookfangs talons and kicks off pulling his wing suit flaps
eret takes aim but astrid shoves him throwing off the shot
hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with its sail
he slides down the canvas and drops to the deck
toothless lands behind him
gobber and grump land on the deck scattering erets crew
were here to rescue you
i dont need to be rescued
the bow dips heavily as stoick touches down on skullcrusher
he dismounts fuming
eret blocks stoick cocky and confident
well didnt you just pick the wrong ship eh
i am eret son of stoick shoves his face aside sending eret slamming into grump
before he can react gobber clubs eret on the head sending him collapsing to the deck
grump then sits on him smothering him into submission
deblois final draft
panting suffocated get
gobber turns to the other crewmen with a smile
erets men eye the vikings armed and flanked by their dragons
they set down their swords
thats what i figured
were going home
of all the irresponsible im trying to protect our dragons and stop a war
how is that irresponsible
hiccup glares frustrated
stoick sighs realizing that he has to explain
years ago there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced
a hulking cloaked figure strides confidently into fire lit hall interrupting a council meeting of viking chieftains
his face is masked in silhouette
deblois final draft
into our midst came a stranger from a strange land covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin
he carried no weapon and spoke softly saying that he drago bludvist was a man of the people devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons
on stoick some twenty years younger seated in a throne studying the impudent stranger with suspicion
he claimed that he alone could control the dragons and that he alone could keep us safe if we chose to bow down and follow him
the viking council erupts in mocking laughter
snotlout fishlegs and the twins snicker
we laughed too
until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out then see how well you do without me
drago bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and marches toward the door
above dragon fire rips through the ceiling bringing down flaming timbers followed by dragons covered in heavy metallic armor
they blast fire as panic ensues
the rooftop suddenly burst into flames and from it armored dragons descended burning the hall to the ground
deblois final draft
was to only one to escape
the twins snotlout and fishlegs exchange spooked glances
men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with
hiccup turns and stomps toward toothless determined
eret watches intently
im still going to try
hiccup jumps onto toothless and locks eyes with stoick
this is what im good at
and if i could change your mind
i can change his too
toothless and hiccup take to the air leaving everyone stirring in awkward silence
astrid mounts stormfly about to go after him
lead the others back to berk
ive had enough mutiny for one day
astrid stirs conflicted as stoick stomps toward skullcrusher fuming
he passes ruffnut whos busily fondling erets biceps as he lays crushed under grump
ooh i like that
deblois final draft
hiccup stares ahead frustrated as toothless glides over a bed of clouds glowing in the low arctic sun
hiccup yells then slumps back onto the saddle
toothless recoils sensitive to hiccups upset
the steam from their breath mixes in the frigid air
dont worry bud
im not gonna let anything happen to you
toothless ear plates perk up
he glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds
a strange and arresting masked warrior rises from the clouds standing upon something unseen
its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence
the warrior eyes toothless and hiccup pulling up alongside them
hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up flustered
he whirls around expectantly then freezes mouth agape
the warrior stares blankly tilting his head in curiosity while cutting a menacing silhouette
then just as gradually as he rose the warrior dips back beneath the clouds disappearing
no sudden moves

hold on hold on
toothless growls a warning
suddenly theyre ambushed from behind
hiccup is plucked off of toothless by another dragon and carried off
with the tail unmanned toothless plummets helplessly
he flaps wildly then crashes through the ice into the black frigid water
flailing and crying out he struggles to stay afloat as he watches
hiccup disappear into the night sky carried off in the talons of the strange dragon one of tens that accompany the warrior in a cavalcade
toothless bellows in distress desperately trying to take to the air
as he leaps and crashes time and again
a group of spiny dorsal fins split the ice carving a path toward toothless
beneath the ice a pod of seashockers approach two headed with manta ray like wings gliding silently in the gloom
fixated on hiccup toothless is caught by surprise as the seashockers surface and drag him under
hiccups helmet bobs to the surface marking all that remains
scene dragon lady hiccup shivers in the claws of the dragon surrounded by the strange flock full of breeds hes never seen
he looks back for toothless now long gone

out of the fog looms an epic ice formation jagged spiked and similar to the icy aftermath of erets fort but many times its size
the dragon escort dives into its jagged folds
the wild ride suddenly gives way to a multilevel cavernous chamber made of ice and columns of basalt rock
its heavily populated with dragons of all kinds looming in the shadows
hiccup is dropped in the center
he scrambles to his feet calling out into the darkness
we have to head back for my dragon
a hissing dragon closes in sniffing leering aggressive
hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade waving a swirl of fire around himself
the dragon pauses intrigued and then watches hypnotically as hiccup pacifies him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade
the warrior watches keenly from the shadows
several aggressive dragons close in behind hiccup
hearing their hisses he quickly stows the blade replaces a cartridge in its hilt then flips it around and sprays a perimeter of zippleback gas around himself
he clicks the lighter igniting a flash ring
the testy dragons recoil
he then reaches through the smoke offering his open hand
the dragons re approach sniffing him with calmed curiosity
tilting his masked head curious
he dismounts his dragon and approaches hiccup
who are you
the dragon thief
the warrior circles hiccup in silence taking in his gear his dragon blade his face
do you even understand what im saying
deblois final draft
the warrior whirls and hammers his staff
in response a large dragon ascends from the depths carrying
toothless is dumped on the ground next to hiccup sopping wet
hiccup rushes to him petting him reassuringly
toothless coos in relief
im glad to see you too bud
you really had me worried there
the warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon
in response it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight from their throats spotlighting hiccup and toothless
the warrior sets down his staff and shield then approaches hiccup cautiously and animal like
toothless snarls and circles hiccup defensively but then instantly yields to the strangers outstretched hand
with a quick disarming gesture the warrior lays toothless down in a state of bliss
hiccup is astounded
the warriors hand continues toward hiccups face
he recoils but the warrior persists finding the faint scar on hiccups chin glinting in the firelight
the warrior gasps and retreats a few steps
whispered shaken hiccup
could it be
after all these years
how is this possible
the voice is surprisingly female
uh should i
should i know you
you were only a babe

but a mother never forgets

just like his mother
she could never stay put either
gobber glances over at stoick whos hunched over brow furrowed and solemn
ah hes just twenty
and a viking
i mean could there be a worse combination
when i think of how stubborn and senseless you were back in the day
well not much has changed actually
you know what hes like
he wont give up gobber
and if hiccup finds drago before we find him
nothing can hurt hiccup so long as that night furys around
its a night fury
framed by a hole in the ice a glistening object bobs on the surface below
stoick squints and circles back leading skullcrusher in a dive toward it
stoick snags it out of the water
its hiccups helmet
gobber pulls alongside stoick seeing his look of dread
stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to smell
find him skullcrusher
skullcrusher sniffs the helmet like a bloodhound roars and suddenly changes heading

wait just a minute
come back here
you cant just say something like that and run off
youre my mother
i mean what the do you grasp how insane it sounds
i have questions
hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain
he tries to clamber over a tall rock unsuccessfully
where have you been all this time
toothless boosts him over
hiccup lands on the other side
whatve you been doing
they said you were dead
everyone thinks you were eaten by
hiccup trails off as he enters
a stadium sized chamber teeming with ferns waterfalls hot springs and thousands of new dragons
hiccup wanders in basking in the in the amazing sight a dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate filled with dragons of every shape and kind
he spots valka clinging to a basalt overhang watching him
deblois final draft
this is where youve been for twenty years
she nods from her perch
youve been rescuing them
she nods again this time with a smile
youre not upset
i dont know
its a bit much to get my head around to be frank
its not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy feral vigilante dragon lady
valka chuckles and using her dragons wing lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat
at least im not boring
i suppose there is that
feeble trailing off one
excited dragons rush up to greet hiccup and toothless
hiccup pets a few marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him
do you like it
i dont have the words

and look hes your age
no wonder you get along so well
hiccup smiles astounded by toothless affection for valka
she checks his teeth
they recede into the gums at her touch
and retractable teeth
how did you manage to i found him in the woods
he was shot down and wounded
she winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to caress a few of her own rescued dragons
this snafflefang lost his leg to one of drago bludvists iron traps
this raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting
and this poor hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare
then left to die alone and scared
re toothless tail and what of this
did drago or his trappers do this too
well crazy thing is
im actually the one who shot him down
she glares confused
its okay though
he got me back
playfully to toothless right bud
you couldnt save all of me could you
you just had to make it even
hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk
valka observes their playful rapport with curiosity
deblois final draft
what did your father think of your night fury friend
he didnt take it all that well
she mutters in agreement
they all did
pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own
she smiles at toothless dismissive
if only it were possible
no really i believe me i tried as well
but people are not capable of change hiccup
some of us
were just born different
dragons sweep from the sky blowing fire carrying off sheep and dried fish
vikings chase them down hurling weapons
berk was a land of kill or be killed but i believed peace was possible
a viking is about to finish off a felled dragon but valka chases up to him and tugs at his arm
youll only make it worse

as he rushes off valka hears a clatter and whirls around to see a dragon cloudjumper clawing its way through the roof of a house
cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof sniffing out a babys cradle in the corner
valka rushes in panicked
one night a dragon broke into our house finding you in the cradle
valka draws a sword quietly slipping up to the dragon only to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as baby hiccup innocently plays with one of its talons
i rushed to protect you but what i saw
was proof of everything i believed
valkas careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak
spooked cloudjumper whips around to face her accidentally scratching baby hiccups chin
their eyes meet
valka lowers her sword transfixed
this wasnt a vicious beast but an intelligent gentle creature whose soul reflected my own
stoicks axe spins through the air between them barely missing cloudjumper and planting into a pillar
alarmed cloudjumper whirls around at stoick and blasts
stoick dives out of the way as the fire splatters against the wall burning a hole and setting the room ablaze
the dragon moves toward stoick but valka grabs hold
deblois final draft
it turns to face her again locking eyes agitated
stoick dashes through the fire toward hiccup and pulls him out of the cradle
he pulls his axe from the pillar
but in a whoosh of smoke and embers the dragon and valka are gone
stoick and baby hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits valka away into the night sky
on baby hiccups face with the fresh nick on his chin
hiccups face with the matching scar
you and your father nearly died that night all because i couldnt kill a dragon
yeah it runs in the family
it broke my heart to stay away but i believed youd be safer if i did
deblois final draft
hiccup considers this then raises his eyes to hers seeing the sting of remorse
how did you survive
oh cloudjumper never meant to harm me
he mustve thought i belonged here
she leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls
half submerged in the warm lake below a massive white dragon with pronounced mammoth like tusks rests benevolently on the banks his stately countenance like that of a lion surrounded
by his pride
in the home of the great bewilderbeast
the alpha species
one of very few that still exist
every nest has its queen but this is king of all dragons
dragons land and bow reverentially to the bewilderbeast
valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a sweating greenhouse
with his icy breath this graceful giant built our nest
a safe haven for dragons everywhere
on hiccup putting it together
wait thats the ice spitter
hes responsible for all that destruction
he protects us
we all live under his care
and his command
they pass an eggshell littered nursery
hatchlings dart out of it greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos
toothless is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching
cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering
all but the babies of course
deblois final draft
the hatchlings clamber on top of the bewilderbeast and play on his massive tusks despite his authority
who listen to no one
the bewilderbeast lets out a frosty snort sending off the youngsters to spread more mischief
now awakened the bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to take a closer look at hiccup coming eye to massive eye
valka bows in his presence
as does toothless
ive lived among them for twenty years hiccup learning their ways discovering their secrets
he acknowledges hiccup with another icy snort slicking back hiccups hair in a frosty veneer
he likes you
she chuckles delighting in his awe
you must be hungry
i could eat
its feeding time
toothless tucks himself beneath cloudjumpers wing trying to befriend him but cloudjumper isnt having any of it
he grimaces and follows valka out

but stoick said
it doesnt matter what he said if theyve all been captured
she flies off determined
erets ship is beset by ice floes
the crew stirs on deck as he paces grumbling while nursing his head with a large chunk of ice

that can be arranged
stormfly drop it
in enthusiastic response stormfly pops open her talons sending eret plummeting
he wails and flails as he hurtles toward the ice far below

on eret terrified as the ground rushes up at him

works every time

scene mommas boy hiccup and toothless follow valka and cloudjumper over a majestic fjord in the long rays of the low arctic sun
hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of dragons nearly all of valkas rescues are close on their tail
he turns back to his mother confused
hey i thought we were going to eat
with a mischievous grin oh we are
she directs his gaze below where in the choppy water of the fjord a group of seashocker dragons are corralling a dense shoal of fish near the surface
suddenly the bewilderbeast rises from deep below scooping the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface
it breaches just below hiccup and toothless giving them a fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing back down into the sea
valka laughs at hiccups surprise as the hungry dragons race for the flailing fish scooping them out of the air
hiccup gestures to toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a mouth full
hiccup has his map spread out in the snow explaining the various lands hes discovered during his explorations
and from dragon island i found this archipelago

with just how far and wide she has explored
deblois final draft
she returned to hiccups side with a smile
but his amazement is interrupted by toothless joining in drawing all over valkas map with a giant icicle
hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles and cloudjumper sneers
valka and hiccup rise on their dragons carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff
one by one dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong updraft popping their wings open like kites
they ride the wind and orbit around each other in a colorful mesmeric dance
its clearly a form of dragon play
hiccup lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind laughs giddily as he watches valka walk across cloudjumpers wing and onto several others dragon hopping from one
to another until she gracefully crosses toothless from wing tip to wing tip
she then drops out of sight reappearing a moment later standing atop cloudjumper
hiccup is in utter awe of her
valka breathes in the frigid air
lets it out blissfully
when im up here i dont even feel the cold
i just feel
she smiles at hiccup
he gleams back
this is what it is to be a dragon hiccup
hiccup locks the pedals in the flared tail position and unbuckles himself
valka watches curious
its all well and good to call yourself a dragon
hiccup runs off of toothless pulling his stowed wings
but can you fly
they catch the air snapping open
and sending him gliding
deblois final draft
valka gasps astonished
she flies her dragon alongside him marvelling as
hiccup soars riding the wild air currents like an eagle the image of freedom
toothless descends steadily with him hovering protectively
hiccup grins pleased at having impressed valka
until he realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with a fast approaching mountain top
but with his tail locked toothless cant make the tight jackknife turn skyward to rescue hiccup
realizing that theyre in trouble valka and cloudjumper pour on the speed
all four of them collide just as they reach the mountain top sending them crash landing in an explosion of snow
they all topple head over tail to a messy landing on the wind swept ridge and pop up laughing
we just about had it that time
toothless raises his snow packed face glowering
he tail swipes hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder
valka inspects hiccups wing suit with utter fascination
well not bad yourself
she caresses his cheek staring deep into his eyes
hiccup doesnt recoil this time
all this time you took after me
and where was i
im so sorry hiccup

will you give me another chance
hiccup smiles a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven
deblois final draft
i can teach you all ive learned these past twenty years
valka finds a spot at the top of toothless neck and rubs in a circular pattern
in response his dorsal blades slowly crack split and extend forming a pronounced aerodynamic v down the length of his back and tail
now you can make those tight turns
toothless shudders as if experiencing a much needed chiropractic adjustment
he bounds over to hiccup giddily retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a new toy
did you know about this
valka smiles delighting in their mutual amazement
every dragon has its secrets
toothless pounces around showing off to cloudjumper who seems thoroughly unimpressed
and ill show them all to you
well unlock every mystery find every last species together as mother and son
this gift we share hiccup
it bonds us
this is who you are son
who we are
we will change the world for all dragons
we will make it a better safer place

scene meet drago astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular icebergs collapsed against each other at the mouth of a maze
stormfly drops eret to the snow but before he can flee she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg
i got you here now get this thing off me
never take a toy from a dragon
dont you know anything
stormfly crushes him in place under her weight
why does this keep happening to me
astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal
a massive flotilla moored together like a floating camp in the deep water between collided icebergs
thick chains run deep into the water where great blasts of bubbles erupt on the surface
the unseen creature rocks the ships
its effect alone describes it as gargantuan

his scarred face is masked by thick grizzled dreadlocks

hookfang bucks and roars chasing off the soldiers then focusing on drago as he closes in
the armored dragons avert their eyes and cower as drago passes
hookfang hisses a warning but drago approaches undaunted
in a blur drago wraps himself in his dragon skin cloak
the sticky napalm like fire splatters against the fireproof scales enveloping drago in dripping flames as he persists forward without missing a step
as the blast ends drago drops the cloak closing in and holding a cold stare
hookfang lets out a ferocious roar
drago yells back with a fierce savage scream interrupting hookfang and causing him to recoil
drago whirls his bull hook overhead and stabs it into the deck planks
hookfang stirs his aggression fading in the face of dragos unflinching show of dominance
after a moment hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head in submission
drago places his boot upon hookfangs snout pressing it into the deck planks

as eret chokes stammering astrid whispers to the gang

a whole island full
his grip tightens around erets neck as he turns to astrid
i wouldnt worry about it
my men are hunting them down as we speak
they wont know where youre hiding
i promise you that
astrid nods a covert signal to the gang she has a plan
oh yes they will

if you so much as touch us hiccup is gonna hiccup
hes not a problem
hes only the son of stoick the vast
dragos eyes narrow upon hearing stoicks name
his heir to the throne of berk
and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen
i alone control the dragons
and unless you let us go right now he will blast through here on his night fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters

then theyll be crying like babies
funny and beautiful
good one babe

he shuffles past stoick and hiccup dazed
uh you might want to take this one
stoick draws his sword then braves into the chamber ahead
dad can you put the sword away
stoick gasps as if seeing a ghost
and drops his sword with a clatter
valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him blocking the path
she lets out an audible shudder upon seeing him
he removes his helmet slowly as hiccup gobber and toothless appear at stoicks side
i know what youre going to say stoick
how could i have done this
stayed away all of these years
and why didnt i come back to you
to our son

dragons emerge from the recesses behind valka hissing protectively
well what sign did i have that you could change stoick
that anyone on berk could

this is why i never married
this and one other reason

i know that i left you to raise hiccup alone
but i thought hed be better off without me
and i was wrong i see that now but
stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face
oh stop being so stoic stoick
shout scream say something
youre as beautiful as the day i lost you
his words snuff her retort rendering her speechless
she softens despite herself yielding her cheek to his palm

he pulls her into a kiss

you can still jump

our sons changed berk for the better
i think we did well with this one val
stoick places his hands on valkas shoulders
she flinches dropping the plate
cloudjumper steals the fish before toothless can get to it
toothless whimpers and as a sign of acceptance cloudjumper regurgitates the fish so toothless can have some
a little out of practice

oh i love this one

he lets out a heavy hearted sigh
but nostalgia gets the better of valka
she softly sings her part and love me for eternity
she brushes past him setting into the center of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation

my dearest one my darling dear you mighty words astound me
