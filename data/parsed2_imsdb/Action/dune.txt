december also known as dune home of the fremen former zenzunni wanderers
fade in to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of the reverend mother ramallo who sits against smooth black rock
her eyes are deep blue within blue and her skin is a haunting translucent white
her voice echoes as if in a great cavern
we are the secret of the universe
bi la kaifa
we are the secret of the universe
we know of spice
the spice called melange
the greatest treasure in the universe
it exists on only one planet ours arrakis dune
we know of spice and the bene gesserit sisterhoods selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the kwisatz haderach the one the spice will awaken
bi la kaifa
and now the prophecy
then a powerful low organ note resounding in the cavernous space
he will come
the voice from the outer world bringing the holy war the jihad which will cleanse the universe and bring us out of darkness
he will have been born of a bene gesserit mother
the reverend mother continues speaking of the prophecy but we do not hear it
the huge wind organ blows louder and louder obscuring her voice
the picture fades
home planet of house corrino and shadam iv emperor of the known universe
fade in to interior of one drop of water
the image changes subtly
pull back to a shot revealing the outside of the drop
there is a distant roaring and within the drop we can see the distorted image of a space ship landing on a sophisticated landing field
deleted on the dark landing field chemicals spill out of the ship in troughs and tank suited guildsmen begin to swarm out of a hatch opening
deleted the emperor is surrounded by crowds of courtiers in his throne room
suddenly a guard enters from a small door and quickly crosses to another guard
a warning sound begins
the emperor turns nervously
guards quickly begin to clear the large room
several women are rushed toward us to a door beyond
one of the woman irulan stops and turns back for a worried caring look to her father the emperor
she sees that sardaukar officers are surrounding him now speaking to him
irulan turns and leaves
the emperor moves away from his officers to the center of the now empty room
he drops his golden robe from his shoulders
he stands in his elegant black uniform thinking
the reverend mother is ushered in and the sardaukar officers leave her alone with the emperor
quickly a third stage guild navigator will be here within minutes
we felt his presence
i shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when were finished
their minds are so
they move in strange directions
forced spice evolution of humans changes many things
i must sit close to him
he will not permit anyone but me to see him
you must be outside this room
do what you can
i am your truthsayer my lord
sensing something outside the room he is here my lord
under the carved inscription law is the ultimate science the doors to the emperors chambers slide open and fifty guildsmen wheel in a forty foot long giant black box
one of the guildsmen addresses the emperor through a translating device
the bene gesserit witch must leave
the emperor looks to the reverend mother
yes my lord
after she has gone we are alone
the reverend mother enters through doors and takes a seat on a chair just outside the door
she closes her eyes
inside the emperors chamber the tank suited guildsmen are arranging themselves in a v formation around the box
suddenly the box opens slowly and beautifully revealing a huge thick glass tank
inside the tank floats a third stage navigator twenty feet long much like a cross between a pasty pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper
the tank is filled with swirling orange spice gas and guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic chemical spills dripping from under the tank
suddenly the guild navigator swims towards the emperor
his head is enormous and fleshy like a huge grasshopper head the eyes are totally deep blue
his voice is a high fleshy whispering and an intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the tank translates into english and broadcasts it into the room
we have just folded space from ix
extremely nervous yes
how was your journey
after a long pause many machines on ix
better than those on richesse
you are transparent
i see many things
i see plans within plans
is there a problem
usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit
finally the answer is within the problem
outside the emperors chamber the reverend mother sits her eyes closed straining
a very blurred scene of the emperor with the guild navigator
she is not getting the english version but a much different language version which is fascinating to listen to
a lilting sing song monologue
i see two great houses house atreides house harkonnen feuding
i see you behind it
the navigator breathes the spice gas heavily and swishes gently in his tank
you must share with us
the atreides house is building a secret army
using a technique unknown to us
a technique involving sound
the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad
he could threaten me
i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice
thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens
house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain
then at an appointed time baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides
i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops
so the harkonnens will rid you of house atreides
outside the reverend mother is seeing the scene mentally
she suddenly sees and flinches
the guild navigator turns toward her and comes very close to her
we hear the navigator speak to her
to reverend mother mentally reverend mother
i will give you the tleilaxu path
an excited whisper a chance for escape
but for whom
can you hear me
if this visit has anything to do with spice
the guild navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank
listen to me
the spice must flow
the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years
it has enabled you to live two hundred years
the spice helps make the sapho juice which gives the red lipped mentats the ability to be living computers
the secret side of spice
the water of life
he shouldnt speak of this
gives the bene gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond
to have superior powers
our power to fold space is in the spice
without us your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets
you would be lost
i can assure you
do not interrupt
do not speak lightly of the spice
one small point
here it comes
foresee a slight problem within house atreides
you mean of course duke leto atreides
page missing high on the rock cliff stands castle caladan its appearance us dark and medieval
there is a window on the seaward wall lit from within
by a drifting glowglobe
paul sits at an l shaped table studying filmbooks and maps of arrakis and the universe
we see vast star fields and galaxies
whispering here we are now
nineteen light years beyond
we see the galaxies move as we hear a hum
whispering beyond epsilon alangue
we hold on this then we see arrakis grow larger in the filmbook screen and we see it is a planet of vast deserts
whispering again it does look dry
the picture grows larger again and we see the arrakeen valley
each day the palms along the outer wall of the palace at arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men
the palms were placed by the harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city fremen
where are the harkonnens from here
the star fields and galaxies move slightly then
geidi prime and the baron harkonnen
in the background footsteps grow louder pounding on thick wooden floors
thufir hawat gurney halleck and dr
paul has his back to the door
thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices this
without turning i know thufir im sitting with my back to the door
hawat suppresses a smile
i heard you dr
yueh and gurney coming down the hall
those sounds could be imitated
id know the difference
paul rises and turns to face them
inner voice yes
perhaps he would at that
my father sent you to test me
im packing this for the crossing
we had practice this morning
im not in the mood
angered not in the mood
moods a thing for cattle and love play
im sorry gurney
not sorry enough
gurney draws his knife
gurney activates his body shield sending a shimmering force field around his body
he advances swiftly toward paul
paul snaps on his force field draws his knife and jumps back collecting himself hurriedly for the fight
his voice sounding strange through the forcefield guard yourself for true
gurney leaps high then forward pressing a furious attack
paul falls back
the shield edges crack loudly as they touch each other
inner voice whats gotten into gurney
hes not faking
paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room
the smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and spark off one another
paul directs a parry downwards turns and leads gurney against the table plunging at just the right moment to pin gurney against the table top with his blade right at
strange shielded voice is this what you seek
strange shielded voice good
the slow blade penetrates the shield
but look down
paul looks and sees gurneys blade at his groin
wed have joined each other in death
however you did seem to finally get the mood
would you really have drawn my blood
if youd fought one whit below your abilities id have scratched you a good one
paul stands and snaps off his shield as does gurney
things have been so serious here lately
i sensed the play in you lad but this can no longer be play
tomorrow we leave for arrakis
arrakis is real
the harkonnens are real
thufir yueh gurney and paul stare at each other for a moment in silence
yueh moves forward and begins to take pauls pulse rate and to collect other data with a small black machine
yueh do you have any information on the worms of arrakis
i have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen
only meters long
they smile at each other
there are have been documented sightings of worms as large as meters in the deep desert far from where well be in arakeen
the desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden
the storms and the worms
is it true that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour
it can render flesh to dust in minutes
and these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere
our body shields wont have enough power to operate in the open air on arrakis
well how do the fremen survive there
we dont know much about the fremen
they live in the deep desert
some of them in the cities and they have blue within blue eyes
smiling the eyes yes yes
saturation of the blood by the spice melange
could the spice affect us in other ways
many dangers exist on arrakis
for one we know the harkonnens would not have given up their choam company contract so easily
rising the harkonnens are our enemies yes
but behind them i suspect is the emperor
you will make a formidable duke
the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence
but if it is a trap then why are we going
we have our new army
in the same breath dr
yueh put the weirding module on him
thufir noticing a squad of guards at the other end of the training room calls out to them
clear and lock the room
gurney activates a series of locks
lights glows above each doorway
activate a fighter
suddenly a fighter robot lowers from the ceiling
as the robot begins to rotate and go through several frightening complicated movements dr
yueh places a plastic device around pauls neck
he tightens it around the adams apple above pauls voice box
paul turns and emits a very strange powerful sound through the weirding module as he rushes towards the robot
to yueh precise control
the hallway is empty in the foreground but in the distance a changing of the guard is seen
deleted paul walks down the stairway
in the distance moving troops are packing atreides belongings
beyond paul sees some troops carrying a large bulls head
the horns are covered with dried blood
the bull that killed my grandfather
is this an evil omen
suddenly duncan idaho appears from behind the giant black head
they shake hands i was on my way to say goodbye to you
i have to go on ahead
i wish you were coming with us
its something for your father
he wants to talk to you
places hand on pauls chest ill see you in arrakis
may the hand of god be with you
may the hand of god be with us all duncan
paul walks to meet his father near the wall
thank you for joining me paul
voice tired it will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us
deleted they look out over the sea
a huge wave crashes below
the duke turns to paul
inner voice my son
out loud thufir hawat has served house atreides three generations
he swears you are the finest student hes ever taught
yueh gurney and duncan say the same
it makes me feel very proud
i want you to be proud of me
paul smiles up at his father
the wind blows the dukes hair and behind him stands the castle and the green and black atreides banner against the night sky beyond
the rain starts again lightly
paul takes a closer look at the atreides banner moving in the wind
studying the dark sea below ill miss the sea
but a person needs new experiences
they jar something deep inside allowing him to grow
without change something sleeps inside us
and seldom awakens
the sleeper must awaken
pauls attention goes to his fathers hand where he sees the dukes signet ring
again he smiles at his father
deleted paul is sweating during his sleep and whispers as if struggling with some disturbing thought
we see pauls dream
it is very dark
suddenly a drop falls into the black and white hot widening rings appear on the dark waters surface
two moons rise in the darkness
as the second appears the second moon your moon
a figure turns toward paul
it is a beautiful girl in deep shadow
tell me of your homeworld usul
cu pauls face in fitful sleep
in a small stone courtyard the back lit figure of a woman moves towards us through the heavy rain and darkness
as she nears us the large protective glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a beautiful woman jessica
inner voice i know she has come to test him
no man has ever been tested with the box
only bene gesserit women
i may lose my son
the doors open she meets the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam the emperors truthsayer and takes her back toward the castle
the rain rushes loudly into the storm drains
whispering again arrakis
cu pauls face
pauls eyes snap open
he hears footsteps outside his door
as the door opens he closes his eyes however and he pretends to be asleep
jessica and the reverend mother enter and stand in the doorway looking at him
well salvage what we can
but i can tell you
for the father
jessica turns to the reverend mother stunned
she turns back to look at paul
her hands tremble
did you really think that you could bear the kwisatz haderach
how dare you
my greatest student
and my greatest disappointment
hes listening to us
ready yourself young paul atreides
i want to see you in your mothers chamber in one quarter of an hour
she turns and walks away
jessica remains at the door and calls out to paul in the darkness
this is very important
jessica leaves closing the door behind her
paul sits up in bed
for the father
jessica and the reverend mother enter
it is quite dark
jessica whispers a code number and a glowglobe lights on a very dim setting
you were told to bear only daughters to the atreides
it meant so much to him
you thought only of a dukes desire for a son
desires dont figure in this
an atreides daughter could have been wed to a harkonnen heir and sealed the breach
we may lose both blood lines now
i vowed never to regret my decision
ill pay for my own mistakes
and your son will pay with you
under a dim glowglobe the duke is writing a note on a scroll like piece of paper
finishing reading the duke seals the message in a cylinder and presses his signet ring with a red hawk symbol of house of atreides into a hole which seals the
cylinder with a swift hissing
he pauses studying the metal tube
with a voice command he extinguishes the glowglobe above him
he leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside the window
paul enters the room and jessica closes the door behind them
paul this is the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam
she is going to
to reverend mother please
jessica you know it must be done
i enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace
inner voice what does she fear
out loud what about my father
listen to the reverend mother and do what she tells you
jessica leaves the room
the reverend mother speaks to paul using the voice a bene gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice
it sounds as if two people are talking one normal and the other gutteral and slightly electronic
the effect is strange yet subtle
using the voice now you come here
paul finds he cannot help but obey her yet he fights her controlling him
inner voice shes using the voice
out loud no
she sees him struggling
inner voice some strength there
out loud come here
the reverend mother holds up a green metal cube
put your right hand in the box
paul stares at the hole in the box
whats in the box
just then she raises one hand to his neck
paul sees a glint of metal
he tries to back away
the voice stop
put your hand in the box
pauls hand goes in
fear passes over his face
inner voice the voice again
i hold at your neck the gom jabbar
dont pull away or youll feel that poison
a dukes son must know about many poisons this one kills only animals
are you suggesting a dukes son is an animal
let us say i suggest you may be human
your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts
your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box
if you do so you will die
you will feel an itching there
now the itching becomes burning
heat upon heat upon heat
whispering it burns
inner voice struggling to compose himself i must not fear
fear is the mind killer
fear is the little death that brings total obliteration
i will face my fear
i will permit it to pass over me and through me
the reverend mother moves her face up to his
her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly
she is smiling
you feel the flesh crisping
pauls inner mind sees his hand on fire with all sorts of sores
the skin is bubbling
flesh dropping off
he pictures this
the destruction of his hand is complete now only blood spurts out and burns
pauls face registers extreme pain
cannot help the explosion no
no woman child ever withstood that much
i must have wanted you to fail
take your hand out of the box and look at it young human
paul pulls his hand out of the box
no sign of anything wrong
he turns his hand flexes his fingers
he looks to the reverend mother
explaining pain by nerve induction
a human can resist any pain
our test is crisis and observation
i see the truth of it
inner voice could he be the one
but will he be ours to control
out loud you know when people speak the truth
i know it
suddenly the reverend mother holds her hand against pauls head
she closes her eyes
she sees a blurred image of pauls earlier dream
she sees the beautiful girl turn
she hears a muffled voice say tell me of your homeworld usul
your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams
i only want to know one thing
do they come true
not all of them
i know which ones will
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach
what is it
profoundly the person who can be many places at once
the one who bridges space and time
he will look where we cannot
do you know of the water of life
the truthsayer drug
i have heard of it
it is very dangerous
the bene gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within
there is a place terrifying to us
it is said a man will come
the kwisatz haderach
he will go where we cannot
many men have tried
did they try and fail
they tried and died
she calls out loudly jessica
jessica enters immediately and sees with great relief that paul is still active
i sense your teachings in him
ignore the regular order of training
his safety requires the voice
ive heard enough of my safety
what about my father
i heard you talking
you speak as if he was dead
well he isnt
she tries to hold him
well he isnt
and he wont die
tell me he wont die
what can be done has been done
the reverend mother covers herself and moves quickly to the door
deleted home planet of house harkonnen as seen from space the black planet as we saw it in pauls filmbook
the surface of the planet is a vast sea of black oil
a small cable car traverses high above the sea toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a rectangular box over stories high
before the city there are rows of huge black towering steel heads atop massive furnaces
smoke billows out of their mouths
inside the cable car stands piter
in one hand he holds the cylinder with duke letos ring imprint
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed the lips acquire stains the stains become a warning it is by will alone i set my mind in
somewhere in the interior of geidi prime we are in a green porcelain room
two large harkonnen soldiers using large hoses are washing down the walls and floors of the room
we move down into the water rushing along the floor towards troughs
closer we see bits of flesh hair and blood
the car zooms past gigantic faces and the furnaces far below roar with tremendous power
the city now looms gigantic and overpowering millions of electrical cables stretch off the top into dark energy taps above the city
inside the city the cable car passes into a huge inner chamber filled with open topped lime green porcelain rooms with tremendous electrical lines criss crossing above
deleted in front of a huge steam boiler the cable car stops and piter gets out steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the baron is being
treated by a doctor for sores on his face and body
the doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the barons lips
the baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time
he turns to piter as he enters the room
piter moves up to the baron
the atreides will be leaving caladan soon baron and i have here your answer from duke leto
what does leto say piter
he wishes to inform you that vendetta as he puts it using the ancient tongue the art of kanly is still alive
he does not wish to meet or speak with you
swallowing angry i made my peace gesture
the forms of kanly have been obeyed
he throws down the cylinder
as you instructed me i have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t
the plan to crush the atreides
no other great house of the landsraad must ever know of the emperors aid to the baron
the entire landsraad would turn against the baron and the emperor
put the pick in there pete and turn it round real neat
his assistant does so
rabban breaks open a squood living food
the squood makes a tiny scream then rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids
he throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room
across the room two harkonnen soldiers enter holding big guns on a boy who is wearing white pants
the baron smiles when he sees the boy who is deeply afraid
the guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the baron
as the baron watches the boy youre so beautiful my baron your skin love to me your diseases lovingly cared for for all eternity
i will have arrakis back for myself
he who controls the spice controls the universe
and what piter didnt tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to duke leto
will be worth more to us than ten legions of sardaukar
who is the traitor
laughs i wont tell you who the traitor is or when well attack
however the duke will die before these eyes and hell know that it is i baron vladimir harkonnen who encompasses his doom
the baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open emitting tremendous sounds
suddenly the baron begins to float straight up twenty five feet in the air
it is a frightening sight
he floats down under the giant humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the
feyd and rabban watch nervously
the attendants stand completely still with fear
the baron swoops down to the boy who stands petrified
the harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards
the boy begins screaming as the baron pulls the boys heart plug located in his chest
the violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues
then the baron turns smiling to feyd as the sounds continue to roar
deleted a drum corps pounds out a powerful cadence in front of a water and cannon show as the duke paul and jessica mount the steel stairs to their ship
in the doorway they turn back for a final look
the duke places a hand on pauls shoulder
we see the signet ring
jessica is there
she tries to get paul to look at her but he scowls and turns to his father
turning away inner voice i must not fear
fear is the mind killer
the little death that brings total obliteration
the door of the spaceship closes
atreides ships are approaching the guild heighliner which is staggeringly colossal
the atreides ships look like dots next to the sun
the dukes ship enters the frame and moves toward the heighliner
deleted paul jessica and duke leto look out the forward viewing glass as tiny lights move outside in the darkness
they hear and feel their ship stop with a huge echoing metallic jolt
they look at each other in the silence which follows
soon theyll begin to fold space
inner voice far off in the control rooms
travelling without moving
deleted we pass through electrical shields into a foot high control room filled with orange spice gas
on the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and filtering system
tons of spice gas are being converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of machinery
from within a dark metal tunnel comes a guild navigator
he exits the tunnel and swims through the gas feet to a six dimensional layered miniature replica of the entire universe
the navigator emits a long piece of light from his mouth which travels to one edge of the universe and changes into a likeness of the planet caladan
the navigator turns and emits another piece of light which travels to the opposite side of the universe
it changes into a likeness of arrakis
the navigator begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the stars and he emits sounds and bursts of light into the mass of stars and galaxies
the universe begins to vibrate and elongate then to curve
electrical lightening traverses from caladan to arrakis as the universe bends into a u shape
arrakis submerges deep into the light
the navigator swims to the point where arrakis disappeared
he begins to pull and tear a hole in the universe
stars like sparks and sounds and rings of light appear along with a roaring wind
the navigator swims deep into this hole through the rings of light
the navigator becomes more and more transparent until hes lost in darkness
the sounds fade
deleted suddenly the real planet arrakis appears and the giant heighliner materializes above it
deleted through a brownish orange haze appears the dusty valley of arrakeen
the atreides ship has landed at arrakeen
the door is open the family walk down the steps duke leto with his dog paul and jessica
deleted clusters of troops standing at attention around the enormous dark cool doorway as the duke paul and jessica enter the palace
deleted the atreides banner is raised on the top of the palace
deleted atreides army soldiers milling yelling noisily
in a darkened passageway fans turn casting deep slow moving shadows
sounds echo in the distance
a room of technicians and electronic gear
the signals are being heard and interpreted
far in the distance in deep black rock harkonnen spies move carrying strange electronic equipment
deleted thufir marches down a hallway with a squad of troops with electronic gadgetry lights and sounds going constantly
into a radio microphone why isnt the shield up yet
down in the basement atreides engineers are removing a complicated device from heavy machinery
a man radios back to thufir
we found and removed another sabotage device
i think it will go up now
the engineers activate a series of atometric holtzman generators
suddenly sounds begin
the machines start at first low then they whine upwards to a high pitch
when the pitch is steady a series of levers are pulled
just after the second set of levers is pulled a huge house shield is seen going up in a box shape encompassing the palace with shimmering protection
from a small window thufir observes the shield with a critical eye
inner voice worried we found these sabotage devices too easily
two giant glowglobes drift into the great hall where jessica and dr
yueh stand watching a giant bulls head is being hung above the massive fireplace
the moving troops are unpacking crates and organizing furnishings
jessica watches them
distant sounds reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside them
you can here the people of arrakeen outside
can you here the cry soo soo sook of the water sellers
so many reminders of the scarcity of water
have you noticed the line of palms along the wall
the harkonnen put them in
to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people
each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men
the way you say harkonnen
i didnt know you had so much reason to hate them
swiftly my wife
you didnt know my wife
out loud forgive me
inner voice his wife was bene gesserit too
the signs are al over him
they must have killed here
jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on yuehs cheek
im sorry im unable to talk about it
above them a series of iron curtains begins to open over deep rock window slots sending narrow shafts of light down across the room
two atreides women in uniform approach
referring to several robed figures standing in the room my lady
the local people
the maids and servants await your inspection
hawat has cleared them
yueh turns to jessica
the harkonnens may have tampered medically
he turns a yellow light on a moves it over the crowd
the yellow light beam plays over the blue within blue eyes
one of the women the shadout mapes watches jessica continuously
yuehs hand shakes slightly
inner voice noticing yuehs hands hes hiding something holding something back
she studies his face closely
its not just his wife
hes a good man though
hes probably trying to save my feelings
we see her mouth
i could use the voice
make him tell me
it would only shame him
we see her eyes
i must place more trust in my friends
we see yueh turn toward her fearful
paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone his footsteps echoing as goes
he takes pleasure observing the details of the rock palace but all the while he feels an uneasiness a feeling of fear builds in him
paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the bed
he opens the filmbook and activates it
we see a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a narrator speaks over
one carryall handles four spice mining teams however it will fly only two harvesters at a time
today we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty one carryalls
paul looks up
across the room he sees a tray of small pastries which have been laid out
he goes to them and scans them with his poison detector which he carries on his belt
a pleasant tone sounds and the word safe appears in green light
paul takes a pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed
suddenly he stops
he looks at the pastry
inner voice spice
as he continues eating he notices the sunlight through the slates over the window begins to glow white hot
pauls eyes are intense as the light glows brilliantly
whispering inner voice terrible purpose
what is it
some red droplets appear rushing through the white light
three images follow a blurred guild navigator
page missing i am the shadout mapes
could she be the operator
i must cleanse the way between us
you saved my life
and we fremen pay our debts
its known to us that youve a traitor in your midst
who it is we cannot say but were certain of it
inner voice a traitor

looks to jessica there is a traitor among us
deleted running troops storm down the hallway with electronic gear and big stun guns
thufir walks quickly toward several troops

generals surround him as well as gurney
on phone thufir
inner voice and a traitor
god help us
troops come off an elevator
the glow span indicates the very bottom floor of sub floors
the ground is uneven rock and the ceiling is low
the troops fan out shining chemical lamps here and there
a soldier suddenly stops
ahead in his light is a dead harkonnen bloody vomit dried around his mouth
he lies beside an electronic device
yueh covers his face with his hands in a darkened room
searchlights sweep over the faces of city fremen who are sitting or moving solemnly around the outer wall of the palace
some are chanting mahdi and lisan al gaib
others hold up one open hand as a sign they feel the messiah is near
a slow moving spike backed dog sucks ants up out of a small anthill he snorts
in the darkened hall we can hear the distant sound of the fremen reverberating
duke leto sits with paul thufir eight generals and six sub lieutenants
the dukes small dog wanders under the table and rests his head on the dukes boot
in front of thufir is a device flashing brilliant light bursts over his face
the others are all talking among themselves

thufir turns to duke leto
he looks up
everyone is quiet now
the palace is now secure
the city of arrakeen is under martial law
we have troops here headquartered underground on sub floors six through ten
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen and we have some on the airfield
our new army is still training but everything is shielded
with the shielding we are impenetrable
kynes is waiting sire for your inspection of spice mining operations but since the attempt of the young master i am against your leaving the palace
very angry the attempt failed
harkonnen captives have already been taken
we must crush the harkonnen machine on arrakis
you all know what to do
turning towards gurney gurney
we desperately need more spice miners
many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle
we need spice drivers weather scanners dune men
any with open sand experience
you must persuade them to enlist with us
they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup as the east wind
and they shall gather the captivity of the sand
squints at gurney very moving gurney
on your way
and take care of dr
kynes until paul and i arrive
we will not be prisoners here in this place
artfully easing the dukes anger behold as a wild ass in the desert go i forth to my work
gurney strides off
thufir sits contemplating
paul and duke leto smile at each other and shake their heads
jessica is sitting in a small room smiling reading a note
it reads i miss you
she sets the note down
she begins to tremble
she becomes fearful
in her mind she sees quick images a blurred guild navigator
paul dead on a stone floor
jessica continues to tremble
inner voice i must speak with you leto
outside in the passageway feet suddenly move quietly toward the door to jessicas room
jessica hears this and looks up just as the shadout mapes silently enters her room
staring at the blue eyed woman waiting for possible danger
i am the shadout mapes your housekeeper noble born
what are your orders
you may refer to me as my lady
i am not noble born
im the bound concubine of duke leto mother of the heir designate
thats an ancient word
strangely asked you know the ancient tongues
i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa all the hunting languages
as the legend says
inner voice thats it
the missionaria protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of bene gesserit need
and that day has come
i must play out this sham
out loud i know the dark things and the way of the great mother
mapes takes a step backward to flee
i know many things
i know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice
my lady i
the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one
and the means of my death should i prove otherwise
inner voice now we will see which way the decision tips
slowly mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a sheathed knife
she unleashes it
do you know this my lady
inner voice it could only be one thing
out loud its a crysknife
say it not lightly
very slowly do you know its meaning
inner voice here is why this fremen has taken service with me to ask that one question
delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer
shadout is chakobsa
knife in chakobsa is
maker of death
out loud its a maker
mapes screams with elation and grief
inner voice maker
maker is the key word
the tooth of the worm
that was close
out loud did you think that i knowing the mysteries of the great mother would not know the maker
my lady when one has lived with prophecy for so long the moment of revelation is a shock
mapes sheathes the blade
slowly inner voice theres more here
out loud mapes youve sheathed that blade unblooded
with a gasp mapes drops the knife into jessicas hands and opens her blouse
take the water of my life
jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and with the blade scratches a line just above mapes right breast
you are ours
you are the one
jessicas eyes stare ahead
she knows these words ring with truth
the duke paul and several armed guards enter a tunnel to a thopter landing pad which is illuminated by a shaft of light coming from a chimney like exit above
kynes and his fremen guard are standing next to gurney
to gurney so this is leto the just
sharply i hope i made myself clear
you may call him the duke my lord or sire
and there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind noble born
inner voice play out your little comedy while you can off worlders
gurney turns and activates a device
which causes the ornithopter behind to fold open ready for flight
the two parties meet and are introduced
so you are dr
kynes the imperial ecologist
turning to gurney i prefer the more ancient term planetologist
this is my son paul
are you a fremen
i am a servant of the his majesty the emperor
i have served his majesty on arrakis long enough for my eyes to change
inner voice hes hiding something
i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits doctor
they are fremen suits
i hope they fit well my lord
your gift is a blessing of the river
kynes fremen guards hearing this are siezed with agitation
kynes quiets them then studies paul
inner voice the mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing
spoken nonchalantly most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot
they mean no harm
with your permission i will check the security of your suits
gurney and the guard move forward warily
angrily the duke is to be addresses as
kynes comes forward and adjusts the dukes suit checking seals and pulling on straps
leaping forward to protect his duke sire
its all right gurney
gurney steps back
its a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system
perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second
the salt is separated
breathing and walking provide the pumping action
the reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck
urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads
should you be in the open desert remember to breathe in through your mouth out through the nose tubes
the duke is now properly fitted
kynes places the noseplug into his nose
with a fremen suit in good working order one can sustain life for weeks even in the deep desert
he removes the noseplug
with your permission
kynes turns to paul running his hands over the slick fabric
he stands back with a puzzled expression
youve worn a stillsuit before
your suit is fitted desert fashion
who told you how to do that
seemed the proper way
that it is
inner voice he shall know your ways as if born to them
kynes fremen guard are watching paul very closely now
were wasting time sire
duke leto dr
kynes gurney and paul enter the ornithopter
deleted jessica trembles
inner voice i must speak with you leto
deleted and the thopter turns slowly as it goes up into the light
deleted from outside the palaces atomic shield we see the blur of the ornithopter pass through a porthole and come out perfect like a gleaming jewel
deleted southeast over the shield wall
thats where i told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting
they crest the top of the wall which opens out into a black level expanse of rock cratered and fractured
on the other side is the huge seemingly endless plain of sand the great desert
in the hazy distance flashes of light can be seen
will we see a worm
where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms
why do they come
to protect their territory
vibrations attract them
inner voice ive registered him now
a knife is a sheath on his left arm
a person born to command
hes hiding many things
out loud suddenly is there a relationship between the worms and the spice
kynes turns instantly and stares at paul
gurney sees the wonder in kynes eyes
the young master is a trained mentat an advanced student of prana bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the universe
kynes takes a second look at young paul
as i said
they defend the spice sands
as to their relationship with the spice
deleted dust cloud ahead sire
no other cloud quite like it
see the spotters over it
theyre watching for wormsign
the telltale sand waves
seismic probes on the surface too sire
worms can travel too deep for their waves to show
looks like a good patch of spice
is it wormsign
youve got sharp eyes sire
kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct frequency
deleted from the window we see that the sand below is rippling like water with a big fish just under the surface
into radio after having found the frequency calling harvester pad nine
then a voice
over radio who calls pad nine
quickly dont mention the duke
this is an uncoded channel
unlisted flight northeast of you
wormsign on intercept course
estimated contact fifteen minutes
over radio have sighting confirmed
stand by for fix
contact in sixteen minutes minus
very precise estimate
who is on that unlisted flight
kynes clicks off the radio
what happens now
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester
try and get in close over the harvester
youll find this interesting sire
the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester
paul can see
huge amounts of sand being spewn out of the gigantic stack atop the metal and plasteel harvester
theyll work until the very last minute
the yellow cloud of the harvester envelops them
the duke flies up to get a closer look
over radio spotter control
no sign of the carryall
it isnt answering
everyone looks at one another
the worm is eight minutes away sire
over radio spotter control give me a report by the numbers
over the radio many voices report they have no contact with the carryall
he punches a control button and grabs a microphone
into microphone we are coming down to take you off the harvester
all spotters are ordered to comply
over radio ordered by whom
angrily duke leto atreides
gurney and paul turn to each other worried
over radio yes
how many men do you have
over radio full crew twenty six men but sire we cant leave this spice
damn the spice
get out of there
all the spotters begin landing and the duke descends directly in front of the harvester which has stopped mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic grinding noise
no one is coming out
gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships
a very low powerful sound starts now and the ground begins to shake
a hatch opens and men come pouring out
yelling at the men two men in each of the spotters
the ground is really shaking now
a tremendous low thundering sound grows along with a high rasping to paul and gurney yelling over the noise i cant see him yet but hes very close
out loud to himself as he watches the men scrambling damn sloppy really damn sloppy
four men begin tumbling into the dukes machine
come on boys
then to the duke were going to be heavy sire
the men press on gurney and paul
paul can feel the fear
the sound is a horrible roar and deeper rumbling now and the thopter is vibrating and shaking violently
the air suddenly begins to spark with static electricity
nervous here he is
weve got to go
the duke closes the doorways surveys the area one last time then takes the controls
the ship strains and lifts off slowly
paul sees the brown powder clumped on the suits of the men
their bluish eyes
he smells the spice
he begins to feel its affect
inner voice as a blinding light comes and goes spice
pure un refined spice
murmuring bless the maker and his water
bless the coming and going of him
may his passage cleanse the world
yelling whats that youre saying
a spice miner turns and sees kynes who remains silent
paul hears this then looks to kynes locks on his image
inner voice liet
pointing down and yelling you are about to witness something few have seen watch
paul looks down as the duke banks over the harvester
static electricity is igniting in the air and the sand is swirling around the harvester
then they see it
a wide hole emerges from the sand glistening spokes within it
the hole is twice the size of the harvester
suddenly the machine turns and slides into the hole parts of it exploding
the sound is deafening
the dukes ship is whining to stay aloft
gods what a monster
someone is going to pay for this
inner voice as he studies the duke this duke is more concerned over his men than the spice
i must admit
against all better judgement
i like this duke
deleted duke leto walks into the room
the night guard comes to attention as he passes
duncan idaho wearing a dark dusty stillsuit emerges from the shadows
duke leto and duncan meet at the foot of the steps
the men embrace and separate
what have you discovered about the fremen duncan tell me
why havent we heard from you
i suspect so much
i think they are the allies we seek
they are strong and fierce
they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly
as you know the imperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert
my lord i suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet
that the fremen exist in vast numbers
and it is they that control arrakis
open the door
paul is in a fitful sleep
leto enters and smiles at his son
the duke smiles at paul then leaves the room but after he goes paul strains with all his might to lift himself to call out
struggling painfully father
the barons face expressionless
the sound of his ship screams in the background
the doctor is seated beside him
the duke walks down the steps to a very narrow passageway
the passageway becomes very dark
suddenly the duke hears a strange mewling sound
he turns down an even darker passageway
he can hear the shield whining in the distance
he almost has to feel his way
up ahead he sees a shape
he bends down and sees the shadout mapes dying on the cold stone floor in the darkness
she tries to speak but cannot
suddenly the duke hears the shield generator start whining down
as mapes dies the shield
the duke reaches to activate his shield be a large dart is shot into his shoulder
the duke lurches upwards then tumbles to the ground
out of the darkness comes dr
the dart drops and clatters as if a dream
mind racing struggling yueh
inner voice hes sabotaged the house generators were wide open
with self disgust ive brought house atreides down
ive destroyed the new armys weirding modules
hoarse whisper why
the generator whines lower and lower i wish to kill a man
not you my dear duke but the baron
you were dead already
but you will be close to the baron before you die
you will be tied and drugged but you can still attack
when you see the baron you will have a new poison tooth
he will want you close so he can gloat over you
one bite on this tooth and a strong exile
for in return i will save the lives of your paul and jessica
yueh removes the dukes signet ring and shows it to him
he implants the tooth
yueh becomes more and more blurred
his image begins to fade
his lips move in the darkness
the generator whine is low and going lower and lower
when you see the baron remember the tooth
deleted atreides guard comes running down the steps and up to the captain and a technician
the shield is down
the shield is down
turns and shouts get that shield up
a warning tone begins
troops begin pouring onto the field
troops race toward their ships
deleted the shield
a loud warning tone vibrates
thufir turns away from the doorway of a small room where hes horrified to see
a chemical fire consuming the thousands of atreides weirding modules
deleted a thousand harkonnen ships dive over arrakeen and the palace
giant deep thunderous explosions shatter the land
billowing smoke clouds column upwards forming a black wriggling death curtain around the palace
troops are running through the passageway right and left
smoke is everywhere and the horrible sounds of the explosions continue
the sounds of stone crunching shifting and breaking
a wall of stone suddenly cracks open
a burst of air and dust shoots out hissing
the dukes dog runs through the passageway whining with fear
deleted sardaukar rush out of a harkonnen ship
their electrically distorted faces come screaming toward us
deleted harkonnen hammer ships thunder the ground sending cracks and fissures throughout the landing field
harkonnen scare sirens scream
atreides soldiers run from the hammer ships
fire and smoke
an atreides soldiers head is hit with a large white hot piece of explosion
through the black smoke large sardaukar chase after three soldiers and them with hydraulic knife guns
one blade enters the back of one mans head and comes out his nose
tremendous noise of battle
gurney and a squad of troopers climb through bodies and thick smoke
gurney has the dukes dog safely inside his coat
the little dogs head sticks out looking about
gurney strokes the dogs neck when the reach safety behind some rock
small glimpses as the smoke moves this way or that let them see thousands of sardaukar fighting
long live duke leto
the cry from the men rings out as they attack with frenzy equalling that of the sardaukar
the distant hammering of the harkonnen hammer ship
jessicas eyes open and she sees two big boots but they seem to be floating above the stone floor she is lying on
she is gagged and tied
she looks up
she sees the huge baron harkonnen staring down at her
in the distance she hears the battle raging
the drug was timed
yueh has been very valuable to us
what a pity you must remain gagged
we cant let ourselves be swayed by your witchs voice now can we
inner voice leto
where are you
yueh covers his face with his hands in a darkened room
the baron floats across the room with suspensor borne lightness
goodbye jessica and goodbye to your sweet son
i want to spit once on your head
just some spittle on your face what a luxury
he spits on her cheek
the baron floats out of the room into the passageway
we were ordered to kill them
so kill them
what are your orders piter
take them to the desert as the traitor suggested and worms will destroy the evidence
their bodies must never be found
whispering to jessica rubbing the spittle around on her face with his hand delicately id thought of many pleasures with you
it is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm
desire clouds my reason
that is not good
that is bad
duncan idaho kills a sardaukar soldier and rushes forward frantically
his eyes blaze intensely
he yells out to the other atreides soldiers
theyre on this floor somewhere
the soldiers disappear searching in another direction
duncan runs pounding down the passageway his eyes searching in every doorway
suddenly twelve huge sardaukar round a corner on a quick march
duncan turns his shield up and charges them
behind them he sees paul and jessica bound in straps and being carried
duncan attacks and fights valiantly but he is outnumbered
in the fight the lights are blown out and duncan is killed by a slow stunner pellet through the head
paul strains to help
seeing duncan duncan
paul and jessica are carried off quickly through the darkness
the battle sounds thundering
duncans dead shielded body slides sparking in the dark against the passageway walls
deleted fire and smoke
the barons face the light of fire and explosions playing over it
the baron turns as piter ushers in the traitor yueh
to yueh quietly you wish now to join your wife is that it traitor
a sudden flash of hope crosses yuehs face
the baron smiles almost sympathetically
you wish to join her
join her then
piter moves to yueh a knife glistening in his hand
it flashes into his back
a gasp escapes yuehs throat a sad look passing over his face as if to say i thought as much
he stands stiffly then falls gasping
he tastes his own blood then dies
take him away
black smoke palms
rabban strides in front of his uncles ship carrying kynes over his shoulder
harkonnen and sardaukar soldiers stand at attention
rabban tears off kynes stillsuit
he was in the palace with the atreides
i also say he was a spy for the emperor
looking up to the troops go now
take him to his desert to die
the small thopter climbs toward the shield wall through a smokey atmosphere illuminated by distant inner voice yuehs sign
hes left a satchell
jessica and paul bound by cabin straps lie in the back the two guards at the controls
outside thopters and ships fly past them toward the city
the distant fires play over jessicas face as she sees yuehs triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin roof
id like to have some fun before we kill her
laughing of course
what did you think
jessica looks to paul
struggling to use the voice dont touch my mother
inner voice oh great mother
hes trying the voice
the reverend mother said it could save him
did you hear a noise from the little one
i didnt hear anything
he turns and hits paul in the shoulder with a stungun
paul recovers and starts taking long calming breaths
inner voice the calming exercise
the little one
they laugh suddenly guard reaches around and puts his hand up jessicas skirt
he starts breathing hard
paul clears his throat
using the voice remove her gag
inner voice excellent
guard finds himself removing jessicas gag
guard turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him
once its off jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the thopter floor
the voice theres no need to fight over me
the two men stare at one another a moment
then guard s hand glinting silver flashes into guard s chest killing him
guard pulls the knife out smiling
the ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive
the voice first cut my sons bonds
guard slowly cuts pauls big straps never taking his eyes off jessica
the ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the shield wall
the voice thats it
the blade cuts through the strap holding pauls legs
paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the mans chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head spewing blood out the mans mouth
paul grabs the controls but its too late
the ship falls into the rock
the thopter slides across the rock shearing off a wing
suddenly they are beyond the rock three miles above the great desert and plummeting fast toward the dunes below
paul pulls desperately on the controls and manages to keep the ship aloft and flying into the deep desert
oh my god
deleted cu violently burning palm
nefud exits two harkonnens wheel in the stretcher and swing it round one of the guards hands piter his knife back the guards exit and the door closes piter moves
up to duke leto and leans over him moving his knife across the dukes face
the baron flies down to the stretcher
duke leto atreides
someones torn the insignia off your uniform
leto shows no sign that he has heard
it was feyd
letos pov the baron and his mentat are only dim faraway shapes
their voices reach leto as if travelling across a greater distance
the baron looks to leto and then moves to him looking him over
it was feyd
laughing it was feyd
where is the ducal signet ring
i must have his ring
he was brought to us as is baron
you killed the doctor too soon you fool
inner voice yueh
paul and jessica safe
hes coming round my lord
the baron moves from behind a table stacked with dirty dishes and foodstuffs and goes to leto
inner voice wait
he must be near
where is your ring
the barons face is now very close to duke letos
you do not answer
very faint a
of my life
the baron briefly wonders at these words and then turns to piter
he hits duke leto hes crying
hes crying piter
what does he mean
piter moves forward
the baron sees a suculent piece of chicken skin on the table
he picks up the plate then the chicken skin
letos pov its grown hazy again
the baron is beginning to move away reaching for the small piece of chicken skin
piter leans close to leto
we hear a crunch hear a tumultuous rushing sound as piters face is pushed forcibly away
the baron is turning a dumbfounded look on his face
he drops the plate and backs away
there is a tremendous roaring
bits of visions of caladan rush through letos ever darkening consciousness
deleted the atreides banner the green of it then the black
the blackness flaps then all fades to as they fly deeper into the desert with the ship shuddering and straining jessica suddenly cries out with tremendous premonition and fear
tears course down her cheeks as paul turns to her
to paul leto
i know inner voice i have no feelings
duke leto and piter lie dead
the baron floats near the ceiling in a small passageway
he is ecstatic
screaming im alive
paul is fighting the controls of the harkonnen thopter
harkonnen thopter lights on dunes
i cant maintain any altitude
well never reach the safety of rock
maybe that small rock
where are we do you think
the south polar regions
the forbidden area
we must make it to that rock
the thopter violently hits the sands and flips up almost turning over
it falls slowly back then slides down the side of a dune
he jumps out of his seat
bring these satchels
she hands him one
at doorway hurry this crashing may bring a worm
as paul puts the satchel over his shoulder he feels something
he looks at his fathers ring
he stares at it silently then closes his hand around it
they jump outside
starting to cry a million deaths are not enough for yueh
inner voice reacting to his mothers tears where are my feelings
i feel for no one
paul and jessica running
paul pulls jessica to a place in the wall where a small overhang offers shelter
jessica falls to the ground
she cries pouring out her grief but soon the sound of it is carried away by the building rush of wind
paul turns and looks out to the open desert this portion of which is a dust ocean
the mouse moon has risen
ripples of dust undulate tide like in the light of the moon
the whispering grains billow up like the foam of waves as they hit the rock
paul turns his face illuminated by the two moons above
his eyes lock on the moon which has the image of the mouse
inner voice the second moon
from the dreams
we move into pauls eye where the mouse moon appear and revolves slowly
the moon begins to explode
the pieces of the moon soar toward us burning with white hot flames
within the flames we see
deleted the burning palace of arrakeen
we move closer to it
we then see duke letos face
the baron leans over the duke and clutches the skin on the dukes face
he begins pulling it
the skin on the dukes race slowly rips open making a hideous tearing sound
black smoke issues forth from the hole which teats larger
distorted house atreides is ruined
less distorted this moon holds my past
inside and through the smoke paul sees feyd tear the red duke insignia off his fathers uniform
he sees feyd laughing
the moving now brilliant red hawk insignia becomes
a burning meteor roaring over the castle on caladan
the meteor crashes in the black sea
this moon holds my future
foaming confusion turning into a small twisting fetus under the sea
its eyes closed
moving close to it its eyes snap open
through the eyes is the pale white face of jessica
there is a huge soaring wind sound and beyond jessica the dunes roll like ocean waves
the moon continues to spew out pieces of moving images which are seen then disappear as fast as sparks
the broken burning pieces float eerily toward us over the undulating dunes below
one image floats closer
it is a hand folded into a fist
i am only a seed
the fist begins to open
the seed must grow
the hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating out the very center of the palm
the hand floats eerily forward
the sleeper must awaken
the last image which passes is foaming and spitting dark blue water
as the image passes the black smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to blackness
through the darkness we move to pauls clenched hand
it opens revealing the signet ring in the very center of his palm
paul looks upward to the moons of arrakis
he looks back to the ring then to his mother
listen to me
you wanted to know about my dreams
and ive just had a waking dream
do you know why
calm yourself the spice
its in everything here
the air the soil the food
its like the truthsayer drug
its a poison
you knew the spice would change me
but thanks to your teachings its changed my consciousness
i can see it
i can see it
inner voice is he
you carry my unborn sister in your womb
inner voice he knows
you and your bene gesserit sisterhood
im not your kwisatz haderach
im something different something unexpected
inner voice im a seed
out load i am so much more
you dont begin to know me
deleted pauls head goes down
he places the ring on his finger
inner voice father
now i have become a killer and i will continue to kill until i have avenged your death
out loud father
jessica cries as she stares at her son
deleted rabban stops up the ramp
he wears a large smile
his thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick neck
he goes inside and the doors swing closed
he enters the ship and moves down within to the barons headquarters passing two dwarves cooking a dead legless cow which hangs from chains
rabban tears out the cows tongue and eats it
then he exits through a door which closes behind him
the baron is flying wildly circling the outside of a large steel shower while nefud and a dwarf play a strange instrument producing maniacal perverse screaming music
the baron sees rabban enter but continues to fly around the shower
very excited rabban
were knee deep in atreides blood
weve gutted them
weve gutted them
laughs the baron floats to rabban and begins lovingly massaging rabbans massive neck as he speaks to him
i place you in charge of arrakis
its yours to squeeze as i promised
i want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze
massaging in rhythm give me spice
drive them into utter submission
you must not show the slightest pity or mercy
as only you can
releasing him go
show no mercy
yes my lord baron
rabban leaves just as feyd steps out of the shower
the baron turns to him lovingly
to feyd and when weve crushed these people enough ill send in you feyd
theyll cheer you as a rescuer
really a lovely boy
suddenly he smiles and screams wheres my doctor
as rabban leaves he looks into one room of the ship
behind the glass porthole sits thufir hawat bound head and foot his eyes darting this way and that
paul and jessica are in stillsuits
paul is looking through a fremkit
he finds a paper with dr
yuehs mark on it
inner voice yuehs left the plans for the weirding modules
the moons have moved further across the sky
suddenly paul turns and studies his mother
a stronger wind comes up
we have to get to that mountain of rock
we have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives
jessica gets up
they make their way up the crest of a dune by a small rock
its further than i thought
a worm is sure to come
ill plant a thumper that should divert it
paul moves off into the shadows
suddenly jessica sees a burst of lightning illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them
inner voice as paul leaves to light the thumper the night is a tunnel
a hole into tomorrow
if were to have a tomorrow
deleted paul plants the thumper which begins a powerful rhythmic noise
he turns to jessica
walk without rhythm and we wont attract a worm
itll go to the thumper
puts in her noseplug im ready
paul and jessica move into camera and exit right
another burst of lightning
the distant rock seems to have grown no larger
their muscles begin to ache
suddenly they hear the thumper start behind them
their breathing becomes very labored
the sand moves like slow water forever rolling down and up
then they hear the worm the low thundering hiss shaking the tonnage of sand
the thumper stops
screaming its deafening
their bodies ache and they feel like dropping yet the cliff is still a good distance away
the worm sound grows louder and paul turns to look
a flash of lightning
the worm is now coming toward them
the mound of sand over the worm is enormous and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed
the power of this worm is awesome
she turns to see
then she runs
all at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand
the sound is very loud
the drumming sound echoes deep within the ground
paul stops and drags her up
they run again
the worm sound becomes unbearably loud
static electricity sparks giant bolts of pure white lightning and the air turns to ozone
finally they find rock
behind them the sound of the worm changes
the gigantic head of the worm is just breaking through the sand
the mouth begins to open in an eighty foot circle of teeth and darkness
the mouth arches forward searching for them
paul and jessica climb up and up inside a narrow slit of rock
the worms mouth climbs higher also but it cannot penetrate the narrow opening in the rock
paul and jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of hundred feet
still the worm stretches up to them
suddenly the worm begins banging on the rock
huge shudders drive through the black stone
over and over again the worm mindlessly hits at the rock
paul and jessica crouch further back in the tiny passageway of safety but a solid back wall of rock prevents them from moving back any more
the breath from the worm is like a hurricane of inner voice cinnamon
out loud do you smell it
inner voice i know the secret
the worm is the spice
the spice is the worm
deleted suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks and topples off into the worms mouth
instantly the worm pulls back
a huge fire roars deep within the worm consuming the rock
the worm now can get even closer to paul and jessica
it looms up again and crushes its mouth up against the rock
another fissure opens and suddenly half the rock wall protecting them splits off entirely and falls
taking paul with it
against the worm
paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight down two hundred feet
his feet skid along the face of rock
he bounces and brakes
he hits and jumps
he careens from one boulder flies upside down rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand
unhurt he jumps up and scrambles up another part of the rock to safety
she presses against the narrow ledge that is left after the worm assault
the worm is just coming up again when distant thumping is heard
the worm as if charmed by the sound turns and moves off towards it
inner voice a thumper
deleted jessica climbs further up and manages to get over to a place where she can meet up with paul who is now climbing back
crying whats happened
why did it leave
breathing heavily someone started another thumper
were not alone
they climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth of a dark crevice
paul and jessica try to see into the inky black hole
slowly paul and jessica enter inching forward
a low moan of wind comes up
paul can see nothing then suddenly he sees stars above and sees the hint of stairs cut into the rock
whispering man carved steps
they climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow dark channel of stone
as they make their way through the rock suddenly there is a burst of lightning which illuminates a whole troop of fremen standing silently in front of them
perhaps these are the ones mapes told us of
to jessica are you trained in the ways of the desert
no but many consider my training valuable
i will take the boy man
he shall have sanctuary in my tribe
a low note on a dip stick is blown by one of the fremen tribe
jessica shifts paul sees it and just as stilgar begins a reach for his weapon jessica turns slashes out utters a sound whirls again and with rock behind her holds
stilgar helpless in front of her her hand at his throat
paul moves on her first move
he races up a rocky incline
he then jumps higher up and presses himself between two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the fremen troop
the troop starts shooting projectile weapons in pauls direction
she has the weirding way
why didnt you tell us
if you can do this to the strongest of us youre worth ten times your weight of water
as a leader of my people i give you my bond teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary
your water shall mingle with our water
then i will teach you our way of battle
you have the word bond of a bene gesserit
it is the legend
up on the rock paul turns
he takes a step then notices a small figure standing in front of him
it is a girl
i am chani daughter of liet
i would not have permitted you to harm my tribe
inner voice from my dream
is this kynes daughter
paul stares at her in wonder
come with me
ill show you an easier way down
to paul as they meet you have strength
you shall be known as usul which is the strength of the base of the pillar
this is your secret name in our troop
but you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly
thinking what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon
we call that one muaddib
could i be known as paul muaddib
you are paul muaddib and your mother shall be a sayyadina among us
we welcome you
wind blows a cloud of dust through the rock
high above the moon with the mouse shadow glows brilliantly
it dissolves into the sun
paul jessica and the fremen march through the dunes
deleted heat waves and sand dunes
mysterious sounds echo in the distance as the giant sun is setting
chani takes paul to the top of a dune
they stare at the sunset and a huge rock outcropping in the distance
paul looks at the rock then turns to her
tell me of your homeworld usul
these words rend pauls soul
he cannot speak
he reaches out and touches her hand her cheek
deleted the fremen troop enters into a large square room with slot passageways going off in various directions
they all move down one of the passageways which are beautifully but very plainly cut with lasguns
they are like passages in the pyramids dark with sharp turns and inclines upwards or downwards some very steep and long and others descending hundreds of feet
there is a strong moaning wind
deleted a quiet wind can be heard deep and moaning
she looks at paul
he too notices
down a long sloping narrow passageway they go until they reach a stairway cut into the stone
it is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they descend
the wind sound grows
the air grows colder and damper
paul and jessica share another questioning look
at the bottom of the stairs they pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly opens out on something so totally unexpected it shocks paul
it is enormous deep reservoir of black water sitting silently in the depths of this sietch and stretching out into the darkness
inner voice water on arrakis
i have seen this place in a dream
out loud a treasure
greater than treasure usul
we have thousands of such caches
only a few of us know them all
when we have enough
we shall change the face of arrakis
there is the sound of water dripping
the lights are extinguished reflections play on pauls face
the rocks of arrakis hold many secrets
through deleted thousands of fremen wait below
paul enters a rock ledge guided by two monks which is crowded with fremen and old fremen monks
below the crowds continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ moans
a monk steps up to paul
we sense that you may be the voice from the outer world
both moons told us of you
you must pass tests before we will know
you must conquer the beast of the desert both his outer and his deadly inner powers
moves back speak to us
from the outer world
paul turns and gathers courage to address the multitude below
inner voice i am only a seed
out loud i am usul
loud murmur muaddib
inner voice no one ever dreamed there would be so many
out loud our shared enemy the harkonnens are once again in control of arrakis
stilgar your leader has asked me and my mother to crush the harkonnens
we must do more than this
we must totally destroy all spice production on arrakis
the guild and the entire universe depends on spice
he who can destroy a thing controls a thing
i will take one hundred of your warriors and train them
this one hundred will train the thousands that remain
when the spice flow stops all eyes will turn to arrakis
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us
arrakis will become the center of the universe
inner voice the dream unfolds
deleted large room with a low ceiling
a drummer playing makes a low echoing musical hit
a big block of stone is moved across coarse sand back and forth fast
a rhythm is started powerful
paul enters pauses and looks to jessica he stands in front of over fremen men
jessica sits behind him alongside stilgar
a large rock obelisk has been placed near paul for this demonstration
the weirding way has long been a bene gesserit secret
with my mothers help my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it
because of the harkonnen treachery my fathers armies were never able to fully develop this new form
this is what i will teach you
you will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the universe
our way of battle is built on rhythm
you understand rhythm like this but you do not yet understand the rhythm of the higher sounds sounds that heal and build
sounds that destroy
motion is the base
you understand the motion
but you do not yet understand the motion that heals and builds
motions that destroy
he moves forward this obelisk is of your hardest stone
he does the rock doesnt move hit it
he does the rock doesnt move yell at it
the fremen laugh the rock doesnt move
a fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it
paul motions him back slightly
paul also moves back
he switches on his weirding module
he opens his mouth and makes a small sound which the module amplifies
the sound shatters the obelisk to pieces
the one hundred fremen yell with surprise and awe
this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you
some thoughts have a certain sound
that being the equivalent to a form
through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves shatter bones set fires suffocate an enemy or burst his organs
we will kill until no harkonnen breathes arrakeen air
inner voice to avenge my father i will turn you into killing machines
stilgar turns to jessica
our reverend mother tells me she is too old
she has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest
she asks that you pass within
inner voice they want me to take the water of life
the truthsayer drug
so dangerous yet
we must move swiftly if were to secure our place among these fremen
out loud i will try to pass within
death may be the result
are you sure
inner voice i must do this for paul but what of my unborn child
deleted fremen carry the fremen reverend mother ramallo in on a litter
the old reverend mother is old a frail yet extremely beautiful and mysterious
she turns to paul and jessica with a strange look
to jessica in an ancient voice so you are the ones
she turns away towards the monks who are very busy blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice purifying the area of the rite
several fremen blow on dip sticks and a female choir begins a haunting chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low notes below
paul looks to his mother
he then sees chani
cu paul he cannot stop looking at her
stilgar motions to paul
whispering to paul do you know the water of life
the mystery of mysteries
the end and the beginning
he shows paul through a narrow passageway almost a slot through the stone to a small room
through an opening in the stone wall paul is shown a very strange and somewhat horrifying scene
a thirty foot baby worm is being lowered into a stone chamber
the chamber is then covered with a wire top
valves are turned and water rushes into the chamber
the worm begins to writhe violently and leap and bang against the bars above
the worm begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it begins to gag
some monks and watermasters quickly drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out using large steel hooks
they hold the worm above a large tub
a watermaster reed man runs a long reed in to the worm causing it to spasm and gag up a beautiful deep blue bile as it dies
the bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial containers
paul turns to stilgar
the water of life
inner voice the most lethal poison in the universe
then we hear from pauls memory his conversation with the reverend mother many men have tried
did they try and fail
they tried and died
stilgar and paul return to the ledge above the hall of rites
a monk priest steps forward addresses the crowd silencing them
the other monks move back carrying their smoking cleansing bags
one among us has consented to enter the rite
she will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our reverend mother
inner voice turning to his mother what if she should fail
he brings the jug close to jessica
inner voice the ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic
i must transform the poison configuration within my body
the blue must be made clean
her body contorts and spasms violently
the reverend mother screams with her
deleted we see jessica sitting shoulders tight and spasming straining her eyelids half closed and flickering
deleted the old reverend mother slowly extends a hand toward jessicas shoulder
inside jessica we see the reverend mother ramallos hand descend through the dark void
shimmering water starts to ripple lightly stirring an image of jessica
as the hand penetrates something deep within her starts to glow
it is a fetus a female
the reverend mother ramallos hand flinches as it touches the fetus
the fetus sparks to life screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its umbilical cord
deleted whispering urgently into jessicas ear you should have told us
gasping great mother
this changes both
what have we done
jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark strangely worm like tunnel until suddenly a gaping black hole appears
a horrible wind sparks and circles of expanding light issues from it
inner voice fearful no
this is the place where we cannot look
the place only for the eyes of the kwisatz haderach
the fetus twists down the tunnel to join jessica her umbilical cord trailing behind
she screams as she looks into the hole
she and jessica see a shape moving deep within the windy hole
it is a third stage navigator roaring
what is this
is this what kills the men who enter here
she quickly takes the fetus back up the tunnel
as they move inner voice now my daughter and i are both reverend mothers
distant ive been a long time waiting for you
here is my life
the old reverend mother ramallo slumps forward onto the stone dead
the crowd waits
the corpse is tenderly removed
jessica very slowly opens her eyes and looks about her
the monk holds the jug to her lips
change it that we may all drink of it
jessica spews water into the spout
the monk swirls the jug sniffs at the spout and then drinks
it is changed
inner voice she did it
the fremen suddenly turn their attention to paul
they whisper it is the prophecy
they soon begin to chant
muaddib over and over again
the chanting sounds fill the hall along with the ghostly wind organ
deleted down below the crowds continue chanting muaddib muaddib
paul continues to stare at chani
he moves to her
paul is at her side
their eyes meet and lock
whispering come with me
at the end of the dark black corridor chani turns and she and paul fall together in a long kiss filled with love
i love you
ive always loved you
deleted the baron and feyd descend several steps into a darker area of geidi prime
feyd is carrying a strange creature in a small wire cage

takes a drink feyd even though hes aging thufir is one of the finest mentats in the universe
and hes mine feyd
nefud stands eating candies behind thufirs chair
nefud has a stun gun even though thufirs hands are tied
the baron enters with feyd
oh thufir i see theyve installed your heart plug already
dont be angry
everyone gets one here
but this is not why were here
weve brought you a little cat thufir
you must care for it if you wish to live
a poison has been introduced into you thufir hawat
by milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote
it must be done each day
also you must do something for me if you wish to live
you know i lost piter my dear mentat
thufir gives the baron a weak wide eyed stare
all i can see is an atreides that i want to kill
feyd no no
thufirs a harkonnen now arent you thufir
inner voice my dear duke
how i have failed you
jessicas face shows signs of straining
women move around her chani and harah at her side helping her give birth
suddenly alia is born and her freshly born moist body is held up in front of jessica
alias eyes snap open burning brightly
what will you call her
as they lift alia for jessica to see
paul walks down the steps into the training room followed by harahs two sons
he pauses at the foot of the steps
activate your weirding modules
paul activates his and the fremens follow suit
set the range for two meters
paul walks down the line of fremen
points to robot the arm
aiming the module chuuk sa
he fires the module and the arm of the robot is shot off
paul smiles and hits him on the shoulder paul walks on
one of the fremen calls out to paul
the word muaddib causes a tremendous power to build
the module shakes violently in his hand it suddenly fires upwards and the wall explodes
inner voice my own name is a killing word
will it be a healing word as well
to paul as he applies red colour to the shoulders of several large fremen men usul
these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard
he pauses then holds up his brilliantly red hand
deleted an explosion
paul turns and his eyes are totally blue
he lifts binoculars to them and looks
he sees the fremen fighters below charging at the harkonnens
as the fremen run they make powerful sounds with their weirding modules exploding everything in their path and catching things on fire
in the distance a huge spice carryall is shot down and it falls to the ground exploding more violently on impact
stilgar signals and fremen run behind them
to stilgar theyre even better on the battlefield than in the training rooms
inner voice sound
as a weapon
if only you could see them father
paul smiles as he looks at the battle in the distance
from the past when the spice flow stops the entire universe will turn to arrakis
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us
rabban stares dumbfounded as many harkonnen wounded and dead are brought through the passageway beyond
rabban grabs a harkonnen and asks what happened
what happened to you
what is he saying
rabban pushes him away
hes been repeating that name ever since we found him
who is this muaddib
heat waves dunes
a big thumper is forced into the sands
a rhythm is heard pounding on fremen hand drums and rhythm instruments
black stillsuited fedaykin warrior bodyguards gather
to paul usul
it is time you become a sandrider
and travel as a fremen
take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride as a leader of men
deleted as paul leaves the troop to plant the second thumper two thumpers are planted
the worm may not surface for the first he will rise for the second
remember when the worm approaches you must be utterly still
and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment
the worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it to the top
do not get too close as he approaches
the sand will engulf you
wait till the head of the worm passes then go
in the distance the telltale sound of the worms approach begins
this worm is deep underground and the sound is low and the ground trembles violently
inner voice only the very strong ones travel this deep
the sound and vibrations continue to build
in the distance the fedaykin and stilgar watch
to the others usul has called a big one
it is the legend
deleted heat waves
thunderous approach of the worm
paul still cannot see the worm but the sound begins to drown out the fremen rhythm instruments and the sand begins to vibrate
suddenly paul sees
a mountain of sands rise up towering thundering lightning sparks fissuring throughout the air above the worm
the mountain approaches at a terrifying speed
then the worm appears rushing
the mouth at first a small opening begins to widen exposing a thousand glistening teeth
he lets the worm get closer and closer
the heat waves distort the gigantic form making it more hideous more foreign
he moves forward
the others watch anxiously
this worm is big
it is so much larger than imaged
its top towers feet in the air
the segments are each ten feet wide
paul gets close and running alongside he plants the hook under a segment and pulls back
the sound is excruciatingly loud
the sand is so deep and more is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm
paul gets caught in it and falls
he narrowly escapes being sucked under the beast
he gets up runs again and plants the hook once more
he runs faster bending the segment open to expose the tender flesh
suddenly the worm begins to turn
paul pulls himself up the body as it turns holding onto the hook
soon he is fifty sixty seventy feet off the ground going higher
the giant worm gets the second thumper and paul at that moment climbs to the top
he plants the second hook
inner voice a sandrider
paul works the hooks into the breathing holes along the body
causing the great beast to make a slow turn toward stilgar and the bodyguard
they set themselves and as the worm passes
they all clamber on climbing up the sides to the top
yelling long live the fighters
they return the traditional call and paul steers the maker in a giant circle
they head out across the dunes

deleted smoke billows from a burning harvester
fighting is going on between fremen and some smugglers
paul moves down a smokey dune with stilgar followed by fremen and fedaykin
we surprised a band of smugglers
racing into thick smoke too bad
thought they were harkonnen
paul and stilgar move through the smoke
a man runs up with a maula pistol aimed at paul but paul spins and punctures the mans chest with a sound from his weirding module
paul turns and a large figure comes through the smoke
they surprise each other
the figure holds a gun
the figure stops stunned
youve no need of your weapons with me gurney halleck
peering whisper of hope paul
dont you trust your own eyes

why have you brought me here
there must be some mistake

to the guards carry this noble atreides warrior away
do him all honor
the guards do as they are instructed
emperor shadam the iv
there are guild heighliners above us containing many great houses of the lansraad
send them how dare you speak to me
speaking into electric microphone stop your speaking
to the guildsmen good
you have some idea of what i would do but i will tell it to one who has never been seen
one who hides deep in the heighliner control rooms
he will hear it first
paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him
suddenly we are in the heighliner control room near the floor in the chemical spills
we move up into the orange gas
thundering begins to shake the heighliner
where are you
let me see you or there will be no spice
we move into very thick gas and there is a roaring
suddenly paul sees the third stage navigator
you know what im about to say is true
i have the power to destroy the spice forever
the guild navigators mouth stretches back in a horrible moan
the moan becomes more pained and grows louder and louder
the guildsmen in the room are moaning and screaming and swarming out towards the doorway the fremen stop them
the emperor and all are amazed and frightened
there is a long hush
the old reverend mother then turns and glares at paul
dont try your powers on me
try looking into that place where you dare not look
youll find me there staring back at you
you bene gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required
here i stand
i will never be yours
stop him jessica
stop him yourself
you saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning
in time you perverted the truth
you sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan
how little you understand
you mustnt speak of
using the voice the old woman is shot backwards by the power of his shout
her breath is knocked out of her
i remember your gom jabbar now you remember mine
i can kill with a word
a fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy
and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous
feyd hears this and is angered
to emperor there is a harkonnen among you
give the harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth
if feyd wishes he can meet you with my blade in his hand
i wish it
steps forward this is a harkonnen animal
let me please my lord
the emperors blade
feyd takes up the emperors blade with a smile
paul takes out his crysknife
they begin to circle each other
paul smiles circling still
suddenly feyd leaps his blade jabbing savagely outward but paul easily evades it moving away
they begin to circle again
he makes another pass at paul that comes dangerously close but again paul is away a frozen smile on his face
why prolong the inevitable
i will kill you
i will kill him
he lashes out biting pauls hand
feyd laughs in triumph
feyd leaps forward jabbing his right hip also forward
yet paul although a little slowly again reels away
again feyd thrusts
this time paul jabs with his crysknife but feyd moves away effortlessly
feyd counters and kicks paul to the ground
paul is up instantly and he circles with feyd
smiling who is the little one
a pet perhaps
will she deserve my special attentions
paul jabs out his crysknife slashing
feyd grabs his arm and paul his the two men locked in a straining clinch
feyd presses his right hip closer and closer to pauls body
paul strains to keep it away
suddenly the gom jabbar flips out of feyds girdle but on the left side and he lunges powerfully with it at paul who just barely misses taking it in his
he throws feyd back but not before feyds feet strike out sending paul to the floor
feyd leaps onto him
whispering you see
my blade will finish you
suddenly paul with lightning swiftness pushes feyd up and over
he is on top of him in a flash
pauls crysknife flashes up thrusting upward through feyds jaw
feyds mouth opens as the knife continues up through his tongue and through to his brain
feyds eyes go wild then glaze over as he jerks dead on the floor
paul slowly gets to his feet breathing heavily
anger still seething in him paul issues a sound a loud horrible powerful sound and feyds internal organs rupture and the stone floor under him cracks open
the fedaykin smile
usul no longer needs the weirding module
everyone stares in disbelief
paul looks to the emperor
now i will tell you how it will be
irulan shall be my wife opening the way for an atreides to take the throne
i sit on the throne
you will sit on a throne on selusa secundus your prison planet
either that or you will die
the emperor is still
paul moves to chani
to chani the princess shall have no more of me than my name
no child of mine or touch the softness of glance
nor instant of desire
this is my promise to you
whispering my love
paul turns back to the others
jessica turns to chani and whispers to her
think on it chani
we who carry the name of concubine
history will call us wives
alia enters with two monks
she signals and one of them places a cloak over pauls shoulders
the fremen have the word of muaddib
they will have their holy war to cleanse the universe
they will have arrakis
there will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases
for the spice there will always be some desert
there will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men
we fremen have a saying
he stares at the reverend mother god created arrakis to train the faithful
one cannot go against the word of god
everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly
and how can this be
there are three powerful drum hits
he is the kwisatz haderach
paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing wind
lightning and thunder begin
clouds begin to form over the palace
in the half light of dusk thousands of fremen watch the sky
giant golden lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into the sky illuminating the growing clouds
five tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a downpour of rain on arrakis
the fremen stand awestruck as they are drenched with water falling from the sky
we move through pauls glowing blue eyes into beautiful blue luminescent light
a gigantic wind arises and suddenly appearing in the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like gold glass off into infinite
the blue becomes darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the night
