rubin jon schroder pov of a home video camera shooting into the window of teenage girls bedroom
the door inside opens
in walks judy oaks kellen a blond haired mousy girl wearing only a t shirt and panties
as she heads to the mirror we hear
sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing
whoever operates the camera is definitely choakin the judy combs her hair in the mirror oblivious
the camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he
the sounds have stopped but the tape keeps rolling
judy stops combing her hair as
camera shuts down
camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as judy runs laps during her gym class
judy again has no idea that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight
shes tired sweating profusely and looks completely miserable
she stops running exhausted as the other kids pass her
suddenly a very butch looking female gym teacher walks over and begins berating judy
the gym teachers face turns red as she spews insults inches away from judys face
we cant hear what shes saying but whatever it is its cruel harsh and very intense
exhausted and humiliated judy holds back tears as
camera shuts down
late summer evening
camera operator wipes dirt from the lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as he looks at camera
this is the first time we get even a glimpse of jimmy wright
his looks are striking even a bit awkward but not at all unappealing
he throws a mischievously evil look at the lens then settles his face back to normal
he spins the camera away pointing it at the back of his house
through the kitchen window jimmy zooms in on his mother jimmys mom s idyllic version of a mom in new millennium suburban housewife clothes
shes on the phone preparing dinner
hey mom heard you and dad doing the nasty last night
thanks for that one
by the way who the fuck is nancy
camera whips over to jimmys dad in the living room well dressed rich looking and fat in his late s watching baseball on tv tired after a long days work
he drinks from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl
hey dad moms on the phone telling her friends that youre hung like a light switch
dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch
jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer
oh daddy there he goes
he makes the reach and
both balls at the same time
one heck of a double play
eyes on the tv dad takes his hands out of his pants and sniffs them
and the sniff to finish it off
satisfied dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he continues to watch tv
we zoom out to see both mom and dad each through different windows
fucking freak show
dark and in silhouette jimmy flips on the camera by remote
its too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail but jimmys clearly having sex with a prostitute in his bed
she is young black and looks very much like a prostitute
as he pounds into her
do you like that nigger
come on nigger do you like it
humors him oh yeah baby i like it
by remote jimmy shuts down the camera
jimmys behind the camera interviewing the prostitute who sits up in his bed holding the sheets to cover herself
with the lights on we can see that shes clearly unattractive
jimmy asks his questions with a gentle confidence
what was going through your mind when i called you a nigger
this costs you an extra fifty
you can tell she just wants to leave but is toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks
well what did it feel like
it felt like nothing
what do you mean
you aint the first person to call me a nigger when we was fucking
not surprised oh
johns call me nigger all the time
especially white guys
just dirty talk
long awkward pause
jimmy doesnt know what to say
no reply from jimmy
what about you
you like calling me nigger
you get your nut off
then whyd ya call me that
have you ever wondered what it was like to treat someone so completely cruel that it was unthinkable
i was trying to do the unthinkable and unimaginable when i called you that
i wanted to see if was even possible for me to do that
jimmy speaks softly and confidently
i think i want to die
like i dont deserve to live anymore
and that i will never want to do something like that to someone again
the prostitute finds jimmys answer endearing
why ya wanna die
because everyone hates me
they hate me because i seek beauty and appreciate destruction
they hate my mind my thoughts my imagination
they hate everything about me
and i hate them
trying not to care really
everyone that knows or who has ever met me
your parents dont hate you
look at this room in this big ole house you got
my parents provide me with food and shelter because they have been conditioned by society into thinking its the appropriate thing to do
in reality they cant stand to be in the same room with me
theyre fascists brainwashed and unforgiving
contd they dismiss my feelings of ill regard towards them on simple rebelliousness of youth but thats only because they are patently and intentionally unaware of their own hypocrisies
prostitute looks bored frustrated again
accidental condescension do you understand me
you wanna know what i think
yes i really do
i think youre a spoiled ass white boy thinks you everything but you dont know shit
all you do is bullshit complain and theres folks out there thatd kill for all this
jimmy doesnt react
i dont feel sorry for you
calmly no one is asking you to
thank you for letting me film you
camera turns off
jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high school parking lot bleachers in the distance
school is letting out as he zooms in on judy
shes looking at the ground as shes taunted by a group of other harassing teenagers a tear streaming down the side of her cheek
suddenly judy is bashed in the face with a school bag
she falls to the ground then picks up her broken glasses as camera zooms out to catch the girl who hit her mean girl
nearby a big dumb looking bully type taunts her as she cries
his taunts are biting and as excessive as the mean girls then he dumps a cup of soda on judys head as shes crying
judy screams at the top of her lungs
the group runs off laughing
jimmy whip pans to the mean girl as she laughs with her friends then whips pans back to judy now on her feet blood running from her nose and onto
her white shirt
camera shuts down
a scene weve seen before
jimmy is off camera videotaping judy through her bedroom window
we hear him floggin the dolphin off screen while judy combs her hair in the mirror
she stops when she hears
a grown man walks into the doorway of her bedroom
this is judys dad
he comes in and doesnt say a thing to her
judy doesnt acknowledge him at all and continues combing her hair as though hes not even there
he comes up behind her then wraps his arms around her giving her a warm hug from behind
somethings not right
the masturbation sounds stop
judys noticeably uncomfortable but doesnt resist as her father begins kissing her neck
his hand slowly creeps down to her pelvic area his other hand turning out the bedroom light
the room goes dark
camera flips down then off
then comes back on again once again were looking through the camera pointing at the window but now its the distorted grainy black and white of nite shot mode
though we see the judys mirror and her dresser she and her father are nowhere to be found
whatevers going on between them its going on out of frame away from the view of the window
camera shuts down
jimmy films once again hidden camera style long lens from far away
frame is close on judy sitting at the dining room table
as camera pulls back we hear but dont see judys parents talking to jimmys mom and dad at the table
judy is bored completely uninterested in their conversation
so melissa talked gary into the sl instead of the seven series
i couldnt believe it
judy looks over at camera catching the fact that shes being videotaped
jimmy keeps filming
they paid way too much
as jimmy zooms in she clandestinely flips off the camera
i strictly buy american anyway
judy gets up
her mom stops her
where you going honey
as judy leaves the table she walks towards camera as it shuts down
judy sits on jimmys bed staring into the camera
shes uncomfortable sitting there
its poorly framed
can we start already
camera shuts off
jimmy films judy again better framing this time
judy looks annoyed and uncomfortable in front of the camera
who do you hate most in the world and why
kind of bitchy why
god i just wanted to come up here to say hi and get away from my parents bullshit for like two seconds and you have to put the stupid camera
in my face
jimmy takes delight in judys displeasure of being filmed
now were onto something
judy wants to go and then doesnt
youre weird jimmy
you were weird when we were kids and now youre just getting weirder
is that why you had a crush on me
scoffs yeah right
you didnt have a crush on me
judy fidgets hes got her
youre a loser
youre twenty one and youre still living with your parents
shes waiting for a response
jimmy doesnt bite
i heard that you got kicked out of college because you tried to talk your roommate into killing himself
whered you hear that
judys curious how hell respond
you wanna know the truth
he asked me if he should kill himself
i told him to look inside himself for the answer
i didnt tell him to
i didnt tell him not to
i said he shouldnt be afraid of the unknown
if he was going to kill himself i wanted him to do it for the right reasons
i swear to god youre a fucking psycho
like youre normal
more than you
if im such a freak what are you doing in my room
i was bored
jimmy waits assessing the situation
i wanna show you something
judy looks up at the camera
before she can answer camera shuts down
judy sits on the edge of jimmys bed facing a television set
jimmy films from behind her so he gets judys back and the television in the shot
the screen is static
i cant believe im doing this
judys getting antsy
offended turns to camera can you start the tape
jimmy clicks the vcr with his remote as judy turns back to watch
on tv static flips to black
dont think this means i like you or anything
a few seconds
nothing on tv yet
and as soon as this is over im going back downstairs
an image flips on the tv
someone jimmy has placed the camera on the ground and is facing a car in a parking lot at school
in bedroom thats mrs
shes your p
i hated her too
jimmy enters frame and punches a butterfly knife into the sidewall of mrs
holzclaws car sending air hissing as the tire sinks
and bill mcallister
i went to school with his brother
theyre both dicks
tape cuts to
on tv hidden camera style long lens from a distance the dumb looking bully type bill mcallister is taken out of school in cuffs into a waiting squad car
in bedroom i planted an ounce of weed in his locker then sent an anonymous letter to principal lipsky
same location different day
on tv again hidden camera style a girl is being rolled out of the school on a stretcher
its the mean girl the one who smacked judy in the face with her school bag
shes placed into an ambulance
i took care of her too
jimmy clicks the television set off with his remote
the tv is off
all we see is judys back
she hasnt once turned around to face the camera during any of the clips
she sits still
she trembles but doesnt turn around
she collects herself but still doesnt turn around
jimmy holds the camera steady
still she doesnt turn around
she fidgets in her seat but still doesnt turn around
she now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a trance but still doesnt turn around to face the camera
she begins to breath heavily
then no movement
she leans her head down towards the floor
then no movement
still no movement or any reaction for that matter
its like she is in a trance and cant wake up
continues to roll without budging
still no movement
it looks like shes about to turn around
she moves her head in the direction of the camera then assumes her original position facing the tv
still no movement
then judy collapses onto the bed
jimmy still rolling gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically
judy cries and cries and cries and cries
she then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul
the cry is long hard and loud
jimmy gets up then stands above her with the camera
she rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera
she tries to collect herself
why did you do that
i had to
i did it for you
i dont understand
judy tries hard to stop but just sobs harder and louder than before
please tell me
i felt like if i didnt save you then no one else would
screams please turn off the fucking camera
a muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs
what the hell are you guys doing up there
judy stops realizing suddenly that shes been screaming
camera shuts down
jimmys behind the camera
he stands at the head of the stairs shooting down
sounds of a dinner party just getting started come from downstairs
he walks down the steps into the party
a generic happy twentieth anniversary sign hangs above the front door
camera pans awkwardly to a lame k mart style studio portrait on the wall
its jimmys parents wearing saccharine sweet smiles dads hair slicked back mom in an overdone hair do and in way too colorful clothing
gifts sit on the entry way table
party guests are dressed nicely and are mingling in the house drinks in hand
dinner is yet to start
as jimmy moves into the
people at the party all turn to camera a look of shock on their faces as jimmy walks through
more and more people react with gasps and revulsion at camera but we cant tell why
jimmy moves camera to the
the place is full of more party guests
frame moves across a huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar
we catch a glimpse of jimmys image and realize
jimmy is completely naked and has painted his entire body camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run from the room
one of the female party guests screams
covers her mouth oh my god
jimmy keeps filming catching peoples reactions
he points the camera at a female party guest
hey great party huh
im making a tape for my parents
want to say something to them
female party guest is just too stunned to speak
jimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely shocked to see him like this
you want to say anything to yourself
jimmys dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over jimmys head body and the camera
all we see is black and flashes of light from under the blanket
muffled get out
cameras under the blanket as we hear jimmys dad pushes him from the room
camera shuts down
camera is being removed from the camera bag
as the lens pans quickly we catch a glimpse of jimmy smirking holding the camera
hes way too close to the lens
he flips it around until it locks on dr
walters mfcc jimmys not very accomplished therapist
walters seems to have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests hes the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to
he sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office
jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first session together
jimmy we discussed this
you cant tape our sessions
its not allowed
the camera doesnt move
you know you cant film someone who doesnt want their image and voice recorded
technically youre actually breaking the law
does your defiance make you feel more powerful
still no answer
filming people makes you feel like youre in control of the situation doesnt it
still no answer
i can sit here as long as you can
youre not going to be able to force me to participate in your little game here
no movement from the camera
jimmy this isnt something that friends do to each other is it
walters sits in front of the camera trying to stay perfectly still and calm
walters is so nice and so calm that we start to feel sorry for him
then holds still
then fidgets trying to stay calm
jimmy put the camera away please
youre wasting your time and mine jimmy
we could be doing something productive
the camera shakes a bit
walters is doing his best to stay calm
put it away
walters gets up and comes towards the camera
he grabs it just above the lens and tries to take it away
come on jimmy
a fierce battle of tug of war breaks out
we see dr
walters becoming increasingly pissed off
the back and forth is suddenly getting violent until
gimme the goddamn fucking camera
walters finally gets the camera free from jimmy
camera shuts off
jimmys behind the camera moving quickly down the hall to
judy is sitting on his bed
she sees jimmy come in with the camera and freaks out
im leaving i swear
judy gets up to go
as jimmy gets up to stop her camera shuts off
jimmy is filming judy who is sitting on his bed
her face is red her eyes have watered up and her nose is snotty and running from after an intense session of crying
jimmy is catching her seconds after shes has finally composed herself
say what you said to me before
i dont know how i said it
paraphrase it then
say it like you did before but it doesnt have to be exactly the same
you mean paraphrase it
thats what i said
i didnt hear you
judy stares off camera
are you ready
im waiting for you
tell me when
you want me to paraphrase it
judy thinks for a beat
i cant remember what i said
then just ad lib
judy thinks for a beat
i dont know what that means
getting frustrated it means make it up
confused do you want me to make something up or paraphrase what i did the first time
this isnt working
the camera drops from judy
lets take a break
camera shuts down
cameras on a tripod
jimmy sits in a chair the back of his shoulder foregrounds judy
im not good on camera
it makes me nervous
forget about the camera
talk to me
tell me what you said earlier
about me about how you felt when you saw the video
relaxes it felt like someone had been reading my mind
it was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected
now judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there
and earlier what you said about god
jimmy zooms in the camera by remote
off her look tell me
i said that it felt like god had sent someone to protect me and to look out for me
she looks at jimmy as if he is an angel
and i said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that
judy tries to stifle tears but theyre starting to flow again
as camera zooms in further judy catches sight of jimmys finger on the remote and blows her fucking top leaping from her chair
god i hate it when you film me crying
judy goes for the camera struggling to get it off the tripod she finally frees it and points it at jimmy
how do you like it huh
how do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass
cameras framed poorly moves around a lot goes in and out of focus etc
do you like it
i dont like it or dislike
im used to it
judy moves the camera directly in his face
the lens is millimeters away from his nose
we see an extreme close up of his nostrils
generally id place the camera further away from my nose but if this is your preferred shooting style then i guess ill have to adjust to it
jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens
hows this work for you
judy pulls back and continues filming him
give me a break
now judys the interviewer
her framing is not quite as adept as jimmys
why do you have to film everything
i dont film everything
why do you like to film me crying
then why do you
because its rare that i get to find someone that lets their emotions go
when a person is crying i mean truly crying or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping
for a few seconds or minutes i get a chance to see that persons soul
and really now that youve forced me to think about it
i think its a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity
judy is shaken and speechless
judys moved and forgets herself
camera drops from jimmy
jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him
jimmy sits still
judy doesnt know what to do with that
why do you think
judy doesnt have an answer
jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and turns the interview around
why you and why me
why are we together right now
judy doesnt know what to say
go ahead say it
i want you to
i know what youre going to say so just say it
soft tell me
bullies her tell me
judy fidgets again then
blows her top because were both fucking weird
the pressure of the camera from jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more
because were the two weirdest kids in the world
and god made us for each other and i fucking love you and you did all this because you love me too and fuck everyone and everything that doesnt get
judys out of breath
camera still points at her
thats right right
judy stares back at the camera longing for an answer from jimmy
she told him she loved him
camera shuts down
jimmy is driving in his car with judy in the passenger seat
judy has the camera and she is interviewing jimmy as he drives
where are you taking me
to a beautiful place
judy and jimmy laugh together
i cant tell you
itll ruin it
judy sulks for a second
jimmy can i ask you something
do you hate your parents
yes but i understand them
whats to understand
lots of things
i understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid life crisis
generally when an only child leaves the nest the parents begin reassessing their own lives
they see us as a younger better version of themselves
jimmy contd they feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval
they used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages but once we no longer need mom to nurture our bruises or dad to be our
hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question
how do you know all these things
when you dont have any friends dont play sports dont go out have no one talk to nowhere to go no one to listen to you or no one to
help you figure things out you sort of have to figure things out by yourself
and without any of those things i have nothing but time to think about stuff
you are so smart
you are so beautiful
judy doesnt know how to react
you think im pretty
i think youre the most beautiful person i have ever met
the most beautiful person in the universe
no one has ever told me that
get used to hearing it
do you think im smart
do you think im fat
how could you say that
i only way a hundred and ten pounds
oh im sorry
i thought you said flat
as in flat chested
i am not flat
judy smacks him
i dont have to prove it
judy is sticking her chest out for jimmy
he looks away from the road to stare her breasts filling out her top nicely
i still cant tell
i wear a full b cup
take em out
i am not going to take them out
you take yours out
its already out
judy tilts the camera down
in a flash we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of jimmys fly a smiley face sticker covers the head
the camera quickly shakes and spins off the image as judy screams bloody fucking murder
judy forgets the camera is on
she drops it into her lap fabric from her clothes covers the frame
we can hear jimmy and judy laughing hysterically
i cant believe you did that
thats why i did it
now come on
i showed you mine let me see yours
we hear the rustling of judys clothing
camera falls to her feet on the floor of the car
off camera judys nervously showing jimmy her breasts
give me the camera
please pretty pretty please with sugar on top
judy grabs the camera
its pointing in jimmys direction but she still doesnt realize its on
here ill pull over
jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the camera
jimmy frames up judy
let me see em
judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile
in the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra then pulls her shirt back down
that doesnt count
come on for real this time
you can trust me
judys not sure
jimmy looks into her eyes pouring it on
you can trust me with your life
judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope
judy gets the same sexy naughty smile and lifts up her shirt exposing the bra keeping it there
will you take off your bra
judy looks nervous but gives in
she unhooks her bra from the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she can
jimmy focusses the cameras attention on them
its too much for her
she quickly pulls her shirt back down
jimmy tilts up to a close up of judys face
struggling i just realized something
judys eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry
whats the matter
i just showed you my breasts and i saw your penis and we havent even kissed
she starts tearing up
you havent even asked me to be your girlfriend and i did that
im a slut
wiping her eyes i dont want to be a slut
jimmy sees shes crying
will you be my girlfriend
can i kiss you
will you turn off the camera
i want this moment to be captured forever
id rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life
judy leans towards jimmy then suddenly attacks him and shoves the camera to the side
they are making out exuberantly
the camera shakes and wobbles
we can hear heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the interior of the car
jimmy finally has the camera in position
he has one of his arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing
judys devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of way
whispers i wanna see your smiley face again
we see and hear judy whispering her lips placed gently on the inside of jimmys ear
whispering turn the camera off
turn the camera off
turn it off
camera goes off
judy films jimmy driving the car
he has a huge shit eating grin on his face
how do you feel
relaxed happy confident studly excited relieved delighted
i love you judy
very much so
i always have
long pause filled with sexual tension takes over
do you want to pull over again
of course he does
camera goes off
judy films jimmy as he fires a twelve gage pump action shot gun off into the distance
after each shot he pumps then fires again
are you getting this
jimmy fires another shot
his muscles are flexing as he pumps the gage
he looks extremely violent and determined
are you getting this
a very turned off judy replies
this is where you wanted to take me
yeah whats the matter
we can hear judy crying
the camera shakes out of control
i wanna go home
jimmy looks over towards the camera judy
he knows that hes fucked up and he feels like complete shit
jimmy walks over to her takes the camera and shuts it off
jimmy is standing in front of a mirror and is videotaping his own reflection
he is talking to himself and into the camera
dont fuck this up
please dont fuck this up
now he is pleading with himself
just try to be normal
screaming just be normal
god damn it why do you have to fuck everything up
he hasnt convinced himself
jimmy takes a breath then shuts the camera down
jimmy films judy who lies next to him in the bed
her face is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath
jimmy is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex
shes somewhat bewildered then she notices the camera
shes starting to get used to it
big smile hi
so how do you feel now right at this moment
judy just sighs basking in the afterglow
i dont know
trying that was soooo good
you were good
what got into you
i dont know
ive just really been wanting you lately
i cant say
now you have to tell me
it was after yesterday
jimmy is more than surprised
judy speaks as if she is going to reveal a big secret
very quiet and cute in her mannerisms
yeah it was after i saw you shoot that gun
you were crying
i wanted to kill myself after i did that
you were scared and you were shaking
it was the most awful thing i ever did
i didnt think id ever see you again
i was scared at first
i didnt expect it to be so loud and you looked so mean
but then i got home and started thinking about it
about how your muscles looked and how dangerous it all seemed
it made me like
all excited and like
judy looks for the right word
judy laughs with embarrassment
camera shakes as jimmy hands it to her
judy turns the camera back on jimmy as he leaps out of bed
where you going
jimmys bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom door
judy holds the camera as we hear jimmy in the hallway
he opens a closet door fumbles through it then busts back into the bedroom holding the shotgun he used out on the lake
jimmy zooms in on jimmys naked upper body as he stands in front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the trigger
obviously the gun is not loaded
that is so hot
my dad keeps it in his closet
jimmy gives judy the gun
now shes holding the gun and the camera
judy points the gun at jimmy
she lowers it aiming right at his crotch just below frame
now i see the appeal
give me the camera
judy hands jimmy the camera
camera moves and shakes as she hands it over
jimmy frames her up nicely
now we see judy topless pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera
what do you think of this
she brings the gun down then takes the barrel of the gun and places it between her breasts squishing them together covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between
do you like that
judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near her mouth
she starts rolling her tongue over the top of the barrel slowly and seductively then stops
it looks as if shes about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of the gun
that is so hot
as she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the gun then suddenly we hear a garage door open
jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed
its my parents
we are now seeing sideways rotated images of jimmy and judy panicking throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly possible
jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off
jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents bedroom
he has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the camera through the crack
jimmys dad enters the room
he has no idea that he is being filmed and that jimmy is in the closet
jimmys dad walks over to the dresser opens up the top drawer and pulls something out
its too dark in the room to tell exactly what hes pulled out but it appears to resemble some sort of undergarment
jimmys dad begins undressing then steps out of frame
after a beat he reappears
now hes wearing nothing but a sequined teddy
hes totally fat hairy and nasty looking
he sits on the side of the bed his back to us
now we see that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of fishnet stockings
he begins putting them on
when he is finished putting on his panty hose he gets up off the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror
he begins to gently stroke the sides of his legs relishing the feel of the hose over his hands and fingertips
he seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to get all worked up
he shakes his hips and dances around the room for a few seconds
now jimmys dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long brunette wig from the back of his top drawer
putting it on with the fishnet stockings sequined teddy and long wig he has transformed himself into the worlds fattest ugliest hairiest cher look a like
someone else enters the room
its jimmys mom and shes wearing a leather dominatrix outfit
are you ready for me you fucking slut
i dont feel like waiting
hurry up bitch
what do you have left to do
i just need to put on my makeup
as jimmys mom exits frame we see jimmys dad go to the mirror
he opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a little makeup bag
jimmys mom re enters now wearing a mini leather bikers hat carrying a riding switch
come on slut
jimmys dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to the bed
by the way jimmys parents are behaving its as if theyve gone through this routine a thousand times
jimmys mom drifts off screen as jimmys dad gets up on all fours
suddenly we hear a smack as jimmys mom hits jimmys dad on his ass with the switch
he lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues smacking him with the whip harder and harder
he yelps squeals and gyrates his hips back and forth then starts dry humping the air until she stops
jimmys mom comes back through and out of frame
jimmys dad pushes his belly into the bed groaning from the pain while he waits for her return
she comes back moving quickly across the screen wearing an enormous strap on dildo
disappearing out of frame again jimmys dad gets himself ready for her one more time ass up on all fours on the bed
from behind we can see her hand as she hikes her husbands dress up his back then we see his face and hear him grunt as she rips his fishnets
theres a pause
nothing seems to be happening but jimmys dad is bracing himself for something
his face tightens up
off screen jimmys mom has started mounting him from behind
jimmy cant take it any longer
as he slowly emerges from the closet his mom notices jimmy almost immediately
she jumps off her husband screaming bloody murder
cameras shaky but its easy to guess whats been happening
moms just started doing dad from behind with the strap on
what are you guys up to
jimmys dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting
he looks completely absurd screaming at jimmy wearing his sequined dress and wig
what the fuck are you doing here
jimmys mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at jimmys dad

no wonder hes a fucking psycho
look a his father
jimmys dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his wig
turn off the that fucking camera
turn off that fucking camera right fucking now god damn it
jimmy is loving it
gee dad what do you say the two of us go out to the front yard and throw some ball together
well have a nice friendly game of catch
jimmys dad attacks jimmy
he swings at the lens
hes one angry drag queen daddy
he begins strangling jimmy
you little mother fucker
turn off that fucking camera
jimmys mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating jimmys dad with it
judging from the punishment shes inflicting upon her drag queen husband the dildo apparently is made from the finest and heaviest of materials
youre going to kill him
jimmys dad lets go
the dildos doing the trick
jimmys mom keeps swinging the dildo at jimmys dad even though hes let go
you think you know me
you dont know me
you piece of shit
jimmys mom now directs her attention on jimmy
she screams at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the camera
you little beast
you want to film something
she continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and closer to the lens
the camera goes crazy
loud sounds are heard throughout the room
evidently jimmy has been tackled
we hear wrestling and grunting
it seems that jimmys dad has tackled jimmy or maybe his mom or both but the camera is too shaky to tell just what has happened
jimmys dad is still fighting
he seems to have them all pinned against the floor
hes crushing his mother
nancy nancy nancy nancy
please someone call me nancy
my name is nancy
crying hysterically nancy nancy nancy
jimmy please call him nancy for the love of god
call your daddy nancy
call him nancy
we hear jimmys mom screaming repeating herself
we see a hand go over the lens
jimmy and his mother and father are all in a wrestling match on the floor
jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera shakes
take me out to the ball game take me out to the crowd buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks
the wrestling match continues as we see more hands come towards the lens
jimmys mom suddenly stops screaming as if shes been knocked out
give me that fucking tape
i dont think so nancy
nancy nancy nancy
after some very intense fighting someone is finally able to shut the camera off
jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked just from behind judy through the woods
the camera shakes and rattles but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun
judy screams as she is being chased through the woods
she couldnt feel more free
she begins to tire and slows down
she can no longer run and turns towards the camera
as she turns around camera shows her from the waist up
she has a beer can in her hand and she is a little drunk
for the first time shes completely at ease with her own body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the wilderness
she walks towards the camera smoothly and seductively
her long hair blond hair blows gently in the wind
im so glad youre out
next time your dad wants to take it in the ass dont film him
ironic that i was the one sent to the nut house
i thought i was going to die without you
what if you and i could live here together
maybe not here but eventually well buy some land and we can live together on it and be naked whenever we want
she takes a big swig of her beer
what do you think
i think youre drunk
judy walks towards the camera
she puts her mouth inches away from the lens
i think youre right mister
judy giggles then dances around playfully in the woods
she has never felt so alive
i dont want this to ever end
i want to be here forever
i want to dance and be naked and be free and i want us to ball our brains out everyday and i want to feel the air on my body
and i want to get drunk and not care about anything in the world
i just want us to be together in this moment
i know a place like that
we can go there one day if you want
where is it
doesnt buy it erlanger
everybody was talking about it in the nut house
thats all anybody fucking talked about was this dude who lives up there named uncle rodney
he supposedly has a commune where we can do this kind of thing every day
uncle rodneys commune
judy smiles almost laughing
it all sounds pretty ridiculous to her but plays along anyway
playfully no im serious
judy walks back towards the camera and grabs it away from jimmy surprising him
okay now its your turn
shot from the waist up we now see that jimmys naked as well
hes at a loss as to what he should say
how does it feel to be a free man
a drunk judy is losing her patience
come on come on come on
just let it go be free
adoringly youre such a hippie all of sudden
judys not getting what she wants from him
camera shuts down
judy films jimmy
the camera is close and intimate as they lie on their sides staring into each others eyes
judy is still naked but is being shot in an extreme close up
jimmys still not up for it
judy grabs the camera and turns it on him
jimmys turns the tables
okay you really wanna hear something
jimmy takes a deep breath a touch of intensity flashes in his eye then
i want to go one day without masturbating
i want to liberate my penis
i want to clone you so we could have a three way and neither of us would be cheating
i want you to scrape my balls with a cheese grater
judy starts laughing
the cameras shaking
jimmy suddenly gets serious
and i love you
i love you so much it hurts
like god is stabbing me in heart with a thousand knives at the same time and youre the only one who can make the pain go away
do you love me that much
i love you so much id rather die than be without you
jimmy grabs the camera and points it at judy
make me a promise
the way a husband and wife make a promise
that we will be together always and forever
you mean get married
something more powerful than marriage
its a bond
its our bond
grabs the camera here
jimmy hands judy the camera as she starts to frame him up but theyre really engaging each others eyes over the top of the eyepiece
its transcendental because it transcends everything
life love law people things
a bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end even in death
if you swear on the bond it means youd rather die than break your promise
judy is moved
thats so beautiful
youre so beautiful
i want to love you forever
swear on the bond
swear well be together forever that youd rather die than be apart
i swear on the bond
and well never let anything come between us not even death
not even death
nothing will come between us ever
jimmy stares at her then slowly leans in for a kiss
a long wet toe curling kiss
jimmy finds a way to point the camera at the kiss
they break apart
judy sighs staring into jimmys eyes then leans into him his lips touching her forehead their eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love
well be together forever
whispers together forever
camera shuts down
jimmy and judy sit in a parked car outside of a huge grocery store
jimmy and judy sit outside a small grocery store
jimmy films himself
judys in the passenger seat
he does his best news announcer impersonation
this is action ten news reporter jimmy van muffmuncher reporting to you live from the parking lot of dicks grocery store where were going to witness the beautiful the talented
the amazing judy commit her first crime
jimmy flips the camera around onto judy
is there anything you would like to say to the public and your adoring fans before you go through with this
judy gleefully plays along
i just want to say that i look forward to losing my um
judy pauses to think
what did you call it before
your conformist crimeless virginity
judy snaps back into her role as interviewee
yes i am very much looking forward to losing my conformist crimeless virginity
i would also like to share with my fans these
judy lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra to the camera
in his reporter voice thank you and thank your tits for this rare behind the scenes look at your first crime slash moment of truth
judy leans in pops a quick kiss at the lens of the camera
jimmy shuts it down
jimmy is in a grocery store aisle filming judy from way far away
we can barely make out that it is her until jimmy zooms in tighter
she couldnt look more nervous or obvious
she is in the beer section
she quickly takes a six pack of canned beer and struggles to put it in her school bag
she walks quickly towards the exit
jimmy follows her and catches up
jimmy is standing next to her and he continues to film
judy looks so nervous
jimmy turn it off
were gonna get busted
no way this is the best part
a man is yelling at them off camera
hey you two
jimmy pans over and a store manager is standing in front of them
what the hell do you think youre doing
jimmy and judy have no reply
the store manager gives them his best intimidating stare
there is an extremely long pause
turn that damn thing off
you cant be running around the store playing with a camera
its against the store policy
now get out of here
camera shuts down
judy is looking at the lens of the camera
shes shaking and screaming
what is the matter with you jimmy
you almost got us caught
youre so worried about that camera
what is it
what is it
jimmy calmly and quietly explains
twenty years from now when were together watching these tapes youll realize how special this moment is
i owe it to you
and i owe it to us to capture everything and anything we do together
judy is calmed but still is pissed
well you freak me out sometimes
why do you have to tape everything
its like you have a problem or something
judys case isnt sticking
she treads lightly
you know most of the reason kids think youre so weird is because of it
why do you think everybody makes fun of you
and then i have to hear it and i have to deal with it
so everybody makes fun of me huh
cant you give the thing a fucking rest
and you dont want to deal with it
well fuck them and fuck you too if you think that
i couldnt give a fuck what people say
this is my life and i want to document it
and right now me filming you happens to be the only reason i manage to get out of my fucking bed every morning
you cant take this away from me
jimmy starts crying
judy takes the camera
she tapes jimmy who is sobbing
now she is the one who speaks gently
shes trying to give him a taste of his own medicine
how does it feel jimmy
how does it feel to have someone taping you while youre crying
jimmy doesnt answer
he tries to compose himself enough to speak
judy pushes harder
look at the camera and tell me how it feels
youre not getting it
it doesnt matter how it feels right now
jimmy contd what matters is that youre seeing whats inside of me and your taping it
can you understand that
judy doesnt know how to respond
i dont know
well can you at least try
jimmy is still crying
this weighs on her
i can most definitely try
and you can never ever ever ask me to not film you or anything we do
thats the only thing ill ever ask of you
will you swear to it
on camera will you swear to it
jimmy has talked himself into a good mood
before we hear judys response we
moments later jimmy is now taping judy
she has her right hand up like a witness about to be sworn into the stand
shes all smiles as jimmy gives her the oath to repeat back to him
please raise your right hand
judy raises her right hand
please repeat after me
do hereby solemnly swear
do hereby solemnly swear
that i will never ask request or even insinuate to jimmy to cease filming no matter the situation
that i will never ask request or even insinuate to jimmy to cease filming no matter the situation
and furthermore i do hereby solemnly swear to commit myself to giving jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that
he has become accustomed to
judy laughs then screams with embarrassed excitement
her laughter and happiness is infectious
she pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again
we can hear jimmy laughing off camera as well
keep your right hand up
judy lifts her right hand back up
she looks at the camera with a huge smile
i do hereby solemnly swear to g
someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of jimmys car
he pans and zooms the camera over and sees a car full of three teenagers laughing at them
suddenly the teenage driver of the car appears as if out of nowhere running to the passenger side
jimmy zooms out
the frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge loogie into the car hitting judy right in the face
the car full of three teenagers laugh hysterically at her expense
jimmy hands judy the camera
here youre definitely going to want to tape this
jimmy calmly gets out of his car as judy tapes him through the window
we can hear her breathing heavily as she tries not to cry softly off camera
jimmy has gone to the rear of the car
we hear the trunk open while judy films through the windshield at the car full of laughing teens
jimmy enters the frame carrying a baseball bat
we see him talking calmly to the driver of the car the kid who spat in judys face
jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with the bat
the kid falls over into the front seat of the car
jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins bashing in the windshield
to herself oh my god
now rage has taken over jimmy over entirely
hes bashing in the windshield with all of his might
the teenagers all go running from the car
a crowd starts to form in the parking lot
to herself oh god jimmy
jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves to the front of the car
he now begins smashing the other windows
now a sizeable crowd is formed
jimmy is seemingly oblivious to them and continues bashing the car
to herself i love you jimmy
now its to the point of overkill
but jimmy wont stop
its as if the rage hes been carrying inside of him his entire life is now coming to the surface
we hear sirens in the distance as jimmy continues to bash the car
the car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in the distance
judy begins screaming
jimmy stop please stop
oh god jimmy stop
god damn it fucking stop
he pounds the car harder as a police cruiser pulls up
two policemen get out of the car
they are temporarily paralyzed with indecision
we see one of the officers trying to speak with jimmy
he just ignores them
the policemen are oblivious to the fact they are being filmed
one of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in jimmys face
now jimmy is completely freaking out
we hear him scream but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed
one of the cops draws his gun as jimmy swings aimlessly towards them
he gets sprayed again with the mace and is now completely blinded
a huge crowd has now amassed outside of the grocery store
oh god jimmy oh god
now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars
lights are flashing all around jimmy
he is surrounded but sill continues to swing the bat
three cops tackle jimmy from behind
judy throws down the camera and runs out the door
the camera is face down on the seat
we hear judy get out of the car leaving the door open so we can hear the entire scene with much more intensity
the sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming
we hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are pulling up
more screaming and sounds on the radio is heard
we hear police chatter over the police radios were going to need an ambulance stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on route
more screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the car
we dont know who it is
they turn off the camera
judy is filming
she sits behind the wheel pointing the camera at the front door of a hidden valley mental hospital
she zooms in on a sign
judy flips the camera around to herself
i miss you
blowing a kiss mwaa
ill be waiting for you when you get out
be good and dont wait too long
look what i did for you
judy opens her mouth wide
shes got a tongue stud on her tongue
i cant wait to use it on you
camera shuts down
jimmys pulled forward to the drive thru while judy tapes from passenger seat
a voice squawks at jimmy asking for his order
can i get a double cheese burger no pickles large fries and a coke
jimmy looks at the camera
thats what i fucking missed more than anything
he turns back to order more
and a number two
the drive thru window voice rattles off a price and tells him to pull up
jimmy continues to camera
what did you do in there all day
jokingly you cheated on me
i want to be the only person responsible for making you cum
i hope youre willing to be on call twenty four hours a day
seriously what did you do
what was a day in the life of jimmy in the nut house
well besides masturbating i talked and talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied
but basically i told them what they wanted to hear
i said shit like
jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech
now that im finally able to talk about my problems i now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful to others
then i figured it out
i had to cry as much as possible
whenever someone would cry theyd call it a break through
so id be like
jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy
he looks directly into the lens
you start out slow then you build it up like this
now i know that using violence is not the answer
jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top with his self impersonation
then you go like this snaps back into the impersonation i was wrong i know i was wrong and ill never do it again
i dont want to hurt people or myself
jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry
boo hoo waaaaaa boo hoo hoo waaaaaaa
snaps out of it then you always give them the obligatory hug at the end
after a couple of weeks then they officially diagnose you with something give you a prescription then youre done
god youre a genius
jimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food
jimmy pulls away and parks
judy continues to question him as he goes through his bag of food
so what did they say you have
jimmy munches on some fries
oppositional defiance disorder
youre so lucky
i wish i was diagnosed with something
what does it mean
jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book s industrial spoof style
odd is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming pattern of negative hostile and defiant behavior which causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality
i love that
jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag
he then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got his order correct
jimmy playfully begins to act crazy
they fucked up my order
i specifically asked for no pickles
playing along oh no
how will odd boy handle this
will his odd brain be able to withstand a pickle screw up at the drive thru
jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character
he begins by taking the pickles off of his burger
he puts the burger down quickly lifts his shirt holding it up with his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples
ooow jeez theyre hot
i burnt my nipples with the pickles
judy cracks up laughing
jimmy takes a pickle off of his left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens
he then feeds it to judy
we hear judy chomping on the pickle and giggling off camera
the camera shakes then shuts down
judy is driving through the ghetto as jimmy shoots out of the window
on the sidewalk he catches glimpses drug dealers a crack whore a drunk stumbling along and other pretty sketchy characters
i love the ghetto
i dont know what it is about it
i fucking love it
its always the first place i go to when i get out
i love it when youre out of the looney bin
do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a while
joking if they dont send me to the bin maybe theyll send me to jail
this upsets judy
you act like its no big deal when you go away
tired of it all right
no its not all right
when youre in there i have to be out in the real world alone by myself jimmy
you go away and come back like its no big deal
well it is a big deal
i dont want to spend another day without you
do you understand me
id rather die
judys holding back tears
im not going back
she doesnt believe him
shes really starting to cry despite herself
he pulls his eye from the lens to look at her
judy looks over at him
i swear on my life and i swear on our bond ill never go back
her freak out subsides
if you swear on our bond then i believe you
judy lets out half cry and half yelp
her emotions are a bit out of control
i love you so fucking much
i love you too
judy looks like she wants to ask jimmy something
whats the matter
i was thinking the last time you got out we did it like five times like as soon as we saw each other we got naked and started doing it
and today my parents werent even home and i tried to do some stuff to you but you were acting like you werent interested
i didnt mean to
was it because you jerked off so much while you were locked up
jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey
she takes a sizable gulp makes a face then hands it back to jimmy
judy is getting upset again
voice cracking then why dont you want to have sex with me jimmy
you dont think im pretty anymore
no no no
that has nothing to do with it
after i saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother i kind of blocked it out but when i was in there they kept talking to me
and talking to me about it
now i cant stop it from coming into my head
every time i get wood the instant replay machine in my brain projects this image of my mom pounding into my dad
god thats awful
i didnt know
yeah well you know you didnt give too much of an effort to get in my pants anyhow
you just sort of made your sex face and grabbed my crotch
judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and smiles
how do you like this
while she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt
now were talking
judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame
she begins pushing one up then sticks out her tongue teasing
that is so hot
judy smiles and looks over at the camera
one hand on the steering wheel and one on her breast when
a loud thump hits the car shaking the camera
i think you hit someone
judys in shock
jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the car by the passenger seat
he forgets to turn it off
all we see is a close up of the floor and jimmys feet
jimmy gets out of the car
we hear the car door open then close
judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown
shes crying but in an extremely nervous and frantic way
calls to him oh my god what are you doing
we have no clue what jimmy is doing outside of the car
oh fuck oh fuck
oh my god
we hear a car door open and some struggling sounds coming from jimmy
dont put him in here
were taking him to the hospital
no well get busted
long pause we hear jimmy struggling off camera
what are you doing
hes not breathing
hes not fucking breathing
you can feel them thinking
is he dead
has decided pop the trunk for me
what are we gonna do
i dont know right now but were not driving around with a dead guy in our back seat
i just want to go home
jimmy lets leave him
we should just go
pop the fucking trunk already before someone sees us
we hear judy pop the trunk
we hear jimmy struggling
the camera is still on the floor of the car
more struggling as jimmy is clearly outside putting the body into the trunk
to self i want to go home
we hear jimmy slam the trunk
screams frustrated fuck
we hear jimmy come around to the drivers seat and open the door
we hear judy get out of the car and walk around to the passenger side and open the door but she doesnt get in
judy doesnt respond
are you gonna fucking get in
judy is hysterical
we should just leave him here
we cant leave him in the middle of the fucking ghetto
get in before someone sees us
judys losing it
i dont want him in my fucking car
i want him out
before jimmy can respond we see the reflection of police lights
red and blue lights flicker against the lens
we hear judy get in the car and close the door
its the fucking cops
just shut up
its the cops
its the cops
jimmy kicks the camera
we still cant see any of this
we can only hear whats happening
you gotta play it cool okay
judys crying gets louder
stop fucking crying
please im begging you
we hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door
hes getting out of the car
weve got a dead homeless guy in our trunk and hes
oh my god jimmy hes walking towards us
just be cool
the cop is close we can feel his footsteps coming towards the car
judy collects herself as best as she can
the cop taps his flashlight against the window
we hear judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice of the cop
license and registration please
the light from the cops flashlight reflects off the floor of the car and into the lens of the camera
the reflections stop
the wait is unbearable
could you please step out of the vehicle
jimmy gets out of the car as judy trembles in the passengers seat
we only hear the sounds of judy sniffling and repressing herself from crying and idle chatter of the cops radio
it seems like forever then
the car is shaking we hear intense struggling going on outside
judy unleashes a piercing high pitched scream
more violent struggling is heard as judy begins to hyperventilate
a gunshot is fired
another shot is fired
the car door opens jimmy gets in
we hear the sounds of tires squealing and the engine roaring
judys now totally freaked
just shut the fuck up
i dont fucking want to talk about it
jimmy cant bully her into silence
she continues to freak out
the camera is kicked
camera is kicked off and shuts down
a weird digital black and white image plays on the camera
theres no light and jimmys got the camera back in nite shot mode
hes standing outside of the car filming the homeless man who is lying dead inside of the trunk
judy stands next to him as he films
the homeless man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in the small confines of the trunk
jimmy pans back and forth and up and down his dead body
what are you doing
its obvious im filming
you cant see anything
its on infra red
do you wanna see
no i dont wanna see
he really is
theres a certain serenity to death i appreciate
hes in my car jimmy and he stinks
i wanna go home
jimmy keeps filming
i dont think i can do this
jimmy ignores her
im not like you
i cant do this
holds back a sob i wanna fucking go home
yeah well you cant fucking go home
and you will do this
you did do this
you killed him
you didnt get in the car until the cops showed up
now we dont have a choice
you want me to go to jail
you want that
jimmy is out of breath
the sun is beginning to rise
the light of a new day cascades upon the dead body in the trunk
half crying what are we going to do
we just need to make intelligent decisions
well find a way to take care of it
then well go away
well fix it
itll be okay
jimmy has dropped the camera away from the homeless man
hes still rolling while he wraps his arms around her and holds her
we hear him kissing her softly
its gonna be okay
im gonna take care of everything
camera shuts down
we see and hear a huge roaring fire
jimmy has zoomed the lens in so close that we cant tell what it is thats burning
as he pulls out its revealed that the dead homeless guy is roasting in the fire
coughing oh my god
the hair burning is making me nauseous
judy coughs more violently before
yeah god damn
burning bodies fucking stinks
that bums body odor is being cooked right off him
jimmy pokes the flaming skull with his stick
jimmy pokes some more at the body then flips the camera up at judy
im not in the mood

the cameras on its on

and he doesnt like cops so hes not gonna call em
now gimme a smile

judy begins coughing
i cant get sexy with that smell
i just cant
camera shuts down
music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as judy dances with dinko late s a completely drunk trailer trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit
empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to a ridiculously low ceiling
judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with dinko who is dancing like a complete dork
dinko has no moves rhythm or beat whatsoever but dances with as much vigor as a dog on crack
jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front of him
dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to be heard
he looks directly at jimmy noticing that jimmys turned on the camera
the video man
i remember that shit when we was in together
said you video ed everything
hey man its cool if you guys stay here for a while but i have a small business to run man
theres going to be some people knocking on the door and shit

i got a shit load of crank dude that shit is off the fucking hook
here take a hit
dinko tries to hand off some crank to jimmy
no thanks i just want to film judy dancing
jimmy pans the camera over towards judy
shes doing her best sexy dance into the camera
we can still hear dinko talking to jimmy
if i tell you to stop taping though man you gotta stop
i got some hard core junkies coming over here
sometimes if they see shit like that they fucking flip
crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man
theyre fucking hard core mother fuckers

this one guy got paranoid about something
he used to climb on his roof to take a dump
thats the only place he would shit
how fucked up is that
dinko laughs at his own joke
youre not even paying attention to me jimmy
judy takes her dancing up a notch to get jimmys attention
dont i look sexy
jimmy doesnt get a chance to respond
yeah you look real sexy baby
dinko starts in with jimmy again
hey i may have some work for you if youre cool with that
jimmy turns the camera back to dinko while he goes to the kitchen to get a beer

dinko high fives jimmy and laughs again
re judy so is she like your girlfriend or are you guys just fucking
shes my girlfriend my best friend and yes we fuck

judy is frustrated with jimmys lack of attention
jimmy turns the camera to her
shes starting to do her best impression of a stripper dance
its all good man
i aint gonna touch your old lady
shit man shes so into you anyway
dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area crossing the frame
jimmy focusses the cameras attention on various items in the kitchen while dinko talks
theres ripped open small electronics and appliances everywhere as if dinkos been taking everything apart and trying to put it back together
so theres this dude
fucker taught me everything i know about meth and shit
hed fucking flip for your girl man
you should go up and see him
hes in erlanger
camera drifts across several messy piles of papers and cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them
yeah uncle rodney
you have an uncle rodney baby
judy is too stoned to realize that jimmy has already told her about uncle rodney
jimmy pulls out to include judy in the shot
shes in the kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top
i want to meet your uncle
hes not my uncle
hes not anybodys uncle
people just call him that
hes the one i told you about from the nut house
as judy bends down to snort her line camera drifts over to dinko whos holding a huge hillbilly wad of cash in his hand and stuffs it into a box
jimmy zooms in on the cereal box
theres a whole bunch more cash in there
i said one day id take you up to erlanger one day remember
when was that
dinko throws the cash on the table
jimmy zooms out catching judy in the frame
when we were naked
were always naked jimmy
judy wipes powder from her nose then goes foggy for a split second losing then catching her balance
re crank fuck
woah thats cool

judy steps into frame
at this point shes in her bra and is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera
you like this jimmy
theres a knock at the door
calls out to door yo
to jimmy customers call
judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while dinko goes to the door
judy finishes her bottle of beer
shes pretty drunk and cranked out at this point
dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer
we cant see her and we can barely hear what theyre talking about but it seems dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with her
he yells back into the living room from the front door
is your girl into chicks
i dont know
to judy are you into chicks
do you want me to be into chicks
calls to her sure dinko
bring her in
dinko brings in hazel a frightfully thin crank addict
shes scared nervous and completely strung out and she looks like death
they stand off to the side of the room watching judy dance
judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing
jimmy zooms in on the woman
looking closer we see that hazel is in the final stages of her life addiction
shes sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull
dinko turns the music down so they dont have to scream
you know what never mind dink
i dont think judys into chicks
yeah im not into chicks
well hazel here will do anything we want

hazel nods her head yes

hazel is trembling
the party atmosphere has come to a complete halt
shut up you fat fucking junkie and take your clothes off or you aint getting shit
hazels not moving
dinko smacks her square in the face
screaming just do it you fucking whore
hazel starts to take her clothes off reluctantly
jimmy doesnt do anything
he just keeps filming
jimmy stop him
hes a big boy he can do what he wants
this gives dinko an added boost of confidence
hazel is now in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them
ever made a porno

well all right

you guys are free to join in whenever you like
judy is now borderline hysterical
i swear to god jimmy if you let him go through with this ill never talk to you again
jimmy ignores her
are you going to fuck her or are you just gonna talk about it
dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can
hazel begins to cry as dinko pushes her into position on all fours
to jimmy hows this
you getting good camera angles and shit
turn her ass towards the camera
laughing it up take off them panties bitch
come on bitch
judy is crying profusely in the background as dinko pushes hazel to the ground
jimmy zooms in on dinko framing out hazel as dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind
just like that
dinko looks directly at the lens of the camera
were going to be doing this shit all the time brother
you think so
dinko sees something o
from jimmy we cant see that surprises him
you dont have to hold a gun to her head man
theres plenty of other chicks we can do that to
if thats what youre into then fuck it ill
dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto hazel
jimmys shot him
judy has stopped screaming
hazel on the other hand is freaking out trapped under a squirming dinko
jimmy sets the camera on top of something stands up and brings the gun to judy
judy doesnt know what to do
jimmy puts the gun in her hand
finish him off
he deserves a bullet right in the fucking face doesnt he
judys in a weird cranked out place
nervous cranked out yeah
then do it
judy points the gun at a still squirming dinko
she cant bring herself to pull the trigger
we can hear dinko choking on his own blood
he struggles to move towards judy
jimmys now standing behind judy
he wraps his hand around hers helps her point the gun and
shoots dinko right between the eyes
jimmy helps her again
two more shots into his chest jimmys hand still wrapped around judys over the gun
jimmy lets go of her hand and the gun drops to the floor
jimmy comes towards camera and shuts it down
a rip roaring fire burns from the trailer
jimmy is shooting out of the back of the dinkos car a beat up old station wagon as they drive away down the gravel road
good bye dinko mother fucker
thanks for letting us borrow your car and for the cash
and for the crank
jimmy sits back into his seat and turns the camera on judy
shes got a big smile on her face
you feeling good baby
i feel calm
i dont care about anything
jimmy keeps filming
what are we going to do with the car jimmy
give some of it away
anywhere we want to go
she turns and blows a kiss towards the camera oddly serene from the drugs despite everything thats happened
to her its as if all is right with the world
camera shuts down
jimmy is standing on the altar waiting for his bride to be
he is wearing a white tuxedo with black tie and ruffle shirt like ricardo montalban from fantasy island
they are being married by an elvis impersonator and the witnesses groomsmen are siegfried and roy look a likes
jimmy waves to the person who is working the camera
the elvis impersonator talks to jimmy
you know the videos gonna cost you twenty extra right
well alright then
lets get this sum bitch started
elvis reaches down and gets a guitar and breaks into an elvis version of here comes the bride but to the song you aint nothing but a hound dog
weeeeeelllll you aint nothing but a young bride
walking down the aisle
the elvis impersonator goes all out with the dance and the gyrating elvis hips as he jams on his acoustic guitar
jimmy motions to the camera to turn around
here she comes
you aint nothing but a young bride
walking down the aisle
the camera whips around and we see judy walking down the aisle
tears of joy run down judys heavily made up face as she walks
well if you dont marry jimmy then you aint no friend of mine
judy makes her way over to her side of the altar next to her bridesmaids two cher look a likes
elvis is looking for judys name thats been scribbled on paper
and here we wrote our own vows
he hands elvis a small piece of paper who skims it
he kind of shakes his head smirking at what he reads then decides to go for it
elvis gives a quick windmill strum to his guitar and starts
do you judy promise to always swallow to never cut your hair or have another mans penis injected into any part of your body for as long as you both
the cher bridesmaids giggle
do you jimmy promise to always fuck judy with enthusiasm to take a shower once a day and promise not to inject your penis into any part of another persons
body as long as you both shall live
can i get the rings
siegfried gives the rings to jimmy who places one on judys finger and vice versa
with the power vested in me by the great state of nevada
i do herby pronounce you husband and wife
you may kiss the bride
jimmy and judy grab each other by the ass and begin making out
the freak show audience claps while they are making out
the applauding dies down but jimmy and judy continue to make out
jimmy puts his hand up her dress as she begins unbuckling his pants
it looks like they may start fucking on the alter
elvis jumps in to break it up
all right you two
we got a schedule to keep
camera shuts down
jimmy is running through the motel room with the camera
flashes of snorted lines of crank dust and rolled up bills are in the background as jimmy moves through the room
we hear judy screaming with excitement about something on the
hurry up jimmy hurry hurry hurry shit jimmy
youre going to miss it
jimmy settles camera on the television
on tv jimmy and judys high school year book pictures are on the screen
an anchorman is mid sentence talking about jimmy and judy
press conference in a few moments
the suspects names are james wright and judy elizabeth oaks kellen
no its not
im judy wright now
sing songy like a little girl im judy wright now
from burlington kentucky are wanted for questioning in the alleged murder of a hamilton county sheriffs deputy that was killed two nights ago while on patrol in the over the
rhine section of cincinnati
on a very serious note the producers here at kpx tv would like to warn you that the images we are about to show are violent and graphic in nature
and may not be suitable for young children
once again these are the images that were taken from a video camera that was mounted on board the patrol car
viewer discretion is advised
judy gasps involuntarily as
jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at judy to get her reaction
her eyes are locked on the screen
judys face drops
we on the other hand are dying to see what shes looking at
jimmy swish pans back to the tv and zooms in tight
the television fills the frame
on screen we see something completely new
its a black and white security cam style video image
just as the announcer described this is the kind of image that comes from a video camera thats mounted on the inside of a cop car
its static and covered with date time text etc
on tv we finally get a chance to see what transpired when jimmy and judy were pulled over
judy is standing outside the cop car
the moment she sees it approach we see her freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and suspiciously
the cop gets up gets out of the car and goes over to the driver side to talk to jimmy
after a few moments he summons jimmy out of the car while judy waits
the cop asks jimmy to open the trunk
he doesnt have his gun drawn but he is being cautious one hand on his gun holster the other shining on jimmys face with a flashlight
on tv go ahead and open it
jimmy stands by the trunk of the car but hes not really obeying the cops commands
the cop is getting suspicious
we can barely hear what theyre saying to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by
theres an unintelligible exchange then
the cop steps forward raising his voice
on tv put your hands on the vehicle
on tv on the vehicle now
the cop and jimmy are sort of at a standoff
jimmy finally leans over and puts his hands on the trunk
the cop comes in close to jimmy pulling his hand from his gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt
at that exact moment jimmy makes his move leaping for the cop
he takes the cop to the ground and off screen
all we see is a barely decipherable image of judy freaking out in the passenger seat because she cant see whats going on and neither can we
about seconds go by
a gunshot is fired
it feels like an eternity then
jimmy pops up off the ground
hes got the cops gun
he hesitates not knowing what to do
he pauses hesitant then shoots down towards the ground where the cop is lying out of frame
he runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat
theres a moment of hesitation as jimmy and judy seem to be screaming at each other in the car then
jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the distance
the image on the tv cuts away and back to the anchorman
the anchorman speaks to camera as
jimmy pans up to judy hoping to record a reaction
shes locked on the tv her hand over her mouth frozen not knowing how to react
she turns and looks up at him
i didnt want us to be apart
judys starting to tear up
shes emotional conflicted
she cant believe he did that for her but shes also just come to the sober realization that he killed a cop in cold blood for her
they know who we are now
making light actually were famous now
judy kind of half smiles
she hadnt thought of it but shes still trying to digest the images until
thats the most romantic thing ive ever even heard of
a voice catches judys attention from the tv
its an attorney type at a press conference being held by jimmys parents
on tv have a few words and then well be taking questions
judy looks back at the tv
oh my god thats my parents
and your parents
jimmy pans back and we see
jimmys mom and dad with a chiron at the bottom of frame
theyre at a podium with judys parents standing stoically in the background
jimmys mom starts reading a prepared statement
on tv we are very shocked about recent events
our son has always been a dear sweet boy who is sometimes confused but we want him to know that we love him very very much and just want this
whole thing to be over
judys dad steps up to the microphone
despite the truth he sounds genuinely concerned
jimmy if youre out there we know youre scared but youre only making it worse
please bring judy back to us
we really miss her terribly
jim walks over to the tv and
jimmy proceeds to kick the living fuck out of the tv
it smashes against the wall and falls to the floor
camera shuts down
jimmy is filming the both of them in the mirror
judy stands above him with noticeably different hair
she has obviously given herself a homemade dye job complete with blonde black and punk pink streaks
judy has an electric clipper and is about to shave jimmys head who is sitting in a chair below her
shes really getting off on this and chuckles as she starts to lower the shaver to his head
wait a second
i just want to look at myself one last time with hair
judy is smiling and cant wait to get started
ok thats enough
she starts in again
whats the matter
im not sure about this
i changed mine
yeah but you look fucking great
this was your idea jimmy
lets do this thing
judy starts the shaver back up and proceeds to shave jimmys head
she starts right down the middle
hair falls into jimmys face as judy slides the buzzer from front to back
jimmy now has a reverse mohawk
he laughs at himself along with judy
this is the look
judy then shaves the entire top of jimmys head giving him the quintessential male pattern baldness look
he looks ridiculous
joking lets just leave it like this
dont be stupid
judy shaves the rest of his head and now jimmy is completely bald
jimmy checks himself out in the mirror
i am one ugly mother fucker
judy is stroking the top of his head with her hands
it feels funny
jimmy gives it a feel for himself
he sticks his pinky in the side of his mouth
i look like dr
judy laughs then kisses the top of jimmys head
lets go across the street and get a shit burger
jimmy shuts down the camera
in a booth at the motel diner judy is filming jimmy while he stuffs a burger into his face
youre such a fucking pig when you eat
jimmy opens his mouth full of food and comes towards camera
im not taking you to the country club ever
that didnt quite sit right with him but he covers it up with a mock pout while he chews
did i hurt your feelings
jimmy wont respond playful
ill take you to the country club
jimmy looks up smiling
i dont know
jimmy keeps chewing
thanks for marrying me
youre my prince charming that came and swooped me off me feet
the irony is thick
bald lanky year old jimmy with a mouth full of food looks like anything but prince charming
and one day were gonna have a house and a white picket fence and a baby
tell me what you think we should name the baby
jimmy stops smiling
she really believes thats going to happen one day
jimmy doesnt want to answer
while he thinks
something out the window distracts him
grabbing camera give it to me
jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what hes looking through the window
finally we see
two florence county sheriffs cars with their lights flashing are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel
jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars
what are they doing
the cops walk up to one of the doors to the motel room
four florence deputies stand outside the motel room door ready to bust it in and raid the room
jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner wont hear them
theyre outside our room
oh god jimmy
they know where we are
were going to get caught
florence deputy knocks on the door waits a beat then busts it down
three florence deputies move in with their guns drawn
to self lets go
jimmy forgets to shut the camera down
he holds it by his waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the diner
follow along with them camera by jimmys side mostly pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the window
they head out the door to the
action continues the camera still rolling without jimmy realizing it
they run at a fast clip along the parking lot as they head toward
jimmy slides into the driver seat and throws the camera onto the dashboard
we see jimmy behind the wheel as they drive out of the parking lot
hes in freak out mode afraid as hell theyre going to be caught by the cops
they dont see us
just shut up
let me think
jimmy keeps driving his eyes darting back and forth between the road the rear view mirror and judy
are they coming
i dont know
i dont think so
jimmy looks back up into the rear view mirror still not satisfied that theyre not being chased
i dont think theyre coming
jimmys still not certain
he looks for a while
then he sighs
it seems that he knows theyre not coming
relief oh fuck
to judy that was close
jimmy drives for a bit then notices that the camera is on and pointing at him
he reaches forward and
camera shuts down
jimmy films judy who is sleeping in the front seat of the car
jimmy gently wakes her
hey baby wake up baby
time to get up little fuck nugget
judy opens her eyes
the first thing she sees is jimmy filming her
judy smiles like an infant who sees her daddy for the first time after a nights sleep
judy very childlike opens her arms for jimmy to hug her
jimmy leans over camera in hand and gives her a hug
the camera shakes and goes out of focus as hes hugging her
good morning mrs
and how are we feeling this afternoon
judy looks around and is a bit disoriented
where are we
its a surprise
i want you to drive us in
i want to film you when we get there
big smile okay
camera shuts down
judy drives up a gravel road as jimmy films
they travel through the back roads in northern kentucky
its nothing but woods outside the window
what am i gonna see
jimmy doesnt answer
i hate it when you do that
judy drives some more
the camera is bouncing as they drive across dirt roads
judy tries to maintain her composure but she cant contain herself
how much further
judy bites her lip and drives
slowly she comes around a bend as they arrive at
judys eyes go wide
oh my god
is that it
jimmy doesnt say anything
he just keeps the camera trained on judy
by the look on her face what shes seeing looks pretty cool
is this where your friend lives
jimmy points the camera through the front windshield
now we see what judy was seeing
about thirty trailers all along the waters edge
it looks like a commune for run away teenagers with crank addictions and budding wannabe drug dealers
the kids are throwing a combination party barbecue and drug festival
this is where we live
if you want to
for a little while
judy doesnt respond
she just drives
her eyes are starting to well up a little bit
shes getting emotional
this is sooo amazing
its like a dream
judys on cloud nine
the place has exceeded her expectations
judy keeps driving as we see young people all more or less the same age as jimmy and judy
some live in trailers some in tents
they watch as jimmy and judy drive in
clearly new faces are of interest to them
go over here
out the window they approach another trailer
clearly this trailer is more important than the others
outside a dorky looking douche bag type buddy s talks to some of the younger people in intense language
they all look over to see jimmy and judy approaching
you can hear the excitement in jimmys voice as judy stops the car
jimmy hands off the camera to judy who retrains it on the buddy and the wunderland teenagers he talks to
jimmy gets out of dinkos car and heads up to him while judy films
we dont hear the conversation between jimmy and buddy man but clearly hes happy to see jimmy
buddy gives jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or an old friend
its all smiles between the two of them
jimmy comes running back over to the car
is that uncle rodney
no thats buddy
he said rodneys been expecting us
were like celebrities or something judy
he wants to meet you
camera shakes as judy starts out of the car
camera shuts down
buddy is standing outside of a piece of shit trailer
hes the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give jimmy a hug in the previous scene
hes surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best to make jimmy and judy feel at home
jimmy films as buddy gives them a walking tour of the group of trailers by the river
judys with them as well
we got like thirty five trailers here
long as weve got some thats empty you can stay in one
sometimes people come in and we got get you a tent or fuck everybodys friendly you can always find a bed to crash in
jimmys panning around the landscape
people are watching them walk with buddy
its almost as if theyve got some kind of celebrity status because theyre with him
it dont look like much but we do some pretty good partying around here
yall are welcome to stay as long as ya like
fuck it you can stay forever
theres only two rules
dont mess around with the labs which are down back there
jimmys panning again but buddy grabs hold of the lens
no filming that shit
thats part of rule number one
buddy contd dont even go near there with the camera and two is no cops but fuck seeing what kinda shit you guys got into i dont think we gotta
worry about you calling em up for a visit
buddy laughs at his own joke
other than that yall can do whatever the hell you want whenever the hell you want
you wanna do some of the stash at the parties thats cool too
wed like it if you do it normally wed say you gotta sell some too but rodney says yalls is a special case cuz you aint leaving til the heats
off for sure that could be months or
shit years for you guys
but no one up heres in a fucking hurry
jimmy pans around capturing the natural beauty and picturesque scenery of the camp
look at you
little bitch from the nut house and you got yourself one sweet looking bride
i still cant get over the tits on this girl
to judy come here sweetheart
jimmy pans back and catches an image of buddy as he grabs judy and puts his arm around her
were gonna have a party for yall tonight
you know that
we have parties damn near every night but this ones gonna be special just for you guys
to judy you like that sweety
buddys squeezing judy just a bit too tight
to jimmy nice piece of ass you got here
best you keep an eye on it so it dont wander off on ya
theyve arrived at a trailer
jimmy pans back up at the trailer thats going to be theirs
from the outside its a disaster peeling paint and cracked windows
buddy gets in front of the camera reaching for it
yalls on your honeymoon
aint gonna film it yourselves
buddy pulls the camera from jimmys hand and points it at jimmy and judy
jimmy looks a bit uncomfortable though he tries not to show it
shaky amateur camera style as buddy zooms in on judys chest closing jimmy out of frame
lets go inside
shouting hold on
camera shuts down
buddy films from the inside their completely destroyed trailer
jimmy stands at the entrance with judy in his arms about to carry her over the threshold
theyre waiting for buddys cue
and three two one
jimmy walks in through the doorway with judy in his arms
buddy is exuberant
he hums the bridal march badly as they come in
look at the happy couple coming into their new home
wedding march da da da dum
buddy looks down at the camera right into the lens
how do you turn this thing off
after a beat camera goes off
jimmy is filming sally a very sexy and very stoned year old girl wearing sunglasses and cowboy hat
she speaks with a heavy southern accent
just give your love to uncle rodney and youll get it back ten times
dont be afraid to love him and youll learn to love yourself in return
hell teach you the cycle how were all connected
if you give yourself freely and completely to him youll have nothing to worry about
thats what i did
camera shuts down
jimmy is filming random teens at a barbecue
jimmy is interviewing sam a long greasy haired nineteen year old wearing a heavy metal t shirt
we see people partying and hanging out in the background
sam is drinking beer from a can smoking a cigarette and looks like he hasnt showered for a couple of days
hes happy to be jimmys video subject
yall are going to love it here man
sam motions behind him at the people partying
this shit goes on every day
i been here for six months man and i love it
thank god my parents kicked me out
all you got do is listen to uncle rodney and youll have the best fucking time of your life
big dopey grin and dont fuck with him cuz hell kick your ass
sam laughs at his own dumb joke
jimmy shuts off the camera
jimmy films a naked judy swimming in the river the reflections of the water obscuring her body
shes free cleansed relaxed enjoying the sun and having the time of her life
she suddenly notices the camera
jimmy come swimming
the waters warm
judy smiles then slips her head under the water coming back up with a smile
she looks up at him
i just want to look at you now
she smiles an oh so sweet smile
because you look happy happier than youve looked in a long time
judy smiles even wider
she floats towards camera while jimmy zooms in on her smiling face
as she comes closer
she splashes towards the camera trying to get jimmy wet
camera shakes as jimmy hops up to avoid be splashed
camera goes off
faint moonlight comes into the trailer from outside
jimmy is filming judy as shes just gotten into bed
she sees the cameras on
so you like it here
judy smiles again
how long will they let us stay
its up to uncle rodney
judy smiles at the thought of rodney
whats he like
i never met him
hes supposed to be cool though
weird as hell
well if hes weird hes great weird whatever he is
judy contd if we could stay here forever like buddy said i wouldnt need anything else
judys looking right over the lens into jimmys eyes
the cops wont come will they
buddy said rodneys cousins the sheriff or something
do you want to meet him
surprised the sheriff
lights up can i
im gonna see him tomorrow
buddy says he wants to talk to me
maybe he wants to talk to you too
i dont know
buddy said he thought you were pretty
oh my god
judy puts her hand over her mouth
she cant believe it
i told you you were
youre the prettiest girl in the world
judys on such a cloud nine high shes almost in tears
she wraps her arms around him and squeals with delight pushing the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with kisses then squeezes him tight like shes going
to squeeze the life out of him
she whispers in his ear
whispers i love you jimmy
head to toe shot on jimmy
buddy well find out in a second is behind the camera
jimmy looks at a trailer off screen
hes excited a little off center and a little nervous
buddy tries to film jimmy as hes walking towards rodneys trailer
i would be
hes suppose to be cool
hes more than cool man
god you really dont have a clue do you
jimmy stops for a second
judy wants to meet him
i dont know if i can ask
dont have to
shes one of his girls man
shell meet him
jimmy stops in his tracks and looks at buddy
what the fuck does that mean
just like youre one of his boys
shit man ill give you two weeks and youll want her to experience him
you may even want to too
jimmy looks at buddy not quite sure what to do with any of it
buddy senses the tension
just go see him
here take your camera
buddy extends the camera lens forward
we can see jimmys puzzled look
he wants you to film him man
with the camera
hell tell you when to turn it on then you video
jimmys puzzled but he reaches forward and takes the camera shutting it down
images of uncle rodney going in and out of focus as he sits on the side of a king sized bed
scars and tatoos litter his arms and neck
his eyes are bit maniacal like charles manson but hes able to maintain a stoic but nonetheless dangerous demeanor as jimmy begins setting up the camera
like a prison inmate or rabid dog you get the feeling that uncle rodney could explode on you at any second
jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the interior of the trailer
its an elaborate triple combination of a middle eastern harem sixties psychedelic motif and white trash junk yard memorabilia
just out of frame we hear a female voice crying softly whimpering
the voice is close in the room with us but we cant see whos making the sounds
uncle rodney ignores it completely
camera shakes indicating that jimmy is exceptionally nervous
just one second
take your time man
i want you to feel comfortable
more importantly i want you to get this right
finally the camera stops shaking
jimmy zooms out to a medium shot revealing that uncle rodney has hazel lying next to him on the bed with her head on his lap
uncle rodney gently strokes her hair like hes petting a dog
hazel in the midst of extreme withdrawals cries and whimpers like a child oblivious to jimmy the camera and everything else in the world except for uncle rodney
she is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she can barely speak
im ready whenever you are
uncle rodney looks down upon hazel
just a second
i have to take care of my baby
uncle rodney admires his work
shes beautiful isnt she
begging pleading please
hazel entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic episode can only gasp in unintelligible spurts
some people come here too far gone
like hazel here
the only thing i can do for her is ease her pain
hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed all the while keeping her head in uncle rodneys lap
to hazel shhhhh
how about a baby one
uncle rodneys tenderness in dealing with hazel calms her
hes having way too much fun treating her like a baby
uncle rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic bag of powder
he then places it to hazels nostril
she quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger
to hazel there you go
hazel begins whimpering again
it wasnt nearly enough to satisfy her
theres something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person
addiction is pure
addiction reduces a person to an infant
and theres nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant
he puts his finger to hazels nostril again but this time without any meth on the tip
she snorts with all of her might then starts crying
uncle rodney is toying with her
hazel is no longer an adult
shes an infant and im the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk
its a role that both of us have accepted and embrace
he leans over and grabs a syringe already filled then gently holds hazels arm and expertly injects the liquid into her vein
nothing happens for several seconds
hazels breathing accelerates
suddenly she sits up her eyes go wide
hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a roller coaster
proudly thats my girl
then she makes eye contact with jimmy
a curious frightened look comes over her face
clearly she recognizes him
she suddenly jumps from the bed and runs out of the room
shes a little jumpy
uncle rodney smiles amusing himself with his own joke
lets begin shall we
im going to use this tape for my fans so lets try to get this right
i apologize if any of this frightens you or makes you uncomfortable
ill be fine
you wont be fine
what im going to teach you will be frightening
the truth is an acquired taste but once you get to it its all youll ever want
uncle rodney starts in on his mantra
its obvious that hes well versed in his meandering rant
those kids out there
we the so called undesirables you and me we know the truth
you know that society doesnt want you your parents dont want you corporate america sure as fuck doesnt want you
you wouldnt be here otherwise
uncle rodney contd if this government had a choice theyd gas us all in a heartbeat exterminate us like the jews enslave us like niggers cuz dont kid yourself we
are the new niggers in this country
no one respects us
no one sees what we have to offer
no one has compassion for us
they dont care or theyre too naive to see that were a by product of a wasteful society that has failed to educate embrace influence or inspire any of us
were societal garbage
the counter culture no longer exists
its been replaced by us long pause
the garbage culture
thrown aside imprisoned institutionalized systematically abused executed and enlisted into wars started by government ass fuckers just to kill us off
just to kill us off
and every week one of you shows up here disillusioned addicted angry pissed cuz they tossed you aside
into the garbage
every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker
until the them and the they of this country run out of places to put us to put its garbage and the garbage over flows into their cities from out
of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us
a pause then
biblical and we will set fire to their world
and we will burn it until a living hell reigns over what was their former world and we will fornicate in their ashes
rodney stops almost out of breath
thats whats here for you
thats whats here
rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as jimmy begins zooming out
uncle rodney lights a cigarette to calm himself
jimmy keeps filming not knowing whether rodney is finished or just taking a break
camera shuts down
someone buddy is filming a raging party consisting of a lot of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones jimmy was interviewing before
its certainly a weird bunch
they all look alike dress similar and have the same type of crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions
most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums
they all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be allowed
camera pans to jimmy so we realize that hes not filming
our best guess would be that its buddy whos filming
jimmy screams at the camera over the noise of the bongo drums
buddys hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit
we now see jimmy see judy
she dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of other drunk happily intoxicated teenagers
say what you might about the attendees to the event this party is a fucking rager and judy is happy to be the center of everyones attention
everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat faster and become more intense
its an all out jam session
jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing around judy
camera follows him with a zoom as he does
who knows how much later
minutes or hours the party rages forward
the camera spins around
the party has reached a new level of drunken absurdity
most of those who are dancing are drunk stoned or both
in the background while its too dark and hectic see anything explicit some of the teenagers are engaged in a variety of sexual activity
some have threesomes
some are probably having oral sex
still others dance around them in the foreground
camera zooms in on uncle rodney
standing just behind him we see of flash of someone recognizable
its a skinny woman she looks vaguely familiar but its hard to get a fix with all the craziness going on
she turns her head to look over at rodney
now we can clearly see that this person is
hazel with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of rolling on crank
and shes saying something to uncle rodney thats definitely pissing him off
bodies wipe the frame
camera catches judy who hasnt missed a step along the way to being a high drunken mess
the rhythm of the drum beats is ever present
uncle rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her shoulder saying something to her but we cant hear it over the noise
jimmy approaches and they start talking
jimmy doesnt notice but there are about four or five of the kids especially a couple of rodneys bigger guys standing not too far behind uncle rodney watching the conversation
its really difficult to put your finger on it exactly but something doesnt seem right here
uncle rodney lets go of judy and puts his arm around jimmy
with the noise of the drums and the fact that were zoomed in from a distance we cant hear anything theyre saying
now uncle rodney and jimmy are having a conversation as they move towards the camera
though jimmy cant see it we can see that rodneys bigger guys the ones that were standing behind uncle rodney are now pushing judy along behind jimmy and rodney
though uncle rodney seems to be having a very light and friendly conversation with jimmy we continue to get the feeling that something ominous is afoot
finally they approach camera and we can hear them
im so glad you guys came down here
we never would have guessed youd come and see us
youve been awesome
judy loves it here
uncle rodneys got jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed side hug
i knew she would
by the way
rodneys face drops
i know what you did to dinko
this hits jimmy like a lead weight
before he can react at all and before he realizes that anything is happening jimmy is suddenly thrown into a headlock by uncle rodney
off camera something similar is happening to judy
screaming what the fuck are you doing
judy screams his name over and over
laughing shut it bitch
judys been hit by buddy off screen
camera shuts down
we hear intense struggling and laughter
by the sounds we hear we gather that jimmy and judy are being dragged off into the woods against their will by buddy and rodneys bigger guys but its too
dark to tell if that is what in fact is happening
someone unidentified is running the show and operates the camera
its impossible to see but its definitely buddys voice
here here here
judy is screaming and crying
two or three guys its too dark to tell start laughing
screams please somebody help us
jimmy grunts trying to break free
shut up asshole
you wanna fucking talk
somewhere in the darkness jimmys been kicked in the gut
the camera hits the ground
it lands right in front of jimmy
we can still barely see whats going on but were close enough and theres enough flashes of light from flashlights to see that jimmy is face down and bloody
defiant fuck you
jimmy gets kicked again just once
then suddenly a barrage of kicks come at jimmy one after the other after the other
leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at jimmys face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly
the process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds
we cant tell how much damage has been sustained but jimmys not moving
hes either unconscious or dead
with one last kick the camera is knocked aside and we dont see jimmys face anymore
is he fucking dead
jimmy say something
they mock her in a high pitched wining voice
jimmy say something
get her clothes off
judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as we hear them tearing at her clothes
then they pick her up and start pulling her away from camera
her screams get quieter and quieter
fainter and fainter
extremely faint jimmy
finally theres silence
the camera isnt moving
its on the ground and in the dark
camera shuts down
its completely pitch black dark
we can see nothing
we can only hear the sound of jimmy fumbling around and breathing heavily and nervously
suddenly we see everything albeit in a weird black and white grainy fashion
jimmys flipped the camera into nite shot using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see in the complete darkness
hes strapped the camera to his wrist
the image is jimmys pov as he searches through his trunk for something
pulling aside a duffle bag we see the mm pistol that jimmy stole from the cop
he grabs it as camera shuts down
by the fire pit the site where the teenage drunken of orgy took place the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens of drunken passed out teenagers lying
on the ground in sleeping bags and in tents
jimmy begins looking for judy with his night vision camera
he sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag with her back turned to the camera
her hair is identical to judys but we cant see her face
jimmy quietly steps over passed out teenagers being extremely careful not to awaken anyone
jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes a loud clanking sound of glass on glass
jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking up
no one does
jimmy continues to walk towards the girl who looks like judy
kneeling directly in front of her jimmy puts his hands on her shoulder and pulls the girls front region towards the camera
the girl flips over
its not judy
and luckily the girl is so severely intoxicated that she doesnt wake up
jimmy now makes his way over to a tent
he quietly unzips the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the inside
turns out the person in the tent is just another passed out flunky loser
jimmy quickly takes his arm out of the tent
jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for judy among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground
jimmys not too far from uncle rodneys trailer
he decides to make his way up
he walks using his nite shot to see through the sea of bodies until he gets up to the entrance
theres a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile by the entrance
jimmy steps around it turning the lens at the glass
he briefly catches his reflection
he looks like hell warmed over freshly bruised and cut from the recent beating
moving forward jimmy makes it to the front door of uncle rodneys trailer
we hear music coming from inside
very slowly and very carefully jimmy cracks the front door
its even darker inside of the trailer but jimmy presses forward in spite of that fact still using his nite shot to see
a boom box sits by the bed still on playing music
jimmy is scared shitless
in the corner of the room in a make shift bunk is uncle rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a spooning position
theres no doubt this time
its definitely judy
they are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying together
jimmy slowly walks over towards them
each step is slower and slower being extra careful not to wake them
once jimmy is within arms length of the two of them he stops
he hesitates for a moment
he hasnt prepared himself for this particular situation and doesnt know exactly what to do
he continues filming them until he finally musters the courage to extend his non filming arm out to tap judy on the face
judy remains unconscious sleeping as jimmy gently taps the side of her cheek
jimmy slowly begins tapping harder and harder until the tap evolves into a poke
an arm comes out of nowhere and grabs jimmys poking hand
jimmy has woken up uncle rodney
the camera shakes out of control
uncle rodney screams at the top of his lungs who the fuck
intense and furious wrestling ensues as uncle rodney flies out of frame then in a split second a gunshot goes off
we hear a uncle rodney collapse followed by more gun shots
the camera has fallen from jimmys hand and dangles by the wrist strap
camera comes to rest on
jimmys shot and killed him
outside footsteps hit the deck
buddy opens the door of the trailer
three more rounds are fired hitting buddy square in the chest knocking him down
jimmy points the camera at a dead buddy on his back then whip pans it back to judy in the bed
finally we hear jimmy speak
judy judy wake up
fucking wake up
outside we hear voices of some of rodneys other teens
jimmy acts fast
judy has been drugged and is mostly unconscious and groggy but jimmy picks her up and gets her on her feet shouldering her out the door
shot continues to
we hear faint voices
a distant gunshot fires but we cant see what is going on
its too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to
another distant shot then jimmy gasps in pain
hes been shot but decides to run trying to carry a groggy judy anyway
their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and bullets whizzing by them
one hits dinkos car
jimmy opens the door then places the passed out judy and the camera in the passenger seat climbs over her throwing the camera into judys lap
we see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear a bullet hit the drivers door
the car starts and jimmy throws it into gear flooring the gas as he speeds away
judy wake up
jimmys voice begins to crack as he talks to tries to wake up judy
are you all right baby
please wake up judy
we dont know if judy is dead or alive
jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the camera to the floor as camera shuts down
close on judy
the afternoon light strikes a shadow across her face
her hairs a mess
come on honey
i saw you waking up
judys eyes flutter
there ya go
judy opens her eyes
she smiles when she sees jimmy behind the lens
am i with you
youre with me
she smiles wider
then im okay
camera shuts down
judys got the camera trained on herself
she talks like a child
judy points the camera up at jimmy
this is the first time weve seen him at all since he was beaten up by uncle rodneys group
hes a wreck
his face is puffy
his lip is cut up
his eye is swollen
he looks like a flyweight boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight
he drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage
jimmy looks like a beaten man both physically and emotionally
his bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma are seemingly non existent
for the first time we are seeing jimmy without his armor
he looks like any other year old kid who is down vulnerable and confused
not to mention the fact that he has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder
not the camera
it reminds me of when we first met
just you me and the camera
god do you remember how you used to freak me out
yeah those were the good old days
how much money do we have
i dont know why
how do you feel about canada
are we going together
jimmy looks over at her
i think i should take you home
judy doesnt answer
i could write you a letter
or i could make a video saying i made you do everything
theyd believe you
you could tell them it was all my fault
you could tell them i was going to mexico and id really go to canada
we swore on the bond wed never be apart
jimmy contd ill let you out of it
if you want to be out of it ill let you out
youre never leaving me and im never leaving you
thats all there is to it
judy leans in and kisses him
judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him
she likes looking at him through the lens
youre so handsome you know that
jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up
then his eyes get droopy and close
hes not responding
hes as punch drunk as you can get
jimmys obviously in a concussion induced daze
the car starts to drift
judy drops the camera on the seat as we hear her leap forward to take control of the car
snaps to what
jimmy stop the car
youre too fucked up to drive
camera shuts down
there isnt much talking going on
you wanted to ask me something
do you love me
you know i do
the car drives
judy just cruises along music playing on the radio
looks in the mirror but keeps the camera trained on her
you know i love you right
what do you mean
look in the rearview mirror
judy looks up immediately
her face drops
jimmy flips the camera around out the back window
theres a ohio state trooper with its lights flashing tailing them
a lone trooper is on his radio
thats it baby
judy doesnt answer
shes short circuited
just pull over
its not worth it
judy holds still for a second not saying a word
the cop car chirps its siren
judy looks up
judy what are you doing
you know this is
dont do this
judy looks up into the rearview mirror
her eyes are welling up
she looks out the front windshield
jimmy senses that she sees something
he flips the camera around through the front only to see a row of cop cars blocking the highway up ahead
he flips the camera back at her
freaks shut up
judy looks straight ahead determination on her face
she wont answer
she turns the wheel hard to the right almost carrying jimmy into her and takes the car onto a side road
i love you
i love you too
judy is on her own mission
the car stops short
jimmy turns the camera to point out the windshield
the road has come to a dead end
its a dead end
judy ignores jimmy
she throws the car into reverse and tries to turn it around and head back the way she came
a faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the background
do you hear that
judy doesnt respond
come on its over
ill do what i said before
ill tell them i made you do it
itll be okay
i want us to be together
screams well we fucking cant so pull the fuck over
yes we can
i wont give you up
i wont let you go
jimmy pans the camera out the front windshield
in the distance we catch sight of a road block thats been set up at the end of the dirt trail
theres nowhere to go
judy doesnt answer
she still doesnt answer
then the car thrusts itself forward
judys got a look of determination in her eye
judy what are you doing
judy doesnt respond
shes murmuring something to herself that jimmy cant hear or understand while she has the throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock
judy keeps going
jimmy flips the back camera towards her
judys murmurs grow louder
jimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the roadblock
suddenly judys murmurs get loud enough or us to hear
murmurs well be together
well be together
well be together
well be together
they head straight in between two cars that form the roadblock
cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on into
impact sends the camera flying against the windshield
sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy
camera settles on judys face bloody unconscious against the steering wheel her neck snapped eyes open in a death stare
camera stays focussed on judy for the longest time as she leans against the steering wheel
music plays on the radio
its johnny cashs cover of tom pettys i wont back down
overhead shot of a news helicopter flying above the final scene
looking down from above we see what the helicopter sees a scene of about twelve state trooper cars lights flashing with jimmy and judys car wrecked
ambulances are there
jimmy and judys lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as johnny cashs song shifts from background to score
the helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song continues and we
