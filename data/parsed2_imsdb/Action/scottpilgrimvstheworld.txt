scott grins heroically
scott winks at knives

back in the kitchen everyone looks at scott

young neil unpauses his nintendo ds

the doorbell rings
scott smiles broadly

stills shuts the door on a confused knives

stephen stills quickly opens the door and waves knives in
knives enters looking around the rehearsal pad with awe bare bulb ratty rug drums guitar bass lame brand amps

scott throws knives coat on the floor
hi sorry what was your name

knives stares blankly at young neil who finally gets it
im not in the band
i just live here
sex bob omb has geared up
amps hum to life
lets start with launchpad mcquack
thats not the actual title of the kim bashes the kit and sex bob omb explode into rock
guitar titles continue over the song as the small rehearsal space seems to grow with the music
stephen stills barks unintelligable lyrics
knives watches jaw ajar
the song ends feedback lingering
scott bids adieu to a stunned knives as she gets on a bus
i cant even
sex bob omb
the band and young neil lounge around stephen stills room
she seems nice

scott if your life had a face i would punch it
i mean are you really happy or are you really evil
like do i have ulterior motives or something
im offended kim
scott takes a breath turns to young neil
neil you were saying she seems awesome
yeah she seems awesome
scott hangs his coat up in a tiny one room apartment
he turns to wallace wells dark hair arched eyebrow disloyal
before you hear some dirty lies from someone else yes im dating a year old
wallace looks up from the now magazine hes reading
is he cute
ha ha ha ha
does this mean we have to stop sleeping together
do you see another bed in here
tiny boxes of text indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat belongs to wallace futon included
youre totally my bitch forever
the whole seventeen year old thing
dont tell too many people
hey you know me
dont tell my sister
you know me
wallace tosses the now magazine aside starts texting
who are you texting
the phone goes
scott picks up
seventeen years old
intercut with stacey pilgrim cute peppy barista gabbing on her cellphone in the second cup
a sign behind her reads if you are using your cellphone you will not be served
thats not true
who told you
that gossipy bitch
you know me
scott turns to see wallace on a second cordless
wallace clicks off
scott sinks into an armchair
who is this mysterious child you date
her name is knives
a seventeen year old chinese schoolgirl
its a catholic school too
with the uniform and everything
yeah the whole deal
oh my god you havent no no no
we havent even held hands
i think she hugged me once
why are you doing this
i dont know
its just nice you know
its been over a year since you got dumped by she who will not be named
scott glances down at the partially obscured now magazine looking into the hot girls eyes on the back cover album ad
so are you legitimately moving on or is this just you being insane
scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times
can i get back to you on that
a school bell clangs loudly
wallace and scott stand outside a catholic high school
uniformed boys and girls pour out
i do not want to be here
this school has boys too
i hate you
even i would think twice about dating a seventeen year old
well shes only allowed out when the sun is up so i wouldnt call it dating more like
that doesnt sound so good either
knives skips to scott
her shy friend tamara lingers behind
hey knives this is my cool gay roommate wallace wells
do you want to know who in my class is gay
does he wear glasses
wallace you go now
wallace pulls knives close
youre too good for him
scott and knives play ninja ninja revolution think a martial arts version of dance dance revolution
they punch and kick in unison side by side
did you know the original name of pac man was puck man
you would think its because pac man looks like a yellow hockey puck but actually it comes from the japanese phrase paku paku which means to flap ones mouth open
they changed it over here because puck man is too easy to vandalize
you know scratch out the p and turn it into an f or whatever
knives flips over scotts back in a combo move
the game ends
continue appears counting down
scott looks at knives
she digs for quarters
oh i got it
scott and knives leave a pizza joint slices in hand
tamara is into this korean guy bobby but everyone thinks bobby has a crush on mina
i thought derek and tamara had a mutual like each other thing going what happened
scott and knives shop for t shirts
hangers click in time
i dont listen to much music
i know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever but you guys rock
i knew i personally rocked but i never suspected that we rocked as a unit
thank you knives
scott and knives flip through records in perfect sync
i mean you guys are gonna be huge
well were already pretty big
but it might be cool if cool people wore our t shirt
knives speaks to a female clerk surly with tats and specs excuse me do you have anything by the clash at demonhead
have you tried the section marked the clash at demonhead
thank you julie
are you coming to my party friday or will you be busy babysitting
thank you julie
you dont want to listen to her
and you definitely dont want to listen to them
scott puts the clash at demonhead cd back in the rack
oh i heart them so much
i hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life
but thats just me
envy adams is sooo cool
do you read her blog
sorry you were saying about me
scott and knives amble down a snow covered sidewalk
i mean ive
ive never gone out with someone so talented
you go out with a lot of guys
yeah so whatever man
ive never even kissed a guy
knives blushes and looks at the ground
scott hugs her
scott and knives walk up to the front of wallaces apartment
so this is your secret lair
can i come in
my secret lair is one of those no girls allowed deals
but do you want to see the house where i grew up
they literally walk across the street to a small house
here you go
the light snowfall turns into sand
scott wanders alone through a barren land
he falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus
a mysterious girl rollerblades across the shifting sands
she wears fishnets an army jacket skirt and goggles
her pink hair is funky but cool
she is hotter than the desert sun
youre not alone
youre just having some idiotic dream
does that mean we can make out
but shes gone
scott wakes up sitting up in the futon
wallace wakes up to the left of scott rubbing his eyes
what is it scott
i had this totally weird dream
what is it scott
a scruffy goateed guy wakes right between scott and wallace can we skip the dreamtime
color me not interested
but there was this girl
was this an envy related dream
we dont use the e word in this house
no it wasnt her
it was somebody new
yay for that
other scott goes back to sleep
wallace rubs his eyes
speaking of new werent you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half hour ago
its like six in the morning
scott opens the bathroom door
sunlight ignites the room
scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library
he carries a stack of books for knives
libraries remind me of grade school
that must seem like a reeeeally long time ago
lets talk about something else
the hiss of ball bearings catches scotts attention
he freezes as he sees the rollerblading girl from his dream skating towards the desk in sexalicious slow motion
do you know that girl
the rollerblading girl delivers a package from amazon
ca to the librarian
scotts gaze follows the girl as she blades out of the library
pensive guitar underscores his thoughts
scott continues to stare at the girl
time slows to a crawl
scott stands in the rehearsal room head still in the clouds
you only played one note for that entire song
my hand slipped
is your girlfriend distracting you
a meek knives sits next to young neil on the couch
ill be quieter
lets do that one again
sorry what are we doing
i told you like fifty times
scott kim pine stephen stills and young neil walk down an icy toronto street
scotts head is still in the clouds
were going to this party retard
i thought you guys split
but you know there may be some label guys there so
this is going to suck
at least it will give us something to complain about
a bored scott stands next to young neil in a very crowded house party
both have red plastic cups in hand
im going to go pee due to boredom
scott exits frame
i have to pee
neil sips his drink
scott passes by comeau a bespectacled hipster geek hey comeau
some party huh
you gettin your drink on
this is coke zero
i dont drink
you dont drink
i remember you getting ridiculously drunk off two g ts one time and comeau you know everyone right
do you know this one girl with hair like this
scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of ramona
someone said she was coming tonight actually
you got the hots for her
i hear shes hardcore
scott has already left a scott shaped dust cloud
scott scans the party
his eyes go wide
he crushes his plastic cup
there she is
playing the wall
scott sidles up and stands next to her
hey whats up
hey you know pacman
i know of him
scott begins to babble
well you know pac man was originally puckman but not because pac man looks like a hockey puck and paku paku paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it
because if you scratch out the p and turn it into an f
yeah thats amazing
am i dreaming
ramona looks at scott blankly
he slowly skulks away
ill leave you alone forever now
series of quick shots as scott follows ramona
he ducks around corners spies from behind a much bigger dude
ramona leaves the party
scott grabs a startled young neil
scott runs towards comeau
what do you know about ramona flowers
all i know is shes american
but you should talk to sandra and ladydudes
what do you know about ramona flowers
i think she has a boyfriend
some guy back in new york
doesnt she have the most ridiculous name
its so ramona quimby aged and yet
the girls laugh
scott does not
jump cut through a flurry of faces as scott asks everyone i heard she kicks all kind of ass
shes on another level
shes got men dying at her feet
shes got some battle scars
not to be entered into lightly we end on the surly julie the rude clerk who steps in front of scott arms crossed
stephen stills is with her
what about ramona flowers
you know her
she just moved here
got a job with amazon
comes into my work
does she really
didnt you say she just broke up with someone jools
did she reeally
that they had a huge fight or whatever
did they reeeally
but i didnt want scott to know that stephen
yeah i dont know what it is about that girl she just scott i forbid you from hitting on ramona
even if you havent had a real girlfriend in over a year hey whoa whoa
scotts mourning period is officially over
hes totally dating a high schooler
dating a high schooler is the mourning period
shes got a point
i thought you guys broke up
i dont want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party scott
we all know youre a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk
that time with lisa misunderstanding
that time with hollie not what it looked like
that time you dumped kim for hey me and kim are all good now
scott looks to kim
we hear the sound of arctic winds
whatever ramona is out of your league lets leave it at that
and anyway im not even sure she really did have a big breakup
she keeps mentioning some guy named gideon
yeah i dont know what it is about that girl she just forget it scott
scott lies on the futon wide awake
wallace storms in
guess whos druuunk
i guess wallace
you guess right
wallace flops onto the futon landing next to scott
so that girl
from my dream
i saw her at the library
can i pretend were talking about a guy
so then im at this party and hey
there she is
there he is
i think shes
you think hes
i think shes the girl of my dreams
then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend
ive never been so sure about something
then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend
im not getting it friend
wallace drifts off
intercut with stacey sitting on a bus on her cellphone
youre thinking of juggling two chicks
well you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend
who told you
hes not even conscious
you of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on
dont you have a job to do
i should send out a mass text about this
scott looks to wallace who is out cold cellphone in hand
wallace how do you do that
hard cut to morning light filling the room
wallace sits bolt upright
scott sits at wallaces computer
whats the website for that
i have to order something reeeally cool
youve got mail
this thing claims i have mail
its amazing what they can do with computers these days
now im reading it
im so happy for you
pilgrim it has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon
my name is matthew patel and im blah blah fair warning blah blah
this is boring
scott walks to the front door
are you waiting for the package you just ordered
its the weekend
it wont ship until monday at the earliest
scott jumps to his feet
you were saying
scott opens the door
its knives chau
knives smothers scott
he plasters on his best fake smile
remember you were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half hour ago
how could i possibly forget
scott and knives flip through the record bins out of sync
yearbook club is getting so boring
i cannot believe the music they put on while we work
knives buys a hip and trendy jacket
scott sits on a couch next to the do not sit sign still distracted
hannah broke up with alan and now shes all into derek
scott and knives walk out of a pizza joint
knives chows down on a slice
scott doesnt eat his thoughts elsewhere
but tamara claims she has dibs on derek
i tell ya
scott and knives play ninja ninja revolution side by side
scott plays halfheartedly his timing off
knives goes to flip over scott but he messes up
the mirror image of scotts videogame avatar appears on screen
uh oh neganinja
neganinja squares up against scotts avatar
i can never get past that guy
scott has his little videogame head cut off
countdown comes up
do you want to keep going
scott takes a long look at knives
um i think
scott takes a deep breath
this is never easy
game on everybody
an excited stills addresses sex bob omb
scott tunes his bass alone by the window staring out
i got us a show
knives bursts into frame
wednesday the rockit
and even better
its the t
the toronto international battle of the bands
this guy at work was like steve do you know anyone in a band
and i was like im in a band and he was like youre in a band
and i was like yeah im totally in a band great story man

only a record deal with g man graves

indie producer of the millennium
stills gestures to knives home made sex bob omb t shirt
if we win
it wont just be knives wearing a sex bob omb shirt
itll be the cool kids too
knives can barely contain herself
she grabs scott
i will do everything i can to get out of study group and come
we follow scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom
oh my gosh who are you battling
crash and the boys
that one band with crash
and those boys
yeah thats the one
i hate them
oh my gosh i hate them too
yeah they suck
scott pees in a state of dreamy reverie
the pee bar above his head slowly reduces
he stares at himself in the mirror
scott exits the bathroom entering
a long empty high school hallway
scotts footsteps echo as he moves towards a classroom door with a star on it
ramona flowers bursts through the door skating past scott and down the hall package from amazon clutched in her hand
scott runs after her around a corner down a row of lockers leading to
the outside of wallaces apartment
scott leaps out of the futon and runs towards the front door throwing it open and startling ramona flowers just as she presses the doorbell
hi um i was thinking about asking you out but then i realized how stupid that would be
do you want to go out sometime
um no thats okay
you just have to sign for this alright
i just woke up and you were in my dream
i dreamt you were delivering me this package
is that weird
its not weird at all
no its just like youve got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that i like to use
its like three miles in fifteen seconds
i forgot you guys dont have that in canada
you dont remember me do you
i met you at the party the other day
were you the pac man guy
that was some total ass
i was the other guy
youre ramona flowers right
so youre like american
why am i coming off as rude
not at all
scott stands in awe of ramona
she gives him a pen
you need to sign for this
whatever this is
its something really cool
youd be impressed
you still have to sign
but if i sign for it youll leave
thats how it works
okay well can we just maybe just hang out sometime
get to know each other
youre the new kid on the block right
ive lived here forever
there are reasons for you to hang out with me
youre all over the place
you are like
my dream girl
i need to find a new route
either that or you need to start hanging out with me
you want me to hang out with you
if thats cool
if i say yes will you sign for your damn package
scott finally signs on the dotted line
and throws the package straight in the trash
scott finds ramona waiting at the top of some stairs in the park
the toronto skyline gleams in the night behind them
why are you just standing there
dude im totally waiting on you
sorry i just assumed you were too cool to be on time
you assumed wrong
so what do you want to do
we could get a slice at pizza pizza or flip through some records at sonic boom
oh or theres this awesome game called ninja ninja revolution at im not into simulated violence
im cool with whatever you want to do
this is good
scott and ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park
this is good
so howd you end up in toronto
just needed to escape i guess
i got this job here
and gideon had always said toronto was one of the great cities so
is he your boyfriend
was he your boyfriend
do you mind if we dont get into that right now
its so not interesting to me
they sit on some swings in the park
so what about you
what do you do
im between jobs
between what and what
my last job is a long story filled with sighs
i know plenty of those
is that why you left new york
it was time to head somewhere a little more chilled
well its certainly chilled here
chilled as in cold
im totally obsessed with you
i didnt mean to get you obsessed
i just havent been obsessed with a girl for a long time
thats probably because you sleep with a guy
i was guessing from your apartment but you totally do
were just poor
we cant afford two beds
were not gay
wallace is pretty gay
i believe you
youre too desperate to be gay
i feel so stupid
youre probably not that stupid
laughing ramona hops off her swing
well youre definitely stupid if you want to go out with me
the snowfall gets heavier
this is ridiculous
isnt it like april
i can barely see you
this whole thing is an unmitigated disaster
i think act of god is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date
so this is a date eh
did i say date
slip of the tongue
the snow gets heavier still
ramona walks away
anyway nights not over yet
i think theres a thingy up here somewhere
i cant see you
a door with a star on it appears out of the whiteness
ramona opens the door
scott and ramona fall into blackness
scott shivers at the kitchen table of ramonas cozy girl friendly apartment
he watches as she slips out of her coat
what kind of tea do you want
theres more than one kind
we have blueberry raspberry ginseng sleepytime green tea green tea with lemon green tea with lemon and honey liver disaster ginger with honey ginger without honey vanilla almond white truffle
blueberry chamomile vanilla walnut constant comment and earl grey
did you make some of those up
i think ill have sleepytime
that sounds good to me
let me get you a blanket
that would actually be awesome
after a moment alone scott ventures upstairs
he wanders towards a half open door
pushing it open he finds ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt
scott covers his eyes and our screen goes black
sorry im just
here does this help
what is that
scott opens his eyes to see ramona hugging him
they look into each others eyes
camera circles scott and ramona as they begin an awesome make out session
scott imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline
ramona breaks off smiling
scott is in heaven
were you just going to bring the blanket from your bed
maybe we should both get under it
since were so cold
what about our tea
not have tea
the slinky bassline continues as ramona takes her skirt off revealing black panties to complement black bra
scott takes his shirt off
they tumble onto the bed and make out
then i changed my mind
changed it to what
i dont want to have sex with you pilgrim
not right now
its not like im gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything
you can sleep in my bed
and i reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later
ramona curls up next to scott
this is cool just this
its been like a really long time and this is
i think i needed this
whatever this is
they exchange a smile
then without warning we jump cut to daylight
ramona is gone
an arrow points to the empty spot in the bed next to him
another arrow point out that ramona steps out of the bathroom in a towel
i have to work
you have to leave
ramona skates towards the front gate scott walking next to her
waist deep snow covers the roads and sidewalks
hey can this not be a one night stand
for one thing i didnt even get any
that was a joke
what did you have in mind
oh come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing
you have a band
yeah were terrible
ramona shrugs and rollerblades through the snow
can i get your number
ramona skids to a stop right back next to scott
she hands him a note
ramona flowers xxxxxxx wow girl number
scott looks back up
ramona is already skating far far away
see you at the show scott pilgrim
at the ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young hipsters reaching scott at the bar
he stands with wallace and stacey
she holds hands with a guy wearing glasses
you totally came
i did totally come
scott is so amazed at her presence his social skills vanish
excuse my brother
hes chronically enfeebled
and this is wallace his room mate
and this is my boyfriend jimmy
staring at jimmy heyyy
and this is knives scotts scott goes white
he didnt even see knives come in
knives pecks scott on the cheek
he pushes her away
knives looks kinda sexy wearing makeup and new clothes
do you like
leone staredowns all around
stacey stares at scott
knives and ramona stare at each other
wallace stares at jimmy
scott scurries off
we hear feedback from a mic onstage
this next band are from brampton and they are crash and the boys
scott runs backstage to see stills obsessively flipping through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band
this is a nightmare
is this a nightmare
wake up wake up wake up
once were on stage youll be fine
we were just on stage
for sound check
the sound guy hated us
its just nerves
pre show jitters
people love us
scott sounds less than convincing
he looks up at ramona and knives sitting with wallace jimmy and stacey in the balcony
crash and the boys tune up
a drunk wallace turns to jimmy
do they rock or suck
havent started playing yet
that was a test jimmy
i am crash and these are the boys
trasha year old girl drummer gives wallace the finger
sex bob omb peer at the band from offstage
they have a girl drummer
this is called i am so sad
i am so very very sad
and it goes a little something like this
crash and the boys play a whole song in
wallace yells from the balcony
this song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony and its called we hate you please die
i love this one
crash continues his rampage of musical hate
these guys are good
are these guys good
kim pine scowls harder than ever
these guys are good
this is called last song kills audience
itll be our last song tonight and your last song ever
sound explodes from the stage
the audience are stunned
stills paces backstage as the others watch the band
how are we supposed to follow this
were not going to win were not gonna sign with g man and well never play opening night at the chaos theatre
as crash and the boys climax stacey turns to ramona
so how do you know scott
hes a friend
hard for me to keep track sometimes
he has so many friends
ramona arches an eyebrow
stacey turns to knives and tamara
so knives how did you meet scott
scott looks up into the balcony sees stacey talking to knives
he turns around and slaps stephen stills in the face
we gotta play now and loud
stacey and ramona listen intently to knives story
well i was on the bus with my mom knives freezes staring at the stage
is that seriously the end of the story
oh my gosh theyre on
onstage a disheveled promoter walks to the mic
this next band is from toronto and
so give it up for sex
sex bob omb walk on
wallace and knives give the only cheers
scott nods vigorously
you rea angle on knives
she faints in the excitement
sex bob omb rock out barely into the first verse when a chunk of ceiling crashes down and a spindly indian hipster kid dives head first through the hole finger
pointed at scott as he sails towards the stage
matthew patel lands onstage and glares at scott through a lopsided fringe
he wears an evil grin and a jacket that borders on flamboyant
he drags on a cigarette blacked out
it is i matthew patel
consider our fight
what did i do
matthew patel leaps in the air and sails toward scott
what do i do
scott throws his bass to young neil and blocks patel with his left arm then punches him across the floor with his right
patel lands like a cat flips his fringe and glares at scott
its that one guy
thank you wallace
patel runs at scott
scott spin kicks patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air
they land in the pit knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle
youre quite the opponent pilgrim
who the hell are you anyway
the lighting guy spotlights the fighters
my name is matthew patel and im ramonas first evil ex boyfriend
ramonas first evil ex boyfriend
all eyes whip up to ramona
anyone need another drink
patel attacks scott with spin kicks
scott blocks then holds his hand up for a time out
were fighting because of ramona
didnt you get my e mail explaining the situation
i skimmed it
you will pay for your insolence
patel attacks landing kicks and punches
scott evades and counter attacks
patel evades then lands more punches
scott jump spins away from danger
they pause breathing heavy
whats up with his outfit
is he a pirate
scott looks at patels outfit
are you a pirate
pirates are in this year
patel attacks again
they exchange furious blows until patel puts scott in a choke hold
scott looks up to ramona
you really went out with this guy
yeah in the seventh grade
the lighting guy swings the spotlight to ramona in the balcony
we see a sketchy childlike animated flashback
it was football season and for some reason all the little jocks wanted me
matthew was the only non white non jock boy in school probably in the entire state so we joined forces and took em all out
we were one hell of a team
nothing could beat matthews mystical powers
nothing but pre teen capriciousness
we only kissed once
after a week and a half i told him to hit the showers
the spotlight swings back onto scott and patel
patel levitates into the air and points at ramona
youll pay for this flowers
patel snaps his fingers and launches into a bollywood song
if you want to fight me youre not the brightest
you wont know whats hit you in the slightest
patel levitates into the air
four hot girls in skirts with fangs and bat wings appear in the air around him
me and my fireballs and my demon hipster chicks im talking the talk because i know im slick
patel and the demon hipster chicks shoot fireballs at scott
he flips back onto the stage narrowly dodging the attack
take this sucker down
the demon hipster chicks unleash more fireballs
the house drum kit is trashed behind him
let us show him what were all about
scott hits the ground dodging a third wave of fireballs
they explode crash and the boys in the wings
that doesnt even rhyme
scott rolls across the stage grabs one of kims cymbals and throws it captain america style
it hits patel square in the eyes
poof the demon hipster chicks vanish
this is impossible how can it be
scott leaps into the air
patel opens his eyes just in time to see scott pilgrims fist racing towards his face
open your eyes
maybe youll see
scott punches patel
he explodes into coins
they clatter to the stage floor
scott lands and picks them up
ramona makes her way out fast
well it was great meeting you
tell your gay friends i said bye
stacey turns to see wallace and jimmy making out
ramona passes knives who is being resuscitated by tamara
scott picks up the coins onstage and counts them
thats not even enough for the bus home
ill lend you the cents
ramona yanks scott away
the promotor ambles back onstage
so like sex bob omb wins
knives is now wide awake clapping wildly from the balcony
her eyes scan the venue for scott
but he is long gone
a bemused scott and mortified ramona sit on the bus home
what was all that all about
uh i guess
ramona takes a breath
looks deep into scotts eyes
if were going to date you may have to defeat my seven evil exs
you have seven evil ex boyfriends
seven exs yes
so i have to fight defeat
defeat your seven evil exs if were going to continue to date
so what youre saying is
we are dating
uh i guess
do you want to make out
scott kisses ramona
the studio audience awwwws
a bleary wallace fries bacon
scott bursts through the front door a spring in his step
the studio audience applauds
well someone got to second base last night
and someone has a second date tonight
someones lucky then
you know when i say someone i mean me right
i got to second base last night
maybe first and a half
wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat scott
oh hey im inviting ramona over for dinner so you cant be here tonight
i dont want you gaying up the place
but in return i have to issue an ultimatum
one of your famous ultimatums
it may live in infamy
you have to break up with knives
scott huffs and helps himself to some of wallaces bacon
if you dont do it im going to tell ramona about knives
i swear to god scott
at this point a sleepy jimmy wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee
scott points bacon at wallace accusingly
i didnt make up the gay rulebook
if you have a problem with it take it up with liberaces ghost
youre a monster
now put the bacon down and go do your dirt while i watch the lucas lee marathon on tbs superstation
whos lucas lee
wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of now magazine
he was this pretty good skater and now hes this pretty good actor
hes filming a winifred hailey movie in toronto right now
they make movies in toronto
i am stalking him later
so this lucas lee lucas lee is not important to you right now
surprising no one
scott grumbles off
wallace turns the television way up
we see lucas lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller
listen close and listen hard bucko
the next click is me hanging up
the one after that
is me pulling the trigger
a shivering and annoyed scott dials the payphone
oh hey knives
um do you want to like talk or whatever
are you wearing a tan jacket
like a spring jacket
and a hoodie
scott checks what hes wearing
spooky music underscores
and a dorky hat
its not dorky
why are you psychic
a beaming knives knocks on the payphone glass
the spooky music continues on in the record store
scott is on edge as knives geeks over a standee for the clash at demonhead it features sultry blonde singer envy adams posing and the rest of the band shrouded
in shadow and mist
i cant believe theyre coming to town
will you take me to the show
yeah listen the spooky music gets louder pounding inside scotts head
oh hey i wanted to invite you over for dinner
like chinese food
its not my favorite
well to meet my parents
its my birthday dinner
i think thats a really bad idea
like really just so bad
no its okay
well i mean im too old for you
no youre not
my dad is nine years older than my mom
are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever
i dont care
knives is so smitten the word actually appears onscreen
scott brushes it away
the spooky music comes to a stop
i was thinking we should break up or whatever
its not going to work out
scott walks out leaving knives in the aisle
scott sits on the bus alone thinking about knives
crosscut with knives still in the record store in shock
on the bus scott sighs thinks of something happier
crosscut with ramona rollerblading her funky pink hair
on the bus scott smiles a little happier
sex bob omb tune up
kim spins a drumstick in her fingers
not coming tonight
we broke up
young neil pauses his ds
kim and stills share a look
check it out i learned the bass line from final fantasy
scott plays the insanely simple video game tune
scott you are the salt of the earth
i meant scum of the earth
you broke up with knives
yeah but dont worry maybe youll meet my new new girlfriend soon
kim mimes shooting herself
stills unplugs scotts amp
from here on out no girlfriends or girlfriend talk at practice whether theyre old new or new new
we were lucky to survive that last round
this is sudden death now
thats for me
scott opens the door to see ramona now sporting blue hair
like you said
is it not cool
scott ushers her in weirded out by this hair development
you know your hair
i know of it
its all blue
i just dyed it
are you going to introduce me
oh yeah this is stephen stills young neil thats
everyone mumbles back
scott still stares at ramonas hair
is it weird not being pink anymore
i change my hair every week and a half dude
get used to it
to sex bob omb so
how do you guys all know each other
high school i guess
what neil said
believe it or not i actually dated scott in high school
got any embarassing stories
hes an idiot
scott fake laughs
starts ushering ramona out again
see you guys tomorrow
uh what about rehearsal
neil knows my parts
ramona lounges reading a magazine
a tense scott hurries around the kitchen area preparing food as wallace looks on
are you doing okay there
ramona goes to the bathroom
scott drops the act
she changed her hair
it looks nice blue
i know but she changed it without even making a big deal about it
oh my god what do i do
i cant believe you were worried about me gaying up the place
wallace pulls on a jacket
hows dinner coming along
ill leave you lovebirds to it
im heading up to casa loma to stalk my hetero crush
scott stops wallace at the door with a panicked whisper
will you man the hell up
you could get to nd and a half base
you think so
well if you strike out in the next hour come find me at the castle
if i strike out
see you in sixty
ramona and scott eat on the floor picnic style
scott has cooked garlic bread and only garlic bread for dinner
this is actually really good garlic bread
garlic bread is my favorite food
i could honestly eat it for every meal
or just all the time without even stopping
youd get fat
why would i get fat
bread makes you fat
bread makes you fat
a nervy scott serenades ramona on his bass guitar
so i wrote a song about you
yeah it goes like this ra mona ra mona ra ra ra mona ra mona ra mona ra ra ra mona ooooh
i cant wait to hear it when its finished
scott makes out with ramona on the futon
scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair
your hairs pretty shaggy
scott sits up like a shot
ramona is taken aback
its just that i got
i got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up
but its so long ago i can barely remember it
a deep voiced narrator chimes in
earl jones deep
scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly days ago three hours before his big breakup
he blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since
sounds like a bad time
it was a mutual thing
i mean she told me it was mutual
she dumped him
it was brutal
what was her name
she was nat when i knew her
but she stopped liking that name
she stopped liking me
your hair is cute
i like it long
but itd be cuter short
scott disappears and just as quickly reappears now wearing his dorky snow hat hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps
why are you wearing that
i thought we could go for a walk
scott and ramona climb a stairway long handrail between them
tell me we didnt come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat
i just love me some walking
putting one leg in front of the other
you seem a little
i dont know
i just when im with you i feel like im on drugs
not that i do drugs unless you do in which case i do drugs all the time every drug but
you make me feel
i dont know
things seem a little brighter around you or something
ramona and scott finally reach the top of the stairs and night turns to day as if crossing a magical line
what is this place
a totally awesome castle
theyre shooting this movie up here
ramona looks up at the looming casa loma a castle surrounded by big bright movie set lights
whos in it
winifred hailey and some actor guy
lets find out
a crew readies a shot of winifred hailey held hostage by some goon
a stand in takes the place of the leading man
scott and ramona approach some spectators including wallace
did you find the guy youre stalking
i think im about to right now
lee is travelling
the universal studios fanfare announces lucas lee as he exits his trailer smoking a cigarette blacked out
he skates towards the set doing kickflips
the spectators go oooh
i want to have his adopted babies
we gotta go
i used to date that clown
i am not a slut
i can think of no higher accolade
lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode
lucas lee points his board at the goon
the only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes its gonna take to kick your ass
you dated a famous guy
in th grade
we had drama
actually it might have been math
i just remember there being lots of drama
lucas lee points at scott who remains oblivious
he just followed me around
he was a little snot nosed brat
he had snot
in his nose
but hes famous
its not a big deal
i only dated him for a week and a half im talking to you scott pilgrim
lucas lee stomps towards scott who gasps
hes famous and he talked to me
the only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes its gonna take to kick your ass
can i get pow
lucas lee punches scott flooring him
scott comes back up with a pen and paper wobbly
can i get your autograph
lucas lee punches scott again
he nods to ramona
he seems nice
lucas lee throws scott up into a castle turret crumbling it
scotts crashes down through scaffolding onto the set
lucas holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo then stomps over to pick up a dazed scott from the ground
think you stand a chance against an a lister bro
lucas lee punches scott again
he slides across the wet down ground
a set nurse sprays lucas knuckles with antiseptic
some competish you are
lucas lee wanders off
scott staggers to his feet punchy
im not done scott spins lucas around only to find an identical stand in
looks like youre seeing double
scott turns to see the real lucas smirking on the sidelines
the identical stand in punches scott to the ground
hes good right
sometimes i let him do wide shots if i feel like getting blazed back in my winnie
scott stands to fight the double
suddenly countless stuntmen fan out behind the stand in all identically dressed all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble
im nothing without my stunt team
the stuntmen attack scott pilgrim with a howl
scott punches through a couple of the boards tae kwon doe style
ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds
how does it feel to krow
scott takes a skateboard to the face followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs
im gonna get coffee
you homies want anything
we follow the smirking lucas to the coffee station
we hear the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing
lucas turns shocked to see scott in front of a painted d skyline backdrop surrounded by many unconscious stuntmen
youre needed back on set
scott charges lucas lee and leaps into a flying kick
lucas grabs his foot and hurls him through the backdrop
scott lands in a crump framed through the torn skyline
lucas stomps over to him preparing for the deathblow
prepare to feel the wrath of the league of evil exes
the league of evil axes
you really dont know about the the league
seven evil exes
coming to kill you
controlling the future of ramonas love life
oh well then dont worry about it
lets get a beer
lucas offers a hand
scott goes to shake it
lucas gets him square in the mouth
scott smiles through his aching jaw
you are a pretty good actor
im going for the oscar this year
but are you a pretty good skater
im more than pretty good ese
i have my own skate company
lucas pulls down his shirt revealing a skate company tattoo
so you can sell them but can you do a thingy on that rail
scott points to the long handrail on the stairs
its called a grind bro
so can you do a grind thingy now
are you serious
theres like steps and the rails are garbage
hey if its too hardcore
you really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that
theres girls watching
somebody get me my board
wallace taps lucas shoulder and hands him his skateboard
why wouldnt you be
lucas goes for it a perfect ollie onto the rail
scott and wallace watch as lucas disappears from sight sparking down the endless rail
cut back to scott wallace impressed at lucas
cut back to scott wallace very impressed at lucas
cut back to scott wallace
scotts about to say wow when boooooooom
a fireball appears from the bottom of the stairs
wow he totally bailed
scott smacks his forehead
i didnt get his autograph
thats a wrap everybody
is she still here
no she totally bailed
whats the deal
scott slumps on the couch phone pressed to his ear
wallace cooks bacon in the kitchen no pants
we hear the outgoing message this is an automated voice messaging system
ramona is not available please record your message after the beep
its me scott again
call me back
whats the deal
scott ambles over to the fridge and rests his head on it
yeah you said that last night
you know what really sucks though
come on guy you cant say you didnt see this coming
it was right under your nose
wallace points to the note ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under scotts nose on the refrigerator ramona flowers xxxxxxx what did you think these were
seven little kisses
seven deadly xs
wallace cocks an eyebrow
scott slides to the floor
why does everything have to be so complicated
wallace crouches down to join scott on the floor
if you want something bad you have to fight for it
step up your game
break out the l word
the other l word
okay its love
i wasnt trying to trick you or anything
look if shes really the girl of your dreams then you have to let her know
you have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path
you have the spirit of a warrior scott
you can do it
be with her
its your destiny
plus i need you to move out
scotts face falls completely shocked at this bombshell
are you moving in with other scott or jimmy or someone
either way im kind of banking on her calling you back so i wont have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit
scott and wallace look at the phone
i have a feeling thats for you guy
scott picks up
a sexy non ramona voice replies
its been a long time
a year i think

nice chatting with you
scott slumps to the floor
wallace appears over him
everything does suck
wallace grins and grabs the phone
or does it
scott sits bolt upright expectant
oh hey knives
scott lays back down
scott sits bolt upright again
wallace opens the door a crack
knives shivers outside pale and broken looking
is scott here
you know what
behind wallace we see scott leap through a window head first
he just left
scott sprints away in the background
scott walks fast down the street freaked out and paranoid
he sees five xs looming above him on a pedestrian crossing and quickly diverts into an
scott rips the x men patch off his jacket when whzzz something buzzes past scott
he looks around
whoosh another blast of air whizzes by
shfff something sweeps him off his feet
hes pissed now
im really not in the mood
shwaa something slices the air in front of scott
scott punches the air in front of him
a diminutive dirty blonde dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up lands on the ground with a thump
she spins to face scott
you punched me in the boob
prepare to die obviously
listen ive had it today
can we not do this right now
love to postpone darlin but i just cashed my last raincheck

well whatever this is about can it wait till im in the right frame of mind
this is one nightmare you cant wake up from

scott shakes his head baffled
well im really really not up for this
whatever it is
okay little chicken then ill see you later
but you wont see me
because ill be deadly serious next time
paf the mystery attacker vanishes
scott looks to the sky
someone help me
scott is in his usual payphone dialing stacey frantically

no its scott

what did you do this time
i didnt do anything
its everyone else thats crazy
look i need to talk to you im having a meltdown or whatever

scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into scott approaches the counter
stacey has her back turned
think ill make it a decaf today
stacey turns around revealing herself to be julie
what did you do with my sister
stacey taps on the window outside mouthing that she has to go
scott turns back to julie not happy
what can i fucking get you
is there anywhere you dont work
theyre called jobs something a fuckball like you wouldnt know anything about
and by the way i cant believe you fucking asked ramona out after i specifically told you not to fucking do that
note to concerned reader everytime julie says fuck a black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped
how do you do that with your mouth
neverfuckingmind how i do it
what do you have to say for yourself
can i get a caramel macchiato
maybe its high fucking time you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl
julie points at the clash at demonhead poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom
fucking speaking of fucking which i hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass is walking the streets of toronto again
so i can pick up my coffee over here
scott retreats away from julie and bumps right into
they share an awkward moment
she looks at the floor
sorry that got a little crazy last night
you kind of disappeared
yeah i do that
listen i know its hard to be around me sometimes
ill understand if you dont want to hang anymore
no i want to hang
the whole evil ex boyfriend thing
i mean i know its early days but i dont think anything can really get in the way of how i shit
scott hides behind ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed milk mists of the coffee shop
the singer from the clash at demonhead has seemingly stepped out of the poster
the icy platinum blonde fashionista walks towards scott
its my ex
the big one
leone staredown between envy and ramona
ramona goes to order coffee leaving envy to fix on scott
your hair is getting shaggy
reverse scott is instantly wearing his dorky hat
okay im jealous

for that cocky pretty boy
youve never even seen him
you left me for a guy ive never even seen
maybe youll see him soon
were playing lees palace

envy disappears into the cappucino mists
caramel fuckiato for fuck pilgrim
its pronounced scott
scott and ramona walk side by side sipping their coffees
that was nat
no that was envy
what did you guys talk about
shes totally jealous of you
how about that
what happened with the two of you
do you mind if we dont get into that right now
she wanted to move to montreal because she missed her best friend
this guy todd
and two weeks later you heard they were sleeping together i guess
i dated a todd once
that didnt end well either
i can see how it sucks
having the past come back to haunt you
is it wrong that i try not to think about it
what do you want to think about
how warm my place is right now
ramona stops and kisses him
scott lies between wallace and other scott on the futon
and you didnt bang her
are you gay
i couldnt stop thinking about my stupid ex girlfriend
a bleary jimmy sits up between them all
is that the uma thurman movie
just because envys back in town doesnt make it not over
scott stands no pants
im not gonna let her toy with me
from this moment on i will think of envy adams no more
i have distressing news
a deadly serious stephen stills addresses kim scott and young neil
ramona lounges on the couch
is the news that we suck
because i really dont think i can take it
the clash at demonhead are doing a secret show tomorrow night
and envy asked us to open for them
i hate you
a gig is a gig is a gig
is a gig
maybe you can put your history aside until we get through this thing
you know for the band

cant we do our own secret shows
all our shows are secret shows
were doing it
g man might be there
we play the next round of the battle saturday
we need to get some buzz going
we need groundswell
we need stalkers
stills paces past the window to reveal
knives chau outside
crash zoom on her tearful face pressed against the window
totally crushed to see scott cuddling with ramona
what would you do
if your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them
if my ex was in the band
it might be a little awkward
but maybe its the grown up thing to do
yeah were all adults right
knives frantically rifles through racks of hair dye and rants furiously into her cellphone
hes dating a fat ass hipster chick
i hate his stupid guts
im gonna disembowel him
knives stands on her bed and continues ranting at tamara
he only likes her cause shes old
shes probably like
shes just some fat ass white girl you know
i think you mentioned she was fa tamara helps knives color her hair under the bathtub spigot
shes got a head start
i didnt even know there was good music until like two months ago
okay this really burns
we should rinse i mean he knew i was cool but he thought i was too young so he tried to find someone cool but old
i thought she was fat well she thinks shes cool
this is all her fault
tamara turns the faucet on and rinses knives hair
it must be her fault
obviously its just a twist of fate or whatever isnt it
star crossed lovers
born too late
knives looks in the mirror her hair is exactly like ramona
i look so
knives throws a long scarf on looking sexy eyes narrowing
scott pilgrim destroyed my heart
but i know how to get him back
push into knives as she plots
tamara pops into frame
we see a text message typing onscreen a huge line of too cool youths snakes outside a rock venue
a sign reads the clash at demonhead sold out
we hear loud music blasting through the open doors
the loud music stops abruptly
sex bob omb bow onstage
we were sex bob omb
wallace and other scott clap and cheer drunk
the other snobbish kids in the audience shrug and disperse
we got some merch out the back so to scott and kim okay
a disillusioned sex bob omb hang with ramona at the bar
level with me
did we suck
i dont know
she has to go
she knows we suck
ramona excuses herself
ramona does her eyeliner
she looks in the mirror to see two images of herself staring back
or is it
knives chau single white asian with identical hair clothes and makeup standing next to ramona looking hot
ramona exits confused
what the hell
ramona and knives exit the bathroom together
scott breaks into a cold sweat
knives shoots scott a sultry look
knives heads into young neils arms at the other end of the bar
scott struggles with something resembling jealousy
what the hell
look who knives is hanging with
who is that girl again
i bet young neil will date her even briefly er
how old is she
a wheel of fortune spins inside scotts head with selections such as it was nothing and she was nobody
the wheel sticks between i gotta pee
and who her
i gotta pee on her
turns beet red i mean i gotta pee
scott washes his hands and looks up to see two scotts staring back one with fringed hair and a wicked glare
scott whips around
spooky music begins
a freaked out scott returns to the group
the lights dim and the stage fills with twisting blue tendrils of smoke
the clash at demonhead materialize envy in a long black coat
knives screams her teen brains out
the bass player steps into the light no longer shrouded in dry ice he cuts a handsome striking rock god figure
that guy on bass
todd flips his fringe from his eyes
stares at scott
envy lets her coat slip off revealing a stunning figure
sex bob omb knives and ramona hang near the backstage doors
oh my god
just oh my god
man you have to see them live
theyre so much better live
i think im going to throw up
julie opens the backstage door and huffs
i cant believe im even saying this but envy adams would like all of you to come backstage
all of us
did i fucking stutter
the group shuffles backstage
scott hangs his head like a condemned man
how do you know envy
knives makes a face that looks like this o
sex bob omb lounge on a couch on one side of the room
envy todd and julie lounge on a couch across from them
knives in shock as she thinks a thousand thoughts
envy burns a hole through scott
everyone else feels
been a while
whispers to scott i think we should get out of here
how was the tour
you played with the pixies
youre a superstar now
its yeah its not something i can really put into words
i read your blog
todd and julie glare at knives
scott and ramona eh
what of it
you guys are a cute couple you know
you suit each other
so whats your ulterior motive envy in general
she doesnt need ulterior motives stephen
shes got a write up in spin
youre my role model envy
just saying cute couple
i like your outfit ramona
i was going to say envy
did you get those jeans in new york theyre im talking to ramona right now
ramona lived in new york
i was just there
we played the chaos theatre for gideon
you know him right
scott looks at ramona
she is about to answer when
knives stands up points at envy and screams envy nods at todd
he punches knives square in the jaw
scott jumps to his feet facing off against todd ingram
young neil rushes to knives aid
im not afraid to hit a girl
im a rock star
you punched the highlights out of her hair
angle on knives
her hair is black and plain as before
he punched the highlights
i dont know the meaning of the word
young neil escorts knives out
todd sits back down like nothing happened
scotts face is a bright shade of rage
so are you guys doing anything fun while youre in town
that is it you cocky cock
youll pay scott leaps across the table and swings a punch at todd
todd thrusts a hand out and telekinetically freezes scott in the air
scott hovers grasping his neck choking
todds hair magically forms into a fauxhawk
didnt you know
its not a big deal
todd telekinetically hurls scott through the clubs wall
ramona and sex bob omb peer through the newly made hole in the wall to see scott sprawled on some trash bags
he tries to keep cool despite being in a lot of pain
anyone can be
ovo lacto vegetarian maybe
i partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face
short answer being vegan just makes you better than most people
todd lifts up scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air
scott sails out of shot and into space
hey man question
i always wondered how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers
you know how you only use ten percent of your brain
well its because the other is filled up with curds and whey
did you learn that at vegan academy
go ahead and get snippy baby if you knew the science maybe id listen to a word youre saying
scott returns to earth with a thump
he moans in pain
while the others bicker ramona helps scott to his feet
if i peed my pants would you pretend i just got wet from the rain
its not raining
how about you give me the cliff notes on how and why you ended up dating this a hole
is that really important right now
if theres a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying
a brief scrappy animated flashback of young todd and ramona
i was only dating lucas until the minute todd walked by
i guess thats not very nice but i used to be kind of
young ramona shoves young lucas down a hill and starts making out with young todd
we hated everyone
we wrecked stuff
young ramona and young todd wreck stuff
he punched a hole in the moon for me
it was pretty crazy
young todd punches a hole in the moon
its pretty crazy
a week and a half later he told me his dad was sending him to the vegan academy so i dumped him
does that help you at all
the flashback ends
scott can only fixate on one aspect
have you dumped everyone youve ever been with
youve never been the dumpee
look ive dabbled with being a bitch
its part of the reason i moved here
i was really hoping to put it all behind me
todd appears behind ramona ready for another round
we have unfinished business i and he
scott stands up sort of ready for another round
he and me
dont you talk to me about grammar
tell it to the cleaning lady on monday
because youll be dust by monday
because ill be pulverizing you in two seconds
and the cleaning lady
sorry so whats on monday
cos its friday now and she has weekends off so
basically you cant win this fight and youll have to give up on this girl cos todd is going to kill you
you used to be so
scott charges at todd who psych throws him back into the club
we hear a distant crump
stills calls through the hole
uh were going to pizza pizza for a slice call us when youre done
oh hell be done real soon
sex bob omb skulks away
envy grins at ramona wicked
crummy way to end things i know
suddenly the bass line from final fantasy rumbles through the walls
todd calls to a roadie
get me my bass
the good one
scott stands in an elephants graveyard of plastic cups and bottles picking the hell out of his bass amp pegged to
todd ingram levitates floating towards scott with his bass
youre going down
todd lands in front of scott
picks strike string
todd easily out basses scott shredding him into oblivion
the enormous reverb launches club debris towards scott
the reverb is hurting my soul
scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall
todd levitates fauxhawk rising
he hovers next to him
thats right pilgrim
i actually know how to play bass
todd detunes his bass and delivers a death note that blows scott right through the stage wall
scott crashes into a backstage food table
todd floats toward him savoring the kill
envy appears beside him with a smirk
i can read your thoughts
your bass hand is badly injured
scott turns around on his knees cringing holding a cup of milky looking coffee in either hand as a peace offering
what say we drink to my memory
fair trade blend with soymilk
im sorry but thats pathetic
i can see in your minds eye that you poured half half into one of these coffees in an attempt to make me break vegan edge
ill take the one with soy
todd floats to the ground takes one of the cups and drinks
actually i poured soy in this cup but thought real hard about pouring it in that one
you know in my minds eye or whatever
what are you talking about
you just drank half half
two trendy police types bust in through the wall making two more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons
todd ingram youre under arrest for veganity violation code number imbibement of half half
no vegan diet no vegan powers
but this is a first offense
dont i get three strikes
vegan police officer flips open his code violation book
on february st you knowingly ingested gelato
gelato isnt vegan
milk and eggs bitch
on april th p
you partook a plate of chicken parmesan
envy gasps disgusted
chicken isnt vegan
the deveganizing ray
the vegan police blast todd with arcs of power from their finger guns
todds fauxhawk deflates into a bowl cut
scott rises into a stance to deliver his killer line
you once were a vegone but now you will be gone
scott headbutts todd exploding him
scott dusts himself off as coins rain down
envy stares jaw ajar
uh sorry i guess
you just headbutted my boyfriend so hard he burst
you kicked my heart in the ass
so i guess were even
no one calls me that anymore
maybe they should
now lets get out of here
a battle worn scott limps through the hole in the wall
ramona follows shooting envy a look on the way out
crummy way to end things i know
envy blinks in shock
julie pops into shot
for the record i am so pissed off for you right now
shut the fuck up julie
sex bob omb wallace and other scott munch pizza slices
ramona and scott on the fringes
its an odd mood
i hate that bitch so much i kind of love her
that todd guy was cool too
i liked him
scott sighs and holds a cold coke zero on his forehead
are you okay
you sure about that
do i look like im not okay
scott does not look okay
were still going to the after show right
im not sure its gonna be much of a party i think a third of the band just went poom
cool bands never go to their own after parties
its just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with label guys
then why would we
neil you down
neil is at the counter with a catatonic knives
youre in right
do you want to go
i kind of almost died back there so
im not saying i want to go
hey we can totally go
ill do whatever you want to do
so lets go
scott takes another bite
other scott whispers to wallace
are scott and ramona fighting
not to my knowledge
i mean not with fists
the whole gang trudge to the after party
scott limps a bit lagging behind
ramona falls back with him
we really dont have to go to this thing
itll probably be a bad scene all around and weve already had a full night
no im fine im fine
its just its just
well not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything
but have you ever dated someone who wasnt a total ass
so far youre not a total ass
but im part ass
if it makes you feel better youre the nicest guy ive dated
is that good
its what i need right now
scott i dont have all the answers
id just like to live in the moment if i can
yeah id just like to live
scott and ramona enter a big fartsy artsy warehouse
okay i know todd was bad news
but are you saying envy wasnt
we all have baggage
my baggage doesnt try and kill me every five minutes
what did you do to your ex boyfriends to make them so insane
no break up is painless
someone always gets hurt
what about you and that girl knives
who broke up with who
i broke up with her
and was she cool with that
knives is with young neil now shes totally cool with it
they pass knives and young neil
she seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at scott lovingly
you sure about that
shes very mature for her age
it was a very healthy break up
were all peaches and gravy
we hear an offscreen distant nooooo from knives
and what about you and kim
they pass kim
shes also staring at scott
me and kim
i can barely remember
why is it important
hey you want to know everything about my past dude
it was just
i dont know
it was high school
she had freckles
it was cool i guess
yeah it kind of ended
scott and ramona have reached the bar at the party
thats really the whole story
i had to fight a dude to get with her
i fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude
and i had to fight guys to get to him too
he was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes
he was totally awesome and i kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth
does that make you feel any better
well now you are being a total ass
welcome to the club
in the back glass of the bar scott sees his reflection fringed hair wicked glare
he catches himself
im not usually like this
hey dont worry
i dont know what im like anymore
i guess this whole ex boyfriends thing is really messing with my head
why do you keep saying paf
a foot appears out of nowhere and kicks scott in the head sending him flying across the dance floor
scott looks up at his opponent the mystery attacker
girl from earlier
scott gets up
the three square off in a triangle
you know this girl
oh boy does she know me
he really doesnt know
you and her
it was just a phase
just a phase
you had a sexy phase
i didnt think it would count
it meant nothing
it meant nothing
i was just a little bi curious
well honey im a little bi furious
roxy throws a scorpion kick at scotts face
ramona catches her foot mid air
roxy flips out of the hold
do that again and i will end you
back off hasbian
if gideon cant have you no one can
the league hath spoken
the girls square off clearing the busy dance floor
then gideon best get his pretentious ass up here cos im about to kick yours out of the great white north
you unbelievable bitch
ramona pulls a large hammer from her purse
an embarrassed scott watches with the rest of the crowd
this is happening right
i mean this is live
kick her in the balls with blinding speed roxy slips her belt off and whips a razor sharp flying guillotine belt buckle at ramona
ramona cartwheels as the buckle sails between her legs and smashes into a disco ball
mirrored shards fly everywhere
roxy vanishes as ramona swings the hammer at her
it smashes a speaker
sound on one side of the room cuts out
ramona turns around just in time to see roxys deadly belt sailing towards her
she blocks with the hammer
the belt wraps around it
roxy hurls the hammer out the window
im sending you back to gideon in a thousand pieces you slag
ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture leaping towards roxy and punching her in the face
roxy reels and slams into the wall leaving a dent in it
id rather be dead than go back
hes a creep youre a bitch and you all deserve each other
give it a rest ramona
this is a league game
roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified scott
meaning your precious scott must defeat me with his own fists
or possibly feet
im not sure i can hit a girl
you dont have a choice
ramona positions scott into a fighting stance as roxy charges with deadly intent
ramona puppeteers scott into a furious volley of punches on roxy
she staggers winces
fight your own battles lazy ass
roxy disappears then reappears between scott and ramona kicking them apart with the splits
roxy then kicks scott into the ceiling
he lands hard on the floor
every pilgrim reaches the end of his journey
some sooner than others
roxy lifts her leg over her head preparing to drop her boot of death on scotts head
she grins at ramona
fs about to get fd in the b
her weak points the back of her knees
how does that work
whenever we were making out i okay
as roxys leg descends scott reaches up with one finger and lightly tickles the back of roxys knee
roxy falls still in the splits throbbing with orgasmic meltdown
scott watches as roxy giggles between spasms
be able to do this to herrrrrrrrrrr
roxy screams in ecstasy before exploding into coins
a spent scott is left standing in the middle of the room
the party starts up again a wave of gossip spreading around the room
people text furiously and point fingers at scott
scott flushes red and retreats back to the bar
ramona follows tentatively
the gossip echoes around them
two gin and tonics please
i thought you didnt drink
only on special occasions
did you want one
scott swigs down his drink
ramona tries to lighten things
i guess we really dont know that much about each other do we
scott seems immediately drunk
maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least i know whos going to beat my ass into the ground next
oh like a handy little laminate or something
let me see if i can find one
looks through bag maybe we could exchange our information
scott has already downed his second drink
just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well being is there anyone at this party you havent slept with
she touches her hair
i really think we should split
as in get out of here
or as in split split
id hope you could figure that out
or did you miss the part where i saved your ass
how could i not
i feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public
holds up fingers ive had like one drink
well im sorry i cared
i dont enjoy all this scott
in fact im sick of it
i thought you might be more understanding
youre just another evil ex boyfriend waiting to happen
ramona walks off and loudly announces
and yes there is someone at this party i havent slept with
another crescendo of gossip echoes around the room
scotts friends gather round in a pity party
but then ramona returns handing scott a laminated list
heres your stupid list
ramona exits proper
scott looks at the list
it reads who the hell are the katayanagi twins
you dont know
stills flips to hand drawn sketches of the katayanagis identical asian twins dressed like pretentious new wave fops
theyre the next band in the battle and they are badass
we reveal a grim terse scott playing a doomy bassline
the rehearsal room feels empty without knives or ramona
ramona dated twins
at the same time
you know what
i dont know and i dont want to know
you know how i feel about girls cockblocking the rock
i play better in a bad mood
if its gonna be an issue though young neil can fill in for you
its not an issue
you know bands i know battles
we got it covered
well wed understand if you didnt want to take part
not only do i want to take part
i want to take them apart
im getting tingles
sex bob omb and young neil load their gear at the venue
flyers cover the outside walls of another rock venue that flyer needs more exclamation marks
oh we are going to get killed
youre onstage in five
arent the katamaris or whatever on first
i think youre both on first
amp versus amp
were going on stage at the same time
thats impossible two stages sit on either side of the auditorium
on one a monolithic wall of elk amplifiers
on the other sex bob omb with their dinky lame brand amps behind them
your bad is saying my bad
sex bob omb stare up at the katayanagi amps sweating behind their instruments
stills looks into the audience positioned between the bands a legion of identical indie teens
we shouldnt even be here
we shouldnt even be here
stills tries to run
scott grabs him and pulls him back
come on man
i put aside my problems for the music
if i can do that we can do anything
did you speak to ramona then
i havent seen her since the other night
shes totally here
kim points to ramona in the crowd
she is totally there
her hair is now the brightest green and she stands next to a nondescript mystery geek in blazer and black rimmed glasses
they are chatting
she looks happy
scott turns bleak again
not that i care
but you should talk to her before shes gone
and i really dont care
scott nods at kims advice
he looks back to the crowd to find the mystery geek staring right at him
then disorienting lights and lasers flash on the opposite stage
a wall of feedback builds
the katayanagi twins appear sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands
kyle katayanagi is very serious and japanese
ken katayanagi is serious and very japanese
scott stephen stills and kim share a nervous look
can we do this
i mean we can do this
scott is distracted again by the mystery geek staring at him
kyle katayanagi hits a single note on the keyboard blasting an enormous wave of sound at sex bob omb
its so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling leaving a huge hole in the roof
the crowd cheers
they brought the house down
now an open air venue snow falls onto the stage
an earth shaking bass note blows the dust off sex bob omb
scott and stills get into battle position
sex bob omb rock out their sound blowing a mass of snow towards the katayanagis
for once they sound awesome
kyle looks at ken
they share a nod
ken turns their amps up to the japanese character for
their waveforms transform the swirling snow into a two headed white dragon
katayanagi slam their moogs
heavy weirdness explodes from the amps
the dragon blows a blast of snowy fire that blows sex bob omb off the stage
the crowd erupts into cheers
scott kim and stills lie in a heap under their instruments
lets break up now and get it over with
we screwed the pooch in front of gideon graves
stills points to the mystery geek who smirks and whispers in ramonas ear
this is gideon graves asshole
scotts eyes reflect ramonas hair and turn green
he struggles to his feet
the crowd slowly stops clapping as scott pulls stills to his feet then helps kim up
lets do this
kim inspired by scotts new hardcore attitude comes in heavy on the kick drum
boom boom boom boom
heads nod in time as sex bob omb rock out
their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a green eyed yeti
the katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their sonic dragon stalks towards sex bob omb slinking on perfect beat with the katayanagis spooky music
the yeti and the dragons clash at center stage fighting in time to the music
scott and stills bring their pick hands down like fierce punches
the yeti brings its fists down on the dragon
sex bob omb hammer down the final note the yeti picks up the dragon and throws it at the katayanagi twins exploding them and their amps into coins
the crowd goes bazooky
a disembodied scott head appears hovering next to scott
scott looks for ramona in the crowd but she and gideon are gone
scott hands his bass to young neil
what are you doing
getting a life
scott swipes the scott head and jumps into the still applauding crowd
he cant find ramona but comes upon knives standing alone in her homemade sex bob omb t shirt
i just came to see the show
im not even stalking you
knivess unusally composed demeanor gives scott pause
knives shrugs different
i feel like i know stuff now
scott and knives lock eyes
scott suddenly spots a flash of green hair exiting the building
knives watches him go eyes narrowing
scott chases ramona down the street outside the venue
i have something i need to tell you
yeah i have something to great
listen i know you just play mysterious and aloof to avoid getting hurt
i know you have reasons for not wanting to talk about your past
and i want you to know i dont care about any of that stuff
because im in lesbians with you
i really really mean it
what did you want to tell me
that we have to break up
its not going to work out
a sleek black lincoln continental pulls up behind
i cant help myself around him
thats the bad news
gideon graves appears behind scott with stills and kim in tow
the lincoln parks
a driver opens the passenger door
the good news scottie is im officially loving the sex bombs
three piece rock outfit with a semi attractive female drummer
music to my earholes
ramona looks at the floor
stills is ga ga
text an arrow points to stills crotch captioned pee
you know im not even going to wait to see how you guys do in the final
im signing you right now for a three album deal
gideon produces a contract and clicks a pen
im not such a bad guy after all
scott grabs the contract and throws it onto the sidewalk
you think were gonna sell our souls to you
well then guess we hear scribbling
stills has picked up the contract and is furiously signing it using scotts back
kim shrugs and signs it too before trying to hand it back to scott
i cant be part of the band with this douche in charge
scottie buddy can i just say keep your emotions in check
dont let whats past screw up your future
scott watches ramona get into the continental
she rolls the mirrored window up so scott stares at his own reflection
the people need to hear us scott
then youre going to need to find someone else to play bass
a meek young neil slides into view bass in hand
looks like were all set
young neil signs the contract
there are hand shakes all round
gideon turns to scott and pats him on the shoulder
oh and scott we should really be thanking each other
i mean if it wasnt for me you would have never been with ramona but if it wasnt for you she wouldnt be back with me
so i guess it all shakes out
gideon walks around to the driver side of the lincoln
and hey the whole league of evil exes thing
i was in a dark place when i put that together
gideon disappears into the lincoln and drives off and sex bob omb drift away
scott stands alone
he slaps his head i said lesbians
scott sits on the bus alone thinking about ramona
ramona sits expressionless in the back of gideons car
scott tries desperately to think positive
a smiling gideon sidles closer to ramona
scott walks forlornly down an empty street and bumps his head on a telephone pole
scott sits on the swings staring straight ahead
night turns to day
day turns to night
scott remains in the exact same position
was she really the one
scott looks over to see stacey on the swing next to him
i mean did you really see a future with this girl
stacey stands to go gives scott a hug
time heals all wounds little brother
maybe next time lets not date the girl with eleven evil ex boyfriends
well thats not so bad
stacey heads off
scott looks at the camera
flicks the light on
gets a shock
scott flicks the light off
over pitch black
presumably you just saw someones junk and i apologize for that
was that other scott or jimmy or someone
scott sits in the chair wrapped in a blanket
some guy lies in scotts usual futon spot wearing wallaces monogrammed robe
wallace hands scott cocoa
scott you know i love you
but i need my own bed tonight
i may need it the rest of the week too
and the year
i get it
maybe you can move in with ramona
scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head
shes with gideon
but you know its probably just because hes better than you
hell certainly have better hair
either way i think this fight is over
you can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay
i got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen
wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask
scott stares at the phone
some guy picks up
its for scott
just wanted to say i feel terrible about earlier
i dont want any hard feelings so i figured why not be the bigger man and give you a call
is ramona with you
gideon appears to sit on some kind of throne
he calls off
i dont know
are you with me
geez buddy its gonna be alright
no i just spilled cocoa on my crotch
sure you did
well as you know im opening a new chaos theatre in toronto and the sex bobs are playing our grand opening tonight and it would feel really weird for all
of us if you werent there
they just did a sound check and the acoustics in here are amazing
maybe ill see you there
i hope so amigo
i dont want anymore bad blood between exs
what do you say
what a perfect asshole
scott turns alarmed
reveal wallace on the other cordless
forget what i said earlier
snow blows around a steely eyed scott as he stomps towards a group of desolate warehouses near the water
a lone hipster kid smokes a cigarette leaning against a warehouse wall
the hipster kid waves scott in
the warehouse is empty
scott follows the sound of music to a gated elevator
two hipster kids guard the elevator
scott gives the slightest shrug
scott steps into the elevator
so far so good
scott exits the elevator and steps into gideons underground lair of cool shit
the chaos theatre
all hipster kids have gathered in one spot of ultimate snobbery
they are legion wearing identical outfits chuck taylors skinny jeans
comeau holds court among them
yeah their first album is so much better than their first album
scott pushes through the idiot hordes
sex bob omb are playing onstage now using sweet brand amps young neil on bass
stills sees scott walking by as they finish a song
scott pauses looking up at his former bandmates
let it go
dont give him the satisfaction
what if i want the satisfaction
well then youre doomed
scott turns to see gideon sitting on a throne of cool atop a black velvet vip pyramid
ramona kneels at his side
hey buddy welcome to the chaos theatre
somebody get this man a drink
coke zero right
a cocktail waitress with a fringe appears with a coke zero
scott takes the beverage and throws the cup to the floor
im not here to drink
i got no beef with you
what if i have a beef
are you still mad about that whole thing with the guild
you mean the league
guild league whatever
its ancient history
gideon puts his arm around ramona
ill show you how ancient of history it is
scott gets into a fighting stance
gideon loses his cool
no use crying over spilt coke buddy
the lady made her choice and were all gonna have to move on
well i aint moving
you want to fight me for her
was that not clear
to sex bob omb was that not clear
sex bob omb shake their heads
gideon stands up flexes
now why on earth do you want to do that
because im in love with her
ramona and scott lock eyes
a new power comes over scott
he reaches for the heart design printed on his ratty vintage t shirt and pulls a flaming blue sword from his own chest
scott earned the power of love
ramona looks away from scott
i think this deserves a song
kim scratches her head with her middle finger before grudgingly launching into a number
we are sex bob omb we are here to make money and sell out and stuff
kim clicks out a fast tempo
sex bob omb begin to rock out
scott swings at them with his flaming blue sword
he slashes at them to the beat exploding each attacker into coins
scott then runs up the side of the pyramid towards gideon
ramona hands gideon a cane with g man engraved on the handle
he unsheathes a sword that could not have fit in there
scott and gideon leap towards each other
gideon descends like a vulture and smashes the sword out of scotts hands
scott hits the ground hard rolling to a stop
your club sucks by the way
gideon approaches to administer a final blow
if my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically canadian sensibilities then i shall grant you a swift exit from the premises
and fast entrance into helllllll
gideon raises his sword
then from above
knives chau sails into frame and kicks the sword out of gideons hands
she lands awkwardly tripping and falling down the side of the pyramid
that is priceless
scott looks to knives both concerned and amazed
she quickly recovers and points a furious finger
youll pay for what you did to him
listen kung pao chicken your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself
he was warned plenty of times
but did he listen
did he f im not talking to you
im talking to her
angle on a confused ramona standing behind gideon
knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked ramona
youre kidding right
knives pulls out knives and charges
ramona fights defensively redirecting knives parries without harming her
you cant say i dont know how to put on a show
gideon lashes out at scott
he can barely block gideons tremendous blows distracted by his duelling exes
what the hell is your deal
you stole him with your advanced american slut technology
the fighters weave in and out of each other throwing blocks and punches kung fu style
i dont know what youre talking about i didnt steal anyone
scott lands a kick to gideons chest sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid
he then blocks a punch from knives to ramona and spins her away separating them
can we please stop all this fighting
nobody stole anybody
knives i dated you and then i dated ramona
maybe i kind of forgot to tell knives right away but
then you cheated on me scott
you cheated on both of us
knives and ramona both look at scott neither amused
you cheated on me with knives
i cheated on knives
is there a difference
you werent wronged
scott breaks into a flop sweat
knives and ramona stare at scott
a sword pierces scotts chest from behind
you can cheat on these ladies all you want but you cant
scott slides off gideons sword and falls to the ground
everything goes white
sand blows through frame
scotts eyes blink open
he looks up into a blinding blue sky
scott sits up next to a lone cactus rubbing his temples
ramona appears out of nowhere fainter than before
dying probably sucks
you know what sucks
getting killed by that guy
well maybe now would be the time to get into it
seeing as im about to die
the truth is it was me who was obsessed
i was crazy about him
but he ignored me
i was more alone when we were together than i ever was on my own
thats why i had to leave
and thats when he started paying attention
so why go back
i cant help myself around him scott
has a way of getting into my head
well thats legitimately disappointing
i really will leave you alone forever now
i mean he literally has a way of getting into my head
ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head revealing a blinking chip implanted on her skull
that is evil
hes like that
ramona covers the chip self consciously touching her hair
so this kinda sucks for everybody eh
im sorry it had to end this way
we had a good run i guess
you cant say i didnt try
i really fought for you back there
the winds blow harder ramona seeming to fade away
but someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there
scotts eyes go wide with epiphany knives
i wish i was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you
ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand
i feel like i learned something
which would be great if i wasnt dead
ramona is gone
scott slumps to his knees
the pilgrim head appears and rotates around scott
we flash back to scott swiping the pilgrim head then fast forward through the breakup with ramona and sex bob omb
we hear scott screaming throughout this magical restart
we fast forward all the way to wallaces apartment as scott enters
he flicks the light on
turn off the light
scott flicks the light off
on pitch black
wallace when my journey began i was living in an ordinary world
ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure a call i considered refusing
but my mentor thats you told me if i want something bad enough i have to fight for it
so i did
there were tests allies enemies
i approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal during which i totally seized the sword
sadly i died
then i resurrected
now i realize what i should have been fighting for all along
but before i do that i need to ask one final favor of you
sure thing guy
could you put a robe on and hand me the phone
wallace flicks on a bedside lamp hands him the phone
tell him scott pilgrim is calling
i was just about to hey pal
i feel terrible about everything
i dont want any hard feelings so i figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call
sorry what i meant to say is im coming over to kill you
scott hangs up and heads for the door hardcore
wallace stands to high five scott exposing his junk
you seen one
scott pilgrim runs towards the desolate warehouses
the same hipster kid smokes a cigarette against the wall
your hair looks stupid
the hipster kid explodes into coins
scott approaches the two hipster kids guarding the elevator
scott split kicks them in the faces knocking them out
scott exits the elevator and steps into gideons yeah their first album is so scott knocks down comeau and looks to sex bob omb
let it go
i know what im doing
stephen the new line up rocks
you guys sound better without me
you have learned well
from this point forward you shall be known as neil
kim looks at scott deadpan as ever
sorry about me
kim smiles at scott for the first time ever
scott turns to gideon on his throne ramona at his side
hey buddy welcome to the chaos save it
youre pretentious the club sucks i have beef lets do it
scott goes straight into fight mode
you want to fight me for her
ramona and scott lock eyes
a strange new power overcomes scott different than before
i want to fight you for me
scott reaches for the heart design printed on his ratty t shirt and pulls a flaming red sword from his own chest
scott earned the power of self respect
kim drives a hardcore beat
sex bob omb rock the fuck out
hipsters attack scott pilgrim to the beat
scott swings his flaming red sword exploding each attacker into coins
ramona hands gideon his cane
he unsheathes his sword
scott and gideon run towards each other leaping in the air
they pass in the air and scott slashes
they land on opposite sides of the platform backs to each other
hows it going back there
gideon falls down
scott calls out
i know youre in here
dont attack ra knives sails through the air and kicks ramona in the head super hard
we hear a metallic klonk
they square off ramona staggered knives pulling knives
steal my boyfriend taste my steel
scott jumps between them hands held out
knives tries to go around him
scott grabs her wrists
she kicks him in the face
this fat ass hurt me and i will have my revenge
i hurt you
i cheated on you
knives steps back stunned
you cheated on me scott
i cheated on both of you
and im sorry
i was a different guy back then
knives frown melts
scott turns to ramona
youre not a fat ass
she didnt mean that
so are we all good
ramona rubs the back of her head
the chip no longer blinks
never felt better
are we all done with the hugging and learning
i thought we had a fight going here
all turn to see gideon bloodied but still grinning a lopsided slash across his face accentuating his smirk
oh you got a fight alright
scott steps into a fighting stance
knives joins him
are you with me
ramona looks to gideon then joins scott and knives and strikes a fight pose the three of them ready to rumble
wrong move baby
scott attacks with his sword
gideon blocks disarms scott with one move spins and butts scott in the face with the hilt of the sword
scott teeters on the edge of the pyramid
knives throws her knives
gideons lightning fast sword deflects them shing shing
gideon wheels towards ramona expecting her to move
she looks doubtful takes a hesitant step towards him
youre still my girl
ramona steps up to gideon and whispers in his ear
lets both be girls
ramona knees gideon in the balls
gideon swings his sword at ramona
knives whips off her scarf uses it to wrap up gideons sword arm and disarms him
scott and knives punch gideon in the face in a volley of knives kicks gideon in the stomach and scott follows with a punch in the nose sending gideon sliding
across the floor
gideon gets back to his feet via backflip
he shakes off the assault and grins
you made me swallow me gum
thats going to be in my digestive tract for seven years
gideon throws a series of wushu moves that give him a power up his glasses glow his health bar increases
he makes an x with his fingers and a draws a new power up sword
he cuts big arcs at scott knives and ramona
they barely dodge him
scott spies his sword and picks it up just in time to block gideons attack
the swords create an x
gideon blocks knocking her down
gideon swings at scott
knives attacks and scores a hit
gideon hits her back dropping her
gideon spins low
scott leaps in the air
gideon spins again and swings upward
scott blocks with his sword and is sent up into the air
gideon jumps after him
they clash in the air
scotts sword shatters
scott lands hard
gideon lands in front of him and raises his sword for the kill
ramona swings gideons velvet rope cancelling out gideons digital sword
gideon slaps ramona in the face and sends her painfully tumbling down the pyramid
she lands painfully at the bottom
knives and scott share a look
they get up and circle gideon
freeze frame punches knives kicks and scott punches sending gideon back and forth like a pinball kick punch kick punch kick
gideons face smashes with each impact
ramona rises to see scott and knives kicking ass
scott slides knives through gideons legs
from the floor she kicks him in the back of the head then upends him like a wheelbarrow and kicks him in the face sending him spinning
gideon lands hard on his knees defeated
one lens of his glasses cracks
he looks up at the steely eyed scott
who do you think you are pilgrim
you think youre better than me
ill tell you what you are
a pain in my ass
you know how long it took to get all the evil exes contact information so i could form this stupid league
like two hours
gideon starts to pixellate quite badly
not long now
youre not cool enough for ramona
im whats hip
im whats happening
im blowing up right now
im not cool enough for ramona
and you got another thing right
you are blowing up
scott spins and back heels gideon in the face
gideons head explodes his glasses sailing down the steps of the pyramid
then his body follows suit in an almighty shimmering coins rain down
scott and knives kiss
there goes our deal
were still getting paid right
kim points to the falling coins
there goes our deal
stills jumps off stage and picks up coins
the coin rain continues silhouetting scott and knives in their kung fu poses
they share a smile
you two make a good combo
ramona awake now makes her way towards them
the trio walk down the pyramid steps
scott picks up gideons fallen glasses
the glasses glimmer
gideons voice echoes
you can defeat me
but can you defeat
scott peers into the glimmering lenses spotting his evil mirror image staring back at him
the glasses dissolve and scott whips around to face
negascott walks towards scott knives and ramona
knives and ramona flank scott in a fighting stance
this is something i have to face on my own
the girls reluctantly exit stage left as scott walks forward to confront his dark side
scott and negascott face off
both take a step forward
knives and ramona huddle in the snow outside chaos theatre
they look expectantly at the entrance worried for scott
scott strolls out with negascott
they chat amiably shake hands and part ways
scott approaches knives and ramona
we just shot the shit
hes a super nice guy
we actually have a lot in common
scott runs his fingers through his hair
its getting really shaggy
scotts hat appears on his head
he looks totally freked
i like it
knives removes the hat from scotts head literally taking his guard down
ramona sees this and smiles
scott smiles then realizes ramona has gone
he turns to see her pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness
scott calls after her
steps tentatively away from knives
where are you going
ramona hoping to slip away stops and turns back
i should probably disappear
after all that
its hard you know
i came here to get away but the past keeps catching up
im tired of people getting hurt because of me
ramona looks at knives as she says this
i think i understand
snow begins to fall
ramona straightens his parka tenderly
i should tahnk you though
for being the nicest guy i ever dated
thats kind of sad
it is kind of sad
she takes his hand briefly then lets it drop
bye and stuff
she turns to walk off again
scott watches then hears go get her
surprised scott turns back to see a smiling knives
you earned it
youve been fighting for her all along
but what about you
totally sweet and sad ill be fine
im too cool for you anyway
she grins and kisses his cheek
theres someone out there for me
we hear a cough young neil sidles into frame behind her
guitar still in hand
we hear a nd cough nega scott also sidles into frame
knives doesnt look back but urges scott to go talk to her
before shes gone
ramona walks on into the night alone but then hey
mind if i tag along
ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery scott walk alongside
you want to come with me
i thought maybe we could
she holds out her hand like in the park scene earlier
scott takes it
we see the door with the star on it standing right in the middle of the street snow swirling around it
scott and ramona walk towards the door sunrise coming up over toronto night magically turning to day winter turning to spring
over this magical transformation we hear a lush rendition of ramona swelling and hear whispers of gossip over torontos cell phone airwaves
oh my god can i blow your mind
scott pilgrim totally threw down with gideon graves at the grand opening of chaos theater
yeah it was apparently awesome
oh my god it was a huge fight
i mean bananas
my little brother kicked a guys head off
it was unbelievable
someone seriously should have been filming it
scott and ramona walk through the door
tilt up to the heavens and reveal the continue graphic in the stars
