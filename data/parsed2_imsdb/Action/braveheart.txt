by randall wallace early draft epic beauty cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky fringed with pink as if the clouds were a lid too small for the earth a
cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in deep green grass and the blue lochs reflecting the sky
we hear a voice husky scottish
i will tell you of william wallace
a farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a scottish valley
riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are scottish noblemen in full regalia eye popping tartans sparkling chestplates
even the horses are draped in scarlet
behind each nobleman rides a single page boy
historians from england will say i am a liar
but history is written by those who have hung heroes
another noble rides in from the opposite side
two more appear down the road converging on the barn
the king of scotland had died without a son and the king of england a cruel pagan known as edward the longshanks claimed the throne for himself
scotlands nobles fought him and fought each other over the crown
so longshanks invited them to talks of truce
no weapons one page only
the nobles eye each other cautiously but the truce holds
they enter the barn with their pages
nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and barn and outbuildings of a well run farm
the farmer malcolm wallace and his nineteen year old son john both strong tough men are riding away from the farm
they hear hooves behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them
among the farmers of that shire was malcolm wallace a commoner with his own lands and two sons john
we favor john wallace the nineteen year old sitting easily on his horse beside his father
william a skinny eight year old riding bareback catches up to his father and older brother
told ya to stay
i finished my chores
where we goin
he was supposed to visit when the truce was over
they ride on over the lush hills
the horses are all gone the place looks deserted
up on the hill we see the three wallaces looking down
he means william
he and his elder son spur their horses
the wallaces ride up looking around
malcolm finds a pitchfork john the woodpile axe
pov from within as the door opens and a widening block of sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows
malcolm and john wallace step in and are shocked to see
hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty scottish noblemen and thirty pages their faces purple and contorted by the strangulation hanging their tongues protruding
malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger john still grips the axe as he follows his father through the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back
row to see the one man in commoners dress like theirs
a shuffle john spins william has entered the back door
get out of here
why would macandrews make so many scarecrows
before his father and brother can think of anything to say william with a boys curiosity touches the spurred foot of the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in
its too solid he takes a real look at the face and suddenly r real
he turns to run but knocks back into the feet of the hanged man behind him
in blind panic he darts in another direction and runs into another corpse and another the hanged men begin to swing making it harder for williams father and older brother
to fight their way to him
then worst of all william sees the pages boys like himself hanged in a row behind their masters
finally his father and brother reach william and hug him tight
there in the barn among the swinging bodies of the hanged nobles malcolm wallace grips his sons
murderin english bastards
the cottage looks peaceful the windows glowing yellow into the night
from outside the house we see john rise and close the shutters of the kitchen where men are gathered
we pan up to the upper bedroom window
young william is in nightmarish sleep
he mumbles in smothered terror he twitches
we see in the blue grays of his dream william stands at the door of the barn gazing at the hanged knights
we whip pan to their faces garish horrible
then one of the heads moves and its eyes open
william wants to run but he cant get his body to respond
and the hanging nobleman his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips moans
william tears himself from sleep looking around swallowing back his tears and panic
a dozen strong tough farmers have huddled
red headed campbell scarred and missing fingers is stirred up while his friend macclannough is reluctant
wallace is right
we fight em
every nobleman who had any will to fight was at that meeting
so its up to us
we show them we wont lie down to be their slaves
we cant beat an army not with the fifty farmers we can raise
we dont have to beat em just fight em
to show em were not dogs but men
young wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the stairs
he sees his father drip his finger into a jug of whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop
they have a camp here
we attack them at sunset tomorrow
give us all night to run home
malcolm and john have saddled horses they are checking the short swords theyve tucked into grain sacks when william comes out of the barn with his own horse
william youre staying here
i can fight
these words from his youngest son make malcolm pause and kneel to look into williams eyes
but its our wits that make us men
i love ya boy
malcolm and john mount their horses and ride away leaving william looking forlorn
they wave he waves back
its strangely quiet until william and his friend hamish campbell a red headed like his father race up the hillside and duck in among a grove of trees
breathless gasping they press their backs to the tree bark
william peers around a tree then shrinks back and whispers
three maybe more
theyre english soldiers aint they
with your father and brother gone theyll kill us and burn the farm
its up to us hamish
hamish leans forward for a look but william pulls him back
here he comes be ready
they wait heavy footsteps
then from around the edge of the grove three enormous ugly hogs appear
the boys hurling rotten eggs
the eggs slap the snouts of the pigs who scatter as the boys charge howling
we pull back
as the sun goes down on their play
the boys walk toward the house beneath a lavender sky
wanna stay with me tonight
i wanna have supper waitin
well get those english pigs tomorrow
aye well get em
williams face appears at the window looking toward of trees and heather where there is no sign of life
william has cooked stew in a pot and now spoons up two steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table
but he is only hoping
he looks out the window again he is still all alone
so he leaves a candle burning on the table beside the stew and moves up the stairs
the house is silent fog rolling around it in the dawn
william has been awake all night afraid to sleep
he rises and in quick cuts he dresses he moves down the hall stops at the door of his fathers bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed
he moves on passing the door of his brothers room also unrumpled
he finds the two cold bowls of stew beside the exhausted candle
he spoons up his own cold porridge and eats alone
william is in the barn loft shoveling corn down to feed the hogs while he glimpses something coming
an ox cart is coming down the curving lane
its driver is campbell with macclannough walking behind it
the farmers glance up at william their faces grim
from his perch in the loft william sees that the neighbors have brought the bodies of his father and brother
the cart stops campbell with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing studies the back of the ox as if it could tell
him how to break such news
the butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter of fact
come down here lad
william looks away he takes quick breaths he looks back
but the bodies are still there
its now surrounded by horses wagons and neighbors
the undertaker arrives in his hearse
on a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them
cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut pennies cover their eyes
softly william enters the shed drawn to his father and brother
campbell follows him in wanting to stop him but what can he say now
the undertaker goes on with his work
william approaches the table the bodies dont look real to him
he sees the wounds
the dried blood
the undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the blood
but the wounds remain
close on a grave with a headstone marked anne wallace
we include the two new graves freshly dug beside it and see the mourners gathered before them
the sight of the boy standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the
ground beside her has all of the neighbors shaken
the local parish priest drones mechanically in latin
the farmers who were secretly gathered in malcolm wallaces kitchen the previous night are now glancing at william but no one is anxious to adopt a grieving a rebellious boy
behind macclannough are his wife and two daughters his youngest is barely four not half williams age shes a beautiful girl with long auburn hair and she clings to her
own mothers hand as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too
restare in pacem eternis amen
with the final amen the neighbors drift from the graveside pulling their children along to give william a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies
the boy stands alone over the open graves his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry a single tear makes its way down his face
and the tiny girl feels for william in a way that the adults cannot
from the ground she pulls a scottish thistle moves to the softly weeping william and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand
william looks up and their young eyes meet her sad blue eyes hold williams as the grave diggers cover the bodies
then a lone mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them
tall thin and angular in black clerical garb he looks like the grim reaper
the girl hurries back to her mothers side everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them
he is argyle wallace
he looks like a human buzzard his face craggy permanently furious
you must be the relative of the deceased
william this is your uncle argyle
argyle glowers at the man dismounts and glares at william
william stares up at this frightening figure
they are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses a dozen mounted english soldiers armed with lances are approaching
argyle rattles to the priest
you were wise to hurry
the soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down from their saddles haughty menacing their leader brusque
someone dead from this household
we just had a funeral isnt that what it means in england as well
what it means in england and in scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands
we were ambushed last night
but the scots dragged their dead away
my brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over
then well just have a peek at the wounds
to his men dig em up
theyve been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of gods church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation
so please do it
outmaneuvered the leader reins his horse away
several of the farmers spit on the ground
argyle glares at them
william and argyle are sitting at the table eating
argyle has laid out a proper meal with exact place settings
not that spoon that ones for soup
dip away from you
and dont slurp
argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy
well sleep here tonight
youll come home with me
well let the house and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors
i dont want to leave
didnt want your father to die either did ya
but it happened
argyle pushes his food away he has no appetite now
did the priest say anything about the resurrection
or was it all about judgment
it was in latin sir
non loquis latinum
you dont speak latin
we have to fix that wont we
beat did he give the poetic benediction
the lord bless thee and keep thee
patris benefactum et beat it was malcolms favorite
argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed he stands awkwardly idle as william scrubs his face at the washstand and crawls into bed
good night uncle
argyle grunts and starts out
then he stops turns back leans down over william
and with great tenderness the grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair
argyle sits by the hearth staring at the embers
he holds the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother
he looks at the handle like a cross
the lord bless thee and keep thee
tears of grief spill down the old mans cheeks
once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn looking at the garish hanged faces in his nightmare
then a mangled hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder william gasps but the hand holds him gently
he turns to see his father and his brother
they are wounded bloody but they smile at him theyre alive
weeping in joy william reaches to hug them but his father stretches forth a forbidding hand
william keeps reaching out helplessly
his father and brother move past him to the hanged knights
two empty nooses are there
before the boys weeping eyes they put their heads into the nooses and hoist themselves up
williams grief explodes his tears erupt and tears flooding down his face
still upset still grieving he gets up and goes looking for his uncle
william moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping
he opens the door
the bed has been slept in but his uncle is not there
he moves downstairs to but his uncle is not there either
then william hears a strange haunting sound distant carried by the wind
he moves to the window and sees only moonlight
he opens the window and hears it more clearly bagpipes
william lights a candle and throws open the door
wind rushes in blowing out his candle
but he hears the pipes louder in the wind
william is barefoot and in only his nightshirt but the sound of the pipes is growing louder
he moves through the moonlight drawn toward the graveyard
he stops as he realizes this then forces himself on
william moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are buried and discovers a haunting scene two dozen men the farmer warriors of his neighborhood are gathered in
kilts and among them a core of bagpipers
the pipes wail an ancient scottish dirge a tune of grief and redemption a melody known to us as amazing grace
uncle argyle has heard them and walked out too he stands at the fringes of the torchlight still holding the massive broadsword
he glances down noticing william as the boy moves up beside him
what are they doing
saying goodbye in their own way in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
the farmers file by the graveside crossing themselves each whispering his own private prayer
argyle whispers half to william and half to himself
your daddy and i we saw our own father buried like this dead from fighting the english
william takes the sword from his uncle and tries to lift it
slowly argyle takes the sword back
first learn to use this
he taps william on the temple with the tip of his finger
then i will teach you to use this
with an experts easy fluidity he lifts the huge sword
it glistens in the torchlight
the music plays the notes hanging in the air swirling in the scottish breeze as if rising towards the stars
william and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon
william has a bundle of clothes in his lap and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back
but he does glance back just once to see the deserted farmhouse
amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords with gemstones sparkling everywhere we hear
twelve years later longshanks supervised the wedding of his eldest son also named edward who would succeed him to the throne
longshanks king of england stands in the jeweled light of the ancient abbey
known as longshanks because of the spindly legs that make him almost seven feet tall he has a hawks nose and a snakes eyes punctuating a face of distinct cruelty
historians of his day considered him and the line of plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers
as bride for his son longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival the king of france
genevieve a nineteen year old virgin of stupendous beauty moves down the aisle the light in her face outshining her blindingly white wedding gown
as she reaches the altar her hands tremble but she maintains her poise and control
she looks toward edward prince of wales
pampered young men surround him as his retinue
he takes her hand coldly and goes through the ceremony under his fathers stare
it was widely whispered that for the princess to conceive longshanks would have to do the honors himself
that may have been what he had in mind all along
the ceremony concluding attendants lift back the brides veil
her wedding day the ultimate moment and prince edward ignores her to turn back to his friends
but prompted by one of the sour lords he leans over and pecks his new princess on the cheek
for an instant we see in her eyes that her heart is dying
but she keeps her poise
having seen to his obligations to provide for a successor longshanks set about his fondest business to crush scotland and turn his power against france
longshanks narrow finger jabs scotland
we are in the longshanks is being listened to by his advisors all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress and all deathly afraid of him
the french will grovel to anyone with strength
but how will they credit our strength when we cannot rule the whole of our own island
he punches the map then sees the princess enter softly
where is my son
your pardon mlord he asked me to come in his stead
longshanks eyes expand in fury it is frightening to see
i sent for him and the little coward send you
shall i leave mlord
if he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how
i will deal with him
he spins back toward his generals
ignored the princess settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat
nobles are the key to the scottish door
grant their nobles land here in england
give our own nobles estates in the north
make them too greedy to oppose us
one old advisor speaks up hesitantly
our nobles will be reluctant to relocate
new lands mean new taxes and they are taxed already for our war in france
longshanks glares at him but takes the point
the wheels grind in his brain his dark eyes falling on the princess he is inspired
perhaps its time to reinstitute an old custom
grant them prima noctes first night
when any common girl inhabiting their lands is married our lords shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding
that should fetch just the kind of lords we want in scotland
the prince and a muscular young friend phillip are stripped to the waist and fencing
they pay no attention to the knock or to the princess as she enters
she watches them they are dancing more than fencing
edward loses his sword it clatters to the polished floor
he looks up at his wife as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness
what is it
you directed me to report to you the moment the kings conference was ended
so i did
and what was so important about it
he intends but edward and his friend are fencing again the clanging of their blunted swords so loud that she cant hear herself
he intends to grant edward loses his weapon again and whirls on her
shut up would you
how can i concentrate
his majesty was quite keen that you should understand all so very boring
he wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
for an instant anger flares into her eyes
she glances at edward and at the young man with him then lowers her eyes and starts to back out
but edward has noticed
she stops but does not raise her eyes
do you disapprove of phillip
he lifts his hand and draws his friend phillip to his side
still the princess does not lift her eyes
barely audible no mlord
look at me
i said look at me
she lifts her eyes
but she could not brace herself enough for what she sees edward nuzzling phillip the princes bare chest to his muscular friends bare back both men glistening with sweat and
the princesss eyes quiver
but she does not look away
now my flower do you understand
i had thought that
i was loathsome to you
perhaps i am
if i may be excused mlord
she starts to leave as quietly as she came
but her husband calls after her
dont worry mlady it is my royal responsibility to breed
and i assure you when the time comes i shall
she closes the door softly on her husband and his lover
now in edinburgh were gathered the council of scottish nobles
the picturesque heart of scotland with its castle on a fairy tale plateau above the firth of forth
the nobles are gathered around a huge table
they rise at the entrance of young robert the bruce a handsome young man full of intelligence and power
among these was robert the th earl of bruce a leading contender for the crown of scotland
robert strides to his seat in the center of the table and the others settle in respectfully
mornay another young warrior gives him a bow as does craig a grizzled noble
young robert we are honored my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
the balliol clan has endorsed the right licking longshanks boots so he will support their claim to the throne
if we make a show of opposition the commoners will favor us
it is too soon to step out alone
my father believes we must lull longshanks into confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it
a wise plan
and how is your father
we have missed him at the council
he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride
but he sends his greetings and says that i speak for all the bruces
and for scotland
flutes and dancing laughter and garlands village families have gathered for a wedding celebration we see the happy bride and groom
farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of cheese villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of smoked fish
and watching the people are ubiquitous english soldiers battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears
riding along the road comes william wallace
grown now a man
he sits his horse as if born there his back straight his hands relaxed on the reins
he has a look of lean rippled power
he looks dangerous
and the soldiers notice him nudging each other as he passes
he carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle he stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the scene
farmers are roasting a pig women are comparing handiwork young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional highland games and everyone is noticing williams arrival especially the farm women
with daughters of marriageable age
among those watching william arrive is campbell grown older now and with his old rebel friend macclannough
william dismounts and ties his horse to a willow
one of the english soldiers shoves william from behind
you hunt this bird
williams eyes fix themselves on the soldier
its against the law for scots to own bows
you shot this bird
his buddies enjoying their role as intimidators grab the bird and begin to search it for evidence
i hit it in the head
with a rock
they dont believe that but they cant find any puncture wound on the bird
william reaches his hand out for the return of the bird
the soldiers drop it onto the ground
slowly william picks it up and heads into the clearing
the farmers watch him come
among those noticing williams arrival but pretending not to is marion macclannough grown now into a stunning young woman her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long ago
she wears it the same way straight and full down her back
her dress is plain like the grass that surrounds a wildflower
shes the most beautiful girl in the village maybe in all of scotland and the soldiers who hassled william notice her too
william reaches the food table and contributes his goose to the feast
farm women eye him he nodes to one
you look well
its william wallace back home
have you met my daughter
the daughter mentioned is missing teeth
william nods to her
its impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright as her hopes and she lowers her head in disappointment
but then raises her face in surprise as william takes her hand and gives her a respectful bow
he moves away from the table passing through the crowd like a stranger
then he glances toward the knot of girls
he sees marion
she sees him then looks away
do they remember each other
he moves toward her she is shy her eyes downcast but then she raises them and looks at him
they move closer and closer together
just as they are about to reach each other a huge round stone thumps to the earth at williams feet
he looks up to see one of marions suitors the broad muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in williams way
now everybodys looking to see how william will handle the challenge
he tries to move around but the guy cuts him off
then william thinks he recognizes the big red head
it is his old friend but hamish wont admit it or be put off from the challenge
he points to the huge stone
test of manhood
blocks him call it a test of soldiery then
the english wont let us train with weapons so we train with stones
the test of a soldier is not in his arm
he taps his temple
hamish stretches out his hand as if to show william something in his palm
with a sudden movement he slams his fist into williams jaw dropping him
a few men move to interfere but campbell macclannough and the other farmers who are the true leaders here stop their neighbors from interrupting
hamish stands over william waiting for him to get up
a contest then
william stands and hoists the huge stone eighteen inches in diameter
straining with the effort he lugs the stone to the line scratched in the rocky field
beyond the line are the muddy dents from previous tosses
william takes a run and heaves the stone
it flies past the other marks in the field people are impressed
william looks at hamish
i still say this is no test
a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can
that depends on the man
hamish walks out lifts the stone and lugs it back to the line
he takes a run and heaves with a great groan
the stone flies passing williams mark by a couple of feet
people laugh and whistle
william nods impressed
can you do it when it matters
as it matters in battle
could you crush a man with that throw
i could crush you like a roach
william walks to the dent made by hamishs throw
then do it
come do it
hamish scowls at william at everybody watching
he lifts the stone and carries it back to the line
william stands calmly
hamish backs up for his run
youll move i will not
hamish backs up a few more feet for a longer run
thats not fair
hes tired he should get a longer run
william seems completely unafraid
he leans down picks up a small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually
stung by this show of calm hamish takes furious run and heaves
the stone flies through the air just misses williams head and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him
william never flinches
the people cheer
hamish is miffed its like william won
i threw longer than last time
an ox is strong but not clever
an ox is stupid enough to just stand in one place
thats not the point
william turns walks double the distance hamish threw and turns and hurls the rock he holds
it whistles through the air hits hamish in the forehead and drops him like a shot
everybody cheers and laughs
they surround william
a fine display young wallace
william takes a tankard of ale from a farmer walks over and tosses the cold liquid into hamishs face he wakes and his eyes uncrossing accepts williams hand pulling him
good to see you again
i shoulda remembered the eggs
grinning they embrace
music plays the dancing begins
william walks to the knot of young ladies
but passes marion and moves to the girl with the missing teeth
would you honor me with a dance
shes thrilled to accept they begin to dance
youve taken over your fathers farm
beat they say he died long ago
fighting the english
he died in an accident with my brother
their cart turned over
the musicians interrupt their playing a group of heavily armed horsemen with banners and flying colors ride up reining their horses into the middle of the celebration
in the middle of the group is an english nobleman he is gray in his fifties and stops in front of the bride and groom
i have come to claim the right of prima noctes
as the lord of these lands i will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the first night of her union
stewart father of the bride lunges forward
no by god
the horsemen point their lances at the unarmed scots who see that the english soldiers from the village have moved to the edge of the gathering as if to dare
it is my noble right
even unarmed stewart is about to attack but the bride intervenes
she grabs her father and whispers to him
she moves to her husband and does the same
holding back tears she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen
marion macclannough is looking on sobered by her friends courage and sickened by her fate and marion is even more unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers a
particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face is leering at her
william wallace sees this too
the noble and his escorts ride away and as they do it begins to rain
the celebration destroyed the scots gather the food and disperse to their homes
but wallace remains standing in the downpour keeping his thoughts to himself
the farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn
william stands at the open door and gazes out at the rain it leaks on him through his roof he doesnt seem to notice
a thatched cottage lit with a cozy fire beneath the rain
a hand knocks on the door and macclannough opens it to find william on a horse
good evening sir
may i speak with your daughter
macclannough shoulders up beside her husband and marion appears behind her scowling parents
would you like to go for a ride on this fine evening
the boys insane
its good scottish weather madam the rain is fallin straight down
she absolutely may not shell marion
marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door she runs out to hop up behind william and they gallop away
william and marion race along the heather up and down hills through swollen streams
the rain stops as the sun sets the scottish mists lift revealing stunning natural beauty
william stops the horse and they look out over it all together
he speaks without turning to face her
your father doesnt like me does he
its not you
he dislikes that youre a wallace
he just says
the wallaces dont seem to live for very long
thank you for accepting
thank you for inviting
ill invite you again but your mother thinks im crazy
and ill come again
he lingers he wants to say something or maybe he just doesnt want the moment to end
finally he spurs the horse
they reach the door
william hops off the horse and reaches up to help her down the moment she touches the ground they look into each others eyes
but the door is snatched open so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss
marion come in
he walks her closer to the door
they turn and look at each other again
she waits for him to kiss her
marion come in
she still hesitates he isnt going to kiss her
she starts in but he grabs her hand
and into it he puts something he has taken from his pocket it is wrapped in flannel
he hops on his horse glances at her and gallops away
she stands in the open doorway she looks down at what he left her
she unwraps the flannel it is a dried thistle the one she gave him years before
william is re thatching the roof of his barn when he hears riders approaching and looks down to see that it is macclannough backed by campbell and hamish
young wallace sir i know it was strange of me to invite marion to ride last night
i assure you i macclannoughs daughter is another matter
we come to fetch you to a meeting
what kind of meeting
the secret kind
william goes back to repairing his roof
your father was a fighter
and a patriot
i know who my father was
i came back home to raise crops
and god willing a family
if i can live in peace i will
campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away with hamish
if you can keep your intention to stay out of the troubles you may court my daughter
if you break your intention ill kill you
macclannough rides away
william sits down on the roof and looks out at the graves of his father and brother
outside the half timbered house william stands in the shadows of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper window
marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the vines dropping into williams arms
giggling suppressing laughter they run to the trees
hand in hand through the heather they run silhouettes along a ridge their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight the scottish wind whipping through their hair
they stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice overlooking a loch gleaming in the moonlight
so beautiful its sacred
youve been here before
i have dreams
mostly dreams i dont want
i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep id dream only of the ride and the adventure
did it work
you dont choose your dreams
your dreams choose you
he looks at her
they kiss suddenly so long and hard that they tumble into the heather rolling devouring each other
through their passion
to marry you
accept your proposal
im not just saying it
but i wont give you up to any nobleman
stopping you scare me
i dont want to scare you
i want to be yours and you mine
every night like this one
this night is too beautiful to have again
i will be with you like this
they kiss again
marion moves through the market
english soldiers admire her as she walks
she stops looking at white lace and cloth
william casually passes poking a note in her basket
subtly she withdraws his note and reads tonight
by the trees
marion slips out of the house and runs to the trees where william waits with horses
she fetches a bundle shes stashed in the crook of a tree and they mount and ride off
the church is at the base of the precipice beside the loch
this ancient gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by the occupying army and yet it looks devoutly holy this way lit only by candles and moonlight through the open
the village priest whom we saw at the wedding celebration is waiting at the altar
marion steps into the confessional as william moves to the altar and kneels in prayer
marion emerges shes changed into the wedding dress she made from the cloth she bought
william stands and watches her float down the aisle his whole life was worth this moment
together the two lovers turn to the priest
you have come to pledge each to the other before almighty god
from within his shirt william withdraws a strip of cloth woven in his family tartan
he and marion each lift a hand to the priest and he binds their wrists with the cloth
i will love you my whole life
you and no other
from her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief embroidered with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those years ago
and i you
you and no other
the priest waits for them to go on but neither can theyre too taken with emotion looking at each other
the priest intones holy phrases
agus bhayd lauch
the lord bless and keep thy love now and forever
the lovers kiss
as they break their embrace a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church and william spins as if to attack but the priest
catches his arm they see the man carries bagpipes
i trust him or ida killed him meself
a weddin needs pipes
the piper begins to play and the tune from his primitive chanter is wispy ethereal beautiful
the lovers look into each others eyes as the single melody of the pipes merges into a swell of music underscoring montage william and marion ride the path to the
top of the precipice where in the shelter of the grove they spend their honeymoon
the music continues as still sweaty from their love making he returns her to her house just before dawn
she waves from her window as william rides away as we its market day in the village busy with highlanders merchants of all kinds and a few special attractions like
jugglers and fortune tellers
marion moves along a table full of flowers and fruit
william concealed behind hanging baskets watches her unseen savoring the beauty of his beloved bathing his soul in the sight of her
then she looks up and spots him her smile sudden and luminous before she remembers to conceal it
he moves up beside her
ive missed you
its only been a day
beat and its seemed like forever
my parents are growing suspicious
i cant keep meeting you every night
playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their wedding which she now wears hidden around
tucking in the cloth strip she hurries away smiling
they spot marion moving through the fair glowing beautiful
the soldiers smirk at each other as marion passes one of them grabs her wrist
its the soldier with the scar the one whos been staring at her
where are you going
a second drunken soldier pipes up
why dont you marry my friend here
then ill take the first night
the scarred soldier pulls marion into his big arms she shoves him away with surprising strength and he staggers back to the laughter of his friends
then he snatches her again and kisses her hard on the lips
she breaks free and slaps him fiercely hard enough to draw blood from his mouth
tasting the trickle he slings her down against sacks of grain and the soldiers are all over her pinning her down ripping her clothes a full scale public gang rape
as the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at marion pull their knives keep them townspeople back
bitch who do you think you are
he slams his mouth down against hers for a long awful time comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body
and is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed
it takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what just happened and in that instant william is on them
he wrenches one soldiers arm in a direction it was never meant to go breaking the elbow separating the shoulder and slinging the howling soldier into his comrades
two of the soldiers leap at william swinging their short swords william ducks knocking their ale cask into their knees william lifts the whole table where they were sitting and
slams it into the faces of two more attackers
she shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier now bloodyfaced has recovered from the rock and is behind william with a knife
william sidesteps the first thrust snatches a leg from the shattered table and crushes the mans skull
but theres no time for celebration
theres blood and ale everywhere and the fallen soldiers are yelling
more soldiers hear the call and come running reinforcements converging from all over the village
will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws marion up onto its back
he slaps the horses rump and it plunges with marion into the twisting village lanes
william darts off through the crowd as the magistrate and more of his soldiers arrive dozens of them
william pauses out in the central street of the village just long enough to be sure theyve spotted him and darts into a side lane in the opposite direction marion
went william weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval town knocking over baskets jumping carts
as the soldiers stumble after him the magistrate looks down at his mangled soldiers
the one with the ruptured arm is lying in agony
the girl on the horse
the shout rings through the village marion hears it and when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane shes trying to take out of town she
urges the horse into an even narrower back alley
she sees a clear route to freedom
but the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there behind the shops rise into the horses face with a sudden thrashing of wings and the horse shies against
marion controls him but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail and as the frightened horse lunges forward again she is pulled off its bare
back her dress catching and ripping at the same time dropping her hard
reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the river the soldiers are running every which way but theyve lost him
thinking marions made it too william heads deeper into the trees
recovers her dress has torn free
she starts to get up but the soldiers pikes appear over her and the magistrate leers
so this is the little whore he was fighting for
william moves into the shelters of the trees expecting to see marion
he listens only the rustling of the wind through the treetops
nothing except the wind
marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an oak staff behind her elbows
she and two dozen soldiers are in the tavern the english have commandeered
the magistrate is a battlescarred veteran a brutal pragmatist angry with his corporal
one scot buggers six of us
hell to pay when that gets round
burn the village
but he is free
you never catch em in the highlands
he studies marion her mouth now stuffed with burlap
he notices the strip of cloth around her neck and touches the weave curiously
clans weave that cloth in their own patterns
so why is this strip concealed
beat he fought for you eh
the magistrate and his men bring marion into the village center and tie her to a post of the well
the townspeople dont want to be near the soldiers but they hang on the fringes of the square too curious to pull away
an assault on the kings soldiers is the same as assaulting the king
he looks down at marion her mouth bound her eyes defiant
he jerks out his dagger and slices marions throat
her eyes spring open like a does then she sags dead
the townspeople are speechless even some of the soldiers are shocked
the magistrate turns calmly to his men
let this scrapper come to me
from a distance we see hamish approaching the grove the same one where he and william played as boys
hamish moves reluctantly forcing himself forward as he reaches the grove william appears hurrying out to him
we stay in the long shot seeing william asking anxiously for any news and seeing hamishs great shoulders as he tells him something that makes william step backwards
at a barrier across the main road into the center of the village are twenty professional soldiers entrenched fully armed bows pikes swords
they hear a horses snort
he has stopped rock still
the soldiers hush there is something unsettling about this man alone staring at the twenty of them as if to steel himself for the butchery
wallace raises his sword screams
we favor wallaces subjective pov the barrier as his horse pounds toward it the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear
they stand to shoot at him with their bows the arrows whish toward the lens fly past
the arrows tear through wallaces clothes but dont catch his flesh
he charges on his horse leaps the barrier as wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword and hes more than an expert the tip at the end of a huge arc nearly
breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the corporals helmet taking off the upper half of his head
the soldiers try to rally to shoot him in the back as his horse leaps over them
one of them has sighted williams back
but hamish and his father crash into them
its a wild fight old campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder but keeps hacking with his sword hamish batters down two men and more scots arrive
they overwhelm the soldiers
he dodges obstacles in the narrow streets chickens carts barrels
soldiers pop up the first he gallops straight over the next he whacks forehand like a polo player the next chops down on his left side every time he swings
the broadsword a man dies
wallace gallops on his farmer neighbors and people from the village follow in his wake
the magistrate hears the approaching shouts
he and thirty more of his men are barricaded around the village square
dont look surprised
we knew hed bring friends
the see wallace gallop into sight but he stops then heads down a side street
the magistrate and his men dont like this where did he go
which way will he come from
and then they hear the horses and see the other scots at the head of the main street
the soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them
they are loading to fire again when wallace runs in on foot
and cuts down two soldiers
the other scots charge
the startled soldiers break and run in every direction
the magistrate abandoned runs too
not far along a twisting lane the bulky magistrate falters
he turns to fight and wallace slashes away his sword
i beg you
as the scots see wallace they break off pursuing the english soldiers and stop to watch dragging the magistrate by his hair wallace hauls him back into the village square
slams him against the well and stands over him with heaving lungs and wild eyes staring at marions murderer
wallaces eyes shift falling on marions blood in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street
wallace spins jerks back the magistrates head and cuts his throat with the sword
silenced by what theyve just seen and done
on old campbells face is a look of reverence and awe
say grace to god lads
weve just seen the coming of the messiah
william staggers a few steps and collapses to his knees
and then not just the scottish farmers but the townspeople too begin a strange hi lo chant
williams wild eyes slowly regain their focus
and there in the dirt beside the well he sees the severed cloth strip he gave to marion now stained with her blood
he lifts it crushes it in his hand as the highlanders chant for war
the villagers are still excited by what just happened at the blacksmiths forge men tend to campbells wound
pour it straight into the wound
i know it seems a waste of good whiskey but indulge me
they obey then take a glowing poker from the fire and run it through campbells shoulder where the arrow went
there is a terrible sizzle and campbell reacts to the pain
now thatll clear your sinuses lads
campbell looks down at his left hand
his thumb is missing
well bloody hell look at this
now its nothing but a fly swatter
wallace is sitting alone nearby staring at nothing
hamish moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder
wallace looks at his friend and looks away killing the magistrate did not bring marion back
shouts of alarm armed men are coming
the farmers scramble for their weapons ready to fight even campbell jumps up but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more farmers with hayhooks knives axes
anything they could find for weapons
their leader is macgregor
macgregor from the next valley
macgregor leads his men into the circle of rebels
we heard about what was happenin
and we dont want ya thinkin ya can have your fun without us
some of us are in this i cant help that now
but you can help yourselves
well have no homes left when the english garrison at the castle comes through to burn us out
they all look at wallace
furious preparations armorers pound breastplates hone spears grind swords in a shower of sparks
the garrison is led by bottoms the english lord who claimed the right of prima noctes
now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers
gather the horses
align the infantry
grabs a man ride to the lord governor in stirling
tell him that i will hang five rebels for every good englishman killed
form for march
the troops begin to scramble into the courtyard
at the same time the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the keepers to open it
they pull up the chains and the heavy gate rises
the messenger spurs his horse to gallop through and is hit in the chest with an axe
the scots hidden just outside the gate come pouring through led by wallace
arrows pick soldiers from their perches scots drop over the wall the surprise is so complete that its over almost without a fight
lord bottoms looks around in confusion
scots drag lord bottoms off his horse an arrow in a flexed bow jabs right up to his eye the archer ready to drive the shaft through bottoms eye socket
and into his brain but wallaces hand closes on the archers fingers and bottoms sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is none other than the highland farmgirl he forced into his bed on her wedding night
beside her is her husband holding a scythe red with english blood
on your way somewhere mlord
murdering bloody bandit
the point of wallaces sword jumps beneath the lords chin
my name is william wallace
i am no bandit who hides his face
find this man a horse
the green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire
william takes his hand from her bow and looks at her grief for marion in his eyes for the sake of that she does not release the string
give him a horse
hamish extends the reins of the lords thoroughbred
not this horse
he nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot
today we will spare you and every man who has yielded
go back to england
tell them scotlands daughters and her sons are yours no more
tell them scotland is free
as the scots cheer wallace throws lord bottoms onto the nags back and slaps the horses rear
it shambles away followed by the english survivors as the scots chant
wal lace wal lace wal lace
the marker is carved with the name marion macclannough and beneath her name a thistle is chiseled into the stone
bagpipes wail like banshees and the priest who married marion and william now mutters ancient prayers as her body wrapped in burial canvas is lowered into the earth under the
sad eyes of those who just fought in the battle
opposite william stands old macclannough he stares across the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter his eyes full of pain and then staggers away
wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief
from within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief she gave him and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave her
he places the strip over her heart and as the gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to its spot over his own heart
prince edward is in his garden playing the medieval version of croquet with his friend
the princess ignored sits watching
longshanks marches through the game furious
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms
this wallace is a bandit nothing more
longshanks slaps his son knocking him down among the colored balls and wickets
everyone gasps stunned
you weak little coward
longshanks jerks him to his feet
i go to france to press our rights there
i leave you to handle this little rebellion do you understand
longshanks grabs his son by the throat
and turn yourself into a man
the king leaves
the friends of the humiliated prince hurry to him and lift him as the princess moves to him too
get away from me
he slaps her
her personal guards frenchmen in distinctive uniforms jump from their seats at the edge of the garden but the princess raises a hand to show she needs no assistance and
curtseys to edward who shouts convene my military council
as edward marches off with his entourage nicolette a beautiful raven haired handmaiden rushes to the princess who is wobbly hurt more than she let show
nicolette whispers to her in french with subtitles
they say this wallace killed thirty men to avenge the death of his woman
i hope your husband goes to scotland
then youll be a widow
robert the bruce is in bed with a young nordic beauty with vacant blue eyes
she drowses but the lovemaking has not defused the restlessness of roberts spirit
he lies on his stomach turned away from her on the bed
stirring she kisses his neck but he doesnt respond
i wanted to please you
but he is numb as she nuzzles him again
she sags back and he still stares away lost in thought
realizing her hurt he explains
in lanark village the kings soldiers killed a girl
her lover fought his way through the soldiers and killed the magistrate
she looks at him blankly
was it rage
whatever it was he has more of it than i
hurt you might have lied
im too arrogant to lie
on his face as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase
he follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom
they reach a door which the servant unlocks
young robert takes the candle and enters robert wills himself forward and places the candle on a table in the center of the room
a shuffle in the dark then moving into the light is a leper whose once noble features are decaying with the disease
isolated in his disfiguration he looks at his visitor his son with the eyes of the condemned
young robert forces himself not to look away
a rebellion has begun
a commoner named william wallace
so no one leads scotland
the old man thinks and points a half finger at his son
you will embrace this rebellion
support it from our lands in the north
i will gain english favor by condemning it and ordering it opposed from our lands in the south
whichever way the tide runs we will rise
he doesnt even have a knighthood
but he fights with passion and he is clever
he inspires men
you admire him
uncompromising men are easy to admire
he has courage
so does a dog
but you must understand this edward longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of england and none of us and nothing of scotland will survive
unless we are as ruthless more ruthless than he
young bruce rises heavily and moves to the door
press your case to the nobles
they will choose who rules scotland
with a last long look at his father robert leaves
troops ride through the countryside intimidating and questioning civilians all refuse to talk
wallaces house burns as soldiers dig up the graves of his father and brother and scatter their bones to dogs
the english search through the woods finding nothing
william and hamish ride to see the damage
they find the smoking ruins and the defiled family graves
i am so sorry
william is struck by an awful urgent thought
we open on marions grave with the thistle carved marker looking peaceful but up the hill in the underbrush english soldiers wait in ambush
edgy they perk up at the sound of muffled hoofbeats then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure wallace suddenly looms up behind them galloping and swirling fire
he hurls burning torches into the clustered soldiers setting some of them on fire
meanwhile hamish has crawled to marions grave and is digging frantically
the new dirt parts easily and he pulls the shrouded body out cringing with the effort
more soldiers rush from behind the rocks at the far side of the graveyard
wallace charges them driving them back
he grabs the reins of hamishs horse hidden among trees and gallops to him
hamish hands the shrouded body up to william and bounds into the saddle of his own horse
they spur the horses and ride away william clutching marions shrouded body to his chest
william dismounts stretching the body gently on the ground
hamish dismounts too with the spade he used to dig up the old grave
he sees the emotion on williams face
hamish puts a hand on his friends shoulder then quietly leads the horses away
william starts to dig
william sits looking at the new grave covered with leaves completely hidden
he touches his hand to the earth
hamish is waiting as william comes out of the grove
there is nothing to say
they mount their horses and ride away as the music of william and marions love haunts us
wallace and his inner circle hare huddled around a small fire
other highlanders guard the perimeters
old campbell is lovingly honing the broadswords to razor edges and sharing a whiskey jug with hamish who stares at the fire
wallace is using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt
whatre ya doin
does it hurt
what do we do when longshanks sends his whole northern army against us
they have heavy cavalry
armored horses that shake the very ground
theyll ride right over us
at a loss wallace looks up at the sky
he sees the trees stretching into the night like spikes to skewer the stars
we make spears
a hundred spears
fourteen feet long
volunteers coming in
they look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in blindfolded
when the guides remove the blindfolds the new recruits see wallace and rush to him bowing
we have come to fight and die for you
stand up man im not the pope
i am faudron
my sword is yours
and i brought you this tarta as he reaches into his cloak both hamish and campbell instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck
we checked them for arms
carefully faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf and replaces wallaces tattered old one
its your family tartan
my wife wove it with her own hands
thank her for me
a loud voice interrupts
that cant be william wallace
im prettier than this man
they all look at a slender handsome young man stephen who is talking to himself or more accurately seems to listen to some unheard voice then answer it
all right father ill ask him
to william if i risk my neck for you will i get a chance to kill englishmen
is your poppa a ghost or do you converse with god almighty
in order to find his equal and irishman is forced to talk to god
quickly yes father
to wallace the almighty says dont change the subject just answer the fookin question
insane irish stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at campbells throat
smart enough to get a dagger past your guards old man
wallace jerks his sword to the irishmans throat and grins
thats my friend irishman
and the answers yes
you fight for me you kill the english
stephen grins and happily tucks away the dagger
stephen is my name
im the most wanted man on the emerald isle
except im not on the emerald isle of course mores the pity
a common thief
wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire as the sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces
a column of english light cavalry a hundred riders moves through the picturesque beauty of the highlands
english lord dolecroft is in command wearing a hat with a pompous white plume
up ahead the english scout sees five scots including hamish walking out of the forest
the scots run the scout rides back to dolecroft
theyve blundered at last
the english force charges off
hamish and his men changed direction but the english spot them crossing a hilltop and ride after them
the scots run for their lives the english horses gallop
the scots run down one slope up another the english follow find their horses stumbling and see
were in a bog
here its firm this way but as they move toward the firm ground fifty scots appear on the crest of the hill
hamish leads them smiling
dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear wallace appears there with fifty more and more scots appear to the left and right of the english who are surrounded in the
too late dolecroft realizes his blunder
wallace lifts his broadsword screams and leads the charge
the scots are moving through deep woods they are laden with the booty they took from the english cavalry extra weapons clothing food and one man even wears the late
dolecrofts plumed hat
wallace is leading them traveling with his heavy sheathed broadsword across his shoulders
stop here and rest
they collapse to the leaves and loam greedily squeezing water from sheep belly canteens
lord pickering english commander is handed news of the disaster
he reads the message and pales
what about our infiltrator
he has already joined them mlord
the moon is high above the scots encamped for the night
most everyone is sleeping but william sits leaning against a tree lost in lonely thoughts
suddenly william freezes a shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty feet ahead of him
something about her is familiar and then she pulls off the hood revealing her auburn hair cascading in the moonlight
it is marion
is it you
joy explodes on his face and he runs to her but stops before he touches her as if she might evaporate
yes you are
and you must wake
i dont want to wake
i want to stay with you
and i with you
but you must wake
i need you so much
i love you
wake up william
wake up william
william clutches at marion but his arms cant enclose her
lying on his new tartan in camp with hamish shaking him williams arms clutched empty to his chest
wallace jumps up hearing the distant barking that alarmed hamish
stephen the new irish recruit races up
we must run in different directions
we dont split up
they used hounds on us in ireland its the only way
hes right hamish
divide them and run
shoving groups of men in different directions wallace then takes off
his group is about a dozen they race through the woods dodging trees running aimlessly
they stop and listen
the barks are getting closer
again they divide and race in different directions
but no matter how they run and dodge the barks grow nearer
we intercut with the approaching of the dogs a large pack of hounds with keepers like on a fox hunt and behind the dogs lord pickering with his soldiers prepared
for a long chase cloaked against the wet darkness carrying torches
wallace and others pause hear the dogs and run again in a new direction
the hounds are relentless
wallaces group is down to hamish stephen and faudron
no matter how we go they follow
they have our scent
you must not be caught
faster now faster
the barks are getting very close
wallace and his friends are starting to panic
the blood beats in their ears their breath scalds their lungs
and we move in on wallaces eyes
he stops gasping
we cant stop
theyve tricked us
whats the crazy man saying lord
the dogs have a scent
someone must have given it to them
who would do such a thing
wallace pulls out his dagger
bark frantically now they smell a kill they tug so hard at their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along
we have them
the soldiers grip their weapons ready to take their prisoners
they burst into the little clearing the dogs find a body stabbed his throat cut the dogs plunge their snouts into the gore yipping wildly
the handlers must fight furiously to tear the dogs from the body
lord pickering approaches the body and looks down
it is faudron mangled now but clearly identifiable with the scarf he gave william in place of williams own tucked into his shirt
as pickering rants his men look at the darkness all around
get them going again
their noses are drowned in new blood theyll follow nothing now
and just as the realization hits pickering that he cant pursue wallace any further a cloaked figure mixed in among his men leans in from behind him to whisper
the almighty says for you to give his regards to the devil
pickerings eyes go wide then roll back as stephens dagger slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart
as pickering falls and his men realize what has happened stephen has already run back into the trees
pickerings men freeze at this sudden turn of events
even the dogs whimper picking up the rising fear of the men around them
then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus of demonic bloodcurdling yells three wild men tear out of the darkness from different directions their swords slashing
pickerings men panic and run their dogs yelping and the other soldiers evident by their torches fell with them in all directions
wallace hamish and stephen are left alone in the heart of the woods howling barking like dogs snarling like wolves and then laughing like hyenas
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger
no english lord would trust an irishman
lets kill him anyway
they laugh again then wallaces laughter leaks away and he stares into the trees where he saw marion in his dream
two men are talking in a village
and william wallace killed fifty men
fifty if it was one
the same tale is exchanged by two farmers at a crossroads
a hundred men
with his own sword
he cut a through the english like the tale is repeated in a tavern
moses through the red sea
hacked off two hundred heads
saw it with my own eyes
and the rumors are discussed even inside the palace grounds in london where the prince and his friends are trying on elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors and the
princess ignored by her husband strolls and chats with her handmaiden nicolette in subtitled french
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes
scotland is in chaos
your husband is secretly sending an army north
how do you know this
last night i slept with a member of the war council
he shouldnt be telling secrets in bed
englishmen dont know what a tongue is for
the princess blushes whacks her with her fan and smiles
this scottish rebel
he fights to avenge a woman
a magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girls throat to tempt wallace to fight and fight he did
the princess is pained at such cruelty nicolette warms to share the juicy gossip
knowing his passion for his lost love they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of
he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place
now that is romance oui
i wouldnt know
a highlander a runner slips like a shadow up the hillside to a circle of ancient monoliths
there hidden among the stone pillars he finds wallace and his band resting
the english are advancing an army toward stirling
do the nobles rally
robert the bruce and most of the others will not commit to war
but word has spread and highlanders are coming down on their own by the hundreds by the thousands
wallace rides down the road followed by his band
as they pass people on the road the women the children all cheer
its william wallace
god bless wallace and scotland
at a crossroads more of wallaces men join them in clusters
one group carries something long encased in wool covers
farmers in the field blacksmiths at their forges leave their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after the riders
they put on their forbidden tartans kiss their wives and head off to fight
stirling castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field cut in half by a river spanned by an old wooden bridge
scottish nobles have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking the field they wear gleaming armor with plumes sashes and banners and are attended by squires and grooms
the mists of morning shroud most of the field
but from the opposite side of the bridge they hear the clattering of a huge army moving forward
lochlan a noble gallops to mornay
it sounds like twenty thousand
the scouts say it is ten
and we have but two
are wearing padded leather shirts and carry pikes and daggers
as through the mists they see the numbers arrayed against them a young soldier tugs at a grizzled veteran
the nobles will negotiate
if they deal they send us home
if not we charge
when we are all dead and they can call themselves brave they withdraw
i didnt come to fight so they could own more lands that i could work for them
nor did i
not against these odds
he lowers his pike and starts to desert
at first one by one and then in clumps more highlanders follow
the nobles see the desertion
do not flee
wait until we have negotiated
they wont stop and who could blame them
then riding into the mob of men comes wallace followed by his friends
hes striking charismatic his powerful arms bare his chest covered not in armor but a commoners leather shirt and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses wallace rides a
swift horse like he was born on it
the entire scottish army watches in fascination as wallace and his men ride through them toward the command hill
the soldiers whisper among themselves
the common soldiers already having broken ranks cluster up the hill to see the confrontation
as wallace and his captains reach the nobles stephen laughs
the almighty says this must be a fashionable fight its drawn the finest people
where is thy salute
for presenting yourselves on this battlefield i give you thanks
this is our army
to join it you give homage
i give homage to scotland
and if this is your army why does it go
wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen men now frightened ready to desert
we play this picture wallace sitting his horse looking down in awe at this thing that has grown beyond anyones imagination
he glances at his friends campbell hamish stephen
theyve got no suggestions theyre just as awed as he is
we didnt come to fight for them
the english are too many
wallace raises his hand and the army falls silent
sons of scotland
i am william wallace
william wallace is seven feet tall
yes i have heard
he kills men by the hundreds
and if he were here he would consume the english with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his ass
many laugh all get the point
i am william wallace
and my enemies do not go away
i saw our good nobles hanged
i am william wallace
and i see a whole army of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny
you have come to fight as free men
and free men you are
what will you do with freedom
will you fight
two thousand against ten
we will run and live
fight and you may die
run and you will live at least awhile
and dying in your bed many years from now would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance to come back here
as young men and tell our enemies that they make take our lives but they will never take our freedom
down on the plain english emissaries in all their regal finery gallop over the bridge under a banner of truce
the english comes to barter with our nobles for castles and titles
and our nobles will not be in the front of the battle
they will not
he dismounts and draws his sword
and i will
slowly the chant begins and builds
bagpipers play pulling the mob back into companies
but through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy army
hamish campbell and stephen move up beside william
now what do we do
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
campbell hamish and stephen ride off
mornay reins his horse over lifts the reins of wallaces horse and extends them to him an invitation to join the pre battle talks
wallace mounts up and rides out with the scottish nobles to meet the english contingent
meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff
cheltham head of the english contingent glares at wallace
this is william wallace here are the kings terms
lead this army off the field and he will give you each estates in yorkshire including hereditary title from which you will pay him an annual i have an offer
from which you will pay the king an annual duty
wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at cheltham whose eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners
you disrespect a banner of truce
from his king
here are scotlands terms
lower your flags and march straight to england stopping at every scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft rape and murder
do that and your men shall live
do it not and every one of you will die today
cheltham barks at the scottish nobles
you are outmatched
you havent even any cavalry
in two centuries no army has won without it
im not finished
before we let you leave your commander must cross that bridge stand before this army put his head between his legs and kiss his own ass
the outraged englishman gallops back to his lines
id say that was rather less cordial that he was used to
be ready and do exactly as i say
they return to the scottish lines
wallace dismounts where his men are breaking out new foot spears
hamish eyebrows raised looks expectantly at wallace wallace nods
wish i could see the noble lords face when he tells him
the husky english commanders blood boils from chelthams report
before he can respond they see wallaces spearmen taking up a position on the far side of the bridge
suddenly the scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the english
give no quarter
and i want this wallaces heart brought to me on a plate
cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack
the english army moves forward toward the bridge
its so narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it at any one time
the english heavy cavalry two hundred knights cross uncontested and form up on the other side
things look terrible
stephen turns to william
the lord tell me he can get me out of this mess
but hes pretty sure youre fooked
talmadge sees the scots doing nothing
they do not even contest us
send across the infantry
mlord the bridge is so narrow the scots just stand in their formations
our cavalry will ride them down like grass
get the infantry across so they can finish the slaughter
the english leaders shout orders and keep their men moving across the bridge
talmadge gestures for the attack flag
the english knights see the signal banners telling them to attack
they take the lances from their squires and lower the visors of their helmets
proud plumed glimmering they look invincible
their huge horses themselves draped in scarlet and purple look like tanks
the knights charge
their hooves thunder the horses are so heavy the ground literally shakes with the charge
the scots stand and watch them come on
its difficult to imagine the courage this takes from the pov of the scottish lines we see the massive horses boring in
we feel the rising thunder of the charge closer closer
wallace moves to the front of the lead group of scots
the scots snap their foot spears straight up in unison
now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks the first line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above the ground the men behind them bracing
theirs at a five foot level the men behind that bracing at seven feet
the english knights have never seen such a formation
their lances are useless and its too late to stop
the momentum that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on foot now becomes suicidal force knights and horses impale themselves on the long spears like beef on
can see it but worse is the sound the screams of dying men and horses carried to him across the battlefield
are protected behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and knights
wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen out onto the field attacking the knights that are still alive
most are off their horses a few have managed to pull up their mounts
wallace and his men are so much more mobile than the knights the field runs with blood
wallace faces talmadge in the distance
here i am english coward
come get me
talmadge is even more enraged and his judgment is gone
press the men across
talmadge himself gallops forward
he grabs hamish
tell mornay to ride to the flank and cross upstream
tell him to be sure the english see him ride away
hamish hurries off with the message
the english infantry keeps moving across the little bridge
the scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback
they have a few dozen mounted riders none heavily armored
if he waits much longer hamish hurries up
ride around and ford behind them
we should not divide our forces
wallace says do it
and he says for you to let the english see you
understanding they shall think we run away
mornay leads his riders away
sees the scottish nobles ride off and shouts to cheltham
every scot with a horse is fleeing
he drives half his army across the river
lifts his sword
he charges down the hill
the scots follow wallace on foot charging into the english
the english leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack
press reinforcements across
the english leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers onto the bridge which only hams them up
meanwhile on the other side of the bridge wallace and his charging men slam into the english infantry with wild fury
the english fall back on each other further blocking the bridge
the nobles look back with grudging admiration
hes taking the bloody bridge
the english cant get across
hes evened the odds at one stroke
with rising desire to join the bandwagon the nobles spur
down on the plain wallace and the attacking men drive the english back killing as they go
the scots reach the bridge itself
the waters below it run red with blood
talmadge has begun to panic
use the archers
theyre too close well shoot out own men
the scots are carving their way through the english soldiers nothing can stop them
wallace is relentless each time he swings a head flies or an arm
hamish and stephen fight beside him swinging the broadsword with both hands
old campbell loses his shield in the grappling an english swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand but campbell batters him to the ground with his right
and stabs him
reaching the english side of the bridge the scots begin to build a barrier with the dead bodies
the english are not without courage
cheltham leads a desperate counterattack
the scots make an impenetrable barrier of slashing blades
still cheltham keeps coming wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet his hair and his brain
talmadge has seen enough he gallops away
the remaining english general tries to save the army
we are still five thousand
the english try to form up but the scottish horsemen fording the river high upstream come crashing into the english flank and ride over the surprised english infantry
sees the scottish nobles attacking
the english soldiers are in utter panic running and being cut down on all sides
and the scottish soldiers taste something scots have not tasted for a hundred years victory
even while finishing off the last of the english soldiers they begin their highlow chant
even the noblemen take up the chant
wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle bodies on the field soldiers lying impaled stacks of bodies on the bridge the bridge slick with blood
before it can all sink in william is lifted on the shoulders of his men
william kneels before one of scotlands ancient elders who lifts a silver sword and dubs williams shoulders
i knight thee sir william wallace
william rises and faces the great hall crowded with hundreds of new admirers as well as his old friends in their new clothes and armor
the crowd chants wal lace wal lace
wallace lifts his eyes taking it all in
at the rear of the hall is a balcony backed by a magnificent sunlit stained glass window and in the center of its rainbow corona he sees a familiar form
marion so real to him in this moment of triumph that he can see her glowing like an angel in a gown worthy of the occasion
but the illusion wont last in the blink of an eye she is gone and wallace hears the chant and fingers the cloth she gave him
the nobles of scotland are gathered in the huge chamber a massive table runs across the far end of the room and aligned on either side are the two rival
factions of nobles glaring at each other
old craig is in the center with young robert the bruce on his right
there is a general murmur along the nobles and robert whispers to craig
does anyone know his politics
but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything
the balliols will kiss his ass so we must
a court stewards steps in and formally announces
lords of scotland sir william wallace
the nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other in their acclamation as wallace strides in flanked by hamish campbell and stephen splendid in their tartans
old craig rises
in the name of god we declare and appoint thee high protector of scotland
and thy captains as aides decamp
the nobles rise court attendants hurry to wallace and drape a golden chain of office around his neck
wallace takes the three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the necks of his friends as once again the nobles applaud
almost before the applause dies a member of the balliol clan who has kept an open seat beside him speaks up
inasmuch as you and your captains hail from a region long known to support the balliol clan may we invite you to join us
but wallaces gaze has locked onto robert the bruce who stares back the two young lions instantly recognizing the leadership power of each other
you are robert the bruce
my father fought in support of yours
the balliols shrivel
the nobles on the bruce side can barely keep from grinning
suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack
with this new success the result of all of scotlands efforts now is the time to declare a king
then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate succession
youre the ones who wont support the true claim
i demand consideration of these documents
wallace glances again at the bruce who suddenly feels ashamed of the bickering
those were lies when they were written
our documents prove absolutely that suddenly wallace turns his back and walks toward the door
where are you going
we have beaten the english
but theyll come back because you wont stand together
there is one clan in this country scotsmen
one class free
one price courage
he turns again and strides toward the door
what will you do
i will invade england
and defeat the english on their own ground
thats impossible it wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length of the table bashing the succession documents into the laps of the nobles
listen to me
longshanks understands this
he brandishes the broadsword
there is a difference between us
you think the people of this country exist to provide you with position
i think your position exists to provide the people with freedom
and i go to make sure they have it
wallace bangs through the door
suppressing smiles his friends file out behind him
wallace and his men are marching away as robert the bruce runs out after them
i respect what you said
but remember these men have lands castles
much to risk
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself
its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other
if you make enemies on both sides of the border youll end up dead
we all end up dead
its only a question of how
wallace walks robert catches up and speaks to him in an urgent half whisper so that no one else can hear
im no coward
i want what you want
but we need the nobles
what does that mean to be noble
your title gives you claim to the throne of our country
but men dont follow titles they follow courage
your arm speaks louder than your tongue
our people know you
noble and common they respect you
if you would lead them toward freedom they would follow you
and so would wallace walks away leaving robert the bruce alone
wallace rides at the head of his army moving through the countryside of northern england
it is autumn the foliage is beautiful the wheat fields gold with harvest
a medieval city guarded by a fortress
the royal governor is a spoiled young man longshanks nephew
he is studying maps and written appeals for help his captain of defenses strides in with another note
message from your cousin the prince
he says london has no more troops to send
every town in northern england is begging for help
where will wallace strike first
i should think these smaller settlements along the border
they hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts
they look out to see a panicked rider who shouts up
to what town
he comes here
as civilians flee the walled city in the distance
has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels
it rumbles ominously toward camera
the civilian panic continues as more people join the swell of those leaving york
the scottish army keeps coming on
the governor is furious and confused
we will not allow a bandit to panic the greatest city in northern england
close off the escapes
let no one leave
the city has emptied already sire
only the scottish civilians remain
the governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his uncle longshanks the king
as it picks up speed and slams into the wooden gate of the city
with the collision the battle is on
its a night battle torches flaming arrows pots of boiling oil being splashed down at the attackers who swarm the gate
the oil beats the first wave of scots back but wallace rushes forward grabbing the ram cart with his own hands the attackers rally to him helping him slam the
gate again and again
it breaks but behind it is an awful tangle of carts broken sheds impenetrable rubbish
wallace grabs a torch throws it into the wooden tangle and shouts back
wait for it to burn
the captain hurries into the tower room
theyve breached the wall
then do as i ordered
the scots wait biding their time as the barrier burns
suddenly they look up in horror the english are throwing the bodies of hanged scots over the wall
they stare at this in mute shock
wallace is frozen his eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction
his men rush forward
beat they wish to frighten us
or goad us into attacking too soon
dont look away
the scots look at the hanging bodies
behold the enemy we fight
we will be more merciful than they have been
we will spare women children and priests
for all else no mercy
wallace draws his broadsword
the burning debris inside the gate collapses leaving a tunnel through the fire
wallace screams and leads the charge through the burning barrier
prince edward and phillip his fencing friend and lover hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard below they look out the window and see the arrival of longshanks
they lean back into the room and edward begins to pace nervously
it is not your fault
stand up to him
edward shows phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt behind his back
i will stand up to him and more
longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily
first he glares at phillip with obvious loathing then turns his piercing stare to his own son
what news of the north
nothing new majesty
we have sent riders to speed any word
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out
and you have done nothing
i have ordered conscriptions
a messenger enters and hands the prince a message
edward reads it and nearly loses his balance
wallace has sacked york
to messenger how dare you bring a panicky lie
the messenger has also brought a basket
he approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it uncovering its contents
prince edward is closest he looks in then staggers back stunned
longshanks moves to the sack coldly looks in and withdraws the severed head of his nephew yorks former governor
thy own nephew
what beast could do such a thing
the king drops the head back into the sack unmoved
if he can sack york he can invade lower england
we would stop him
edward who is this shitpoker who speaks to me as if i needed his advice
i have declared phillip my high counselor
longshanks nods as if impressed
he moves to phillip and examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears
then longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window the same one edward and phillip were looking out six stories above the courtyard
we hear phillips scream as he falls
edward rushes toward the window in horror
he looks out at the result turns back toward his father in shock and hatred and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it
he stabs at longshanks the old king smiles at the attack parrying letting his arms be cut
you fight back at last
then longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury he grapples with edward knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the floor then longshanks kicks his son again and again
he exhausts his fury on him
edward is a bloody mess longshanks coughs up a bit of blood
he ignores it and his sons wreckage and goes back to the discussion as if this fight was normal business
we must sue for a truce and buy him off
but who will go to him
if i came under the sword of this murderer i would end up like my nephew
and not you the sight of my faggot son would only encourage an enemy to take over this country
so whom do i send
a full encampment across an english field campfires chase the dawn chill
soldiers sharpen swords and spear points
wallace is huddled with his inner circle all except campbell who receives a report from a scout
a royal entourage comes flying banners of truce and the standards of longshanks himself
wallace buckles on his sword
set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow
wallace and his men ride in wary ready for ambush
they surround the tent
there are two dozen royal soldiers there but they make no threatening moves
no sound from the tent
wallace rests his hand on the handle of his broadsword ready
i have come
servants pull back the sides of the tent door and a tall slender shapely female figure appears there
there in the shadows she looks just like marion
william is not the only one who notices the resemblance he glances at hamish and campbell and sees them haunted by it too
is this another dream
he pales as she steps into the morning sun
she moves toward him her face lowered
it is marion
she reaches him lifts her face
and he sees the princess
william is relieved and yet as he sees the princess more closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she carries herself her shape the fall of
the princess is struck with wallace too tall powerful and commanding
wallace dismounts and moves to face her
their eyes hang on each other
she sees something that she has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life
she surprises him by bending at the knee in a half submissive yet proud curtsey
i am the princess of wales
wife of edward the kings son
she nods somehow she is already ashamed
i come as the kings servant and with his authority
its battle i want not talk
but now that i am here will you speak with a woman
she leads him under the pavilion a purple canopy shading rich carpets laid on the bare ground
watching the gorgeous walk stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg like a horny dog
hamish backhands him campbell hamish and stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession shouldering their way in beside the princesss french guards so they can watch wallaces back
the rest of the scots surround the tent ready for ambush
nicolette is among the royal attendants there seeing wallace she shoots a glance at the princess that says ooo la la
the servants have brought a throne for the princess a lower chair for wallace
she sits he refuses the chair
she studies him taking in his anger and his pride
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight
i have been given nothing
god makes men what they are
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities
the executioner of the kings nephew my husbands own cousin
york was the staging point for every invasion of my country
and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots even women and children from the city walls
that is not possible
but knowing longshanks family she glances at a richly dressed advisor a crony of the king who averts his eyes
longshanks did far worse the last time he took a scottish city
the crony mumbles to her in latin with subtitles
latin he is a murdering bandit he lies
i am no bandit
and i do not lie
they are startled at wallaces fluency in latin
or in french if you prefer that certainmous et ver
ask your king to his face and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth
she stares for a long moment at wallaces eyes
hamilton leave us
mlady leave us now
he reluctantly obeys
seeing that she wants the exchange to be private wallace turns and nods for his men to leave
stephen who has been admiring the ladys beauty non stop leans in and whispers to william
her husbands more of a queen than she is
did you know that
stephen moves off with hamish and campbell
wallace and the princess are left alone
let us talk plainly
you invade england
but you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply
the king proposes that you withdraw your attack
in return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which i am to pay to you personally
that i should become judas
peace is made is such ways
the outburst startles even those watching from a distance
the princess is mesmerized by wallaces passion
i understand you have suffered
about your woman
she was my wife
we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord
they killed her to get to me
and she was pregnant
the princess is stunned wallace is dead still
ive never told anyone
i dont know why i tell you except because you look
much like her
and someday you will be a queen and you must open your eyes
beat tell your king that william wallace will not be ruled
nor will any scot while i live
the princess rises slowly from her chair moves in front of him and lowers herself to her knees
the crony and her other attendants seeing this from a distance are shocked
i leave this money as a gift
not from the king but from myself
and not to you but to the orphans of your country
she lifts her face
their eyes hold a moment too long
wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of their company and watch as the princess procession leaves
hamish studies wallaces face wallace notices and gives him a non committal shrug
as the carriage rolls away its window curtains lift back slightly
all they see are the princess fingers but they know she looked back
wallace reins his horse away to ride back to camp
the doors open the princess enters longshanks war council prince edward is there among a dozen others
my sons loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen
so he accepted our bribe
he did not
then why does he stay
my scouts say he has not advanced
he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him
you spoke with this wallace in private
what kind of man is he
a mindless barbarian
not a king like you mlord
the scottish nobles have sent him no support
his army starves
our stall has worked he must withdraw
you may return to your embroidery
she barely curtseys and starts out
you brought back the money of course
he already knows she didnt hamilton is standing near him
i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war
glances at son this is what happens when you must send a woman
and a fool
forgive me sire
i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
my greatness is better demonstrated with this
from a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and throws it onto the table
most of those there are shocked
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself
so the scots will have none of them will they
my armorers have already made a thousand
no one notices that the princess is deadly pale
the scots are lining up to leave their encampment
wallace is about to give the signal to start the march when hamish beside him comes alert a small group of riders in distinctive attire are coming toward them what
can this be
william french guards
the riders stop at a distance and out from their ranks comes a single rider sitting sidesaddle
it is nicolette
wallace and hamish recognize her from the princesss visit
she trots her horse the rest of the way while the french guards stay back
hamish helps her from her horse
she moves to wallace and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding cape
secreted there hung from a rope at her neck is a crossbow
wallace has gathered the nobles among them robert the bruce mornay and old craig for a demonstration
hamish and stephen have placed a spearmans chestplate against a bale of hay
as william cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position and places a bolt in its slot stephen tucks a melon behind the armor
the bolt slashes through the air and punches through the armor and the melon leaving no doubt what it would do to a mans heart
the nobles pale
that is why the pope outlawed the weapon
it makes war too terrible
how many does longshanks have
beat you have made me guardian of scotland
so i tell you this is what we face
we must sue for peace
we cannot defeat this with cavalry not heavy like the english but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen
it is suicide
sir william the bruce sees wallace about to explode and tries to intervene but wallaces anger is too great
we won at stirling and still you quibbled
we won at york and you would not support us
then i said nothing
now i say you are cowards
the nobles grip their weapons wallace hamish and stephen are ready to finish this quarrel right here
robert the bruce backed by mornay steps between the two sides
please sir william
speak with me alone
i beg you
the nobles stalk away and robert draws wallace away to the target wallace shot so they are alone
you have achieved more than anyone dreamed
but fighting these odds looks like rage not courage
peace offers its rewards
has war become a habit you cannot break
the question strikes deep
war finds me willing
i know it wont bring back all i have lost
but it can bring what none of us have ever had a country of our own
for that we need a king
we need you
i am trying
then tell me what a king is
is he a man who believes only what others believe
is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart
there is strength in you
i see it
i know it
consult with my father
and i will consult with mine
robert the bruce walks off the field heading the way the other nobles went
wallace rejoins hamish and stephen
they look to him what do we do now
remember when the english turned their hounds on us
maybe we should introduce them to our dogs
in the faint nimbus of the single candle young robert sits across from his leper father
the son grips his own head as if stunned by a blow
cannot be the way
you have said yourself that the nobles will not support wallace so how does it help us to join the side that is slaughtered
heartsick the father reaches across the table then stays his arm unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand
look at me
i cannot be king
you and you alone can rule scotland
what i tell you you must do for yourself and for your country
young robert holds his father with his eyes and does not look away
the scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain covered in the gray mists
they see glimpses of the enemy in the distance
wallace deploys the scots campbell with the schiltrons spear formations stephen with the infantry the noble mornay leading the cavalry and with wallace and hamish on horseback looking over the
hamish sees gazing up at an empty hill above the field
the bruce is not coming william
mornay has come
so will the bruce
hed better the odds look long
and its nasty ground one side of the field is ankle deep in water and the english are covering it with a layer of burning oil releasing thick smoke to
hide their movements
the priest from their home village is moving through the scottish ranks dispensing absolution
he reaches the two friends who accept the host say their own last prayers and give each other a look of goodbye
hamish rides off to join the schiltrons
on the opposite side of the field send their army forward
see them through the smoke wallace spots what hes looking for there they are the ranks of crossbowmen
and as they draw nearer wallace hears a haunting noise
he sees the bowmen more clearly and the english infantry
some are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes
he stares at the approach of his countrymen
wallace appears beside him
stephen sees him and is ashamed
so thats where longshanks got his soldiers
irishmen willing to kill scottish cousins for the english
their families are starving theyll feed them however they can
if you dont want to fight them no
ill stand with you
loyal to the end
wallace signals to hamish and campbell among the schiltrons
the formations bristling with spears move forward
hamish looks back at wallace both men know the spearmen are the bait here
wallace and stephen see the english heavy cavalry advancing
they cant be that stupid to attack the schiltrons again
wallace is scanning the battlefield
he sees the english cavalry charge but before they reach the bristling spears they pull up and crossbowmen moving up behind the knights
its only a faint to shield the crossbows
the crossbowmen fire a volley too hurriedly
we see the hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison you can actually see them coming
the bows fall short of the front ranks of the schiltrons
give em the dogs
stephen signals and up the slope behind them come handlers with ten war dogs
huge mastiffs they wear steel collars with razor sharp protrusions
their handlers hold them at the end of long catch poles
the crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs now as the scottish handlers run toward the english ranks and unleash the dogs fear races through
the english line
the dogs tear into them
it is chaos the bowmen cant flee and as the dogs mix among them the bowmen fire frantically mostly hitting each other
the dogs collars slash legs their jaws crush bones even when their back legs are hacked off the frenzied dogs keep killing
wallace signals to mornay with the scottish cavalry
mornay does nothing
the crossbowmen though taking great punishment are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers and are regrouping
mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away
longshanks and his officers see mornay and his cavalry melt away
the english general looks knowingly at longshanks
for double his lands in scotland and matching estates in england
they see the scottish army abandoned
wallace glances to the other hilltop still no sign of bruce
he looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another volley
the scottish spearmen bunched in a tight group are helpless
the bolts fall cutting through their helmets and breastplates like paper
wallace has no cavalry and his men are being slaughtered
he spurs his horse and stephen and the infantrymen race behind him
the english heavy cavalry surge to meet them but wallace weaves through them dodging with his horse slashing with the broadsword cutting down on knight another another
the scottish infantry claws in dragging down the horses hacking the knights as they run by
the english bowmen are about to fire again but they see the scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim the bolts cut into the infantrymen one bolt
tears off the armor of wallaces left shoulder
he wobbles on his horse regains his balance and keeps up the charge
longshanks and his generals are watching the action
my god and still they come
use the reinforcements
but take wallace alive
the general signals and the english reinforcements surge into the battle
on horseback wallace fights his way into the watery edge of the field where english infantry is now overrunning the schiltron
he hacks men down left and right reaches the scottish center and finds hamish bending over another soldier
ham and wallace sees that hamish is holding his father fallen in battle
wallace has no time to react he cuts down and english swordsman moving in to hack hamishs back
wallace lifts campbell across the saddle and shouts at hamish
get him away
hamish obeys jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward the rear
wallace fights with new vengeance swinging the double edged broadsword with deadly accuracy
rallied by wallaces presence the scots surge back
then wallace sees the english reinforcement cavalry coming
the scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron
the spears bristle out ready
the english horsemen thunder in
but before the spears impale the horses another flight of crossbow bolts cuts down half the scots still fighting
hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp body of his father to the scottish monks who are attending to the wounded and giving absolution to the
still wallace fights back meeting the english charge
the scots hold their own
an english knight tries to ride over william he knocks the lance aside and tough the horse slams into him william also unseats the rider
the rider rolls to his feet
william struggles up to meet him and comes face to face with robert the bruce
the shock and recognition stun wallace in that moment looking at robert the bruces guilt ridden face he understands everything the betrayal the hopelessness of scotland
as he stands there frozen a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck and wallace doesnt react to it
bruce is horrified at the sight of wallace this way
he batters at wallaces sword as if its use would give him absolution
but wallace can only stagger back
bruces voice grows ragged as he screams
all around the battle has decayed the scots are being slaughtered
another bolt glances off wallaces helmet a third rips into his thigh plate making his legs collapse
suddenly stephen comes through the melee on roberts horse
he hits robert from behind knocking him down and jumps to the ground to try and lift william onto the horse
robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up sighting out wallace taking careful aim
bruce leaps up and helps stephen sling wallace onto the back of the horse even covers him with his shield deflecting another bolt fired at wallace as stephen mounts too
as the horse plunges away into the smoke robert falls to the water
his own troops reach him realize who he is see the horrible expression on his face and race on after the scots
robert is left alone on his knees in the water the fire and noise of battle now dim to him as if his senses have died along with his heart
looks over the battlefield strewn with the bodies of the scottish dead
for now he is satisfied
remnants of the defeated army straggle past
wallace and stephen are trying to help hamish carry his father but now old campbell says
i want to die on the ground
but as they tilt old campbell onto the ground he grabs at something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach
thatll clear your sinuses
youre going to live
i dont think i can do without one of those
whatever it is
hamish is too grief stricken to speak
were like my father
old campbell rallies one more time for this
and glad to die like him
so you could be the men you are
all of ya
the last three words to hamish telling him hes a hero too
im a happy man
hamish is weeping
when he looks up again his father has died
we pull back from them in tableaux with the army the people of scotland the whole gray world in defeat
wallace still bloody and in his battered armor removes the chain of office from beneath his breastplate lays it onto the table in front of craig and the other nobles
and walks from the room
hamish and stephen see the satisfaction on the nobles face and follow william out
hamish and stephen move out into the hallway after wallace but he is gone
wallace is in the woods in the grove of trees looking at marions hidden grave
the rain falls on his face like tears
but he has no tears of his own
the cold the icy rain the wounds nothing seems to touch him
with his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth from beneath his breastplate hanging in his trembling hands filthy with the grime and gore of battle it looks impossibly white
something from a better purer world
thunder the sound of driving rain
snug by a massive fire are longshanks his son edward and other advisors
on the far side of the room away from the fire the princess stands at the window and watches the rain against the panes
their nobles have sworn allegiance mlord
every last one
longshanks savors the victory and gloats to his son
now we kill two birds at one stroke
we recruit from scotland for our armies in france
the scots will fight for us
what choice do they have
now they must serve us or starve
but if we have not caught wallace exploding he is gone
if he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him he will not survive the winter
it is very cold is it not our flower
from the other side of the window we see the princess as she hears him but doesnt turn around
she looks at the window we snow swirling among the raindrops outside
her eyes glisten and her breath fogs the glass
the elder bruce his decaying features sagging from his face stares across the table at his son
i am the one who is rotting
but i think your face looks graver than mine
he was so brave
with courage alone he nearly won
so more men were slaughtered uselessly
he broke because of me
i saw it
he lost all will to fight
we must have alliance with england to prevail here
you achieved that
you saved your family increased your lands
in time you will have all the power in scotland
yet you grieve
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break
all men lose heart
it is exactly why we must make the choices we make
mornay in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and carpeted with eastern rugs lies in bed tossing in the restless sleep of a tortured soul
he thinks he hears galloping
in subliminal flashes he dreams of wallace riding toward him
he wakes and listens to a strange noise
it is hoofbeats
he hears shouts too screams from below and those strange approaching hoofbeats
rides up the circular stairs inside mornays castle
his horse bounds up the stone mornays guards are behind him on foot pursuing
at a landing wallace cuts down a guard and gallops higher
sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and wallace rides through
mornay is frozen
wallace slashes him down
out in the corridor the guards gather they have wallace trapped
he covers the horses eyes with a cloth and spurs his flanks
the blind animal runs through the window
the horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the castle
and into the loch
mornays guards and the castle servants cluster at the windows to see wallace and the horse surface and swim to the shore escaping
the news has spread through the countryside
in the town square drunken scotsmen chant
old craig rides past them heading toward the bruces castle on the hill above the town
robert is in his central room he hears the chanting from far below
old craig enters
is it true about mornay
craig hands him the bloody nightshirt mornay was wearing
and he rode through the window
he cant hide his admiration
from below he still hears the people chanting
longshanks and edward are in the royal gardens resplendent with spring
longshanks pulls a new flower and crushes it
his legend grows
it will be worse than before
you let wallace escape your whole army
you cannot blame me for this
longshanks glowers at his son the princess arrives
good day to you mlords
you mock us with a smile
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries
all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
if you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every scottish town i leave you to your hauntings
if you wish to take him i know a way
edward snickers in derision but his wife is steel
i have faced him
let her speak
he will fight you forever
but what does he fight for
freedom first and peace
so grant them
the little cow is insane grant as you do everything else with treachery
offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary
he trusts me
pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along
and i will set the meeting and the ambush
you see my delicate son
i have picked you a queen
locharmbie is a small picturesque castle on a hillside
as the queens entourage moves through the gates they close behind her
she steps out of the carriage and moves into inside the great hall are thirty killers led by their chief assassin a cutthroat with a mangled eye
we came in small groups so the rebels would not suspect
and you have reached wallaces men
we tell the villagers and the traitors pass it on
all thats left is for you to say where
wallace is in the grove of trees where marion is buried
drinking in the silence his own isolation
he hears a rustle behind him and spins drawing the broadsword
then his face registers
its hamish and stephen
hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here unsure until wallace moves to them and hugs them
they are in the old secret cave rain is falling but its dry inside with a campfire smoldering at the entrance
thanks for the food and drink
and for bringing em yourselves
were here to stay
we dont care to live if we cant fight beside ya
stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket
he swigs hands it to hamish for a chug then to wallace who declines but smiles for the first time in many weeks
one thing william
longshanks is offering a truce
he has dispatched his daughter in law as his emissary and she has sent word that she wishes to meet you in a barn
wallace frowns a barn
hauntingly similar to the one in wallaces childhood
as he sits on his horse and looks at the place surmounted by a white flag of truce it gives him a chill
but in full view of the barn he hands hamish his sword and rides forward
are the assassins killing knives ready
its william wallace sure
hes given up his sword
they position themselves at every entrance
wallace reaches the barn dismounts and moves toward the door
but suddenly instead of entering he grabs the heavy bar and seals the door
at this motion scots spring from the woods in all directions
the assassins inside realize the ambush is being turned on them but its too late they hear the entrance being sealed from the outside
more scots led by stephen scramble up from hiding place tinder dry brush and pitch against the barn and set it on fire
in moments the entire barn is blazing
the scots stand back and watch the barn burn their faces lit by the flames
after awhile there are no more screams from inside
the princess sees the burning off in the distance like a bonfire
she stands on the wall looking out at it
and then she sees on a hillside silhouetted against the night and the fire a rider just sitting there on his horse looking at the castle
she runs into the castle up the stairs and stands on the pinnacle of the castle so that she too is silhouetted and he can see her
the lone rider is william wallace
being placed in a window of the stable cottage built into the outer wall of the castle
at a distance the candle burns like a tiny beacon
and william sees it
sits alone wondering if her signal is going to work
wallace climbs the castle wall hand over hand up the mortared stones to the window twenty feet above the ground
he reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the ledge
he looks through the window and sees her inside
inside the room she looks up and sees him there
the first glance frightens her and yet she expected him prayed for him to come
now for a long long moment the two of them look at each other through the glass each realizing the implications of this moment
she moves to the window and opens it
the wind rushing through extinguishes the candle and he slips inside
they face each other in the darkness
then she strikes a match and relights the candle and they look at each other
a meeting in a barn
it had to be a trap
and only you would know i would be aware of it
it does me good to see you
i am much diminished since we met
she wants to say something but instead she says something else
there will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month
food and weapons
they will trav no
i didnt come here for that
then why did you come
why did you
because of the way youre looking at me now
the same way
as when we met
he turns his face away
gently she pulls it back
you looked at me
and saw her
he twists back toward the window
you must forgive me what i feel
no man has ever looked at me as you did
surprised he looks at her now
you have a husband
i have taken vows
more than one
ive vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son
and i cannot keep both promises
slowly it starts to dawn on him what shes asking and an unexpected smile plays at his lips
her smile lights too
consider before you laugh and say no
you will never own a throne though you deserve one
but just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule england
and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks but with that of a true king
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge
but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost
or simply love me
because i love you
slowly he reaches to the candle flame and pinches it out
we see the surging pent up passion
and their bodies limp they lie asleep entwined
the first rays of morning spread yellow light through the room and across their faces
wallace wakes suddenly sunlight
he grabs for his clothes as she wakes covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of bed rushing to the window to look out
he reaches her throws the window open and sees a clear path down the wall to safety
he stops and looks at her and touches her face in gratitude
she has to ask
did you think of her
pausing to look straight into her eyes he kisses her her not marion and climbs out
she watches him go
wallace stands alone in the grove where marion lies
wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way to an english fortress the villagers drop what theyre doing and run to follow them we see wallaces face
relentless as he hacks men down in the attack with the fortress sacked and smoking in the background we see wallace lead his men away the people cheering him
once again wallace stares at the fire beside his friends
your rest is making me exhausted
stephen offers the jug wallace declines
come itll help you sleep
but it wont let me dream
pulling a tattered tartan around himself he lies down
he sits by a palace hearth where a huge blaze burns still hes huddled beneath a blanket and coughing blood
but he ignores the ice in his lungs his mind is plotting
she walks the parapets alone lost in her own thoughts
sits staring at
the stone coffin of his father
the coffin is closed on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his father as a knight in final repose
ranks of candles light the scene and roberts face cold as the stone
robert looks up to see old craig
may he rest in peace
you have already sealed the coffin
he was a modest man
it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
craig sits next to robert and keeps his voice low
our nobles are frightened and confused
wallace has the commoners stirred up again from the highland clans to the lowland villages
in another six months christ and the apostles could not govern this country
robert only stares at his fathers stone coffin
longshanks knows his son will scarcely be able to rule england much less half of france
he needs scotland settled and he trusts you after falkirk
if you pay him homage he will recognize you as king of scotland
our nobles have agreed to this as well
he shows robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in scotland
the bruce barely glances at it
if i pay homage to anothers throne then how am i a king
homage is nothing
it is the crown that matters
the crown is that of scotland
and scotland is william wallace
that is another matter
there is a price to all this required both by longshanks and our nobles
pay it and you will be our king
and we will have peace
robert turns from his fathers coffin to look at craig
a commotion the nobles their heads hooded are led in on horseback by guerrillas from the village
the nobles stop feel their hoods pulled off and see wallace
we come to seek a meeting
youve all sworn to longshanks
an oath to a liar is no oath at all
an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed
every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you
so let the council swear publicly
some scarcely believe you are alive
other think youll pay them mornays wages
we bid you to edinburgh
meet us at the city gates two days from now at sunset
pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you
scotland will be one
wallace glances at hamish and stephen who can barely hide their contempt
wallace looks at the nobles
i will meet you but only one way if robert the bruce is there and puts his hand on my bible and swears his loyalty to scotland
he has already agreed to come
wallace stands alone looking at the moon and stars
hamish moves up and sits down beside him
you know its a trap
but we cant win alone
we know that
this is the only way
i dont want to be a martyr
i want to live
i want a home and children and peace
ive asked god for those things
but hes brought me this sword
and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country then ill do that too
thats just a dream william
weve lived a dream together
a dream of freedom
your dreams arent about freedom
theyre about marion
you have to be a hero because you think she sees you
is that it
my dreams of marion are gone
i killed them myself
if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death id welcome it
william hamish and stephen are on their horses looking down at the road leading into the city
wallace hands his dagger to stephen and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it to hamish
were going too
one of us is enough
wallace hugs them first stephen then hamish
tears roll down hamishs cheeks
with one last look at his friends wallace rides away
the house looks quiet as wallace rides toward it
robert the bruce and craig stand at the hearth tense
he wont come
i know he will
they hear the approach of a single horse
the bruce looks out to see wallace arriving
my god he has a brave heart
wallace dismounts and enters
wallace appears at the doorway into the main room and stops
bruce faces him
the eyes of both men meet saying everything
wallace steps into the room
he sees something flicker onto bruces face shame just as henchmen in the rafters drop a weighted net and it envelopes wallace
english soldiers spring from the closets run down the stairs and tumble over him ripping at his clothes searching as if broadswords might spring from his boots
they bind wallace hand and foot
he stares at robert the bruce who averts his eyes
the soldiers hurry wallace out the back where others are bringing up horses
robert grabs the english captain of the soldiers
he is not to be harmed
i have your kings absolute promise that he will be imprisoned only
the captain looks at bruce the way the high priest must have looked at judas and leaves
now we will have peace
robert the bruce spots something on the floor that must have fallen from wallaces clothes as they grabbed him bruce lifts the white handkerchief and sees the familiar thistle embroidered
a procession of heavily armed english soldiers winds its way toward london wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse his head bare to the sun
country people come out to jeer
dont look so fearsome does he
a thrown rock careens off wallaces check rotten fruit slaps his shirt
his lips are so parched they bleed
edward inspects his father who lies semiconscious in bed breath rattling ominously in his chest
the princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the kings bedroom and follows him down the hall to his own
is it true
wallace is captured
simply because he eluded your trap do you think he is more than a man
my father is dying
perhaps you should think of our coronation
when will his trial be
for treason there is no trial
tomorrow he will be charged then executed
with a faint smile he shuts his bedroom door in her face
the bruce is incredulous yelling at craig
you are surprised he would lie
balliol was murdered in a church yesterday
you are longshanks new designate
you will be king
wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of hannibal lecter
before him are six scarlet robed royal magistrates
you stand in taint of high treason
we push in on the iron mask that binds his face
we can only see his eyes but they are bright
against thy king thou vile fool
hast thou anything to say
never in my whole life did i swear allegiance to your king it matters not he is thy king
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times
i cannot commit treason if i have never been his subject
confess and you may receive a quick death
deny and you must be purified by pain
do you confess
do you i do not confess
then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification
and in the end i promise youll beg for the axe
the stone prison and the wretched stone section known to this day as the wallace tower
wallace is alone in his cell still in the garish restraints
we can only see his eyes as he prays
i am so afraid
give me strength
the jailers jump to their feet as the princess enters
i will see the prisoner
weve orders from the king the king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling
who do you think will rule this kingdom
now open this door
the jailer obeys
the princess can barely contain her shock at the sight of wallace the jailers snatch him upright
on your feet you filth
they hesitate there is no way out of this hell
leave me with him
reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell but they can still see her back and hear her
looking at wallaces eyes through the mask she cant quite hold back her tears dangerous tears that threaten to say too much
wallace tries to distract her
what kindness of you to visit a stranger
come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
will he show mercy to my country
will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
is to die quickly
perhaps even live in the tower
in time who knows what can happen if you can only live
if i swear to him then everything i am is dead already
she wants to plead she wants to scream
she cant stop the tears
and the jailers are watching
your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger
she almost goes too far now pulling closer to him but she doesnt care
she whispers pleading
you will die
it will be awful
every man dies
not every man really lives
she pulls out a hidden vial and whispers
it will dull your pain
it will numb my wits and i must have them all
if im senseless or if i wail then longshanks will have broken me
i cant bear the thought of your torture
on the verge of hysteria she presses the vial to the air hole at his mouth and pours in the drug
the jailers seeing suspicious movement shift inside the cell she backs up her eyes wide full of love and goodbye
from inside the mask he watches her go
when the door clangs shut he spits the purple drug out through the mouth hole
longshanks lies helpless his body racked with consumption
edward sits against the wall watching him die glee in his eyes
the princess enters and marches to the bedside
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace
you fancy him
i respect him
at worst he was a worthy enemy
oh thou great king
and win the respect of your own people
longshanks shakes his head
even now you are incapable of mercy
the king cant speak
but hatred still glows in his eyes
the princess looks at her husband
to you that word is as unfamiliar as love
before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead
she leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair
the guards flanking the door start forward but the princesss eyes flare at them with more fire than even longshanks once showed and the guards back off
she leans down and hisses to longshanks so softly that even edward cant hear
death comes to us all
and it comes to william wallace
but before death comes to you know this your blood dies with you
a child who is not of your line grows in my belly
your son will not sit long on the throne
i swear it
she lets go of the old king
he sags like an empty sack back onto his satin pillows
without even a look at her husband she strides out of the room with the rattling breath of the dying king rasping the air like a saw
the crowd is festive hawkers sell roast chickens and beer from barrels
royal horsemen arrive dragging wallace strapped to a wooden litter
as they cut him loose and lead him through the crowd the people begin to jeer and throw things at him chicken bones rocks empty tankards
we see a former english soldier one of those who fled in terror at the battle of stirling lift a stone from the street and hurl it it cracks against
wallaces eyes capture the soldier and hold him piercing his soul
the soldier looks away in shame even as the rest of the crowd jeers more
grim magistrates prod wallace and he climbs the execution platform
on the platform are a noose a dissection table with knives in plain view and a chopping block with an enormous axe
wallace sees it all
we will use it all before this is over
or fall to your knees now declare yourself the kings loyal subject and beg his mercy and you shall have it
he emphasizes mercy by pointing to the axe
wallace is pale and trebles but he shakes his head
the crowd grows noisier as they put the noose around wallaces neck
the princess in helpless agony hearing the distant noise from her room in the palace
hamish and stephen disguised as peasants among the crowd helpless too but there as if to shoulder some of the pain
longshanks rattling coughing blood as edward watches
robert the bruce paces along the walls of his castle in scotland
his eyes are haunted he grips the embroidered handkerchief that belonged to wallace
a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around wallaces neck and hoist him up a pole
in the score amazing grace wailed on bagpipes carries through all that happens now
ties hand and foot wallace is strangling
the magistrate watches coldly even when the executioner gives him a look that says theyre about to go too far he prolongs the moment then the magistrate nods and the
executioner cuts the rope
wallace slams to the platform the magistrate leans to him
rise to your knees kiss the royal emblem on my cloak and you will feel no more
with great effort wallace rises to his knees
the magistrate assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak
wallace struggles all the way to his feet
very well then
the executioners slam wallace onto his back on the table spread his arms and legs and tie each to a crank
goaded by the crowd they pull the ropes taut
they crowd grows quiet enough to hear the groaning of wallaces limbs
hamish and stephen feel it in their own bodies
wonderful isnt it that a man remains conscious through such pain
wallace shakes his head
the executioners cut off his clothes take hot irons from a fire box
the crowd grows silent we see them not wallace as the irons are touched to his body but we hear the burning of flesh
then the magistrate signals wallace wants to say something
clear your sinuses
everyone hears hamish smiles even through his tears
rebuffed the magistrate nods to the executioners who lift the terrible instruments of dissection
we are spared seeing the cutting we are on wallaces face as the disembowelment begins
the magistrate leans in beside him
it can all end
just say it
the crowd cant hear the magistrate but they know the procedure and they goad wallace chanting
wallaces eyes roll to the magistrate who signals quiet
booming the prisoner wishes to say a word
hamish and stephen weep whisper pray
wallaces eyes flutter and clear
he fights through the pain struggles for one last deep breath and screams
the shout rings through the town
hamish hears it
the princess hears it at her open window and touches her tummy just showing the first signs of her pregnancy
longshanks and his son seem to hear the cry still echoes as if the wind could carry it through the ends of scotland and robert the bruce on the walls
of his castle looks up sharply as if he has heard
the crowd has never seen courage like this even english strangers begin to weep
the angry defeated magistrate gives a signal
they cut the ropes drag wallace over and put his head on the block
the executioner lifts his huge axe and wallace looks toward the crowd
he sees hamish eyes brimming face glowing
begins to drop
in the last half moment of his life when he has already stepped into the world beyond this one he glimpses someone standing at hamishs shoulder
she is beautiful smiling serene
she is marion
his face has changed
he is standing at the open grave where marion lay the headstone carved with the thistle still there
he holds the handkerchief
as he tucks it into his own pocket and we move in on his eyes we realize the voice over belongs to him
after the beheading william wallaces body was torn to pieces
his head was set on london bridge where passerby were invited to jeer at the man who had caused so much fear in england
beat his arms and legs were sent to the four corners of britain as warning
we see the people as the remains of william wallace are displayed in a box
the faces of the young men are fiery
it did not have the effect that longshanks planned
more young men put on tartans take up their weapons and gather into fighting units
among them is hamish carrying a shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword and the words for freedom
robert the bruce flanked by the noblemen and the banners of the scottish throne and backed by a ragtag army of scots sits on his horse and looks down at
the english generals in their martial finery
the english are haughty victorious at the head of their colorful polished army awaiting the ceremony of submission from scotlands new king
and i robert the bruce backed by a body of scottish veterans rode out to pay homage to the armies of the english king and accept his endorsement of my
the scots the remains of william wallaces army look so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait
one english commander turns and jokes with another
i hope you washed your ass this mornin its never been kissed by a king before
up on the hill robert the bruce sits on his horse and waits
he looks down at the english generals at their banners their army
he looks down the ranks at his own
he sees hamish
old macclannough is there his eyes watery his weapon sharp
the scottish bride lord bottoms took is there among the ragtag archers her husband beside her
robert knows none of them yet he knows them all
old craig among the other scottish nobles mounted beside the bruce grows impatient
come lets get it over with
but robert holds something uncurling his fist he looks at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to wallace
the nobles start to rein their horses toward the english
robert the bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his breastplate and turns to the highlanders who line the hilltop with him
he takes a long breath and shouts you have bled with wallace
now bleed with me
bruces broadsword slides from its scabbard
a cry rises from highlanders as from a tomb rising wal lace
the chant builds to a frenzy it shakes the earth
the scottish nobles can scarcely believe it the english are shocked even more
robert the bruce king of scotland spurs his horse into full gallop toward the english and the highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill ready to run through hell itself
in slow motion we see their faces
and over this we hear the voice of william wallace
in the year of our lord patriots of scotland starving and outnumbered charged the fields of bannockburn
they fought like warrior poets
they fought like scotsmen
and won their freedom
on wallaces army behind robert the bruce charging down the hill to victory and glory we slow to freeze frame and hear their chant huge echoing
