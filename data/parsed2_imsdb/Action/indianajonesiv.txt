indiana jones and the monkey king a
indiana jones and the garden of life a screenplay by chris columbus underwater close up a brightly colored fly attached to a dangling fishing line
a large salmon swims to the fly
the salmon examines the fly deciding whether or not to bite
camera pans upward tracking the line and moving out of the water
we pass the crooked boards of a small rowboat and continue to pan upward
a man reclines in the boat
his hands gently grip a wooden fishing pole
he is handsomely dressed in sportsmans trousers and a blazer
his green tweed fishing hat is lowered over his face
its brim is filled with various types of tackle and bait
it is dusk
a warm summer evening
the boat rests on a calm lake surrounded by moors
thick night fog has begun to settle over the entire area
suddenly the mans fishing line becomes taut
the wooden pole buckles
the man stirs
he sits up moving the hat from his face
camera dollies forward into a close up of the man
it is indiana jones
his face anxious
indy begins to reel in his catch
a voice interrupts
in the distance
indy turns to the direction of the sound still struggling with the line
countless orange flames sparkle across the moors
the torches are being carried by several members of a small village
the villagers are gathered behind a group of six policemen
the policemen are headed by inspector angus macgowan a plump balding fellow with a veiny bulbous nose beady green eyes and a thick curled red moustache
macgowan shouts to indy
we need your assistance
struggling with the fishing line cmon mac
its the first bite ive had all week
its very importantl
indiana struggles a bit longer with the line
but his conscience prevails and indy drops the fishing pole
with a grumble he rows back to shore
night has fallen
it is very dark
a reluctant indiana has joined the inspector and the other policemen
they lead the townspeople along the foggy moors
slowly carefully the villagers search
their faces tense many unable to hide their fear
a summer wind sends an eeire howl whistling through the night air
blue moonlight bathes the moors creating stark frightening shadows
an expression of anger and annoyance cover indianas face
he grumbles to macgowan
do you value our friendship mac
more than me nightly pint
then this better not be some wild goose chase
taint wild geese were after doctor jones
you got me word on that
sincere and a macgowans word is truer than an angels kiss
there is a sudden scream
one of the villagers stumbles upon something
everyone gathers around the villager
a corpse lies before them
the body has a somewhat rubbery appearance as if all of its bones had been broken
the mans pale greenish face is frozen in a hideous grimace
indiana and macgowan stare in shock
the villagers whisper among themselves
hes the eighth
just like the others
all his bones busted
whatevers killin people around here aint human
pointing offscreen its there
the woman shoots forward
the police and the townspeople are right behind her
a curious indiana follows
the woman stops in a clearing
she is pointing ahead
the villagers surround her
they stare ahead in the direction where the woman points
nearly a mile in the distance we see an enormous th century stone structure
tall forboding towers lined with menacing gargoyles pierce the night sky
the castle appears deserted
its interior is completely dark save for a small flickering candlelight
it burns from the castles upstairs window
indiana gives a questioning look to macgowan
the inpector points to the castles upstairs window
only burns after a murders been committed
nods turning toward the castle lets go
the villagers step back
eyes wide with fear
murmers of aint goin in there nor i got me a wife and kids are heard from the terrified villagers
indiana turns to macgowan
even the usually sturdy inspector is trembling
but macgowan turns to his men forcing himself to be strong
that is what were here for
points to men hennesey
youre comin with us
as each man is called the color leaves his face
the chosen policemen reluctantly join the inspector and indiana as they begin walking toward the castle
the remaining villagers and policemen stay behind
the elderly woman kisses the crucifix that hangs from her neck
she stares at the departing men
may god help them
two enormous wooden doors covered with intricate carvings of demons serpents and gargoyles adorn the castle entrance
indiana and the police stand before the doors
indy glances to the upstairs window
the candle still flickers
a long wooden bar carved into the shape of a serpent is fastened through the metal door latches
it blocks the castle entrance
indy and the policemen grab hold of the bar
it is extremely heavy
using all of their strength they manage to slide the bar out of the door latches
it hits the ground with a thud rolling down the castle stairs
indiana clutches the rusty metal door handles
the doors creak
and slowly open
a thick cloud of dust explodes from inside of the castle
it blows out all of the torches
behind the open doors there is only total darkness
indiana enters holding the flashlight before him
the policemen exchange frightened glances
inspector macgowan shoves them through the open doors
indys flashlight beam glazes over the castles interior
it is a stone palace
filled with elaborate antique furnishings macabre sculptures and oil paintings
the place is bathed in dust
thick cobwebs fill each corner
it is extremely cold
the mens breaths are visible
hennesey rubs his folded arms
its deathly cold in ere
how could a human bein survive
hearing this the other policemen exchange terrified glances
indiana shines his flashlight to a twisting stone staircase
the staircase spirals upward along a far wall leading to the second floor
a faint glimmer of light emanates from the top of the stairs
indiana moves forward
the policemen follow
indiana ascends the stairs
toward the light
macgowan and the others are directly behind indy
as he makes his way to the top indiana examines the bizarre oil paintings that line the wall
there are various portraits and landscapes depicting everything from military battles to sunday picnics
but the unsettling quality of the pictures is that they each feature the same white haired elderly man
indy comments to mac
this guys got one hell of an ego
baron seamus seagrove iii
some say e walks the moors every midnight
others claim es been dead for years
indy arrives at the top of the stairs
his hand rests on a sculpture that is part of the bannister
the sculpture is a bust of baron seagrove
indiana makes his way to the first doorway where the light emanates
the door is wide open
a thick cobweb covers the entrance
indy wipes away the web and enters the room
the policemen draw their pistols
deserted except for a few pieces of elaborate ancient furniture and a large canopy bed
everything in the room is caked with dust and cobwebs
save for the burning candle
it rests on the windowsill in a sparkling sterling silver holder
it bathes the room in orange light
indiana walks toward the candle
arm outstreched he prepares to lift it
the policeman watch
tightly gripping their pistols
indys fingers are inches from the candlestick
there is a loud whoosh
the candle goes out
indiana drops his flashlight
there is total darkness
we hear the distant manical laugh of a man
it echoes through the castle
indy retrieves the flashlight clicking it back on
the candle has disappeared
the laugh has sobsided
macgowan looks at his men
a troobled look covers the inspectors face
macgowans eyes dart about the room
hennesy is gone
panic e was standin right ere
just a second ago
standin right beside me
the soond of a bell
a thick dull ringing
in the distance
it sends a chill through the men
indiana darts out of the room
following the sound
the policemen are right behind him
indy and the police hurry down the stairs
the ringing bell continues
macgowan is calling for hennesey
indy dashes to a door along the far wall
he opens it
it leads into a dark basement
the sound of the ringing bell echoes from inside
indiana enters motioning for the others to follow
a decrepit narrow wooden stairway leads into the basement
indy holds tightly to his flashlight
the policemen are clustered behind him taking each step with extreme caution
the boards creak and groan with their every move
macgowan leans to his side calling for hennesey
macgowans weight causes the rotted bannister to snap in two
he loses his footing
falling off the side of the stairs
indianas arm shoots out
grabbing hold of macgowans collar
indy pulls macgowan back to safety
macgowan catches his breath
thanks for catchin me
id rather be catchin trout
they continue down the stairs arrivifig at the bottom
it is a large musty stone basement
the slimy walls are covered with a green moss
there are several doors along the basement wall
the sound of the ringing bell is much louder down here
indiana moves to the first door
he reaches for the handle
the policemen draw their pistols
indy opens the door
a large object shoots out from inside
rolling toward the men
the policemen fire their guns
several shots ring out
the object comes to a stop
a deep red liquid pours out onto the floor
indy dips his finger into the liquid
interesting blood type
the policemen stare
indys flashlight beam shines ahead illuminating the mysterious object a wine barrel
and inside the room is a deserted wine cellar
suddenly a loud creak echoes through the basement
galbraith pointing off screen look
a large stone door built into the wall slowly opens
indy and the police stare in amazement
the door stops
a flickering light glimmers from inside
indiana walks to the opening
he peers into the opening
the police stay a few steps behind
a family crypt
stone coffins with glass covered tops line the crypt walls
macabre ghastly religious statues decorate the room
countless death masks cover the ceiling all carved with that same frighteningly familiar face
camera dollies to the far corner of the crypt
it stops on a close up of the candlestick
the exact candle from upstairs
it rests on one of the coffins glass tops
a trembling macgowan steps back away from the crypt
be blurts an order to his men
you come with me
well search for hennesey
you go with doctor jones
finger shaking points to inside of crypt in there
macgowan and galbraith nearly fall over each other as they scramble away from the crypt
the two dash off into another section of the basement
indy shakes his head
he enters the crypt
a reluctant and very frightened bottomley follows
indys flashlight beam dances across the glass coffin tops
decayed corpses smile from inside their hands tightly clutching crucifixes
bottomley is horrified by the sights
indiana continues ahead
he passes the burning candle moving further into the darkness of the crypt
the shivering bottomley stays directly behind indy
with their every step the bells ringing grows louder
indiana and bottomley arrive in a circular chamber located at the far end of the crypt
here the ringing bell is nearly deafening
the sound echoes from above
we are on the floor of the bell tower
indiana shines his flashlight upward
the beam stops on a ringing bell that hangs several feet in the air
inside of the bell dangling by his feet is the dead body of hennesey
he has replaced the bell clapper
his body swings back and forth
it slams into the sides of the bell
causing the dull ringing
indiana grabs bottomleys arm
lets get outta here
indy and bottomley turn to the crypt door
it begins to close
the two men dash forward
the door continues to close
indy and bottomley are only inches away
when the door slams shut
they push and kick at the door
it wont budge
a panicked bottomley calls for help
open the door
using his flashlight indy scans the door looking for a crack another way out
indy nudges bottomley
motioning to candle i need more light
bottomley hurries to the candle
he reaches out
there is a loud whoosh
the candle flame goes out
followed by total darkness
indy turns from the door
indy shines his flashlight toward the area
the candle is gone
there is no sign of bottomley
indiana takes a step forward
again no answer
indy sweeps the flashlight beam across the room
it passes one of the coffins
then shoots back
indy is met with a bottomley lies inside the coffin
his face twisted in a ghoulish smile
all of his bones broken
his hands are wrapped around a crucifix
indy stares in horror
there is a sound
there is someone else in here
indys flashlight beam darts around the crypt
there is no sign of anyone
who is it
the same crazed laugh of a man echoes through the crypt
a chilled indy turns back to the door
he is startled to find the crypt door indy reaches out
he touches the sparkling green ice
he snaps back his hand
his fingers are burnt
macgowan and galbraith are outside of the crypt door
they pull at the doors metal handles
trying to open it
but the door wont move
macgowan calls through the door
try to push
indy answers taking a step back
theres some kinda hot ice coverin the
indiana suddenly falls
the floor has disappeared from beneath him
indy manages to grab hold of a stone coffin
his fingers tightly grip the coffins edge
indiana looks down
beneath him is a several indy tries to pull himself up
the coffins ancient stone begins to crumble
large chunks and pieces fall from indys grasp
he is losing seconds before he plummets into the abyss indiana reaches inside of the coffin
he clutches onto a corpses arm
using the arm indy at the precise moment indiana releases the dead arm
he lands on a rocky ledge
located only a few feet below the open crypt floor
indy stands on the ledge
suddenly the ledge indiana falls
his body drops hundreds of feet into the blackness
a moment passes
we hear a splash
a pool of water
surrounded by rocky cavernous walls
indianas hat floats on the waters surface
indy pops out of the water bobbing up beside the hat
indy reaches for the hat
suddenly a fish flaps out of the water
the fish gobbles up one of the hats live baits and disappears back underwater
now they bite
indy attempts to pull himself out of the water
there is a loud sound
indys eyes dart to his side
two horizontal metal gates eject from the cavern walls
they shoot across the water
theyre headed toward each other
and indys head
indy dives underwater
the gates snap shut
less than an inch above the waters surface
indy attempts to resurface
the closed gate stops him
he clutches the grating trying to move the gate
its too strong
indy struggles for air
there isnt enough space
hes going to drown
in desperation indy swims downward
looking for an alternate escape
but there is no bottom in sight
indys eyes bulge
his face loses color
only a few precious seconds of life remain
when suddenly he spots something
a small tunnel
built into the cavern wall
indiana hurriedly swims to the tunnel
he bolts inside
a water fountain
a large three tiered stone structure
instead of the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens this fountain is surrounded with water spewing demons gargoyles and hellish beasts
camera dollies to a large metal drain located inside of the fountains base
the drain cover begins to turn
suddenly flipping open
indiana crawls out of the opening
he gulps at the air
color returns to his face
life returns to his body
indy rises to his feet
he finds himself standing in the fountain
he is inside of a banquet room
the sprawling room is beautifully decorated in victorian dignity
the room is immaculate
not one speck of dust
two medieval suits of armor adorn one wall
a gargantuan crystal chandelier hangs above a long mahogany banquet table
at the far end of the table sits a shriveled white haired elderly man
it is baron seamus seagrove iii the fellow whose likeness appeared in every piece of artwork
baron seagrove is calmly eating his dinner
a bloated roasted pig rests on a silver platter before him
the same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the family crypt now rests on the table
directly beside the baron
two powerful muscular mastiffs are tied to baron seagroves chair
the hounds fight for a scrap of meat
indiana stares in bewilderment at the new surroundings
he steps out of the fountain
baron seagrove seems unaware of indys presense
indiana walks toward the baron
excuse me sir
baron seagrove does not look up from his plate
indy moves closer
he speaks louder
canyou hear me
baron seagroves hand nonchalantly unties the mastiffs bindings
still walks toward the table
the baron continues to ignore him
indy is annoyed
there are two dead policemen upstairs and
the mastiffs leap forward
coming at indiana
he tries to get away
the hounds are upon him
they drag indy to the floor
baron seagrove continues to enjoy his dinner seemingly oblivious to the scene before him
indiana fights for his life
the vicious dogs tear at his clothing and skin
indy spots something
on the wall above
hanging amidst a display of stuffed animal heads is a hunters trumpet
indy struggles to his knees
trying to reach for the horn
but the dogs are still biting
indys fingers are inches from the horn
the mastiffs sharp claws rip at his arm
but indy manages to snatch the trumpet
he quickly moves the horn to his lips
a high piercing note fills the air
the dogs respond to the sound
stopping their attack
for a moment
tattered and bruised indiana leaps to his feet
he drops the horn
he the mastiffs come to their senses
they dart after indy
mouths baron seagrove continues to dine still ignoring the action
indy runs to a velvet curtain
he grabs hold of a long thick rope that is attached to the curtain
indiana tears the curtain from the wall
a large stained glass window is behind the curtain
the first mastiff leaps at indy
indiana quickly drapes the curtain over the hound
indy ties a large knot in the open curtain end
the dog is trapped
the second mastiff is only a few feet away
barrelling toward indy
indiana hops to the window ledge
he opens the window
the mastiff leaps upward
indiana jumps out of the window
the dog follows indy also jumping out of the window
the mastiff falls
flying hundreds of feet into the rocky waters below
the hounds vicious howl fades
camera pans from the water and stops on indiana jones
indy has outsmarted the mastiff
be hangs onto the swinging window frame
he leaps back inside the room
baron seagrove pours himself a glass of wine
a very angry indiana walks toward the baron
chow times over mister
you better start talkin
the baron still ignores indiana
theres a lot of strange things happening around here
a suit of armor located a few feet behind indy suddenly twitches
its arm lowers
its head slowly turns
indiana still walks toward the baron who is only concerned with spreading butter on his bread
and i want some answers
do you hear me
louder i want some answers
there is a loud creak of metal
a huge sharp battle axe shoots into frame
swinging toward indys head
the axe is only inches from his face
indy leaps back
the axe slices through the air
just missing indy
the shaken indiana is shocked to see a glistening black suit of armor
the black knight is nearly seven feet tall
it has come to life and is walking toward indy
the black knight is wildly swinging the battle axe
indiana continues to step back
unbeknownst to indy his steps are leading him toward another suit of armor
also over seven feet tall this armor is made of a silvery white metal
as indy moves closer the white knight opens its arms
when indy is within reach the white knight locks its powerful arms around indys chest
indiana tries to break free
the white knights grip is too tight
indy is trapped
the black knight still comes toward indiana
its frenzied axe swings back and forth
indy still struggles with the white knights bone crunching grip
the black knight is only a few feet from indy
its deadly axe blade inches from indys face
indiana moves fast
he jerks his body forward
this flips the white knight off its feet
over indys head
the white knight flies into the black knight
this sends both knights falling to the floor
indiana shoots to his feet
the two knights leap to their feet
they chase indy
the black knight armed with his axe the white knight armed with a long sharp sword
baron seagrove spoons another helping of boiled potatoes onto his plate
indy snatches a shield and sword from a nearby wall display
ready to fight
the knights are upon him
indiana battles both knights
he defends the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield and swordfights the other knight
the sound of heavy metal fills the room
indys sword strikes the white knights thick chest
the sword snaps in two
in the confusion indys shield is knocked from his hand by the powerful battle axe
indy is defensless
the two metal giants raise their weapons
aiming for indys head
the two knights swing
indy dives to the floor
the knights cant stop their weapons in time
they deliver a hard blow to each other
the woozy knights wobble and spin
in a momentary daze
indiana jumps to his feet
the black knight hisses
he dashes after indiana
the white knight is still reeling from the blow
seeing the black knight in hot pursuit indy searches for a weapon
he spots the curtains long thick rope
lying on the floor
the black knight is nearly upon indy
indiana grabs the rope
facing the knight
indy snaps his wrist
a loud crack
the rope shoots forward
not unlike indianas familiar whip
the rope wraps itself around the black knights neck
indy jerks the whip forward
this sends the knight flying through the air
the knight crashes into the stone foontain
several of the fountains sculptures shatter into pieces
the dazed dented black knight attempts to stand
but loses his footing
the knight falls backward
into the fountains wide drain opening
its heavy armor causes the knight to sink
disappearing into the hole
into the pool of water
indy catches his breath
the white knights sword swings into frame
slicing through indianas jacket
indy jumps back
the vicious white knight comes toward him
indiana turns to run
finding himself at the banquet table
face to face with the roasted pig
a few feet away baron seagrove continues to dine
the white knight raises his sword above indy
the sword begins to swing down
indiana ducks and dodges the deadly blows
instead of carving indiana the knights sword manages to slice perfect sections of the roasted pig
the satisfied baron helps himself to a freshly carved slice of pork
indiana leaps onto the table top
trying to escape the living suit of armor
but the white knight climbs up onto the table
the sword slashing knight pursues indy along the table top
indy glances upward
to the heavy chandelier
he continues to step backward
leading the knight directly below the chandelier
at the precise moment indy picks up a sterling silver plate from the table top
indy whisks the plate in the air
toward the rope that holds the chandelier
the spinning plate severs the rope
the chandelier flies downwardl
crashing on top of the white knight
the knight lies beneath the chandelier
the sword drops from its lifeless hand
onto the table top
indy takes the knights sword
eyes on fire sword outstretched indiana walks across the table top
headed for baron seagrove
the baron prepares to take another bite of his food
the sword shoots into frame
the tip of the blade rests upon baron seagroves rubbery throat
havent you had enough
baron seagrove finally looks at indiana
the baron lowers his fork
his face twists into an eerie grin
he begins laughing
its the same maniacal laugh we heard earlier
indy responds by blowing out the flame of the mysterious candle
the rooms door bursts open
inspector macgowan and galbraith dash inside
they hurry to baron seagrove
their pistols aimed at him
galbraith handcuffs the baron
macgowan looks at the bruised bloodied and tattered indiana jones
now you can get back to your fishing doctor jones
no chance mac
my plane leaves in the morning
gotta get back to school
shakes his head tis a shame to go home empty handed
smiles an idea tell ya what my friend
i fancy meself quite the fisherman
tomorrow ill go out and catch you a real beauty eh
sarcastic smirk right
send it to me airmail
incredulous doctor jones
a macgowans word is truer than
an angels kiss
they exit the room
the villagers surround the castle
their bright torches are raised high in the air
baron seagrove is led out of the castle by indiana and the police
the crowd begins to whisper
as the baron is led to the police vehicle he turns and looks at indy
the baron speaks in a trembling raspy voice
his eyes are wild
a chill rushes through indiana
the baron turns continuing to the police wagon
one of the villagers shouts
es done it
indiana jones has captured the killer
the crowd cheers
indiana gives a humble nod and wave
macgowan shakes indys hand
indy glances to the police vehicle
baron seagrove climbs into the back compartment of the police vehicle
galbraith closes the vehicle doors
the baron is still visible through the vehicles windows
he lights a cigarette
it appears that the match flame shines through the barons body
its as if he were a indiana turns to the others
but it is obvious that no one else has seen the apparition
macgowan notices the pale expression on indys face
what is it man
you look as if youve seen a screamin banshee
indy points back to the police vehicle
but it has already departed
it drives over a far hill disappearing into the night
indy sighs turning back to macgowan
it was nothing mac
nothing at all
a rainy spring day
students run to the university doors protecting themselves with textbooks
rain splatters the window of this cramped cluttered room
crooked stacks of dog eared textbooks and papers nearly reach the ceiling
the spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various archeological relics and instruments animal and bird skeletons fossils primitive statues etc
sitting at a small wooden desk amidst a mountain of term papers is indiana jones
indy is wearing a brown three piece suit and circular wire rimmed glasses
in one hand he holds a student seat assignment card as he hurriedly reads through the term papers
he furiously grades each paper
to make matters worse the office is crowded with students with countless others pouring out into the hallway
all of the students are anxious to get inside
they are badgering complaining and moaning at indy
i took your class instead of all the others
i coulda had professor needles
you said youd have em graded by yesterday

my parents paid good money to send me here
you know how much they shelled out for your class
he doesnt care about us
he only wants fame and fortune

indiana continues to grade the papers trying to ignore the verbal assault
betsy tuffet pushes her way to the front
betsy is indys student assistant
she is years old with thick luxurious black hair bright brown eyes and a small framed athletic body
betsy is a tough
a brooklyn kid
she moves close to indy her hair brushing his cheek
indiana is very tense continuously working on the term papers
hello ind giggle doctor jones

goodbye ind giggles doctor jones
again the obnoxious student shouts
didja get the name
capital professor thad priestly enters pushing virgil aside
priestly is a young wisecracking greasy haired aquaintance of indys
he shoves a photograph beneath indys nose
points to photo thats what i named im
captain said it was the biggest fish he ever saw
indiana glances to the photo
it is a picture of prof
priestly dressed in fishermans outfit standing on a pier holding a giant fish
priestly gives him a manly slap to the back
what about you jonesey
you were over in scotty land for two weeks
didja catch the big one

indy is suddenly interrupted by a hard slap to his face
he looks up
a beautiful blonde student rebecca stands over his desk
she two timing bastard
indiana rubs his jaw
how could you
my own mother
in my own bed
slaps him again ive had it with you
priestly hides his chuckle
rebecca throws a shirt that obviously belongs to indiana on the desk and storms out of the room
indy shakes his head and continues working
the students are still harassing him
a loud voice echoes through the room
a burly postman stands in the doorway holding a thick enormous brown envelope
indy motions to the postman
the postman tries to make his way through the crowd
indiana goes back to his grading but is suddenly interrupted by a loud tapping noise
he looks up
dean claude coventry a stately elderly gentleman raps a steel ruler on indianas desk
the dean is upset
doctor jones ive had complaints from several of the students the postman interrupts dropping the heavy envelope onto indys desk
the postman shoves a yellow paper in front of indy
dean coventry continues lecturing
they feel that you are ignoring them that you are distracted
gives postman the signed paper me
staring at indys signature puzzled whats this
thats how you sign your name
indy grabs the paper
hes signed a b on the line where his name is supposed to appear
indy crosses out the grade and signs his name
professor coventry still lectures indiana
marshall university is not the place for sloppy behavior
at that moment indy opens the envelope
a large amount of water pours out
saturating the papers on the desk
this is followed by an enormous dead trout
it flops onto indys desk
the students exchange startled and nauseous glances
indiana removes a water logged note from the envelope
it reads a macgowans word is truer than an angels kiss
indiana uses a tissue to wipe some of the water from his desk
dean coventry shakes a finger at indy
i have one final warning for you doctor jones the phone rings
interrupting the dean
indiana quickly answers the phone
a fuming dean coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat
indiana speaks into the receiver
oh hello marcus

but this better be important marcus
indiana hangs up
he gives an embarassed look to the furious red faced dean
you are on probation jones
if there is no improvement you will be dismissed
the dean storms out of the room
indiana gathers the wet papers
he begins to exit the room explaining to the students as he makes his way through the crowd
ill have all of these graded
indiana continues making apologies and excuses
the obnoxious student again shouts at him
hands him paper virgil stares at his paper adorned with a large red f
indiana exits the room
the large room is filled with skeletons fossils and statues dating back to the dawn of man
indiana his arms cluttered with the soaking term papers hurriedly enters the museum with marcus brody
marcus is very anxious
he carries a l mm metal film cannister beneath his arm
indiana is very impatient
his eyes dart to a full sized skeleton of a tyronosaurus rex
this better be important marcus
or the museum will soon be displaying my bones
my teaching career is in danger of extinction
smiles you will not be disappointed indiana
close up an ancient painting
the watercolor features an upright wrinkled face sun wu kung the stone monkey king
but the monkey is not made of stone
he appears to be half human
his face is wise
his coal black eyes are penetrating
he wears a lion skin robe and holds a tall golden hooped staff
sun wu kung stands amidst a garden of luscious ripe peace trees
he is surrounded by a heavenly glow a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in the clouds
camera pulls back
we are inside of the museum board room
marcus holds the tattered painting before indiana who sits at a desk still feverishly grading the wet term papers
after he finishes each paper indy pins it to a nearby bulletin board for drying
he glances to the painting of sun wu kung
sun wu kung the stone monkey king
that was ten years ago marcus
going back to papers wanting to change subject geez
this heller kids got the worst grammar
ten years or fifty years
it will always be in your blood
ignoring marcus dont believe this
he spells repeat with two es
think back indiana
remember your desire
still ignores marcus kid gets an a on content
a d on form
angry slams his fist on the desk damn it man
you cant bury those feelings forever
indiana finally looks up from the papers
he glances at marcus then looks at the painting
camera dollies into indianas face
he becomes very serious
his eyes are empty
memories of failure fill his head
nearly two years of my life
looking for the remains of that monkey
a piece of his legendary golden hooped rod
or some sign of the lost city
shakes his head nine men perished on the journey
rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered
looks back to papers in a near whisper we still came back empty handed
threading the projector one mustnt give up so easily indiana
marcus we spent thirteen months in china
another seven in india
but none in africa
puzzled expression there was no proof
archeological or anthropological
to indicate that sun wu kung ever visited africa
marcus turns off the room lights
marcus starts the projector
a black and white image flickers on the far wall
we see a pygmy standing in what appears to be a grassy area
the pygmys name is tyki
he is adorable
a little over four feet tall his body is taut muscular
his long black hair is shaggy his eyes are wide and bright
his face is cute
covered with a very inquisitive expression
tykis energy is boundless
he cannot stop moving
standing beside tyki is dr
a tall strikingly beautiful woman
she is communicating with tyki in sign language
the woman is dr
the famous zoologist
she works in africa studying animals in their natural habitat
very interesting marcus
now if youll turn the lights back on continuing three weeks ago dr
clarke discovered that cute little fellow
a pygmy of an unusual race
unrelated to any known african tribe
clarke believes that tyki comes from the lost civilization of sun wu kung
he stands walking closer to the flickering image
but how did miss doctor
how did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis
the pygmy speaks in a language that has no african origins
but bears a strong resemblance to chinese
the rivers of africa have been plagued by various oriental pirates and scavengers since the th century
turns from screen not much evidence marcus
the pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neck
believed to come from sun wu kungs legendary garden of immortal peaches
skeptical marcus there are countless undiscovered african tribes
all with various obscure beliefs and practices
smirks one tribe may wear peach stones
another may wear banana peels
indiana walks back to his papers
there is one final bit of evidence
the pygmy is over years old
indiana adjusts his spectacles
he stares at the black and white image
the cute pygmy appears to be in his mid twenties
he walks to the camera staring into the lens
tyki examines the camera with thats impossible
clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmys clothing
everything was over years old
skeptical hes probably wearing his great grandfathers stuff
camera pans back to the projected image
tyki begins to unscrew the camera lens
the picture goes out of focus
the film runs out
marcus turns off the projector and flips on the overhead room lights
indiana gives marcus a puzzled look
what does all of this have to do with me
clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the lost city of sun wu kung
she is quite familiar with your reputation
shed like you to come along
gathering his papers no chance
there will be money involved
the museum is willing to fund the expedition
ive burned this bridge
indiana turns and begins to walk out of the room
marcus calls him
he waves the papers at marcus
ive got to finish these
youve got to finish something much more important
you crossed the threshold over a decade ago
and its been tearing at your insides ever since
passionate my friend if there is even one iota of truth in dr
then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this chinese legend for centuries
you may uncover the secrets to a lost civilization
and possibly to mans never ending search for immortality
indiana stares at the painting of sun wu kung
can you afford to pass up the single most important adventure of your life
indiana has no answer for marcus
indy picks up the painting
a thrilling expression slowly covers indianas face
his eyes glimmer
filled with a long lost excitement
the sound track music soars
the papers are slightly crumpled
a drop of water hits the papers
camera pans upward
betsy tuffet indys student assistant sits at the desk grading the papers
she is crying
her falling tears soak the papers
we are inside of indianas apartment
later that evening
indiana stands in the background
he is hurriedly packing his bags
his familiar gun hat and whip lie on the bed beside the suitcase
indy notices that betsy is crying
he walks to betsy
indy puts his arm on betsys shoulder attempting to comfort her
betsy snaps at indy
you cant do this to me
shaking tears off the papers cmon betsy
youre gettin em all wet again
you just cant go away
africa is so far away and
heartfelt i love you indy
thought we agreed this was sposed to be casual
you call what happened last night casual
a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make
very upset momentary lapse
so thats all i am to you
betsy shoots to her feet walking off screen
his eye catches one of the termpapers
he begins to read making a few corrections
we see betsys hand removes indianas whip from the bed
indiana continues to correct the papers
suddenly there is a creaking noise
his face goes white
he runs off screen
one end of indianas whip is attached to an overhead lamp
camera pans down the whip
the other end has been formed into a noose around betsys neck
sbe stands on a wooden chair
she kicks away the chair
indiana grabs betsy in midair
he takes the noose from her neck and places betsy on the floor
angry whatsa matter with you
tryin to ruin my whip
if i cant have you
i dont want to live
indiana tosses the whip into his suitcase
he pulls up the chair and forces betsy to be seated
he pours her a tall glass of bourbon
youll feel better
indiana walks to his suitcase continuing to pack
his back is to betsy
she raises the glass to her lips
she pauses reading a message on the bourbon bottle
it reads danger
she lifts the bottle over her head and begins to douse her body with the liquid
indiana is busy folding his clothing
suddenly we hear the flick of a matchstick
he sees the bourbon covered betsy preparing to light her body on fire
indy dashes forward
he blows out the match moments before it sparks betsys clothing
indy shakes betsy by the shoulders
get a hold of yourself
there are a lot of other guys
not like you
succumbing to his ego thats true
realizing his mistake but thats no reason to stop living
besides im too old for you
by the time youre seventy five ill be
calculates the thought of it makes him grimace yeccchhh
ill be disgusting
indiana turns and finishes his packing
she notices an enormous stone african urn
the pound antique sits atop a section of bookshelves
meanwhile indiana makes certain that his gun is packed
he places the familiar hat on his head and begins to close the suitcase
close up the african urn
it is wobbling
moving closer and closer to the edge of the bookshelves
camera pans to the floor
betsy lies here
directly below the trembling urn
betsy shakes the bookshelves causing the urn to tilt and shiver
the urn is nearly halfway off of the edge
if it falls
the urn will crush betsys head
indiana struggles with closing his tightly packed suitcase
the urn falls
headed straight for betsy
indiana suddenly grabs the urn
inches before it strikes betsy
indiana rests the urn on the floor
he helps betsy to her feet
betsy wraps her arms tightly around indiana
dont leave me indy
indiana picks up his suitcase and tries to walk to the door
but betsys arms are still tightly wrapped around him
finally indy stops
his eyes burn through betsy
youre just a flighty kid
twenty minutes after i walk out this door youll have a date with the college romeo
two hours from now youll be madly in love with him
by tomorrow youll forget i ever existed
hurt betsy removes her arms from indiana
he gives her a quick kiss to the cheek and hurriedly exits
betsy glares at the closed door
a tough angry expression covers her face
never underestimate the determination of a brooklyn girl doctor jones
the silhouette of the ship sails across the water
a beautiful orange sky fills the background
stands aboard the ships deck
it is a typical s luxury ocean liner filled with vacationing tourists
indiana stares into the sunrise
his face is a study in concentration and intensity
he anxiously awaits his adventure
a moving red line traces indianas journey across the ocean toward africa
the red line comes to a stop at mozambique
chief port on the coast
gateway to the zambesi river
supply ships sailboats and rafts line the marina
the docks are crowded with various merchants and sailors unloading their goods
small shops and restaurants clutter the waterfront
behind them are rows of one story low square homes
tall healthy palm trees surround the area
an ocean liner has anchored along the shore
several passengers exit from the ship
indiana steps onto the ocean liners exit ramp
he is unshaven wearing his traditional leather jacket and hat
indy looks around expecting to meet someone
there is a a loud car horn
crowds of pedestrians leap out of the way
a rusted yellow model t barrels along the rickety dock
the word taxi is crudely painted on the cars trembling doors
the cars tires are wobbling
thick black smoke pours from the cracked exhaust pipe
the ancient car rattles and grinds
upon seeing the car indiana smiles
at the foot of the ocean liners ramp the car screeches to a stop
indianas friend and guide jumps out of the taxi
scraggy is a rough unkempt african man
an elderly fellow with the energy and vitality of a youth
his snow white hair and beard are wild
he wears tattered dirty clothes that are many sizes too large for his skinny body
homemade crocodile sandals flop on his feet
scraggy suddenly breaks into a wild grin
he spots indiana
scraggy shoots up the exit ramp running through the crowd of people
scraggy stops a few feet in front of indiana
scraggy waves his arms before him as if he were blessing indiana
following this scraggy leaps into indys arms
indiana cradles scraggy like a child
speaking with a portugese accent scraggy exclaims
at last we are reunited
looks to sky oh keechingo god of friendship
i thank you for granting my wish
indy rests scraggy back onto the ramp
scraggy moves to assist indiana with his luggage
before picking it up scraggy raises his arms over the baggage
again he blesses the suitcases
scraggy then picks up the bags
i see you havent changed scraggy
mahootmek god of goodness say
before body make contact with foreign object
one must cast out bad spirits or or bad spirits will enter your body
you have excellent memory indy
last time we saw each other
you made me wear the same clothes for weeks straight
never separate body from clothes or bad spirits will hide in pockets
in other words
if people never changed clothes
there would be no evil in the world
chuckles puts his arm around scraggy i missed all a your crazy philosophies scraggy
they not so crazy indy
serious eyes wide with fear these days
there is much evil in the air
i feel it
indy and scraggy continue to walk down the ramp moving off screen
camera pans to a few feet behind them
camera stops as the screen is filled with a large blazing red swastika
camera pans upward
we see that this is the sleeve of a german soldier
camera stops on the face of a thin skeletal nazi
he resembles the angel of death
gutterbuhgs face is narrow and sunken
his deep set eyes are a frightening light blue
his complexion is pale
his hair is blonde
his right arm appears rigid
it rests stiffly at his side
gutterbuhg follows indy and scraggy through the crowd
the nazi removes something from his pocket
it is a tiny mechanical item
it resembles a cockroach
we see that it is a mini radio transmitter
gutterbuhg whispers into it
german english subtitles are we making contact
the mechanical roachs eyes blink red
gutterbuhg gives a chilling meanwhile indiana and scraggy arrive at the taxi
scraggy begins to secure indys baggage to the roof
indy opens the rear door of the cab
he begins to climb into the back seat
he is met with a swift kick to the stomach
he falls to the ground
the wind knocked out of him
scraggy runs to the open door scolding the person inside
why you kick dr
steps out of the shadows of the car
we recognize her from marcus film but she is even more beautiful in person
she is the same age as indy
her hair is bright red
she removes her glasses revealing sparkling green eyes
she is very prim
but extremely intelligent and quick witted
she is dressed in khaki slacks and shirt
she speaks in a slight british accent
she hurriedly assists indiana to his feet
thought i was being attacked by a degenerate sailor
just a degenerate archeologist
your appearance is deceiving
they exchange a handshake and a smile
immediately attracted to each other
calling passenger indiana jones
a ship porter walks through the crowd pushing a large barrel on a dolly
indy waves to the porter
the porter stops in front of him
you left this aboard ship
puzzled there must be some mistake
i didnt the porter points to a section of the barrel that reads deliver to thats you aint it
the porter drops the barrel in front of indiana and hurriedly walks back to the ship
gutterbuhg continues to spy on indiana
the nazi hides a few feet away
in a dark alleyway
a puzzled indiana begins to open the barrel
scraggy shouts a warning
remember mahootmek god of goodness
before body make contact with foreign object indiana ignores scraggy and begins to pry open the barrel
you must cast out bad spirits
indiana still ignores scraggy
he struggles with the barrel top flirting with clare
may i call you clare
weve obviously got a lot of notes to compare
lets get started tonight
id like that very much
friend of mine owns a cafe
hell get us a nice quiet table
just the two of us at that moment the barrel lid flies off
the inside if filled with old brown banana peels
suddenly betsys head pokes through the peels
indiana is shocked
i warn you indy
you must always cast out bad spirits
a dirty unkempt betsy leaps out of the barrel
she throws her arms around indy
puzzled to indy your daughter
revolted a child
to clare its nothing
to betsy what the hell are you doing here
proving my love for you
how terribly sordid
to clare puppy love
shell get over it
this proves that nothing can come between us
not an ocean
not two separate continents
think im going to be ill
puzzled to betsy how
how could you stay alive
im from brooklyn
but weye been sailing for three weeks
stowed away in the banana barrel
ate my way to the bottom
pointing to clare hey indy
whos the babe
your intellectual and emotional superior
well youre gettin on my nerves miss
extends her hand doctor clare clarke
reluctantly shaking clares hand betsy tuffet
as in curds and whey
getting tough listen sister
you better stay away from indy
my dear he has no interest in me
ive already celebrated my tenth birthday
indiana shoots clare an angry glance
indy removes a wad of bills from his pocket
he gives them to betsy
why dont you get back on the boat
this time as a passenger
too late indy
scraggy points toward the ocean liner
the boat is several feet from shore
it sails back out to sea
whens the next one out
an amused dr
clarke gets back into the car
indy shoves betsy inside
he is furious
before indiana gets into the car gutterbuhg steps out from the alleyway
he tosses the tiny mechanical cockroach at indiana
the roach attaches itself to indys trouser leg
the tiny transmittor is very light
indiana can feel nothing
he gets into the car
scraggy blesses the taxi and gets into the drivers seat
gutterbuhg watches as the battered model t drives off
the nazi turns walking in an opposite direction
the camera follows gutterbuhg as he enters a seedy waterfront hotel
gutterbuhg walks through the dimly lit lobby filled with dusty tacky african furnishings
he turns a corner into a narrow decrepid hallway
he stops at the last doorway
he opens the door with a key and enters
a small musty hotel room
it is furnished with a single bed a sofa two chairs and a fire place
two bizarre african statues adorn the fireplace mantle
gutterbuhg carefully locks the room door
he walks to the fireplace
he tilts one of the african statues forward
there is a mechanical creaking sound
suddenly the sofa begins to move
it slides a few feet revealing an opening beneath the floor
a staircase leads into the opening
gutterbuhg descends the stairs
gutterbuhg enters a large brightly lit room
we are inside of a secret nazi headquarters
the room is filled with various communications equipment and radio transmitters
several nazi soldiers are seated before the equipment monitoring various radio signals
an enormous glass panel covers one wall
through the panel we see two speedboats
both speedboats are adorned with a swastika
they float in water in an underground man made chamber
directly beside the speedboats parked on a stone incline are two automobiles
the cars are enormous beautiful woodies
equipped with a running board and wood panelled sides
the cars glisten
brand gutterbuhg turns to klaus a hulking nazi who stands in the corner
pointing to klaus feet gutterbuhg shouts an order to klaus
camera pans to klaus feet
the nazis boot is untied
a long string dangles on the floor
the embarassed klaus kneels and sloppily re ties his shoe
gutterbuhg turns to a nazi who sits at a radio receiver
the nazi wears headphones listening for a transmission
the long frightening shadow of a man overcomes gutterbuhg
fear covers gutterbuhgs face
the shadow raises its arm
gutterbuhg also raises his right arm
but a bizarre mechanical squeak is caused by the movement of his arm
stands before gutterbuhg
mephisto is a nazi nightmare
his face is thick and bullish
his bulging eyes are a reddish brown giving him the appearance of a demon from hell
he has no facial hair
his body is thick
he is over six feet tall
he glares down at gutterbuhg
german english subtitles were you successful
gutterbuhg gives a timid nod
with trembling fingers he reaches over and turns up the volume of the radio transmission
the voices of indiana betsy clare and scraggy echo through a tinny speaker
mephisto manages a pleased grunt
german english subtitles keep a record of everything that is said
gutterbuhg nudges the officer before him
the officer hurriedly begins to scrawl a manuscript of the radio transmission
german english subtitles ever since our battle for the lost ark
the feuhrer has been very interested in the adventures of indiana jones
a miniature zoo
the peaceful compound is surrounded with small man made lakes and palm trees
there are countless metal cages filled with various animals
the tigers lions gorillas and other violent creatures are kept behind bars
but the llamas giraffes deer and various tame animals are free to roam the compound grounds
indiana enters with clare betsy and scraggy
the persistant betsy is annoying indy
she attempts to snuggle closer to him
indiana pushes her away
betsy tries to hold his hand
indy shakes her loose
scraggy watches all of this giggling to himself
we hear singing
a high pitched beautiful voice
clare walks to the far end of the compound toward the singing
the others follow
betsy walks by bonzo a large chimpanzee
as betsy passes the chimp catches a familiar smell
bonzo begins to follow betsy
clare opens the door of a large metal cage
here the singing is louder
clare enters the cage
scraggy blesses the cage then enters
betsy moves to go inside but bonzos large hairy hand reaches out and grabs betsy
pulling the girl off screen
filled with hand made wooden and bamboo furniture
tyki the adorable pygmy from marcus film is inside
tyki is dressed only in a belted leather loin cloth and sandals
he is perched on the floor working on a large tapestry
the tapestry depicts a colorful picture of clouds
the buildings of a large city are reflected on the clouds
tyki pleasantly sings as he does his work
upon hearing the cage door open tyki looks up
he sees clare
a joyous smile covers his face
the pygmy runs to clare giving her a huge hug and a kiss
clare introduces tyki to the others
this is doctor jones
tyki extends his right hand
he shakes indianas hand
indiana is charmed by the civilized display of friendship
indy smiles at clare
hes a real gentleman
shrugs just basic manners
what it takes most men a lifetime to learn
tykis accomplished in two weeks
introduces scraggy this is our guide scraggy brier
and miss bets clare pauses noticing that betsy is missing
clare suddenly breaks into a laugh
she points off screen
bonzo is being extremely affectionate toward betsy
the chimpanzee pulls and grabs at betsy
it is all very similiar to what betsy has been doing to indiana
betsy wrestles with bonzo calling indy for help
everyone chuckles at betsys dillemma
it appears that bonzo is attracted to miss tuffets derfume
eau de banana peel
tyki has gone back to his artwork
a fascinated indiana looks over the pygmys shoulder
where did you find him
about ten miles from here
we were on a photographic expedition
in the thick of the jungle
i heard sounds
i took a few steps and found tyki
he was lying in a shallow swamp
a high fever
nearly dead from exhaustion
he had obviously been travelling on foot for many days over countless miles
so i brought him back to the compound
nursed him back to health
indiana stares at the pygmy
a skeptical look covers his face
clare i hate to quibble with your anthropological abilities
but if this little fellow is over years old
what accounts for his youthful appearance
clare opens a door at the rear of the cage
it leads into another room directly behind the cage
clare and indiana enter
scraggy stays behind
he exchanges a friendly smile with tyki
meanwhile in the background we see betsy and the chimpanzee
they roll by on the ground
a fruit fly crawls along the peach pits surface
tyki was wearing this when i found him
camera pulls back
we are in a small sterile room
the peach stone rests on a table
indiana and clare stand over the stone
indy picks up the stone examining it
an annoying fruit fly buzzes around indys head
camera pans down to indianas trouser leg
the radio transmittor is still attached to his pants
the tiny bugs eyes blink
he stands inside of nazi headquarters huddled over the radio
the voices of indiana and clare echo over the speaker
gutterbuhg furiously transcribes the conversation
jones you are obviously familiar with the legend of sun wu kings garden of immortal peaches
a bite from the fruit of that peach tree would give a person eternal life
make them forever young
the vicious gutterbuhg smiles
camera pans to his notebook
gutterbuhg underlines the words forever young
studying the peach pit
the fruit fly continues to buzz around indianas head
theres nothing unusual about this nothing to indicate that its from sun wu kungs garden
the fruit fly lands on indianas neck
indy smacks the fly
a shocked clare runs to indiana
she grabs his hand and gently removes what remains of the fruit fly
she glares at indiana
this fruit fly had a normal life span of twenty four hours
frustrated sigh as an experiment
the fly was put in this room
with only the peach stone to sustain its existence
the fly stayed alive for looks at dead fly until now
she flicks thefly against the wall
indy gives an embarassed shrug
indiana and clare are suddenly interrupted by the sound of scraggy and tykis laughter
this is followed by the two of them having a discussion
in tykis foreign tongue
clare and indy exchange a shocked glance and dash out of the room
scraggy and tyki are having a conversation
clare points to scraggy giving a puzzled look to indiana
he understands him
nods scraggy knows hundreds of languages
hes the best guide in africa
turns to scraggy ask tyki where he came from
scraggy nods and asks tyki
tyki answers and points to the painting of the clouds
i come from land of city on clouds
what the hells that sposed to mean
to scraggy can he take us there
scraggy asks tyki
he and scraggy laugh hysterically
scraggy looks at indiana
he say if he could
he would go back
tyki offers some more information to scraggy
he say pai cho may help you
indianas eyes widen
clare looks at indy
the sacres proverbs and writings of sun wu kung
anxious looking at scraggy his disciples always carry the pai cho with them
scraggy asks tyki
the pygmy nods and removes his belt
we see that the thick belt actually unravels into a cloth scroll
tyki kisses the scroll and gives it to scraggy
scraggy nervously opens the scroll
it is filled with countless ancient chinese writings and proverbs
indiana stares over scraggys shoulder
can you translate it
indianas eyes anxiously scan the document
he is breathless
the sound track music soars
suddenly betsy and the chimpanzee fall into frame
on top of the scroll
bonzo straddles betsy trying to move his lips toward hers
she is screaming
bonzo moves its lips to betsy and gives her a big kiss
finally clare begins to make bizarre monkey hand motions and sounds
he understands clare
she continues to communicate with the chimp until bonzo turns and runs out of the cage
indiana and scraggy exchange an impressed glance
betsy wipes the kiss from her lips
it reads dashiells american bar
it adorns the front of a stylish mozambique nightclub
filled with cloth covered tables and ornamental african furnishings
a piece jazz band plays swing tunes
a few couples sway on the dance floor
the place is swarming with nazis
many are seated at the bar
others are scattered at various tables throughout the restaurant
some stand in corners
lurking in the shadows
they are all looking in one direction watching one man
indy sits with scraggy clare and betsy at a table near the rear of the restaurant
they are eating dinner
but indy scraggy and clare are more interested in the stone monkey scrolls
a very nervous scraggy translates
indiana wearing his spectacles takes pages and pages of notes
searching for a clue
an interested clare reads over indianas shoulder
betsy tries to become included in the discussion
but everyone ignores her
scraggy continues to translate
sun wu kung run like fire he journey to many monkey land to build his final empire
whos sun wu kung
ignoring betsy to scraggy many monkey land
thats a definite reference to africa
he journeyed to africa
also ignores betsy to indiana that confirms our suspicions that he may have formed his civilization here
angry to betsy betsy
keep your trap shut
this doesnt concern you
who cares about this stuff anyway
were in a nightclub
we should be havin fun
grabs indianas hand cmon indy
what a buncha stiffs
condescending to clare bet you cant dance
quite the contrary
i spent several months studying dance
the bunny hop
shakes her head the bondogea
the kyebe kyebe
african tribal dances
never heard of em
of course not
theyre beyond the spectrum of your microscopic world
insulted betsy gobbles down her glass of wine and turns back to indiana who is still deeply concentrating on the scrolls
betsys foot reaches across the floor
it rests on indys leg
betsy begins to rub against indianas trouser leg
the red eyed mechanical bug is still attached to indianas trousers
glares at betsy
clare reaches for her cup of coffee
she notices that the coffee cup trembles slightly
clare glances beneath the table and sees betsy rubbing indys leg
clare is disgusted
above the table clare shoots a scowl of disapproval at indy
a flustered indy tries to explain
but is suddenly interrupted by a hand on his shoulder
it is dashiell the suave handsome owner of the restaurant
dashiell gives a caarming smile to everyone at the table
enjoying your dinners
everyone nods expressing their thanks
dashiell leans close to indiana and whispers
watch yourself sport
most of the talk here tonight is about you
and it isnt good
indianas eyes dart around the room
he sees the various nazis
indy gives a confident smile
a worried dashiell continues whispering to indiana
i dont know what youve done to the nazis
but they are certainly no friends of yours
many of the animals are asleep in their cages
a security guard keeps watch on the compound
he stands outside of the metal gates
there is a sudden sound
the guard turns
the figures of three men stand before him
in the shadows
the nervous guard places a hand on his holster
we hear a mechanical creak
a mans leather gloved hand extends from the shadows
the hands finger is pointed at the security guard
the sound of rapid machine gun fire echoes throughout the camp
camera records the animals shocked reactions
lies on the ground
his body riddled with bullets
the shiny black boots of the three men pass his body
we notice that one of the boots shoelaces are untied
stares into the dark night
fear covers his face
he is seated inside of his cage
a candle flickers beside him
tykis hands rest on the beautiful tapestry
he hears footsteps
coming toward his cage
tyki reaches to his side
he grabs a stone dagger
suddenly a lood gonshot
the splintered lock from tykis cage goes spinning across the floor
the cage door creaks open
gutterbuhg stands in the doorway
two nazi soldiers helmut and klace who we met earlier are beside him
his stiff right arm extends from his side
his leather gloved index finger is pointing ahead
tyki growls at the nazis
raising the stone dagger over his gutterbuhgs finger begins to rapidly fire bullets
his mechanical arm is actually a a maceine gun
the bullets tear through tykis tapestry
they make a crooked tattered line through the beautifol work
a terrified tyki watches
gutterbuhg stops shooting
he removes the empty cartridge from a slot in his mechanical arm and replaces it with another
he points the deadly finger at tyki
a trembling tyki drops the dagger
the three nazis walk toward the helpless pygmy
indiana scraggy and clare continue to excitedly study the map
a neglected betsy pours herself the last of the wine
she is very drunk singing along with the bands version of cole porters night and day
betsy continues to rub her foot against indianas leg
tries to ignore betsys playing
scraggy continues to translate the scroll
with his golden hooped rod and its powerful lightning rays sun wu kung build water curtain cave where he live for days
the golden hooped rod
a heavenly staff with many different powers
most notably it had the ability to transform itself into hundreds of objects
staring it remains the most priceless treasure of sun wu kungs empire
and what is the
the water curtain cave
sun wu kungs legendary hideout
an enormous secret cave hidden behind a running waterfall
clare again reaches for her coffee
the cup and saucer are still trembling
clare peeks under the table and again sees betsys foot rubbing indianas leg
clare gives a revolted grumble
indiana excitedly explains scraggys translation
this proves that the water curtain cave exists in africa
to scraggy does it mention anything about sun wu kungs travels
reading scroll only place called
twisted snake water
the zarnbesi river
it has a reputation for its deadly water snakes
it would have been sun wu kungs logical path
confident anxious it will also be our logical path
betsys foot continues to rub indianas leg
finally indy reaches down trying to slap betsys foot away
but indys hand stumbles upon something else
the mechanical bug
indy tries to remove the bug
but the tiny device wont budge
indianas hand is buried beneath the table struggling to remove the bug
to clare it appears as if indy is playing with betsys foot
clare gives an incredulous look to indiana
please try to control that monstrous libido of yours
indiana finally removes the mechanical bug
he lifts it above the table
clare is about to ask a question
indy indicates for her to shhhh
he covers the bug and whispers to the others
we have to get back to the compound
tyki may be in danger
indiana clare and scraggy hurry from the table
a tipsy betsy follows
indiana passes the jazz band
he nonchalantly drops the mechanical bug into the trumpet players horn
the trumpet player hits a piercing high note
the nazi wearing the radio headphones emits a loud scream
his eardrums bursting with the trumpet sound
gutterbuhg klaus and helmut lead the bound and gagged tyki out of the compound
they keep their lugers at his back
suddenly klaus trips over something
he shouts a german order to helmut who grabs a tight hold of the baby deer
klaus aims his luger at the fawns head
gutterbuhg and helmut exchange a chilling laugh
tyki stares in horror
klaus clicks the luger
ready to shoot
there is an earth shattering crack
a whip shoots into frame
the whip wraps itself around the luger
tearing the gun out of klaus hand
the fawn breaks free and runs off
the nazis exchange a shocked glance
they turn and see indiana jones
he stands a few feet away
holding the whip
indiana points to tyki angrilly shouting to the nazis
get your hands off him
he points his finger at indiana
indy is puzzled
the finger begins to shoot
rapid machine gun fire
indy dives for cover
holding tyki captive the nazis turn and begin to run out of the compound
indy gets to his feet
he lifts his gun
ready to shoot
but the nazis are running behind several rows of cages filled with animals
indiana cant shoot
he dashes back outside
located on the waterfront
countless rows of long wooden docks line the marina
the nazis run to below a rotted ancient dock
here one of their speedboats waits
rudolph a pudgy nazi is at the wheel
the nazis hurriedly climb into the speedboat pushing tyki inside with them
indy runs to scraggys model t
scraggy sits in the drivers seat
betsy and clare sit in the rear
a drunk betsy still sings night and day
indy leaps onto the sideboard
he sees the nazis ahead climbing into the speedboat
indy motions for scraggy to drive
toward the dock
the nazi speedboat shoots forward
moving beneath the dock
scraggys model t follows above along the shaky dock
indiana rides the cars rusted sideboard
he sees the speedboat below through the wide openings in the docks slated boards
indy begins to shoot at the nazis
gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm firing shots back at indiana
machine gun fire splinters the dock boards slicing through the model t
the side mirror is blasted to pieces
the floor beneath betsy and clare erupts with flying bullets
just missing the girls
clare is horrified
betsy laughs hysterically
the model t is less than twenty feet from the end of the dock
if they continue ahead the car will plunge several feet into the water
but scraggy doesnt take his foot from the gas
gutterbuhg smiles seeing the vast ocean ahead
knowing hes almost as he dodges bullets indiana sees the end of the dock ahead
he shouts to scraggy
when i tell you
hit the brakes
the end of the dock is only a few feet ahead
clare covers her eyes
between hiccups betsy laughingly sings
indy looks to the speedboat
back to the approaching dock edge
waiting for the right moment
scraggys foot slams on the brakes
the sudden jolt sends indy flying the speedboat shoots out from beneath the dock
indiana lands directly helmut points his gun at indy
indy reacts with a swift kick to helmuts jaw
the nazi hits the deck
klaus comes for indy
they begin to fight
an angry gutterbuhg tries to shoot
but indy and klaus move too quickly
gutterbuhg cant get a clear shot
the model t has come to a stop
its front wheels teeter over the docks edge
scraggy betsy and clare get out
clare catches her breath
betsy is still laughing
about time we had some fun
a worried scraggy sees indiana fighting with the nazis
bad spirits have indy
he in trouble
scraggy runs off screen
the nazi speedboat is headed toward the side of an enormous ocean liner
gutterbuhg radios for help
indiana and klaus continue to fight
rolling along the deck
a bound tyki watches with wide eyes
the speedboat makes a sudden sharp turn
avoiding a collision with the ocean liner
indiana and klaus tumble off the boat
into the water
indiana and klaus continue their battle
they wrestle only a few feet from the ships large spinning steel propellers
the propellers create a suction force
drawing indy and klaus closer
toward a spinning death
indy and klaus grab hold of a dangling steel anchor
preventing their bodies from being sucked into the propellers
klaus pulls a switchblade from his pocket
he attacks indys clenched fingers with the knife
indy begins to lose his grip
his body inches toward the propellers
klaus raises the knife to finish off indiana
but klaus untied shoelace dangles beside the propellers
the shoelace catches a spinning blade
the shocked nazi is pulled into the indiana turns away holding tightly to the anchor
a blood red cloud surges through the surrounding water
indiana climbs the anchor to safety
taking a gulp of air
suddenly the water in front of him erupts with machine gun fire
indiana sees gotterbuhg
he has parked the nazi speedboat only a few feet away
gutterbuhg smiles pointing his finger at the helpless indiana
a sitting duck
goodnight doctor jones
there is a loud gunshot
gutterbuhgs mechanical arm is hit by a bullet
pieces of spring metal and sprockets fly from the wound
dashiell the nightclub owner is a few feet away
he is driving a sleek speedboat its side adorned with the american flag
dashiell points a pistol at gutterbuhg ready to take another shot
with a roar the nazi speedboat drives away
toward a cluster of docks
indiana climbs into dashiells speedboat
scraggy said you might be needing some help sport
dashiell hits the gas
tearing after the nazis
a frenzied high speed chase begins
through the darkness
beneath the rows of docks
the speedboats face countless obstacles
they swerve around a virtual forest of wooden poles which fly by at breakneck speed
the men duck and dodge dangling fish hooks and nets
many paths are blocked by the wooden rafts and rowboats
note because of the darkness these obstacles appear only when they are a few feet ahead of the speedboats
this makes the chase completely surprising and scary causing a funhouse effect
throughout the chase indiana and the nazis continue to exchange gunfire
a frustrated gutterbuhg cant shoot
his mechanical machine gun arm rendered useless by dashiells bullet
he continues to radio nazi headquarters for help
dashiell catches up with the nazis
the two speedboats travel side by side
their edges scrape together
the recovered helmut aims his luger at indiana
but indy leaps toward the nazi
the two fall
struggling for the gun
they fight between the two speedboats
the crack below them slightly opening and closing
up ahead an enormous stone pole appears
to avoid a collision the speedboats must separate
indy frees himself from helmut and rolls back onto dashiells boat
helmut looks up
he sees the stone pole ahead
coming at him
helmut tries to move
the two boats separate
helmut smacks into the pole
dashiell turns away from the wheel looking at indiana
you okay sport
indiana begins to answer
then sees something
dashiell turns back
the speedboat is headed straight for a solid wooden wall
a sign on the wall reads futtermans fishing warehouse
the nazi speedboat has already made a sharp turn avoiding the warehouse
theres no time for dashiell to turn
indy hits the deck
the speedboat arches upward at an angle
the speedboat blasts into the warehouse
splintered wood splatters through the air
dashiells speedboat bursts through another wall
the boat skids across the warehouse floor
screeching to a stop
a shaken dashiell gets out
indy runs to the window
the nazi speedboat shoots out of the docks escaping across the water
indiana grabs his whip
he kicks open the warehouse window
he snaps his wrist
the whip shoots forward attaching itself to the rear of the nazi speedboat
indy firmly grips his end of the whip
the whip tightens
indiana is pulled out of the window
gutterbuhg exchanges a victorious laugh with rudolph the speedboat driver thinking they have lost indiana
a frightened tyki looks back
his eyes suddenly fill with hope
his mouth drops indiana uses his whip to water ski behind the nazi speedboat
a red faced gutterbuhg slams his fist on the dashboard
he removes a sharp knife
he hurriedly begins to slice through indys whip
trying to indiana aims his pistol at gutterbuhg
but suddenly a shot whizzes by indys head
followed by another
coming from behind
a second nazi speedboat is in hot pursuit
there are five nazis inside
armed with pistols and rifles
all firing shots at indiana
meanwhile gutterbuhgs knife continues to slice through indys whip
only a few threads remain
indiana performs some expert water skiing
all in an attempt to avoid the flying bullets from behind
suddenly indys whip snaps
indiana falls underwater
directly in the path of the seccnd nazi speedboat
tyki hides his eyes
it appears that indiana has met a grisly death
the nazis in the second speedboat are delighted
shaking each others hands
camera pans to below the speedboat
we move underwater
sound track music soars
we see indiana
very much alive
he straddles the bottom of the speeding boat
holding on with all of his strength
indiana climbs toward the side of the speedboat battling the pressure of the rushing water
the four nazis are laughing
their backs turned to the approaching indiana
moving like lightning indy grabs one of the nazis and tosses him overboard
with a swift punch to the stomach and jaw indy sends another nazi into the water
the other two nazis tackle indy
they fall to the deck
gutterbuhg looks back
shocked that indy is still alive
his eyes suddenly light
he spots something
are moving toward each other
there is an opening between the two ships that continues to get smaller as the ships move closer
he orders rudolph to drive through the in the second speedboat the nazis have overcome indiana
one nazi pins indy down
the other removes a thick metal chain from his neck
a red swastika dangles from the chain
the nazi wraps the chain around indys neck
he begins to strangle indiana
gutterbuhgs speedboat moves toward the ocean liners
the opening between the two ships continues to shrink
and the second speedboat is directly behind gutterbuhg
the nazis are strangling indiana
the color begins to leave indys face
he gasps for air
the opening between the two ocean liners continues to get smaller
less than ten feet wide
gutterbuhgs speedboat is only a few feet through his fluttering eyes indiana sees gutterbuhgs speedboat headed for the ocean liners
indiana is nearly unconscious
the giggling nazis tighten the chain around his neck
with less than an inch to spare
gutterbuhgs speedboat squeezes between the two ocean liners
the second speedboat is only a few feet from the ocean liners
but as the ships move closer
the opening is nearly closed
the driver cant turn away
hes too close
he emits a scream
the nazis pause from strangling indiana
indy moves fast
he dives overboard
into the water
the speedboat hits the opening
the speedboat is crushed between the two ocean liners
the nazis let out their final screams
followed by a fiery explosion
flaming pieces of the wreckage are splattered through the night sky
his grinning sadistic face lit by the explosion
tykis eyes are filled with fear
several feet away indiana jones surfaces
he swims to the nearby shore and climbs out of the water
he rubs his reddened neck catches his breath and looks into the distance
indy sees gutterbuhgs speedboat
too far to catch
gutterbuhg sees the silhouette of indy standing on the distant shore
gutterbuhg orders the driver to move faster
the engine roars
gutterbuhg looks back at indy
the nazi emits a maniacal laugh that pierces the air
indiana watches the speedboat escape into the night
his eyes fill with rage
clare scraggy and a very drunk betsy join indy on the shore
betsy puts her arms around indiana
she rests her head on his shoulder
she closes her eyes and emits a drunken sigh
what a romantic night
an annoyed indy pushes betsy away
in a drunken stupor betsy moves to the next person clare
thinking shes still with indiana betsy puts her arms around clare
a worried clare is too concerned with the departing nazi speedboat
clare turns to inqy
will they hurt tyki
shaking his head they know hes important to us
holds up ancient scroll theyll use him to bargain for this
eyes closed resting her head on clares shoulder betsy sighs
indy you smell so good
clare pushes betsy away
betsy spins and wraps her arms around scraggy
clare watches the nazi speedboat disappear into the night
will they be following us
every step of the way
betsy still thinking shes snuggling with indiana rubs her face against scraggys bristly beard
i love it when you dont shave
its so sexy
scraggy pushes betsy away
she spins this time putting her arms around a hanging fishermans net
filled with fish
meanwhile scraggy looks at indiana and clare
pandoola god of purity say
always stay ten paces ahead of bad spirit
we cant let the nazis get to the city first
if they do theyll wipe out one of the greatest archeological finds in history
indiana turns and walks away
clare and scraggy hurriedly follow
theres no time to lose
the drunken betsy continues to embrace the net of dead fish
how bout a little goodnight kiss
betsy kisses the lips of a dead fish
you really know the way to a girls heart
betsy opens her eyes
face to face with the dead fish
betsy screams and runs toward the departing indiana clare and scraggy
the sparkling waters of the zambesi are lined by thick jungle
sounds of screeching gibbons exotic birds chattering insects and various other wildlife echo from the jungle
bright rays of hot sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm trees
a foot tattered wooden river boat the adobo travels along the zambesi
the boat is filled with various crates and barrels of supplies
and there are several men crew members all natives of mozambique
they are a motley crew all armed with swords and daggers
they are dirty
the boat pulls a long wooden raft behind it
scraggys model t is attached to the raft
one of the crew members a young man sits on the raft
he strums a beaten guitar singing a folk song
indiana stands at the ships steering wheel
forehead covered with sweat
he guides the ship along the twisting waters
clare exits from a cabin carrying a stenographers notebook
she looks radiant
her red hair shimmers in the morning sun
clare walks up beside indy
she crinkles her nose
what is that awful aroma
scraggys takin a shower
indy points off screen
scraggy fully clothed stands here
he rubs a large fresh onion over his face arms and legs
squeezing the onion juice over his body
indiana explains to a befuddled clare
he believes that onions keep bad spirits from entering his body
writing in her notebook in all my years of anthropology
ive never run across anyone or anything quite like scraggy
chuckles hes a rare breed
turns looks at clare for the first time youre looking very lovely
youre looking very lecherous
turns away angry just tryin to be friendly
save it for the schoolgirls
betsys just an anxious archeology student
she admires my work
egotistical shrug who can blame her
back to his point but its just some kinda hero worship thing
there was never any romance
pops in from off screen kisses indiana i dreamed about our first night together
clare disgustingly shakes her head
she continues to scrawl more into her notebook
indiana gives her a startled look
youre writin this down
nods im keeping an accurate record of our journey
whats that got to do with my personal life
i plan on testifying at your child molestation trial
indiana shakes his head
staring into the distance
why do i do this to myself
holding her head in pain betsy turns to clare
holds her head in pain to clare hey lady
youre sposed to be a doctor
you got any cures for a hangover
the best ive heard was used by a new zealand tribe
pauses thinking one part crushed owl skull
two parts rhino saliva
one part zebra dandruff
betsys face becomes pale
get a cup of donkey sweat two spoons of skunk hair
and one pint of shredded lizard tongue
betsy turns a light shade of green
i always use family cure
two spoons chopped leeches
half cup horse mucous
two quarts crocodile urine
ready to throw up ex
betsy runs off screen
the others exchange a shrug
scraggy looks at the river ahead
how far we travel indy
any sign of the nazis
shakes his head confident long as we keep up this pace
theyll have trouble tracking us
camera pans from the hopeful faces of indiana scraggy and clare to the cabin behind them
here a crew member hides in the shadows
his face hidden
he holds a small radio receiver
he whispers into the receiver
speaking in perfect german
he is seated in nazi headquarters
he repairs his detached machine gun arm which sits on the table before him
behind gutterbuhg a group of nazis listen to the radio transmission of scraggys treacherous crew member who discloses the location of the river boat
the nazis chart out the boats exact location on a large wall map
mephisto supervises the project
tyki bound gagged and bruised watches from a corner
mephisto looks at all the nazis
german english subtitles we must leave
various shots of exotic animals
a creeping panther
a sleeping white bat
a tense scorpion
a family of crocodiles
indiana scraggy clare and betsy are gathered on the deck
seated in a circle
they are surrounded by the crew members
everyone eats their dinner from tin cans
the surrounding lanterns cast an eerie light on the area
the young crew member plays a soft spooky tune on his guitar
betsy is restless
she glares at the guitar player
dont you know somethin else
the guitar player ignores betsy continuing to play
its so hot
do we have to stay on this stupid boat all night
nods we have to keep moving
can we at least jump in the water
go for a swim
theres an old legend about the zambesi
in ancient times criminals were given their choice of execution
or swimming across the zambesi
most chose execution
well be safer on the boat
annoyed to betsy now quit moanin and eat your food
an angry betsy tosses her tin can overboard
furious with indiana
you are so rude
i travel thousands of miles just to be with you
and everybody treats me like dirt
to clare nobody even talks to me without making some condescending remark they think im too stupid to understand
very upset so maybe i dont know a lot about weird tribal dances
im still pretty good with anthropology and archeology
maybe i could even help you out
if somebody gave me a chance
clued me in to what it is were doin here
to indy cause whether you like it or not indiana jones
im part of this expedition too
clare raises an eyebrow
indiana says nothing
he cant argue
motions to crew members my friends also curious about where we journey to indy
the crew members nod
staring at indiana
indiana turns to clare
she tell us all a bedtime story doctor jones
the crew members guitar playing combines with the sound track backing up indianas story with an eerie tune
a place known as the flower fruit mountain in the chinese province of ao lai
was struck by lightning
a stone monkey sun wu kung was born
he could walk
more than human
he was blessed with countless heavenly powers
but it wasnt enough
sun wu kung wanted to learn the secret of eternal life
pause equipped with his golden hooped rod to protect him sun wu kung travelled the world for many years learning the secret philosophies and teachings of eternal youth
eventually he was granted entrance to heaven
where the jade emperor gave sun wu kung the title of great sage of the heavens
and permitted him to oversee the garden of immortal peaches
pause after several years the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth
here he ruled an empire
a civilization of monkeys and humans who had life spans of many hundred years
shrugs the exact whereabouts of that lost city has been a mystery for hundreds of years
until doctor clarke discovered the pygmy
the crew members scraggy betsy and clare listen with fascination
its uncertain just how much of this legend is based in reality
nevertheless were hoping to find some sign of the lost civilization
what about sun wu kung
whatever he was
a stone idol
an actual monkey
a human being
but he is one of the most influentual religious figures in history and his remains are most likely somewhere in the lost city
suddenly they are interrupted by a distant sound
a low rumbling sound
unlike anything weve heard before
indiana turns to scraggy
shakes his head it is far far away
frightened what is it
some kinda weird animal
no animal sounds like that
could be banseebaba
banseebaba is giant demon from hell
he is feet tall
make sound like human never hear before
he is made up of all evil in the world
the sound suddenly stops
everyone exchanges a frightened terrified glance
whatever the hell it is
it went to sleep for the night
which is what we should do
the boat sails along the river
beneath the moonlight
a lone crew member stays awake
at the steering wheel
other crew members sleep along the deck
scraggy sleeps in a hanging cot
is asleep in his cabin
suddenly the door slowly creaks open
a shadow appears on the cabin wall
coming toward indiana
the shadow extends a hand
the hand grabs indys blanket
he leaps out of bed and tackles the mysterious person
indy flips on the cabin lamp
the intruder is none other than
indiana pulls betsy to her feet
she gives a flirtatious smile
im in the mood for passion
im in the mood for isolation
indiana leads betsy to the open door
he begins to push her back outside
betsy stops him
im not leaving
not till i get a kiss
serious one kiss
or ill scream
ill wake the whole boat
indiana has no choice
leans toward her pauses keep your mouth closed
betsy wraps her arms around indiana turning it into a at that moment across the hall clare exits the bathroom toothbrush in hand
she sees the kissing indiana and betty
indiana opens his eyes
he sees clare watching him
an angry clare marches into her room
she slams the door
we hear clare locking the door behind her and moving a piece of furniture in front of the door
indiana pushes betsy away
he quickly closes his door
betsy walks back to her room
a huge satisfied smile covers her face
the river boat has travelled countless miles into the heart of the zambesi
a tired crew member mans the boats steering wheel
camera pans down moving along the side of the boat
we stop at water level
a hand shoots out of the water
gripping a rusted sharp knife
followed by another hand
until there are countless hands reaching for the side of the river boat
the hands grab hold of the boat
several dark figures slowly rise out of the water
only the outlines of their bodies are visible backlit by the rising sun
the figures climb up the side of the boat
indiana stands on the rear deck shirt wrapped around his waist
he is shaving
clare sits a few feet away
writing in her journal
indy glances to her
whats that youre writing
the erotic adventures of indiana jones professor of perversity
back to shaving very funny
camera pans to the front deck
stopping on the driver
he stares ahead
steering the ship
suddenly a figure appears
behind the driver
the figure grabs the driver
around the neck
before the driver can scream
the figure slices his throat
scraggy witnesses this
through an open porthole
his face covered with shock
betsy stands over a large skillet
she fries pancakes lifting the first pancake betsy places it on a plate that rests beside her
betsy turns to get another pancake
a hand reaches from off screen
the hand grabs the pancake from the plate
betsy turns back
she sees the empty plate
she is puzzled
she shrugs placing another pancake on the plate
she turns back to the skillet
again a hand grabs the pancake
betsy turns and again sees an empty plate
she hears giggling
she turns and sees an oriental pirate
the pirate towers above betsy
he is dressed in colorful tattered clothes
the pirate laughs
his bloated mouth dribbles with pancake crumbs
betsy steps back
the pirate removes a dagger from his belt
eyes filled with lechery the pirate moves toward betsy
she grabs the skillet
throwing hot oil in the pirates face
betsy dashes out of the kitchen
has nearly finished shaving
he tries to convince clare of his innocence
she continues to write
you are blowing this betsy thing all out of proportion
indiana leans down
he rinses his face in a large bucket of water
a dagger flies into frame
just missing indiana
it sticks into the wall
a few feet above indys head
clare witnesses this
unaware of the danger indiana raises his head out of the bucket
he still tries to reason with clare
its not as if i have this sleazy reputation
clare is trying to interrupt indy trying to point out the dagger
but before she can say a word indiana again leans into the water bucket
another dagger shoots into frame
into the wall
this time only inches above indys head
indiana again raises his head
i am a respected
clare leaps forward
she pushes indy out of the way moments before another dagger flies into frame
sticking into the wall
indy and clare turn
three pirates stand here
swords extended they move toward indiana and clare
indys eyes dart to the water bucket table
his whip and pistol rest here
out of reach
indy and clare are trapped
the pirates move closer
suddenly a loud scream
the pirates look up
scraggy swings from a rope above
toward the pirates
before the pirates can react scraggy crashes into them
they tumble to the deck
scraggy shoots to his feet
he tosses a spare sword to indy
scraggy and indy begin to swordfigbt the pirates
dashing around the corner
a sudden stop
her face is buried in the hairy bare chest of kezure an enormous bear like pirate king
kezure hasnt bathed in years
he is dressed in several layers of tattered colorful clothing golden jewelry and animal skins
his stringy hair is long tied in a ponytail behind his head
a thick long moustache wraps around a large mouth filled with crooked golden teeth
kezure grabs her around the waist
he tosses clare over his shoulder
the river boat is overcome with a mixture of oriental and black pirates
sound track music soars
there is a heated battle between the crew members and the pirates
using her brooklyn street smarts betsy fights like a pro
with a swift punch and kick betsy defeats one pirate
she takes his sword
another pirate comes for betsy
she edges him on
you aint so tough
you wouldnt last ten minutes in brooklyn
the pirate attacks
he and betsy begin a heated swordfight
indiana and scraggy continue to battle the onslaught of sword slinging pirates
suddenly indy is interrupted by clares loud scream
he has appeared
beside the river boat
the ship is ancient
countless pirates are aboard the ship
armed with guns bows and arrows and cannons
kezure the pirate king stands at the edge of the boat
he still holds the screaming clare over his shoulder
from the pirate ship the pirates toss a grapnel rope to kezure
the pirate king grabs bold of the rope
holding tightly to clare kezure swings from the river boat to the pirate ship
indiana runs through the fighting crew members and pirates in an effort to save clare
suddenly the sound of cannon fire
the river boat rocks
hit by a cannonball
indy keeps his balance
sword in hand he dives into the water
indiana swims across the zambesi
toward the pirate ship
the water surrounding indy erupts with countless sprays of bullets cannonballs and flying arrows
the swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many pirates at bay
scraggy exchanges swordplay with a pirate
the sword is knocked from scraggys hand
he is defenseless
the pirate comes in for the kill
he raises his sword
ready to plunge it into scraggys heart
the pirate suddenly pauses
a horrified look on his face
the end of a sword shoots out of the pirates chest
a moment passes
the sword slides back inside of the pirates chest
the pirate falls to the deck
betsy stands behind him
she holds the bloodied sword
scraggy gives her a thankful nod
indiana has made it across the zambesi
he climbs up the side of the pirate ship
the pirates begin to shoot at indy
indy is hit
in the arm
he dives to safety in a nearby cannon compartment
indy pulls the arrow out of his arm
he is suddenly attacked by the pirate gunner
the two begin to struggle
camera pans to the rear of the cannon moving to a close up of the fuse
the fuse is lit
meanwhile indy and the pirate fight directly in front of the cannons open barrel
every few seconds each of their heads moves in front of the opening
the fuse continues to burn
clare has been tied to a mast pole
kezure stands in front of her
as his men battle around him kezure leans forward
the drooling pirate king sloppily kisses clare
along her neck
clare is nauseous
indy and the pirate continue to fight
the cannon fuse sparks
burning toward the bottom
the pirate pushes indys head inside of the cannon opening
the fuse will blow at any second
at the last moment indiana overpowers the pirate
indy leaps to the floor
the pirate falls forward
face to face with the cannon opening
the cannon fires
indys shirt is splattered with blood
indiana runs to a wooden staircase hurrying up the stairs
to the top deck
kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the struggling helpless clare
indy emerges from the cannon compartment
upon seeing the pirate king attack clare indiana shouts
you son of a bitch
he emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck curiously studying indiana
indy extends his sword
the pirate king removes a long sharp golden sword
they begin to fight
moving along the deck
a fast paced heated swordfight
a pirate has taken over the boats wheel
he steers the river boat off the regular path
it speeds toward the base of a large thrashing waterfall
the pirate ship moves alongside of the river boat also headed for the waterfall
scraggy and betsy sees the waterfall ahead
panic fills their eyes
they dash to the steering wheel
betsy distracts the pirate
they begin to swordfight
scraggy takes the steering wheel
he attaempts to steer the ship away from the waterfall
indiana and the pirate king have climbed to the top of the ships mast
they battle amidst the tangled ropes
as the two men fight indy notices that the pirate ship is headed for the waterfall
indiana has a sudden realization
he sees scraggy trying to steer the river boat in the opposite direction
indy screams above the cannon fire
still fighting scraggy
keep goin straight
full steam ahead
is confused by indys orders
he screams back to indiana
you crazy indy
we be crushed
we smash into rock wall
still swordfighting the pirate king screams to scraggy
full steam ahead
full steam ahead
his face is strong
he revs the engine
he tightly clutches the wheel
aiming the river boat toward the waterfall
swing from sail to sail continuing their spectacular swordfight
clare helplessly watches from the deck
continue to move side by side
to the shattering waterfall
continues to rev the river boats engine
chanting various prayers under his breath
in the background a feisty betsy continues to swordfight
penetrate the waterfall
the two boats are met with an exploding shower of powerful water
crew members and pirates are tossed about the deck
indiana and the pirate king hold tightly to the sails to avoid being thrown into the waters below
the aged boat tosses
boards creak and moan
ready to burst
but scraggy holds tightly to the steering wheel
keeping the boat afloat
the powerful water sends betsy somersaulting along the deck
she tries to grab hold of something
that will prevent her from falling off the boat
betsy finally clutches onto something
the arm are immersed into the waterfall
they disappear behind the thrashing curtain of water
the pirates hidden fortress
an enormous underground cavern
hndreds of burning torches cast a devilish glow
the grey rocks of the cavern walls stretch upward
filled with countless tiny caves
various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are scattered throughout the cavern
there are several other pirates here
waiting for the return of the pirate ship
the river boat and pirate ship enter the cave
the rushing waterfall thrashes behind them
the battered and bruised river boat comes to a rough stop
screeching along a far wall
the pirate ship sails to a smooth stop in the middle of the cavern
armed with guns knives and swords the pirates hurriedly surround the intruding river boat
they take betsy scraggy and the crew members captive
kezure leaps to the pirate ships deck and quickly unties clare
indiana attempts to follow
quickly grabbing a few sticks of dynamite from the pirate ship deck
kezure begins to lead clare off of the ship
his sword at her throat
indiana calls out
indy walks toward kezure stopping less than ten feet from the pirate king and clare
indys eyes burn through kezure
free the girl
glances to his captive friends and my friends
lights a match moves it toward tnt fuses or i blow your hideout here out of the water
indiana lights the dynamite fuses
kezure stops laughing
worried for a moment
then the pirate king breaks into a wide defiant smile
we will all die
indy didnt expect this
he is suddenly frightened
betsy scraggy and clare stare at indy
waiting for his next move
as the dynamite fuse slowly burns
to the tnt
kezure seems calm
perfectly willing to die
indy gets another idea
he blurts it out to kezure
we can take you to the lost city of sun wu kung
better men than you have tried to find the lost city
they have all failed
cynical laugh you are a fool
as the tnt fuse burns no
youre the fool
you and your friends are hiding out in sun wu kungs water curtain cave
and you dont even know it
puzzled looking around huh
scraggy and betsy exchange a shocked glance
clare is also surprised by the news
the tnt fuse nears the end
ready to blow at any second
indiana removes the ancient scroll from his pocket
he extends the scroll to kezure
the sacred pai cho scroll
kezure grabs the scroll
attempting to read it
only we can translate it
kezure examines the scroll
puzzled by the writing
indiana and scraggy exchange a hopeful glanpe
he mumbles to himself
the lost city
said to have streets paved in gold
treasures far greater than any mortal man could imagine
kezure pushes clare away
clare embraces indy as he blows out the dynamite fuse
kezure growls at indy
your pathetic lives will be spared
scratching his neck but everything we find in the lost city
belongs to me
fat chance sinbad
or youve got no deal
vicious smile it is my way
or youve got no head
a group of pirates sit together
they sing one of their ancient songs
the guitar strumming crew member accompanies them
indiana and scraggy sit around a blazing fire with kezure and several other pirates
indy wearing his spectacles translates the scrolls with scraggy
indiana is puzzled
he looks at scraggy
read that last proverb again
reads translation high tide drowns curiosity low tide quenches thirst
stands looking at the surroundings theres something here
something that could help us
meanwhile betsy and clare work in another section of the cave
clare is doing some archeological work studying the various artifacts and utensils
betsy assists her
they are surrounded by leering hungry eyed pirates
the drunken pirates dont take their eyes off of the girls
she points it out to clare
look at em
its like theyve never seen a woman before
were the ultimate women
kinda flattering isnt it
being the girl of guys dreams
clare and betsy exchange a chuckle
meanwhile indiana scraggy and kezure walk through the cavern
indy is looking around
curious he turns to kezure
is there an area
a place where the tide changes
kezure leads indiana and scraggy into a dark corner of the cavern
a large smooth wall stretches to the ceiling
the wall is filled with intricate cracks
at the base of the wall water slowly pours into the cavern
kezure points to the water
in a few hours
the water will be lower
and the remainder of this wall will be visible
indianas eyes light
he excitedly turns to kezure
were gonna need light
a lot of light
on this wall
indiana exchanges an anxious hopeful glance with scraggy
camera pulls back
all of the pirates sleep
their slumbering bodies lie in various positions throughout the cave
indiana and kezure are still awake
the flickering orange light of the torches illuminates the wall in front of them
they await the lowering tide
scraggy betsy and clare sleep on the ground beside them
kezure pours two glasses of whiskey from a stone bottle
he gives a glass to indiana
to my good fortune
kezure gobbles down the whiskey
indiana reluctantly drinks
kezure pours two more glasses
we are very much alike doctor jones
i doubt that
we both share a remarkable talent for killing
ive never gotten used to killing pal
i do it for survival
i do it for pleasure
indiana downs his whiskey
a laughing kezure does the same
indiana notices something
on the wall
he jumps to his feet
camera pans to the wall
the tide is very low
the entire wall is now visible
what were once simple cracks have become the specific lines of a map
a group of arrows leads to an x at the bottom corner of the map
a fascinated kezure and indiana study the wall
astounded this is incredible
this map was obviously used by sun wu kungs disciples
if they were ever lost
they are of the surrounding jungle
points to x where is that
it is located at the most south eastern part of the jungle
near the mountains
there is a village there
the mongooboo tribe
you know them
i traded with the chief for many years
anxious excited good
well leave in the morning
camera pans from indiana and kezure to a dark cave
a few feet away
standing inside is the figure of the mysterious crew member
his face is hidden in the shadows
again he radios back to nazis
he whispers in german
camera dollies into a close up of his radio microphone
a red swastika adorns the microphone
scraggys decrepid model t taxi putters across the flat jungle terrain
the hot sun shines in the background
the car is completely packed with people
ready to burst
indiana clare and betsy are crowded in the front seat
kezure and four pirates ride in the rear compartment
everyone is uncomfortable
two of scraggys crew members straddle the sideboard
three men sit on the roof including the guitar player who plays a delightful melody
various rusted pots pans and other utensils dangle from the car
this creates a charming jingling sound
the taxi passes a herd of giraffe
the beautiful animals stare in bewilderment at the passing taxi
suddenly there is a distant sound
the same low rumbling we heard earlier
the giraffes scatter
afraid of the unnatural sound
the bizarre sound echoes through the taxi
indy exchanges a puzzled look with the others
listening still far away
but getting closer
the sound stops
indiana is bothered
kezure leans forward
he points to a clustered area of jungle
nearly a mile in the distance
the village is there
beyond the thick of jungle
he drives toward the village
suddenly an arrow shoots through the window
just missing everyone
it shatters the passenger window
a tribe of native warriors appear on the terrain
there are hundreds
screaming in high pitched squeals
their bodies adorned with red and white paint
the angry warriors run toward the taxi
on the taxi roof the men dive for cover
arrows whiz by their heads
inside everyone rolls up the windows
the taxi is attacked with a shower of arrows
scraggy floors the gas
the taxi keeps moving ahead
speeding toward the jungle
indiana glares at kezure
thought you said they knew you
kezure gives a puzzled shrug
the warriors continue to chase the taxi
firing more arrows
the taxi spins to a stop
directly in front of a large opening that leads into the jungle
everyone pours out of the taxi
arrows fly by their heads
they dash through the opening
into the jungle
the warriors stop
outside of the opening
they dont enter
turning to each other they begin to laugh
an almost perfect path has been cleared through the thick jungle
indiana and the others run through the path
indy suddenly pauses
motioning for the others to stop
a puzzled look covers his face
theyre not following us
one of the pirates continues to move forward
his foot trips a thin string that stretches across the path
a booby trapped palm tree swings forward
it slams into the pirate
like a giant baseball bat
it sends the pirate flying upward
high into the air
his body is thrown several feet into the jungle
indiana exchanges a cautious look with the others
be careful where you step
weve got to move slowly
indiana leads everyone
they creep through the path
camera pans to his waist
a section of vine stretches across the path
another booby trap
indiana crawls beneath the vine
he motions for the others to follow
one by one they carefully crawl beneath the vine
the guitar player is last
he begins to crawl through
he nearly makes it when
the top of his guitar hits the vine
the vine snaps
there is a creaking sound
the guitar player dives to safety
the traps sharp metal teeth snap shut
the guitar is snapped in two
soon the path erupts with countless rows of traps
they eject from the ground
one after the other
everyone begins to run
the traps snap shut only a few feet behind them
everyone rounds a corner
they come upon
an enormous pit
over ten feet deep
filled with countless layers of scorpions
there is nowhere to turn
nowhere to run
the metal traps continue to shut behind them
indiana removes his sword
he slices at a bamboo tree
the traps continue to shut behind him
indiana gives a final whack to the tree
stretching across the pool
only a few feet above the stinging scorpions
indiana begins to climb across
moving hand over hand
everyone hurriedly follows
the bamboo tree creaks with their every movement
their feet dangle only inches above the scorpions
the last pirate grabs hold of the bamboo tree just as the final metal trap shuts
just missing him
as the last pirate makes his way across the pit he drops a small bag of gold coins
the coins rest a few feet below
directly on top of the scorpions
the pirate pauses
deciding whether to climb to safety or retrieve the coins
everyone else has made it across
the greedy pirate wants his money
with his left hand he holds tightly to the bamboo tree
with the other he reaches for the coins
his fingers are inches from the ciins
but he loses his grip
into the pit
surrounded by hundreds of scorpions
he struggles to get out
but he only manages to sink
the pirates screams die as his body is engulfed by the stinging scorpions
indiana and the others continue ahead
someones foot steps on a wooden trigger
there is another creaking sound
behind everyone a large bamboo door ejects from the ground
it leads to an underground cage
the door creaks open
three ferocious lions leap out
they come for the humans
everyone dashes forward
the lions are in hot pursuit
the humans dont stand a chance
suddenly clare stops
facing the charging lions
indiana looks back
what are you
the lions stop
inches from clare
they surround her
ready to attack
clare begins to make bizarre purring and cooing sounds
the lions pause
they recognize the sounds
the lions begin to warm up to her
she pets the beasts
the lions snuggle up to clare
licking her face
indiana and the others come closer
i imitated the sound of a lion mother calling her babies
betsy is impressed
lets get outta indy turns
face to face with a grotesque shrunken head
he steps back
the shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall muscular tribal chief
leader of the warriors
countless natives stand behind the chief
a look of anger
covers the chiefs face
indiana gives a hopeful glance to kezure
is this the tribal chief you told me about
points to shrunken head no
that is him
indiana rolls his eyes
the warriors surround everyone
ready to kill
the warriors lead everyone out of the path
several grass huts are scattered throughout this large village
indiana and the others are led into the village
they pass the penetrating unfriendly glares of the villagers
kezure explains to indiana
this is a different tribe
they have taken over the village
what happened to the other tribe
indiana turns to scraggy
you recognize their language
suddenly a voice echoes from inside of the oven
the natives listen
again the voice shouts from inside
the natives recognize the language
they quickly open the oven door
scraggy is screaming in the tribes tongue
the grille is pulled out of the oven
the natives hurriedly untie the slightly smoked indiana kezure and scraggy
scraggy shoots to his feet
he begins to shout at the tribal chief
the chief and the villagers are awestruck by scraggys words
the nervous chief orders clare betsy and the others untied
scraggy whispers to indiana
i tell him we divine messengers of sun wu kung
if he interfere with our mission
jade emperor come down from heavens and destroy his village
scraggy turns and again shouts to the chief
the chief obeys scraggys every word
he leads indy and scraggy to another area of the village
scraggy translates for indiana
i tell him we lose path to city
i ask if he have something to help us
the chief leads indy and scraggy into a large grass hut
empty save for an elaborate marble altar
a dull mirror rests on the altar
the small mirror is surrounded by a crude stone frame
the chief picks up the mirror and gives it to scraggy
the chief explains
scraggy gives the mirror to indiana
translating he say this will help us
and since we are divine messengers
we will know how to use it
he examines the mirror
totally confused by it
the village sleeps
scraggys model t is parked here
several of the crew members and pirates are sleeping in and around the car
kezure is sprawled on the cars roof
it is obvious that they have camped here for the evening
suddenly a slight tremor surges through the village
a soft vibration
cooking utensils rattle
grass huts shake
indiana sleeps here
in a hammock
the vibration wakes indy
as he moves to climb out of the hammock a figure leaps on top of him
indiana attempts to push betsy out of the hammock
they begin to wrestle
the hammock becomes tangled around their bodies
clare walks by the hut
she looks inside
to her it appears that indy and betsy are in the middle of a passionate love scene
she emits a shocked gasp
indiana sees clare
he calls out
but the startled clare hurries away
indiana manages to escape betsy and the tangled hammock
he lands on the floor
the vibrating intensifies
the ground begins to rumble
the surrounding trees shake
the villagers pour out of their huts gathering in the middle of town
indiana and betsy join scraggy clare kezure and the others
betsy is puzzled by the tremors
the tribal chief steps forward
he says one word in his language
scraggy translates for the others
hundreds of the raging animals plow through the jungle
they crush everything in their path
the vibrating is louder
the villagers panic
they run away
scattering into the jungle
indiana and his party are clustered together
we have to get out
or well be crushed to death
scraggy puts his ear to the trembling ground
indy dashes to the model t supply rack
he tosses shovels to each of the group
he looks around
wheres the softest ground
scraggy asks a passing villager
the villager shouts some gibberish and continues running
scraggy points off screen
toward a communal snorting
carving a wide path through the thick jungle
small animals run for their lives
bunnies dash ahead of the herd
monkeys swing to other trees
the angry wildebeest continue ahead
indiana and the others stand in the large graveyard
shovels in hand
they have dug a large hole
pieces of decayed bodies and skeletons protrude from the surrounding hole
scraggy stares at the ghastly sight
he begins to babble
many dead spirits
we must stay away
indy interrupts by pushing scraggy into the open grave
scraggy falls into the arms of a skeleton
bursting through a section of jungle
they arrive on the vast jungle plain
directly ahead of them several feet in the distance is the mongooboo village
the wildebeest head straight for the village
no sign of human life
everything trembles with the force of a major earthquake
the wildebeest arrive
destroying the village
grass huts are flattened
the enormous stone oven collapses
crumbling to pieces
scraggys model t is overturned
with nothing left standing the wildebeest move on
the village has been completely devastated
surrounded with a heavy cloud of dust
camera pans to the graveyard
grave markers and tombstones lie broken and crushed
countless hoofprints cover the flat ground
the dust begins to settle
the graveyard ground suddenly buckles
a hand shoots out
indiana climbs out of the dirt
he is followed by the others who also climb out from underground
everyone is unhurt
protected by the ground above
a skeleton has attached itself to betsy
refusing to let go
scraggy indy and a few of the men run to the overturned model t taxi
they grab hold of the car and turn it back upright
clare looks at the devastated village
betsy stands beside her struggling to escape from the clutches of the skeleton
clare looks into the distance
watching the departing wildebeest
she is troubled
wildebeests will not stampede unless provoked
suddenly the same low rumbling sound from earlier echoes through the area
but this time it is loud
scraggy looks at indy
this time it is very close indy
at that moment directly behind scraggy and indy the jungle erupts
the trees separate
crashing to the ground
making way for some giant behemoth
scraggy and the others leap in one direction
indiana leaps shoots out of the jungle
a metal monstrosity
one of a kind
the tank is over ten times the size of a normal tank
nearly feet long
over feet high
it is equipped with three levels
on the top level is the tanks swivelling gun barrel
the size of a cannon
two giant blazing red swastikas adorn both sides of the tanks second the tank runs over scraggys model t
the car is flattened
a thick cloud of dust erupts from the ground
gutterbuhg is here
he views the outside action through a periscope
two nazi gunners are behind him
waiting for orders to shoot
tyki sits in the background
the confused pygmy is bound and gagged
scraggy clare betsy kezure and the others dash across the plains
running away from the pursuing tank
but indiana is not with them
scraggy unable to see through the dust calls out
indiana is several feet away
on the ground
lost in the thick of dust
suddenly a dark figure appears
towering over indiana
the dust begins to clear
revealing a protruding white horn
more dust clears
we see that the figure is a large black rhinoceros
indy leaps to his feet
the rhino snorts
indy turns to run
the rhino chases him
meanwhile with most of the dust cleared the tank chases indys gutterbuhg looks into the periscope
indys friends are in his sights
gutterbuhg screams to the gunners
german english subtitles fire
the tanks large barrel fires a shot at the running group
the blast flies over their heads
just missing everyone
it blasts a row of palm trees to smithereens
indiana is still running from the rampaging rhino
indy begins to run in a circle
the angry rhino follows him
the circle begins to tighten
until indy is nearly running alongside of the rhino
at the exact moment indy grabs hold of the rhino
he leaps onto the beast
with a bit of careful maneuvering indiana is riding the rhinoceros
scraggy betsy clare kezure and the others continue to run
the tank is right behind them
in hot pursuit
the tank fires another shot
it splatters the ground
beside the group
again just missing everyone
the group turns
running in another direction
the tank follows
indiana continues to ride the wild bucking rhino
he has no control over the beast
the rhino spots something
from this angle the tank with its large protruding gun barrel resembles a giant rhinoceros
seeing this the rhino turns and runs toward the tank
indy holds tightly
scraggy and the others pause
they see the tank behind them
they see the rhino ahead of them
the group makes quick turn
to the right
they run toward a ravine
the tank is headed straight for indy and the rhino
both moving at through the periscope gutterbuhg sees indy and the rhino
continues to ride the uncontrollable rhino
they are within thirty feet of the oncoming tank
gutterbuhg screams in german ordering the nazi gunner to fire
the tank fires
the blast is low
the ground in front of indy and the rhino explodes
a cloud of dust erupts
gutterbuhg looks through the periscope
his view is blocked by dust
the tank is upon indy and the rhino
the rhino screeches to a stop
frightened by the blast
indiana leaps onto the tank
gripping the front section
holding on for dear life
moments before he is crushed beneath the tanks giant treads the rhino turns and runs off
scraggy betsy clare kezure and the others have arrived at the foot of a tall several branched tree
located at the side of the ravine
over the ravines edge is a several hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks
scraggy begins to climb the tree
safest place from bad spirits
is in branches of tree
the others shrug
they have no choice but to follow scraggy up into the branches of the tree
indiana climbs along the side of the monstrous tank
he searches for a passageway inside of the tank
the nazis are unaware of indys presense on the tank
gutterbuhg continues to look through the periscope
the dust begins to clear
he focuses his sights on indys friends
located several feet away
they climb into the tree
indy cannot find a passageway into the tank
he sees the gun barrel
aiming toward the tree filled with indys friends
indy grabs one of the tanks large headlights
he pulls hard
snapping off the headlight
indy leaps upward
he quickly stuffs the headlight inside of the barrel opening
the tree of indys friends are in gutterbuhgs sights
a perfect shot
gutterbuhg screams in german ordering the nazi gunners to shoot
but the barrel backfires
exploding in the face of the two nazi gunners
it sends them flying against the wall
the cabin fills with smoke
only gutterbuhg and tyki remain
a furious gutterbuhg picks up the radio
he screams into the microphone
german english subtitles send help
we need assistance
tyki helplessly watches in the background
gutterbuhg looks into the periscope
he sees indiana
on the tank
gutterbuhg hits a red button
on the control panel
countless rows of machine guns eject from secret slots
all around the tanks first level
the machine guns begin to fire
indiana ducks and dodges the guns
he climbs to the second level
but the large swastikas begin to move
they are actually hidden doors
several nazi soldiers exit the compartments
they come for indiana
he fights the onslaught of soldiers
the tank without a driver begins to wildly spin
going in circles
from the tree scraggy sees indys dillemma
he shouts to the others
indy in trouble
we must help
scraggy begins to climb out of the tree
a gun suddenly moves into frame
pointed at scraggys head
one of his crew members holds the gun
german accent dont move
to the others all of you
stay where you are
scraggy and the others freeze
clare makes a realization
she glares at the crew member
it was you
youre the reason the nazis found us
the crew member gives an evil smile
indiana continues to fight the nazis along the second level of the frenzied tank
indy has defeated most of the soldiers
only two nazis remain
they overcome indy
they push him downward
toward the tanks first level
toward the rows of firing machine guns
indiana struggles to break free
but the powerful nazis push him closer
to the machine guns
in the tree the crew member keeps his pistol aimed at scraggys head
camera pans upward
kezure is perched on the top branch
at the right moment kezure leaps down
on top of the treacherous crew member
kezure knocks the gun from the crew members hand
the gun goes off
a stray bullet strikes the tree trunk
kezure punches the crew member who loses his balance and falls from the tree
going over the edge of the ravine
his body drops hundreds of feet
crashing to the rocks below
but the tree suddenly creaks
a crack has formed around the trunk where the bullet struck
the tree begins to tilt
slowly teetering over the ravines edge
or well go over
scared to death
they tightly grip their branches
the tree sways
indiana still fights the two nazis
struggling to keep his body from the tanks deadly machine guns
indy flips one of the nazis over his head
the nazi falls directly in front of an entire row of machine guns
his body does a grotesque dance of death
riddled with bullets
indiana and the other nazi exchange punches
their bodies tumble over the rear of the tank
they fall onto a small ledge
above the enormous rotating tank treads
indy and the nazi battle to push the other off the ledge
he pushes the nazi on top of the giant treads
the nazi tries to climb back
but his body is indiana turns seeing gutterbuhg climb out of a secret hatch
on the tanks top level
gutterbuhg points his finger at indy
it rapidly fires bullets
indy dodges around the side of the tank
bullets bounce off the metal beside him
meanwhile indys friends sit breathlessly on the swaying tree
everyone is silent
kezure suddenly sneezes
the tree creaks
it wavers over the ravines edge
nearly going over
but it doesnt
everyone catches their breath
the tree continues to teeter
gutterbuhg pursues indiana
playing cat and mouse along the top level of the tank
indiana peers around a corner
seeing gutterbuhg ahead
indy grabs hold of the large rotating gun barrel
indy lifts his feet
he swings forwafd
riding the gun barrel
he spins around the tanks side and comes up behind the unsuspecting gutterbuhg
indy jumps the nazi
they begin to fight
gutterbuhg tries to move his mechanical arm into position
to shoot indy
the tank continues to lose control
it no longer spins in circles
it is headed straight toward the tree filled with indys friends
tyki sits inside
watching through the periscope
gutterbuhg and indiana continue to fight
suddenly there is a buzzing sound
an airplane engine
indiana looks to the sky
a nazi biplane flies toward him
the biplane dives
gutterbuhg rolls out of the way
indy is trapped
a sitting duck
the biplane swoops down
trying to hit indy
he dives onto the tank top
the plane flies directly over indy
just missing him by a few meanwhile the tank still drives directly toward the swaying tree and ravine
scraggy betsy clare kezure and the others remain frozen
watching the tank come for them
they are frightened
indy and gutterbuhg have resumed their fighting
standing on the tanks top
the biplane loops in the air
coming back for another shot
gutterbuhg leaps out of its path
the plane heads straight for indy
he again dives to the tanks top
the biplane swoops down
this time aiming lower
as it passes indy its wheels graze his back
indy the tank continues to speed towd the tree of trapped people
getting his back aching indy struggles to keep gutterbuhgs machine gun arm from shooting him
the biplane does another midair loop
it turns and heads straight for indy
this time the plane wont miss
as the biplane gets close
indy grabs a tight hold of gutterbuhgs mechanical arm
indy raises the arm
aiming at the biplane
indy pulls the arms trigger
firing a round of shots
the rapid bullets strike the planes belly
the biplane loses control
its engine coughs
the biplane spins
flipping into a nosedive
leaving a trail of black smoke
the biplane hits the ground
a flaming crash
several feet from the tank
indiana overpowers gutterbuhg
with two hard punches indy floors the nazi
gutterbuhg lies sprawled on the tanks top
he sees that the speeding tank is going to crash into the treefull of his friends
indiana leaps into the open tank compartment
indiana takes the controls
but they are completely alien to him
he hears a squeal
tyki motions to a specific control
indy grabs hold of it
the tank screeches
spinning to a stop
inches from the swaying tree
scraggy clare betsy kezure and the others emit a unified sigh of relief
but the tree suddenly cracks
falling over the ravine edge
there is the sudden crack of a whip
the whip wraps itself around the trunk of the tree
indiana holds the opposite end
he pulls with all of his strength
holding the tree in place
he prevents the tree from falling into the ravine
indy shouts to his friends
through gritted jump
everyone begins to leap from the tree
to the ground
indy continues to hold the tree in place
soon everyone is back on the ground
indy retrieves his whip
the tree tilts
falling over the ravine edge
the tree crashes to the rocks below
splintering into a million pieces
on the top level of the tank gutterbuhg stirs
but indiana is upon him
using a rope indy ties up gutterbuhg
he removes the ammo cartridge from the nazis mechanical arm
emptying the bullets onto the ground
indiana pushes gutterbuhg inside the tank
tyki crawls out of the tank
he sees clare
tears of happiness fill his eyes
he runs to clare
the two exchange a warm embrace
tyki sees scraggy
they shake hands and begin an excited conversation
like two indy grabs the radio microphone
he holds it in front of gutterbuhg
call your mommy
he speaks german into the microphone
the voice of lieut
echoing over the speakers
indy grabs the microphone
this is jones
ive got your tank
pause its all over pal
he is angry
but he forces himself to calmly address indiana
you surprise me
for a supposedly intelligent man
you jump to childish conclusions
you are driving our tank
we can follow you anywhere
vehement you are far from defeating us my friend
the battle has only just begun
camera pulls back
mephisto is standing beside a long row of tents
housing many troops
several jeeps are parked in the background
all mounted with recoilest cannons
canvas trucks are also here
filled with more troops cannons and ammunition
the nazis have assembled an drops the microphone
he hurries out of the tank
gutterbuhg stays behind
indiana hurries to tyki and the others
indy shoots an impatient glance to scraggy
weve got to move
points to tyki ask him if he knows the way to the city from here
scraggy asks tyki
the pygmy answers pointing off screen
scraggy translates for indiana
he do not know exact place
but it is somewhere over there
indy turns to the direction where scraggy points
several miles away we see countless rows of mountains
thick layers of clouds surround the mountains
a lotta good that does us
it could take us months
to search everyone of those
betsy has an idea
she removes the stone mirror from indianas pocket
maybe he knows what to do with this
betsy gives the mirror to tyki
his eyes widen
tyki recognizes the mirror
he excitedly explains to scraggy who translates for indiana
it is magical mirror of sun wu kung
but whattayou do with it
scraggy asks tyki
the energetic pygmy places the mirror against an upright stone
tyki adjusts the mirror until it faces the distant mountains
tyki emits a high pitched giggle
pointing to the mirror
everyone gathers around the mirror
the sound track music soars
the mirror reflects the clouds above the mountains
but above one specific mountain we see the image of a city reflected on the clouds
indiana turns away from the mirror looking at the specific moontain
but the city is only reflected in the magical mirror
clare smiles at indy quoting tyki from earlier
i come from land of city on clouds
he looks back to the magical travelling a narrow path
along the side of a steep mountain
the tank moves upward
toward the mountain top
the tank jerks
its as if the driver were having trouble with the controls
unfamiliar with the controls
the tank is crowded with everyone
betsy and clare sit beside indy
gutterbuhg is directly behind him
kezure teaches a game to scraggy
tyki the pirates and the various crew members watch
the game appears to be a bizarre version of chess
only the tokens are dried insects and lizards
this is called taskipi
only the bravest play
upon hearing this scraggy is even more excited to play
the game indiana is becoming extremely frustrated by the tank controls
betsy gives a serious look to him
ive been talking to dr
clarke about our problem
struggling with tank problem
whatre you two doin talkin behind my back
betsy needed help
since when did you become the female sigmund freud
since i received a masters degree in psychology
indy rolls his eyes
meanwhile kezure has taken all of scraggys tokens
hes obviously won the game
a carefree scraggy throws up his hands
we play again
pause serious the game is not yet over my friend
you have lost
you must pay
going through pockets i dont have money
deadly smile rules of the game declare that i may choose a souvenir
removes a knife a part of your body
any part i wish
rubbing his jaw
meanwhile betsy explains to indians
clarke says that youre not really in love with me
youre just trying to prove that you can still attract younger women
youre terrified of getting old
thats what i told her
i told her that you really did love me
worried you mean
she was right
i mean yes
indy turns seeing clare glaring at him
he gives betsy a tender honest look
i dont love you
tears fill her eyes thats the first time you ever said it
betsy begins crying
into clares arms
indiana shakes his head
clare comforts betsy
hes a very disturbed man
face to face with a grinning and nodding gutterbuhg
kezure has made his decision
kezure raises his knife
toward scraggys face
they are a striking deep blue
scraggy covers his face
kezure attacks him
trying to cut out scraggys eyes
a fight begins
the crew members vs
indiana turns away from the controls
he breaks up the fight
were in this together
if we start fighting among ourselves
well never get out alive
the men calm down
catching their breath
kezure puts away his knife
he glares at scraggy
you owe me old man
the tank without a driver begins to swerve off the mountain road
clare notices the tank going over the mountain
leaping back to the controls
he hurriedly steers the tank back onto the mountain path
saving it at the last moment
everyone catches their breath
indiana steps on the gas continuing ahead
the tank has nearly made it to the top of the mountain
trekking through a narrow rocky ravine
the tank rolls to a stop
the top hatch flips open
indiana scraggy and tyki pop out
tyki suddenly points to the mountain top which is cloaked in thick layers of clouds
tykis eyes fill with joyous tears
he begins to shout
his voice squeals with excitement
scraggy translates for indy
he say that two miles ahead
we will find his home
excited by the prospects
touched by tykis reaction
indy looks to the foot of the mountain
several miles below
they are still at least two hours from reaching indiana and the others
the massive army moves fast
they begin to drive along the mountain path
in hot pursuit
he looks at the surrounding rocky walls then to the tanks enormous gun barrel
he hurries back inside of the tank
scraggy and tyki follow
closing the hatch above them
indy looks at the tanks control panel
he looks at gutterbuhg
how do i work the big gun
he refuses to answer
indy has no time for games
he looks at kezure
want your souvenir
grabs gutterbuhgs left arm start with his good arm
kezure smiles and removes his long knife
he moves it gutterbuhgs neck
the snivelling nazi cries out
w w wait
indy nods to kezure
the pirate king moves his knife
gutterbuhg hurriedly points to two switches on the control panel
that is what you want
he turns to the switches
close up the tanks large gun barrel swivels
to the rocks above
the gun fires a shot
it swivels a few feet
then fires another
a rumbling sound echoes through the area
indy hits the gas
the tank shoots forward
an avalanche begins
just missing the tank
several pounds of rocks and debris fall from above
the rocks create a thick wall
blocking the mountain path
the tank continues along the twisting narrow mountain path
moving further and further upward
the tank disappears into the thick clouds that surround the mountain
indiana looks through the persiscope
his view blinded by the clouds
the tank is a large grey blur through the clouds
several dark bulking figures appear
they climb along the ravine sides and tops
the mysterious figures surround the tank
all are holding enormous boulders over their heads
aimed at the tank
indy eases up on the gas
the tank slows
suddenly there is a loud crash
the tank is hit
everyone is tossed
save for indy who stays at the controls
he continues to guide the tank forward
there is another crash
the dark figures shower the tank with heavy boulders
the tanks gun barrel snaps in two
its body becomes dented
indiana is tough
he continues to move the jolting tank forward
as the surrounding walls cave in
the injured wobbling tank moves out of the clouds
arriving around the corner from the mountain top
the countless dark figures continue to follow the tank
scurrying along the ravine sides and tops
the figures emerge from the clouds
for the first time they are visible
and we see that the figures are tall
they continue to assault the tank with boulders
indiana still attempts to move the tank forward
but the engine begins to cough
the tank comes to a sudden stop
one of the gorillas emits a bigs pitched shriek
communicating with the others
the others pause
they stop the attack
the gorillas approach the tank
the apes reach out
touching the tanks wrecked body
a few of the apes begin to climb onto the tank
the tanks top hatch flips open
indys head pops out
two hairy arms reach into frame and grab indiana
an enormous gorilla pulls indy out of the hatch
the ape tosses indy off screen
indiana flies into the air
he lands in the arms of another gorilla
the ape takes indys whip and throws him to another gorilla who takes indys hat
the gorilla tosses indy to another ape who tears off indys leather jacket
the helpless indy is thrown to yet another gorilla
the angry ape raises indy over his head
the gorilla prepares to throw indiana off of the mountains edge
tykis voice erupts from off screen
the gorilla pauses suspending indiana high in the air
the gorilla turns to tyki
the pygmy stands on the tank
he shouts an order to the gorilla
the ape nods
he knows tyki
the gorilla gently places indy back on the ground
indiana adjusts what remains of his clothing
he turns seeing a group of gorillas
the gorillas separate
they have dressed one of the apes in indianas hat leather jacket and whip
the ape begins to snap the whip almost as if he were imitating indy
scraggy betsy clare and the others have climbed out of the tank
upon seeing the gorilla dressed as indy they burst into laughter
a very angry indiana growls at tyki
pointing to gorilla tell him to take off my stuff
through laughter scraggy translates for tyki
the pygmy shouts an order to the gorilla
the ape removes the hat and leather jacket reluctantly giving them back to a grumbling indiana
tyki continues to shoot orders to the other gorillas
the pygmy suddenly appears strong
he obviously has power over the beasts
the gorillas gather together
they move toward the people
the apes gently take the hands of the various humans
it is a warm enchanting sight as the friendly gorillas lead the humans forward
clare using her gorilla motions and sounds communicates with the beasts
the group moves around a twisting corner of the path
toward the mountain top
indiana and the others are met with an awesome sight
his mouth drops open
clare is equally astounded
betsy and the others stare ahead
in total wonderment
even gutterbuhg is amazed
the sound lies ahead of the group
a spectacular sight
a city whose every building and tower is cast in solid gold
a heavenly place
the city is protected by a deep moat
the fins of several sharks move through the moat waters
a thick stone wall surrounds the city
a large golden drawbridge is built into the wall
passageway into the city
a tremendous tower stretches above the city walls
the guard a pygmy similiar to tyki is posted in the tower
the guard spots tyki approaching the city walls
the guards eyes light
the guard cries out
shouting to everyone inside of the city
he continues to repeat a certain phrase
scraggy translates the guards words for indiana
our prince has returned home
soon the beautiful sound of countless ringing bells is heard welcoming tyki home
eyes watering a proud tyki and the gorillas lead everyone to the foot of the city walls
the enormous drawbridge begins to lower
a stunning shaft of golden light escapes from the opening
as the drawbridge continues to lower the shaft of light becomes wider
it illuminates the faces of indy and the others
when the drawbridge is completely lowered everyone is led into the city
their bodies silhouetted against the warm glowing light
we enter with indy and the others
the city is bursting with the bright colors of various vegetable and fruit gardens and various other exotic plant life
luscious green grass and crystal clear lakes surround many of the homes
the earthen streets are literally paved with gold
the men and women of the city are members of tykis race
there is a peaceful joyous quality about them
they rush toward tyki
showering him with kisses
welcoming him home
indiana and the others are in awe of this new world
gutterbuhg walks with them
camera pans to his hands
he struggles to untie his bindings
kezure spots something
a small solid gold garden tool
lying in a vegetable garden
kezures eyes fill with greed
he moves to steal the can
kezure grabs the tool and begins to hide it
beneath his cloak
a large gorillas hand grabs kezures arm
towering over the pirate king the gorilla waves his finger at kezure
the nervous kezure nods
he places the garden tool back on the ground
meanwhile indy and the others are led to an elaborate palace
they ascend the several golden stairs toward the entrance
the palace doors open
an older man steps outside
he is bohbala
the citys ruler
a few palace guards stand beside him
bohbala raises his arms over the crowd
pygmies and gorillas drop to their knees
tyki runs to bohbala
tears of joy fill their eyes
bohbala wipes away his tears
he gives a warm smile to indiana and the others
in a wise voice
scraggy translates for the others
he thank us
for returning his son
indiana and the others smile
betsy whipsers to indy
if the little guys pushin years
how olds his father
indy motions for betsy to shhh
bohbala continues to speak
scraggy his name bohbala
he is ruler of city faithful servant of his lord and master
sun wu kung
pause smile he welcome us to stay
as long as we wish
indiana exchanges a hopeful glance with clare
as bohbala continues to speak camera pans to gutterbuhg
the nazi has successfully untied his bindings
while the others listen to bohbala gutterbuhg removes one spare bullet from his mouth
he slyly inserts the bullet into his mechanical arm
indiana is too concerned with bohbala to notice gutterbuhg
anxious to scraggy ask him where we may find the burial place
or the remains
of sun wu kung
scraggy turns to ask bohbala
but his question is interrupted by gutterbuhgs mechanical arm
it extends into frame
its finger pointed at indiana
but the bizarre sight greatly amuses bohbala
he begins to laugh
he reaches out and pushes gutterbuhgs finger away
but the machine gun goes off
bohbala is hit
in the chest
tyki kneels cradling bohbalas head in his arms
tyki calls his fathers name
it is futile
bohbala is dead
the crowd of villagers stare
they are unaccustomed to indiana clutches gutterbuhg by the throat
indiana pulls back his fist to punch the nazi
but indy is stopped by the palace guards
they move their swords to his throat
indy is suddenly puzzled
the villagers fall to their knees
bowing to gutterbuhg
a distraught tyki hurriedly explains to scraggy who translates for indy
it is written
if ruler is defeated by greater power
he who possess that power
points to gutterbuhg shall become ruler
gutterbuhgs eyes fill with a sadistic thrill
he raises his mechanical arm
in a heil hitler pose
the entire city imitates the nazi
raising their right arms
hailing their new leader
indiana is horrified by the scene
tyki is upset
he knows that gutterbuhg is truly evil
but none of the villagers listen
indiana looks to his shocked friends
this is turning into one helluva nightmare
hears smiles at indy one you will never awaken from doctor jones
indy glares at gutterbuhg
clare and betsy exchange a frightened glance
a beautiful expansive chamber filled with tapestries and artwork
gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate golden throne
he has donned a ghoulish new outfit
the robes of bohbala the dead ruler
gutterbuhg is being attended upon by several villagers who bring him countless plates of food
he is surrounded by several women who patiently wait for his orders
gutterbuhg gobbles down the variety of food and wine
scraggy kneels before the nazi
gutterbuhg uses indianas whip as a leash
it is tied around scraggys neck and held by the nazi
gutterbuhg pulls the leash
nearly strangling scraggy
his mouth filled with food gutterbuhg screams at scraggy
i want to see jones
scraggy translates for the guards
surrounded with moss covered stone walls
located beneath the palace
indy and the others are locked inside
everyone is silent
clare consoles a tearful despondent tyki
the dungeon gate opens
the two guards enter
they drag indiana out of the dungeon
betsy calls out to indy
trying to follow
but the guards slam the wooden door in betsys face
she peers through the small indiana is led into the rulers chamber
indy sees scraggy tied to a leash
an angry vengeful look covers indys face
he turns to gutterbuhg
the nazi still stuffing his face with food pulls tightly on scraggys leash
your friend makes a wonderful interpreter
indys eyes burn
gutterbuhg gulps down a glass of wine
liquid spittles from the sides of his mouth
he looks at indy
the nazi party will exist for one thousand years
and i wish to be alive for every year
pause that is a favorite philosophy of our feuher
your feuhers philosphies belong on a bathroom wall
angry slapping indy across the face this is a very serious matter doctor jones
it could save your life
pause i understand that somewhere in this city
there is a garden of
indy doesnt respond gutterbuhg continues i want information about this garden
and i would greatly appreciate it if you would share everything you know with me
i dont share anything with nazis
he takes another bite of food shooting a glowering look to indiana
my friends will be here soon
they will rest
enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom
kisses a woman and pushes her away then we shall exterminate these worthless people
destroy their city
and we will carry away all of its riches
gutterbuhg goes back to his food
scraggy exchanges a worried glance with indiana
travelling along the narrow mountain path
they are more than halfway up the mountain
mephisto rides in the front jeep
he looks to his driver who reports to mephisto
german english subtitles sir
we shall reach the mountain top in less than sixty minutes
an enormous stone arena
located in the center of the city
it resembles the roman coliseum in size and structure
the coliseums top walls are surrounded by countless large metal bells
the bells are ringing
they are the same bells we heard earlier
but they now sound eerie
the many seats are filled with members of the village
all gathered for a special event
gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate rulers box
it is covered with a protective golden grating
the box is located directly above the earthen playing field
indys whip is still tied around scraggys neck who kneels at gutterbuhgs feet
two guards lead a shirtless indiana jones onto the playing field
they bring indy to a steel cage located directly below gutterbuhgs box
inside of the cage are two enormous buffalo
betsy clare tyki kezure the remaining pirates and crew members all helplessly watch from inside of a large metal cage
the cage is suspended in the air
dangling over a deep pit
it is filled with indy is led into the cage
between the two buffalo
the guards grabs hold of indiana
they tie one of his arms and one of his legs to each sidw of the buffalo
preparing to draw and quarter indiana
a delighted gutterbuhg peers down at indiana
those beasts are anxious to run wild
vicious smile how long will you be able to ride
before they tear you in two
indy looks at scraggy who is very frightened
goodbye doctor jones
gutterbuhg turns to the guards
ready to give them the order
to open the cage and set the buffalo free
indy suddenly screams
upon hearing the words gutterbuhg stands
like a robot
he raises his mechanical arm in a heil hitler pose
the fingers of gutterbuhgs mechanical arm get caught in the metal grating above his head
gutterbuhg tries to remove his fingers
his mechanical arm is ripped from its socket
it dangles from the grating
the crowd watches
scraggy thinks fast
he leaps to his feet and grabs the arm
he tears it out of the grating
scraggy holds the arm above his head
now it is he who possesses the power
the crowd cheers scraggy
their new ruler
gutterbuhg steps back
scraggy orders the guards to free indiana
the guards hurriedly untie indy from the buffalo
running out of the coliseum
scraggy screams to the people motioning for them to follow gutterbuhg
several people leap from their seats
chasing the nazi
gutterbuhg dashes out
a crowd of villagers follow him
in hot pursuit
gutterbuhg runs toward the city gates
he runs through
escaping the city
the crowd pauses
theyll go no further
they scream and shout at the departing gutterbuhg who disappears into indiana rejoins his friends on the playing field
they have been freed from the cage
scraggy gives the whip to indy
indy is impatient
he looks at everyone
nazisll be be here soon
we gotta move fast
scraggy gives gutterbuhgs mecahnical arm to tyki
the pygmy nods
tyki raises the arm toward the people
they cheer tyki their rightful ruler
tyki pulls back and throws the mechanical arm
high into the air
it soars several feet
flying over the coliseum walls
the arm flies through the air
it lands into the moat
the arm is attacked by a horde of hungry sharks
they tear it to pieces
the nazis have arrived at the section of path that is blocked by the avalanche
their other vehicles and troops have pulled back
a few hundred feet from the avalanche
several sticks of dynamite have been placed beneath the avalanche
is connected to a long fuse that extends along the path
mephisto stands at the fuses end
he strikes a match
preparing to light the fuse
the match flare is inches from the fuse
mephisto is interrupted by a familiar voice
it is gutterbuhg
mephisto blows out the match
a soaking wet sgt
gutterbuhg slides down the edge of the ravine
he still wears the colorful elaborate robes of bohbala
mephisto is puzzled by gutterbuhgs bizarre appearance
gutterbuhg stops in front of mephisto
gutterbuhg attempts a heil hitler
but suddenly realizes that his mechanical arm is gone
gutterbuhg drips water all over mephisto who is disgusted by the appearance of his officer
he slaps gutterbuhg
german english subtitles idiot
why are you dressed like that
where is your uniform
before he can answer gutterbuhg is shoved away by the disgusted mephisto who attempts to light the fuse
but his matches are useless
soaked with water
furious mephisto slaps gutterbuhg ordering him to fetch something
the snivelling gutterbuhg nods and bows scurrying away
he runs into the rear of a canvas truck
filled with several crates of dynamite and supplies
gutterbuhg dashes inside
toward a silver metallic briefcase that rests in the rear of the truck
gutterbuhgs greasy fingers open the briefcase
inside encased in black velvet are two rectangular compartments
one of the compartments is empty
the other houses another mechanical arm
gutterbuhg quickly attaches the arm to the stub of his shoulder and gutterbuhg rejoins mephisto and extends his new mechanical arm toward the fuse
gutterbuhg points his finger
he squeezes a lever located on the palm of the mechanical arm
a bright jagged line of electrical current shoots from the arms finger
the electricity lights the fuse
moving toward the dynamite
gutterbuhg and mephisto hide behind a rock
there is a loud explosion
rocks and debris fly through the air
the path is cleared
the sound of the explosion echoes through the city
shaking the city walls
the nazis are close
indiana stands in the city square
he has assembled everyone for the battle
tyki and the pygmies are armed with bows and arrows spears and blow pipes
kezure and the pirates hold their swords
scraggys men carry revolvers and daggers
clare and betsy stand with several gorillas
tyki whispers to scraggy who translates for indiana
they want you to give speech
general always give speech to inspire troops
who the hell do they think i am
but all eyes are on indiana
depending on him
trying to think of something to say
he mumbles to scraggy
the only speeches i remember are from college
when i played ball
indy clears his throat
he looks at everyone
were about to face one of our toughest opponents
theyve got size
and well quite frankly
were the underdogs
indys eyes light
a moment of inspiration
the background music slowly begins to rise
indys voice becomes louder
well if it wasnt for the little guy
where would this country be
excited louder i mean
i knew this little guy once a scrawny runt with thick black glasses and about different kinds of allergies
but this little kid had a dream
he wanted to be on the football team
music rises so does indys voice well all the big guys made his life miserable
always shoving his head in the drinking fountain
putting mustard in his pants
throwing me er him
throwing him in the shower with all his clothes on
louder heartfelt but that little guy didnt quit
be worked hard
never gave up
and in two years
he was the quarterback
star of the team
and you know why
music soars as does indys voice cause that little kid had somethin that those big guys never heard of
he had heart
and nothin can stop that
we hear the nazis approaching indy screams now lets go out there and show em everyone breaks into a loud cheer
ready to fight
the sound track music soars
indiana raises his sword
he turns and runs toward the drawbridge
the people follow as indy leads them into battle
indiana armed with a shield sword and pistol leads his troops forward
the nazis are approaching
mephisto rides in the front jeep which is mounted with a large recoilist machine gun
the entire nazi army is behind him
mephistos jeep begins to cross the drawbridge
moving toward indiana and the others
the recoilist machine gunner opens fire on indy and the troops
bullets bounce from indys shield
several of the pygmies are hit
falling to the drawbridge
an angry pygmy throws his spear
it hits the machine gunner
through the heart
the jeep continues to drive forward
headed straight for indiana who leaps onto the jeeps hood
indys troops split into groups
dashing around the speeding jeep to battle the oncoming nazis
indiana crawls along the jeep hood
toward the nazis
mephisto attempts to shoot indy
the bullets zip through the windshield
whizzing by indys head
indiana grabs mephisto
he pulls the nazi over the windshield
indiana and mephisto tumble along the jeeps hood
struggling for the gun
the jeep directly behind mephisto is filled with several crates of dynamite
gutterbuhg back in uniform rides here with three nazi soldiers
as the pygmy troops come forward gutterbuhg extends his mechanical arm
he zaps several of the pygmies
killing them with deadly jolts of electricity
as the jeep passes through the city gates indiana and mephisto continue to battle along the hood
mephisto attempts to shoot indiana
but indy pushes away the nazis arm
the gun fires
hitting the jeep driver who slumps over the wheel
the speeding jeep spins out of control
sending indiana and mephisto flying through the air
they tumble to the ground
the jeep crashes into a wall
a shaken indiana gets to his feet
mephisto lies a few feet away
suddenly a blast of electricity bursts into frame
sparking the ground beside indiana
indy turns and sees gutterbubg
the nazis jeep has entered the city
gutterbuhg points his mechanical arm toward indy
another electrical shock ejects from his finger
the shock tears a smoldering hole through the building behind him
only inches above indy
meanwhile the nazis begin to unload the dynamite from gutterbubgs jeep
they unwrap a long section of fuse from a large coil
placing the fuse along the ground
indiana is running for his life
gutterbuhg is directly behind him
in hot pursuit
the nazi continuously fires electrical shots at indiana
the thin lines of electricity whiz by indys head
just missing indy
a cat and mouse chase begins as gutterbuhg pursues indiana throughout the city
they have climbed to the top of the city walls
from here they guard and defend their city
crowds of nazi troops are on foot
running toward the city walls
the pygmies shower the nazis with arrows spears and poisinous darts
the nazis fight back with machine guns and they stand at the city gate
protecting the city entrance
they hurriedly load a large wooden catapult with a huge ball of hay
a crew member torches the hay
it bursts into flame
scraggy cries fire
his men launch the fireball
it sails over the city walls
lands directly onto a speeding nazi jeep
the nazis and jeep catch fire
the vehicle loses control
the flaming jeep crashes into the side of a mountain wall
rolls toward the city
its gun barrel aimed at the city walls
camera mountain top above the path
clare is here
a group of gorillas are beside her
the apes each have a tight hold of individual sections of hanging vine
they stand at the edge of the ravine
clare looks to the opposite ravine
betsy is here
she stands with another group of gorillas who also securely bold lengths of vine
on the mountain path the nazi tank passes directly beneath betsy and clare
the two women turn to the gorillas
emitting gorilla grunts moans and motions betsy and clare communicate with the apes
the gorillas listen
when the tank is directly below
betsy and clare order the gorillas to jump
the apes swing from the mountain
riding the vines
toward the tank
the gorillas land on the tank
they climb aboard
exploring the tanks surface
filled with nazis
the gunner looks into the periscope
he is met with the reflection of a snarling gorillas face
he screams and jumps there is a sound of ripping metal
suddenly the tanks top hatch is torn open
countless gorillas pour inside
the apes attack
overpowering the nazis
as the gorillas climb inside of the tank betsy swings across the passageway to clare
she exchanges a congratulatory handshake with clare
betsys face suddenly goes white
a shocking sight
a group of nazis have climbed to the mountain top
the soldiers spot clare and betsy
they run toward the women
betsy and clare dash off
into the thick of the jungle
the nazis follow
in hot pursuit
barrelling along the mountain path
kezure the pirate king leaps from the side of the path between the two trucks
kezure climbs onto the rear bumper of the first truck
the driver of the second truck spots kezure
he begins to fire shots at the pirate king
as bullets whiz by him kezure hurriedly removes a thick metal chain from around his neck
he securely connects the two truck bumpers with the chain
filled with nazi troops
waiting to fight
there is a sudden ripping sound
followed by another
the nazis are startled to see the blades of countless swords
piercing the canvas
through all sides of the truck
several pirates leap through the canvas
attacking the nazis
the nazis fight back with bayonets and daggers
two pirates burst into the cabin
they stab the nazi driver
the cackling pirates take control of the steering wheel
they madly steer the truck toward the steep edge of the mountain path
plummets over the eage
the second truck attached by the metal chain follows the first truck
the two canvas trucks fall into the moat
splashing into the shark infestea waters
the nazis have planted an enormous pile of dynamite on the palace stairs
enough to destroy the entire city
is attached to a long fuse that stretches hundreds of feet over various sections of the city
the nazis light the fuse end
the nazis turn and run
gutterbuhg continues to chase indiana
blasts of electricity shoot from the nazis arm
avoiding the electrical jolts
indy spins around a building corner
he spots the burning fuse
it stretches along the ground moving up over a wooden fence
indy dives and stomps out the fuse
but gutterbuhg who is directly behind indy relights the fuse with a shot of electricity
before indy has a chance to stop the fuse
gutterbuhg aims at indy
indy leaps over the fence
the fence is splintered by the powerful electrical blast
indiana runs into a small alleyway
the burning fuse stretches up along the alley wall moving to the rooftop
indy begins to climb the ancient golden bricks that protrude from the wall
toward the roof
he shoots at indiana who avoids the blast by leaping onto the roof
gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to climb the wall
gutterbuhg arrives at the top
he looks around
there is no sign of indy
but the fuse rests at the roofs edge
gutterbuhg restarts the fuse
at that moment indiana leaps out from inside of the stone smokestack
he jumps the unsuspecting gutterbuhg
they tumble and fall off the rooftop edge
indiana and gutterbuhg hit the ground
they continue to struggle
as the fuse burns in front of them
it speeds toward the pile of dynamite
less than fifty feet ahead
still wrestling with gutterbuhg indy rolls toward the fuse
indy reaches out and stops the fuse with his hand
but gutterbuhg moves fast
again the nazi relights the fuse
indy suddenly leaps to his feet
he runs off screen
the fuse continues to burn
to the dynamite
indiana runs to a cluster of trees
he comes to an abrupt stop between two trees
gutterbuhg is upon him
the nazi pauses
only a few feet from indy
gutterbuhg points his arm at indy
a clear shot
indiana is trapped
the fuse is now only a few feet from the dynamite
it will blow at any second
moving like lightning indy leaps out of the way revealing a large lake behind him
its too late for gutterbubg
the electrical current hits the water
the nazis body surges with electricity
frozen as the powerful electrical current flows through his veins
smoke billows from his body
his mechanical arm suddenly explodes
gutterbuhgs charred body falls
indiana leaps to his feet
it is now inches from the t
indy cant get to it in time
he grabs his whip
his arm snaps forward
the whip cracks
it slices the remaining fuse in two
the fuse fizzles and goes out
the city is saved
there is a gunshot
a bullet whizzes by indys head
mephisto bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident stands several feet away
mephistos luger is aimed at indy
prepared to take another shot
indy removes his revolver
he fires at mephisto
the nazi dashes into the coliseum
battling the oncoming nazis with his sword
tyki fights hard
he manages to defeat many nazis
but the sword is suddenly knocked from tykis hand
a troop of nazis come toward him
their eyes murderous
tyki is trapped
scraggy and his crew members load another fireball onto the catapult
scraggy cries fire
the fireball flies over the city walls
it lands directly in front of the nazi troops who are about to attack tyki
many of the soldiers catch fire
the others run from the flames
tyki is unhurt
he rejoins his friends in the battle
they continue to run through the jungle
the nazis are a few feet behind them
the women turn a corner scramble through a section of bushes and find themselves face to face with
another troop of nazis
clare and betsy stop
surrounded by nazis
the soldiers move toward the women
the nazis eyes are lecherous
clare whispers to a trembling betsy
do exactly what i do
the nazis move closer
clare looks to the sky
she begins to make bizarre
a confused betsy makes the same noises
the nazis look at each other and chuckle
the women continue to make the sounds
suddenly the exact sound seems to echo from the sky
it becomes louder
but it belongs to a hundred voices
the nazis pause
there is a splattering of birds
they attack from above
the birds screeching is identical to clare and betsys calls
the angry birds attack the nazis
clare and betsy continue to make the sounds which causes the birds to ignore them
the nazis scream
dropping their weapons
falling to their knees
each soldier is covered with birds
they are being torn to shreds
clare and betsy turn and run
escaping into the jungle
the nazis screaming echoes behind them
as they run clare explains to betsy
i made the sound of a baby swandola bird crying for help
the mother birds immediately reply to the cries angrily protecting their children and murdering the babys attackers
they crookedly float along the shark infested moat waters
the battered bruised trucks now resemble two sinking pirate ships
kezure and the pirates battle the nazis along the truck frames
the pirates fight in their element
with fast swinging swords the pirates are defeating the nazis
several nazis fall into the water and are immediately attacked by countless sharks
at one point kezure falls into the water
several sharks come for him
the pirate king disappears beneath the water surface
a few of his men pause
suddenly kezure leaps out of the water
he holds a live shark in his hands
the crazed kezure takes a bite from the shark
he tosses the fish back into the water
kezure chews ana swallows the raw shark meat
blood spills down his chin
kezure resumes his fighting with the nazis as the two truck frames continue to sink
several nazis are sprawled on the tank floor
camera pans upward
the gorillas have taken control of the tank
they have dressed themselves in nazi uniforms
as the battle rages around them the gorillas tank makes a sudden u turn
it heads straight for the second nazi tank
the nazis stare through their periscope
puzzled by the sight of their own tank coming toward them
the gorillas tank fires a direct shot at the other nazi tank
the nazis tank is blown to smithereens
the gorillas break into a victorious cheer
indiana walks across the coliseum floor
revolver in hand
he moves slowly
he is looking for a sign of mephisto
but everything is silent
mephisto sneaks along the top wall of the coliseum
hiding behind the row of surrounding bells
the nazi unlatches the chain that holds all of the bells in place
the bells begin to fall
thundering down the coliseum stairs
indy covers his ears
the sound of countless clanging bells is nearly deafening
seeing the enormous bells rolling toward him
indiana begins to run
giant rolling bells chase him from all directions
in an effort to avoid being crushed by the heavy bells
mephisto watches from above
indy continues to run
a giant rolling bell chases him from behind
the bell gains speed
a few feet in front of indy
is the deadly tiger pit
but indy cant stop running or hell be crushed by the bell
indiana leaps into the pit
the bell rolls directly over the pit
but indiana is safe
there is a five inch drop from the ground to the pits overhead metal bars
indy lies on the bars
safely above the countless tigers
the bells have all come to a stop
they lie around the coliseum ground
only one bell gently rocks
it slowly teeters on the coliseum stairs
it hasnt yet rolled off
indiana begins to climb out out of the pit when suddenly
another gunshot rings out
indy is hit
in the chest
bis wounded body is sprawled on the bars
ready to fall into the waiting tigers
mephistos luger is smoking
the nazi walks down the coliseum stairs
he moves toward indiana
seeing mephisto heading for him
indiana removes his gun
he aims at the nazi
but indys vision is blurred
his hand trembles
mephistos silhouette nears
but the bullet zips past mephisto and strikes a section of wood below the teetering bell
this causes the bell to fall
and slowly roll forward
mephisto arrives at the edge of the tiger pit
he is about to shoot indy
then comes upon another idea
mephisto lowers the luger
he gives a swift kick to indys ribs
indiana falls through the bars
his arm shoots out
with his last bit of strength indys hand grabs hold of a bar
clutching on for dear life
his body dangles over the tigers
they snap at his legs
he steps on indys fingers
grinding them beneath his boot heel
indy cries out
hes going to fall
he hears something behind him
a clanging bell
he sees the giant bell
coming at him
only inches away
there is no time to move
the bell rolls over mephisto
knocking him into the pit
mephisto falls through the bars
inside the pit
into the middle of the hungry tigers
the tigers are upon him
the nazi is ripped to shreds
within seconds his screams are a memory
a very weak indiana still clutches the bar
he manages to boost himself out of the pit
he takes a few steps
blood pours from the wound in his chest
to his knees
his eyes roll back
he falls to the ground
his body is still
the gorillas still dressed as nazis continue to drive the tank the tank speeds toward the rows of charging nazi troops
the nazis stop
shocked to see their own tank coming at them
but the tank continues to barrel ahead
many of the nazis are crushed beneath the heavy tank treads
others drop their weapons and run
the gorillas are ecstatic
they have defeated all of the nazis
one of the canvas trucks has completely sunk
only a small section of the other truck juts out of the water
the pirates cling to the fleeting safety of the sinking truck frame which is surrounded by several hungry sharks
there are even too many maneaters for the powerful kezure to handle
as the frame continues to sink
the pirates feet get closer
to the snapping sharks
suddenly a rope drops from overhead
kezure looks up
scraggy and his crew members stand on the drawbridge
they have dropped the line
kezure and the pirates climb upward
on the drawbridge scraggy assists kezure
scraggy smiles repeating kezures earlier threat
you owe me old man
he embraces scraggy
they are joined by tyki and the other pygmies
a sudden calm
a sudden silence
overcomes the city
the battle has ended
the nazis have been defeated
the city is saved
but tyki is solemn
he stares off screen
camera pans to his p
we see the countless bodies of pygmies
sprawled on the ground
the price you pay for freedom
suddenly the silence is interrupted
someone is crying
it is betsy
scraggy looks off screen to the direction of the sounds
the color leaves his face
a group of pygmies carry the limp body of indiana jones out of the coliseum
they gently lower indys body to the ground
clare and betsy kneel beside indy
tears run down betsys face
scraggy suddenly breaks away from the crowd
camera dollies with him as he runs toward indy
scraggy stops at indys body
clare eyes filled with tears nods to scraggy
she can barely utter the words
tears erupt in scraggys eyes
he breaks down crying
a startled kezure joins the others
camera pulls back to an extremely long shot
the entire village gathers around indianas body
everyone is solemn
it is lying in state
resting on a bamboo stretcher
it is covered with exotic colorful flowers
camera pulls back
indy is being carried by several elaborately dressed pygmies
at the head of a long funeral procession
betsy clare scraggy and kezure march beside indys body
they also wear the ceremonial funeral flowers
behind them the body of bohbala is being carried
and behind the ruler the bodies of all dead pygmies are being carried by the remaining villagers and gorillas
it is nightime
all mourners are carrying flickering candles
at the rear of the procession a lone pygmy strums an unusual string instrument
this creates a haunting melody
camera pulls back to a long shot as we see the procession move through the city
the hundreds of flickering candles against the dark night sky create a beautiful image
the procession arrives at a large stone wall
it appears to be a dead end
tyki walks to the wall
he falls to his knees and begins to chant
clare betsy scraggy and kezure watch
there is a small rumble
a hairline crack begins to form in the mountain
as if it were being drawn by an invisible hand the crack forms a large door in the wall
the door slowly opens
an almost blinding whlte light emanates from inside
the procession the procession ascends a twisting stone staircase that spirals upward where the light becomes brighter
at the stairway top there is another doorway
tyki and the others enter
indianas body is carried through
a breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green trees filled with succulent ripe peaches
we have never seen colors like this
bright sunlight shines from a vivid blue sky
there is always a rainbow here
the procession enters
scraggy clare betsy and kezure stare in total wonderment
betsy is puzzled by the bright sunlight
its the middle of the night
tyki whispers to scraggy who explains to betsy
sun always shine in the garden of immortal peaches
kezure is mesmerized by the peach trees
his mouth hangs open
he turns to scraggy
these are the peaches that make one forever young
tyki leads the procession to a clearing in the garden
many freshly dug graves are here
all of the bodies are carried to separate graves including indiana and bohbala
a few feet ahead of the graves rests the largest peach tree in the forest
it is much wider and taller than the others
there is a small glass encased tomb built into the tree
inside of the tomb is a tiny skeleton
no more than four feet tall
the skeleton is adorned with a lion skinned robe and golden crown
in its hand the skeleton clutches the famous golden hooped rod a glorious elaborate staff
an ancient inscription is etched in stone over the tomb
pointing to the inscription clare turns to scraggy
what does it say
translating our lord
kung the sound track music rises
it is the tomb of the stone monkey king
clare exchanges an awe inspired glance with betsy then looks to the still body of indiana
damn you jones
why couldnt you be here to share this with me
the pygmies begin to lower the dead bodies including indiana and bohbala into the ground
tyki reads from ancient scripture
scraggy sobs on the shoulder of kezure who continues to stare in astonishment at the peach trees
suddenly there is a rumbling sound
followed by a slight tremor
the trees begin to sway as a howling wind rushes through them
the tomb of sun wu kung glows with a bright light
the glass surrounding the tomb suddenly shatters
the skeletons head turns
its body rattles
beginning to move
the skeleton steps out of the tomb
everyone stares in awe
the skeleton takes a few steps forward stops and raises its arms
high in the air
the skeleton opens its mouth
emitting a high pitched unearthly
an ectoplasmic green smoke seeps from the skeletons fingers slowly traveling over the heads of the humans
the ectoplasm separates into several individual lines that touch down upon each of the gorillas
the ectoplasm encircles each the gorillas bodies
the gorillas begin to rise from the ground
high in the air
the ectoplasm appears to be carrying them toward sun wu kung
as the gorillas travel through the air their bodies begin to shrink
growing the humans stare into the sky
watching the amazing magical as the gorillas get closer to sun wu kung their bodies have shrunken to tiny hair like substances
when the gorillas arrive at the skeleton they attach themselves to his body
we see that the shrunken gorillas are actually individual hairs on the skeletons body
as the countless hairs converge the skeleton begins to take shape
sun wu kung comes to life
he is unlike anyone or anything we have ever seen
his face is covered with wrinkles
his wide eyes are coal black
when he smiles it is devilish but incredibly charming
his movements are perky
an extremely adorable little fellow
but there is a strong powerful presense about him
he is indeed a heavenly figure
sun wu kung looks over the congregation
everyone falls to their knees
clare betsy scraggy and a reluctant kezure do the same
sun wu kung paces through the clearing
he looks into the many graves
he is distressed
his wrinkled face twists into furious expression
he raises his golden hooped rod to the sky
his old voice creaks and groans
we cannot bury these men
this is a garden of life
not of death
betsy whispers to clare
whys he speakin in english
he is a heavenly being
according to legend when a heavenly being speaks men of all countries can understand him
we hear him in english
the pygmies hear him in their language
sun wu kung continues his heartfelt scream into the heavens
return their souls
i demand it
return their souls
a few moments pass
a thick white cloud eclipses the sun
a small hole in the cloud allows one ray of sunlight to shine through
the ray shines down upon one particular peach tree
sun wu kung turns to that peach tree
he raises the golden hooped rod toward the tree
he begins to sing an unusual hymn
suddenly several peaches magically fly from the trees
they congregate above the golden hooped rod
the peaches spin in midair
with quick movements of the rod sun wu kung sends several peaches flying off screen
camera follows the magical peaches as they separate and fly into each grave
toward the bodies of the dead pygmies
each body is hit with an individual peach
when the peaches make contact with the dead bodies there is a small colorful explosion
a small fireworks display
the bodies erupt with a bright golden glow
a few moments pass
one of the bodies stirs
the body sits up
gets to its feet
another body does the same
so does another
soon the various pygmies climb out of the graves
their wounds have disappeared
their life has been restored
sun wu kung flings the remaining two peaches into the graves of indiana and bohbala
there is a small explosion
followed by the warm glow of their bodies
the wound in indys chest vanishes
his eyes pop open
to the delight of his friends indy stands
he is puzzlled by the surrounding grave
clare scraggy and betsy help indiana out of the grave
they shower him with embraces and kisses
but indy remains confused
what the hells goin on
sun wu kung looking very pleased with himself stands behind indiana
clare smiles at indy
i think there is someone you should meet
clare points to behind indy who turns and sees the smiling sun wu kung
indy is at first shocked
his face breaks into a childlike smile
filled with delight
he then manages to utter
sun wu kung
sun wu kung steps forward
he nods and answers
taken aback huh
you know me
nods i have watched you for many many years
from the heavens
i was fascinated by your bravery
in searching for me
thanks im very honored
the honor is mine doctor jones
you and your friends have saved my city from ruin
a pause i would like to return the favor
sun wu kung gives indiana the golden hooped rod
indiana takes the priceless artifact
he stares at the beautiful rod
he is very moved
sun wu kung explains
raises an eyebrow
the golden hooped rod will be a faithful friend
it is capable of one hundred transformations
and will always remain by your side
indy manages a nod
sun wu kung sighs
i will explore the heavens for another
surely my search will be shorter and less hazardous than yours
meanwhile kezure uses the oppurtunity to sneak away
he disappears into a cluster of peach trees
he climbs the smallest tree
the greedy pirate king begins to pick several peaches
hiding them in his pockets
sun wu kung looks over the healthy restored community of pygmies
the monkey king smiles
with my city alive again
i will be able to return to the heavens
warm smile to indy and the others goodbye
my dear friends
sun wu kung again raises his arms
green ecotplasm again emanates from his fingers
the individual strands of hair fly from his body
in a reversal of what we saw only moments ago the strands of hair fly through the air
they grow larger
until they resume the shape of the gorillas
sun wu kung has returned to his skeletal form
he turns and walks back to his resting place
the pieces of broken glass re assemble
sealing the tomb
kezure his pockets stuffed with peaches hurriedly rejoins the others
tyki embraces bohbala glad to have his father alive
bohbala resuming his position as ruler leads his people out of the garden
indiana clutching his golden hooped prize exits with the others
indiana clare betsy scraggy kezure the pirates and crew members have gathered outside of the city walls for the journey home
they are saying goodbye to tyki bohbala and the other pygmies
clare and tyki exchange a tearful farewell communicating in hand signals
they share a final embrace
bohbala again thanks indiana for his help
betsy says goodbye to the many gorillas
betsy communicates in gorilla hand motions and growls
indiana holding the golden hooped rod turns and moves across the drawbridge
the others follow
the entire city of pygmies and gorillas cheer for their departing friends
indy and the others disappear into the clouds walking down the mountain path
the lost city glistens in the background
the drawbridge closes
until the next visitor early afternoon
the sun is hot
indy and his party rest
they nap in a shady section of the path
camera pans the snoozing bodies of everyone coming to a stop at indiana
the golden hooped rod rests beside indy
a hand comes into frame and grabs the staff
other hands move into frame
they steal indys whip and revolver
they take all weapons from scraggy and his crew members
indiana is awakened by a sword
at his throat
indy reaches for his gun and whip
he looks up
kezure stands over him holding the sword in one hand the golden rod in another
the other pirates hold swords and daggers at the throats of clare betsy scraggy and the crew members
kezure twirls the golden hooped rod in front of him
he smiles at indiana
she is a wonderful treasure
we had a deal
moves sword closer to indys throat i have no deals with dead men
son of a bitch
he has removed a peach from his pocket
he shines the peach on his cloak and gives a shrug to indiana
shrugs laughs i am an old pirate doctor jones
do you suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness
it is not my way of life
indy is disgusted
kezure takes a large bite from the peach
as he chews and swallows kezure nods to his men motioning toward indy and the others
takes another bite of the peach but save their hair
i will make a coat out of it
the men move to kill scraggy betsy clare and the crew members
suddenly kezure emits a loud scream
he grabs his stomach in pain
he falls to his knees
the half eaten peach rolls from his hand
onto the indy and clare rush toward kezure
something very strange is happening to the pirate king
his hair begins to fall out
his teeth rot
his skin shrivels
his body becomes thinner
kezure has begun to rapidly age
he continues to scream
in horrible pain
the pirates step away
the others watch in horror
kezures body contorts
his skin withers
it begins to peel from his bones
his screams fade
his eyeballs roll out of their sockets
only his skeleton remains
it turns black and crumbles to dust
only his elaborate clothing remains
the many stolen peaches roll out of his cloak onto the ground
the remaining pirates drop their weapons
they run off down the mountain
scared to death
indiana holds the half eaten peach in his hand
betsy is puzzled
i thought the peaches promised immortality
the garden of immortal peaches promises life only to those who are pure in heart
pause kezure was evil
his heart was filled with greed
indiana drops the peach to the ground
he grabs his whip revolver and golden hooped rod
scraggy and his crew members retrieve their weapons
everyone turns continuing down the mountain path
leaving kezures clothes and the several peaches behind
passengers board a large ocean liner bound for the united states
indiana jones is here
he holds a rectangular wooden crate covered with the words fragile
the golden hooped rod is obviously stored inside
indy is waiting for someone
he impatiently checks his wristwach
he grumbles to himself
the boat leaves in five minutes
suddenly a horn interrupts
indy turns to the direction of the sound
it is scraggy
he is wearing driving goggles
he rides a battered bruised motorcycle attached to a ricketty sidecar
the word taxi is painted on the sidecars exterior
scraggy pulls up beside indiana
scraggy jumps off the motorcycle
excitedly he runs toward indy
i want to give you something for your journey
scraggy fumbles through his pockets
he removes a small bottle of purple liquid
he holds it out to indy
take one drink before bed
it keep out all bad spirits
he flashes a flask of whiskey from inside of his coat pocket
but thisll keep out all the bad spirits
they are suddenly interrupted
betsy and clare walk toward him
indy looks at betsy
wherere your bags
im not leaving
you have to finish school
im staying on as clares assistant
indy shoots a jealous glance to clare then back to betsy
but youre my assistant
not any more
im having my credits transfered
clare is a brilliant teacher
jealous so am i
yes but i dont offer a course in seduction
you stay out of this
i thought you wanted me out of your life
that was before i realized how gifted
how talented you are
i could really use you
especially aboard ship for three weeks
it gets terribly lonely
i warned you
indy ive learned a lot from you
but its time i started concentrating on a career in anthropology
instead of romance
sighs to betsy youve certainly developed a mature attitude
hugs him thanks to you
pauses looking into indys eyes you know
i always thought of you as my knight in shining armor
but now ill think of you as the father i never had
rolls his eyes terrific
clare walks up to him
she extends her hand
although your libido is questionable your bravery and intelligence are exceptional
a smile it has been an honor working with you
taken aback why
indy leans toward clare as if he is going to kiss her
he raises an eyebrow
speaking in his smoothest
you know clare
moving closer something ive been wanting to do
closer since we first met
leaning forward indy closes his eyes to kiss clare
but clare moves away
bonzo the gorilla enters the frame
bonzo kisses indy on the lips
indy opens his eyes
he tries to move away
but the gorilla will not move wrapping her arms around indy
the gorilla wrestles indy to the ground
by using gorilla hand motions and grunts clare manages to persuade bonzo to move away from indiana
indy wipes his mouth
clare betsy and scraggy are laughing
betsy explains to clare
guess i left her cage open
she followed us
the ocean liners horn sounds
it begins to drift away from the dock
indiana turns and runs up the stairs leading to the boat
the boat is a few feet from the dock
indy leaps onto the boat
he makes it
just indiana pauses
he realizes that hes forgotten the golden hooped rod
it sits on the dock
at scraggys feet
as the ocean liner pulls away indy is about to scream to his friends
but clare picks up the crate
she shrugs to indy
the ocean liner pulls further
from the dock
indiana is helpless
he cant go clare is sound asleep in bed
camera pans to a corner of the room
the wooden crate holding the golden hooped rod rests here
suddenly the boxs nails begin to twist
as if they were being turned by invisible hands
they fall out of the box
dropping to the floor
one by one
the box slowly opens
the golden hooped rod shikmers in the moonlight
suddenly the staff begins to move
it changes shape
turning into a golden eagle
the bird slowly flaps its wings and flies out of the open window
into the night
clare continues to peacefully sleep
the full moon illuminates the night sky
shimmering across the ocean waters
countless bright stars sparkle in the night sky
indys ocean liner sails across the water
the image of an eagle appears in the night sky
silhouetted against the moon
indiana jones is sound asleep in his bed
the rooms porthole mysteriously swings open
the golden eagle flies inside
the eagle transforms back into the golden hooped rod
the rod leans against the wall
the moonlight reflects the rod shining into indianas eyes
he sits up and sees the golden hooped rod
at first he is shocked
he touches the rod
then comes upon a realization
the creaky voice of sun wu kung fills the soundtrack
the golden hooped rod will be a faithful friend
it is capable of one hundred transformations
and will always remain by your side
he turns and looks out of the porthole
satisfied smile covers indys face as he stares at the stars above
sound track music soars
camera pulls back to extremely long shot of the ship sailing across the ocean
