href b b logans run by david zelag goodman april revised draft screenplay by david zelag goodman producer saul david director michael anderson production design dale hennesy revised april the
moon and stars are visible but as camera looks down the screen fills with dark billowing clouds
camera moves into the clouds and just as they blank out the screen a distant shimmer of light becomes visible
moving toward it the shimmer becomes a glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds that press it
camera continues to move in until the detailed structural webbing of the dome fills the screen and then camera moves through it and we see shining below the dome which
we now see as a series of dome like structures standing off without end a marvelous crystalline city of great openness building clusters green plazas fountains
multi leveled but human scale crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the maze cars
as a maze car slides softly to a stop
the hatch opens and a man in a hurry leaves the maze car and runs swiftly along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator which instantly starts to descend
from a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great height
as it reaches the courtyard the runner darts out pushes into the crowd
as he reappears around a corner skirts a brimming pool and makes for a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard
he is moving even faster now glancing back as if he fears pursuit
above at the railing of an oval light well dressed in black and silver a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand and watching
it is francis
moving rapidly down the corridor he suddenly stops as if feeling the presence above
he looks up sees the sandman and his face breaks in terror
he wheels frantic screaming runs back into the hall
vaulting the rail dropping lightly to ground level weapon poised
the crowd melting parting to reveal the runner backed against the pool
people are yelling shaking their fists terribly excited and fearful
seeming to burst aflame in the lens then slipping below frame to reveal francis sauntering forward holstering his weapon
the crowd closing in behind him applauding congratulating him
arriving at the pool where the body lies half immersed
he leans over lifts the right hand from the water revealing a palm with a black flowercrystal shape in it
he lets the hand fall back now as the crowd cheers and applauds him
closing in until the crystal fills the screen
clear sparkling flower like
camera pulls back to reveal the crystal is in the hand of a sleeping infant who is behind glass in one of many cubicles
standing outside looking in logan dimly lit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant lies swaddled and coccooned in the rosy auto tender which caters to
the babys every need
faint music bubbles like distant laughter
logan is twenty five strong virile yet sensitive with a kind of austere grace
he is somewhat manic
as he peers through the nursery window into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles three sleeping infants
logan is knocking on the soundless glass
come on logan
francis shaking his head in mild mocking disbelief you are here
i couldnt believe it when they told me
what are you doing
logan still knocking on the soundless glass turn this way
as one of the infants stirs smiles bubbles no no
francis tries to pull logan away from the window but logan is intent on waking one of the infants
you shouldve seen me take my last runner
logan continues to pound the soundless glass i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated
breaks off as logan is paying no attention so now youve seen him
whats the difference awake or asleep
logan to infant open your eyes once idiot
to francis its not every day that a sandman son is born
im telling you francis thats him
maybe maybe not
whats the difference
come on logan lets get out of here before everybody finds out
but logan isnt moving
francis gets an idea
you really want to wake him up
francis starts to pry at the panel
knowing it will sound an hey cut that out
too late there is a sound of alarm chimes
the area in which they stand is bathed in a violet glow
logan grabs francis firmly and stops him from prying at the panel now youve done it
the chimes stop
but the glow continues a metallic voice is heard break in scanners report intrusion identify
francis authorized duty quadrant
clear logan and francis
the violet light goes off
francis with affection to logan had enough
logan looking at the infant even the alarm didnt wake him
as francis starts out logan one last look joining francis all right francis
im with you
they move off down the corridor
the lights behind them dimming as they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light children automatically tended
a lullaby and a soothing impersonal voice
go to sleep
sleeping time little ones
as they exit nursery
logan stops and takes one final look backward
you need a lift
lets go to arcade and celebrate
teasing tone your alert successor
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are
putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly not in my time
they move through the door which closes
they are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced doorways each glowing faintly
they pause waiting
francis peering at logan curiously why
francis shrugs dunno
whatever happens you can bet its final
but who would want to find out
one of the doorways brightens and the word arcade appears on it
the two men move to the spot as a maze car stops
they enter it through the doorway which dims behind them as the maze car whooshes softly off into a kind of twilight
the door slides shut
they sink into seat forms which yield to them
they move off
moving through the city at terrific speed
giving us glimpses of the city as it goes
slowing finally as we see brightly lit garish
we get only a glimpse as the maze car disappears into a tunnel
as the maze car stops opens and logan and francis exit into a gathering crowd
throngs of people moving on many levels some walking some on moving platforms
its the great white way luna park you name it
gaudy booths and entrances featuring every delight too much to take in at a glance
as they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them across halls and up moving platforms the good natured argument continuing
but you dont know you just say what everyone says
one for one
one for one
well why no
thats exactly how everything works
how else could the city stay in balance you have a better idea
logan laughs no but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that one for one song of yours
you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape
well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering
beat you know logan you wonder a lot
too much for a sandman they are passing the facade of a relive shop the signs urging people to relive your most precious memories
do it again and again
as they cross the entrance two men come out grinning broadly falling into step just ahead of logan and francis
then one of the men stops abruptly almost colliding with them
he mumbles an apology and starts back to relive
as he disappears into the relive shop his friend shrugs cheerfully to logan and francis and moves on
they are moving past a shop called new you when a man comes cannonading out thrilled and excited
he rushes over to a pretty young woman who has been eying logan and francis plants himself in front of her with his hands framing his face
how do you like it
woman critically i dont know
the cheeks maybe
look a little cheeks
too much you think
gestures too little
okay wait for me
and he darts back into new you
the woman shrugs glances around smiles and goes off with a passer by
signs promising love fulfillment rare delights
people streaming in and out
a woman comes out looking glazed breathing yes
as she passes camera logan and francis emerge from the crowd and camera moves with them
did you ever see francis
francis shaking his head i never even visited nursery before tonight
beat when you wonder it slows you up you know
they are now passing the facade of hallucimill where the signs promise lift off crazy lift super lift
here the people going in are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds
i dont know what makes you so curious
you have any idea who his seed mother was
logan quickly of course not
i m curious not sick
laughs the crowd is growing denser funneling into a kind of passageway
logan and francis are swallowed up in the group
an immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling
there is a general air of anticipation stirring the crowd as camera singles out logan and francis entering waving to friends
camera closes in on them just as they reach a beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see francis
they embrace and as they break and thats my friend logan
as she acknowledges the introduction were celebrating his next in line
carousel arcade who knows
want to come along
woman smiles shakes her head only if i make it to the top of carousel
she holds up her hand thirty and the big spin
in her palm the crystal blinks red black
francis nods gives her a half squeeze
youre thirty already
i always thought i was older than you beat well give it a good try
woman pleasantly you know i always have
another beautiful woman joins them
nd woman to the first sorry i wont be at carousel tonight
it s my love shop turn
thats all right
ive got a feeling
woman smiles so do i
but if i dont at least ill have the ultimate thrill
id almost rather have that than renew
i feel the same way
sometimes i think im not even going to try and renew when my time comes
but thats three years away
the nd woman walks away
francis after a beat to first woman its been nice
they look briefly and then she turns away
francis takes logans arm and they move off
i guess you never had her
logan shakes his head
you missed something special
you cant have them all
together its an old joke but you can try
they laugh but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters moving with erratic speed of lightning smashes between them almost knocking francis over
he reels logan catches him and they recover in time to see the trio rip wildly through the crowd knocking people down screaming with shrill joy as they disappear
the damned yellows are getting out of hand
those three ought to be in cathedral
no business scrambling in arcade
logan laughs cuffs francis arm what an old old man youre getting to be francis
werent you ever a yellow
i bet you were even wilder than he breaks off as the lights in the great hall dim come on sandman
the two of them start to move to the far end of the great hall
as everyone begins to move to the far end where great curtains have parted to reveal ac the far end of the hall where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance the crystal is red and pulsing rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling tone
as we move toward it with logan and francis the tone deepens the great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality
in the crowd they overtake a fellow sandman daniel and fall in step with him
when they speak now their voices are hushed
you should have been with us in nursery daniel
im positive i recognized him francis hustling logan come on
i dont want to miss the filing in
therell be some i know tonight i think
daniel glances at his own red crystal nods yes
you know were both on monitor tonight
just when i feel like an all out blast in arcade
want me to take your shift
im feeling restless anyway francis glances at him exchanges a look with daniel
they vanish into the throng passing under the great crystal turn the corner and we see framed in a huge corridor we see a steep sided arena dropping down to
a shadowy center which even now pulsates and flickers in changing dimensions but always maintaining the jewel flower shape
there is one entrance into the center a kind of ramp from below the seats leading directly into the mysterious bowl just now the seats are filling and the sense
of expectation builds people sit and immediately crane their necks waiting
featuring logan and francis as they find places in the arena
like the others they crane upward
as they do logan gestures at a number of pretty girls who are just being seated
now theres a few who could have been his seed mother
only a few
youre just not trying
as the seats fill the excitement builds
suddenly the lights begin to dim and dim
sound a kind of collective sigh breathing in unison
suddenly visible the lastday group
their arms are upraised and in each palm the crystal blinks red black red black
transfixed gripped with a religious fervor
hands still raised filing slowly into the mysterious well of carousel
tense beginning nervous applause here and there
as the last one enters beginning to glow and as it does the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant enfolding and hiding the people within a series
of translucent petals
as the last one enfolds them the light intensifies the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it
visible in the growing light from carousel gripped with passion and excitement applauding gesturing as they see moving bands of light seeming to spiral upward like a contained aurora as
the carousel picks up speed
caught up in it like the rest
beginning to blur with its own speed
through the shifting spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of weightlessness always struggling to move higher
follow a shadowy form as it moves twists through other writhing shadows upward upward
suddenly the form is spread eagled and in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and then a searing flash
and it is gone
sound crowd in a frenzy screaming
screaming their cheers as high reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome fringing intersecting rainbow bands appear looping the swirling upper carousel like saturns rings
now we see figures reaching outward toward them
reaching and missing and falling downward against the curtain and the flash of extinction
at the highest level
straining for the rainbow
starting to chant
the man continues to strain renew
almost a blur
but still straining renew
chanting with the rest renew
but still there
straining with all his might for the rainbow
suddenly the man
topples into the whirling blackness below
where he is instantly incinerated
whirling whirling the rainbows shining
orgiastic pleasure a spanish crowd at a perfect killing screaming fulfilled
other figures move to the topmost level
straining for the rainbow bands
as the screaming goes on in the b
of the shut
we hear a buzzing noise
logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small dark plastic box
logan looks at the box
on it we see to francis looks like im working
who invited you
im in my party mood
and the camera pans them rushing out of the bleachers
they make their way into the hall
logan takes out the small plastic box
we can tell from his face that he is disappointed
until a faint beeping sound emanates from the box
francis watches as logan wheels in one direction
the beeping stops
he turns in another direction
again there is no beeping
as logan turns in a third direction
the beeping commences
logan and francis move swiftly in that direction and the beeping grows louder
until logan and francis see running
chase inter cut between logan and francis following the running man in the great hall
we can hear the crowd screaming in carousel offstage
logan and francis separate
to encircle the running man
the running man turns a corner and for a moment logan cannot see him
as logan turns the corner
francis is on the other side and fires at the running man
just missing him
francis winks at logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp and logan gets it a little cat and mouse is in order
just missing the man
francis fires again
just missing too
the man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp
to various levels and areas
both barrels of logan and francis respective guns glow again as they fire
with both just missing the running man once more
the mans face is crazed
the mouse is going berserk as he has been chased to a high level
he stands frozen petrified driven to the edge of a high balcony by the shots teetering now
he is in full sight of logan francis is across the hall
the runner s face
he looks at death twenty feet away logan aims
francis watching smiling at the perfect moment
a shadow of thought a hesitation
the runner lunges
logan fires misses
francis fires a salvo drives the runner back to the rail where he teeters again throws his hands in front of his face and plunges
the screaming in carousel reaches a peak
as he arrives at the dead body of the runner bends over him turns the mans left hand up
we see the flower crystal
logan takes out his transceiver
a mans face visible
logan checks it against the face of the dead man
they are not the same
as francis comes up waits
logan moves the transceiver to the dead mans face rests it on his forehead
the words appear ident
new you alteration scowls for a moment then shrugs
he takes out a small flat pouch and methodically strips from the body its few personal things stuffs them into the pouch
then his eye is caught by the mans right hand clenched
logan opens it
a metal ankh on a bit of chain
it means nothing to logan who stuffs it into the pouch and closes it
now again he fiddles with the transceiver speaks into it softly
runner terminated a beat ready for cleanup
done with his job he rises to face francis
smiling that was a great shot you made
beat but you look a little rusty to me what were you doing wondering
hes not sure himself
together they walk off down the hall passing camera we see in the distance a pair of stickmen descending into the hall riding through the air on their odd vehicles
passing overhead then descending
one hovers not far away as the other comes down hangs a few feet over the body
the driver makes sure hes in position then presses a button on one of the arms of the vehicle
there is a broad spray of vapor from the bottom which covers the corpse
it turns to crystals which sag away from the human form as a sand sculpture erodes when its dry
satisfied he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the shot
as it leaves the second machine moves down and into its place
glances at the crystals maneuvers into position presses his buttons
sucked up into the machine as it hovers
as the floor is once again bare the nd stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and away
as the stickmen move up and out we see the exhilarated crowd beginning to pour out of carousel
descending from the top level not much of a crowd
francis is gesturing toward the hallucimill
well i think youre getting stale
you need old lucey go on
gee the whole burn try the new psycho lift they tell me it turns you inside out
he shoves logan in that direction and continues on down
calling after him ill look for you here when im off and he is gone
waves smiling then turns to the hallucimill
hesitates as a couple push past him gleefully on their way
he looks and we see the people from carousel starting to pour in loud happy ready for more fun
not with it
he turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit
as he enters
he crosses to a sideboard makes himself a drink sips doesnt like it
gets rid of it makes another
he fiddles with things a game sits gets up
now he is beginning to feel the drink
takes another belt smiles
now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials
as logan dials blurred and smoky images appear in the recess a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors
he tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears bejeweled lustrous willing
bored as mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves
he dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape
it is jessica
still in the recess she makes no gesture of interest no smile
around her neck from a collar a dangling ankh
it catches logans eye
he smiles clicks another dial and she becomes real
he reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room
as jessica turns to him logan moves in strongly and embraces her but to his surprise she resists
logan still holding her loosely is amused and surprised
whats wrong available
breaking away gently please
she backs away almost apologetically
logan follows smiling
noting that she looks trapped he understands you mean not here thats it
youre a private available but particular he is moving in on her as he speaks she retreating which amuses him dont worry
theres no one here but me
that stops him just no
you prefer women
i felt sad i put myself on the circuit
it was a mistake
what made you sad
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight
now hes gone
after a beat yes
probably he was renewed
flatly he was killed killed
why do you use that word
isnt it right
isnt that what you do
i never killed anybody in my life
sandmen terminate runners a beat who brought you
i felt sad
i put myself on the circuit
you felt sad
whats your name
matter of fact youre beautiful
lets have sex
but you put yourself on the circuit
i thought i had to do something
i changed my mind and now
how a sandman lives
logan smiles takes off gunbelt etc
lets have sex
as jessica shakes her head i thought you were curious
not about that
after a beat im listening
im afraid to tell you
smiling im not armed
a beat well
why is it wrong to run
you shouldnt even think such things
smiles and you picked a strange person to say them to i suppose
but what if you want to live
do what everyone does
try like hell for renewal
logan stretches out his right hand
we see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm
it is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner
when this turns black
laughs if for any reason you want to be
you have the same chance as everyone else
logan takes his gun and points it at her
logan playfully but if youre one of the misfits
thats where i come in
jessica somewhat frightened i didnt say that i would run
logan interrupting turning over her palm are you a or a
we see a green crystal six
i go red next year
youre years away
i dont know why youre thinking of these things much less talking about them
offering jessica the gun want to try
jessica shakes her head
logan looks at jessica carefully
in an admiring sexual way
from her toes to her head
briefly noticing in the process chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner
around her neck
what quad do you live in
logan softly youre sure you dont want to try
its nice to know you can nod
its nice co know you can do that too
suddenly francis and two dishevel led young women burst in and come laughing toward logan and jessica stoned hilarious they crowd around logan one of them embracing him
in the wild hilarity jessica slips away and logan seeing her go makes a vain effort after her
francis notices laughs
amid the noise he shouts to logan these are for me youve got your own
looking after jessica she must have been something
at logans expression he roars with laughter francis picks up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great pink cloud settles over them all
a frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper fronted by broad steps
logan and francis are climbing the steps as a sandman is coming out
his uniform is in tatters
they greet one another
then what happened to you
sandman embarrassed i lost a runner in cathedral
ran into some cubs i couldnt manage
as they stare one of them cut me bad
extends his arm and moves a finger from his shoulder to his wrist all the way down
with anger sandman shrug on my way to the new you for repairs
get yourself a new face while youre at it they know you now
logan and francis continue
as logan and francis cross turn into a corridor
i just might look in on new you myself
youre already beautiful
no its that last runner someone in was trying to help him
as logan and francis cross the room logan nods to other sandmen who are monitoring areas of the megalopolis on video consoles
one of these sand men speaks to francis who hasnt greeted them sandman monitor whats with you francis
francis touching his head grimacing last night the other sandmen including logan smile as logan and francis continue to black door opens revealing logan and francis who now enter a
as they walk
they pass four giant lifeclocks
white each lifeclock pulses out the moments of every person alive in the city governing everyones crystal changes automatically shifting to the next lifeclock when the time comes
there are no humans
francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room
above which is a circular overhang
there is a groove
the shape of a palm crystal on one part of the circular table
francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the dead runners pockets and starts putting the contents on the table
these contents are the ones from the runner francis has killed at the beginning of the film
the moment the first item touches the table
it activates a scanner on the overhang above
francis stands alongside the table
his attitude is very matter of fact
he has been through this procedure many many times
he touches his head
and logan smiles
the scanner stops
the word appears on a screen
francis places his palm into the groove
and the words appear on the screen
see you in the hydrotoner
francis exits as logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the items he has taken off the runner who jumped to his death
among them is the odd shaped piece of jewelry
logan is standing nonchalantly
as the scanner moves over the items
waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as francis was earlier
the scanner continues scanning
logan starts becoming impatient
but the scanning goes on and on and on
logan is clearly puzzled
it has never
ever taken anything remotely resembling this length of time
suddenly directly before him
on the screen
the word blinks on and off
on and off
catching logans attention
as logan turns toward the screen
the scanner stops moving
the word probability blinks off and is replaced by the word we can tell from logans expression as he walks to the corner
that he has never seen this before
logan sits in a chair in the area facing the screen
there is a stellar groove that we have seen on the table the shape of a palm crystal
glowing on an arm of the chair
the word on the screen is now logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove
we hear a humming noise
then the piece of jade jewelry appears on the screen and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the screen negative
question what is it
words on screen now read negative
words on screen now read i dont understand
words on screen now read question word on screen now reads it disappears and words on screen now read unaccounted for
word on screen reads impossible
rising tone question maybe they werent all runners
maybe most of them reached life renewal on carousel
words on screen read question none of them reached renewal
word on screen reads but everyone believes that some
words on screen read question you mean nobodys ever been renewed
words on screen read as logan reacts the new words which appear read logan startled the seal
breaks off question the seals
but theres nothing outside
the words on the screen read i will
the words on the screen read question a beat what if i need help from another sandman
the words on the screen read logan takes a breath
question i am six red
how can i pretend to be approaching lastday
the words on the screen read my lifeclock
slightest beat question my life before the startled logan can finish
he feels a shock of pain and his hand is immobile
logan stares at the back of his hand as if it wasnt his
his forehead shines with sweat
now the entire area including the chair and the screen begins to glow bright red
the glowing becomes so bright that logan is forced to close his eyes
as the glow subsides
logan looks at his right hand
the red flower crystal in his palm is blinking
he stares at it fascinated fearful
question urgent tone am i still six red
the words on the screen read logan standing i know that but i had four more years extending the blinking palm this means ten days to lastday
of course i will get the four years back wont i
the words on the screen read logan very urgent question do i get my four years back
the screen is blank
for a moment his lips part as if to say something more but he changes his mind turns away
now logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh
almost automatically he starts moving his hand toward the groove
but the screen already has the words logan looks at it then the camera pans logan out of the mammoth room
past the giant lifeclocks
where he pauses
glances at his blinking crystal
and continues out into spectacularly rd century
he looks around and spots francis
in a whirlpool bath
trying to recover from has incredible hangover
in the b
of the shot we can see some sandmen doing calisthenics
logan walks over to francis
hiding his blinking crystal by holding his hand against his leg
what the hell took you so long
after a beat did you ever see anybody renew
i think youve been skulling out too much
first nursery and now stupid questions
anybody we know
why dont you get into the water
you need it
more than i do
after a beat im fine
walking away see you
at carousel tonight
logan nods exits
the camera remains on a slightly puzzled francis for a moment then follow logan out to logan is on the steps irresolute
he looks at his blinking crystal
moves as if to reenter changes his mind
now takes out the black box dials
into box location
female green six
living in quad k
logan opens the door to see jessica
behind her a young sandman who has obviously escorted her there
young sandman smiling she says shes been here before
jessica half turns and shrugs a see
the young sandmans smile widens he waves to logan and shoves off
you could have called me yourself
but i wasnt sure youd come
the game has started here i am
beat shall i come in
logan gestures leading her inside to the living area
i couldnt get you out of my mind
im the most beautiful woman youve ever seen i suppose
but i have the choice
then its still no
you can have any woman in the city
what do you really want
you know i dont believe you
there has to be more
logan extends his right hand
he turns his right palm so that
jessica can see it blinking red
jessica gasps for a moment
then why show me
im going to run
jessica after reacting why tell me
you know something
about running dying what
runnings what im interested in
i know what everyone knows
try like hell for renewal
you have the same chance everyone else has
its different now
how can i
logan takes out the ankh
where did you get that
a runner gave it to me
and then you killed him right
i let him go
logan a beat speak to your friends for me jessica
clutching the ankh looking at jessicas then i dont have much time
i never heard of a sandman running ever
logan putting the ankh in his pocket dropping the bombshell and i never heard of sanctuary
she is about to speak
logan reaches out and touches her hand
what can i do to make you believe me
jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch
logan stands and starts out
as jessica watches him
there are three men and a woman seated at a table
jessica reaches the table and sits down
a distance away
eating without enthusiasm
obviously more interested in their conversation
sandmen get old too
but what if hes telling the truth
i say no
its not worth the risk
i absolutely agree
hes killed runners for a decade
he has no feelings
he was born a sandman
he had no choice
neither do we
four sandmen at the consoles
they look up as francis enters
he goes to one of the men who stretches yawns gets up
francis taking his place at the console just dont be forever about it like last time
ah h you love it
youre afraid youll miss a really good run
they all laugh
francis takes up his watch as the other exits
leaning together talking in an undertone second man urgently if he believes you hell come
why arcade station
second man impatiently why
its our only chance kill him and get away in the crowd heading for the evening slaughter right at the station itself
no just there on the first level
beat dont look for us
well see you
woman cutting in you dont seem quite sure jessica
beat can you do it
slowly jessica nods
jessica stalling y yes
if i can find him
i think you can
jessica faces her squarely nods
the woman looks deeply into her eyes relaxes
we all are
but he has heard about sanctuary and that makes him dangerous to all of us
after murmurs of agreement staring at jessica were counting on you
they look at each other in dismay
after a moment one of the men follows her
they dont trust her
obviously enjoying the work watching tracking a runners progress the assignment of a sandman the kill
making her way through the strolling crowd her face thoughtful
the man from the restaurant following
walking slowly up to a door she hesitates knocks
logan opens the door reacts
are you here to help me
what do you need
a moment then logan moves toward her hungrily pulling her in to him as the door closes
walking along a handsomely landscaped stream
laughing together stopping to admire the beautiful fish koi
whatre you going to do
turning away slightly i wish i could help you
turning her gently back maybe youll chink of something
hating herself i wish i knew what you think i know
logan smiles at her both knowing whats false but drawn to each other anyhow
they commence walking again
the followers ahead now watching trying to make up their minds as to whether jessica is bringing logan to the ambush
as they argue logan and jessica approach
if you did know youd tell me
of course logan overriding if you trusted me youd know
jessica evading it were coming to arcade
beat shall we relive together
as they pass jessica looks full in the face of one of the followers looks away
logan does not notice
the followers are partly reassured
one of the men is now holding a garrote made from his necklace
the man who first followed gestures and the others go off purposefully
he continues after logan and jessica as they exit round a corner
as st sandman returns still cheerfully chewing
francis is reluctant to give up his place and when he does he remains standing there watching
he loves the work they all do
logan and jessica entering
logan is aware of jessicas increasing tension
he pretends unconcern but he is wary
behind them visible through the crowd two of the men we saw before
the follower and the man with the garrote
they are moving so as to intersect with logan and jessica where the crowd is thickest streams coming together to move to a higher level
as they move fearful torn between her promise and her feeling for logan
catching a glimpse of the followers she makes a small sound hesitates pretends to have stumbled
closer now closing in the wire garrote gleaming between the mans hands
suddenly she stops
he comes round facing as people eddy by them
logan looks at her searchingly
tell me jessica
behind him the two men move in
the man with the garrote raises his hands
one more step
logan senses something half turns just as we hear a familiar urgent sound the sound of his transceiver
behind him the man hesitates drops his hands
logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side jessica with him
now he bends to read the message and jessica cranes her head to see too
as the runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message the sandman at the console turns and says hey logans got a mean one tonight why dont you but
francis is already at the door
a wave and hes gone
the others ad lib interest watch out in there they can cut you before you see them etc
the two watching muscles taut wondering
as he speaks he leads her into the maze car station and punches out his destination on the car caller
youre not going are you
logan a beat why not
maybe shell help me
youd better stay here
the maze car arrives and they move to it
jessica touching his arm id rather be with you
logan knowing she is lying through her teeth thats nice
they enter the car which instantly moves off
as it passes the men in ambush come forward and read the destination
they ring for another car which pulls in immediately
as the two jam into the maze car which rockets off in pursuit
have you ever been through cathedral
jessica shakes her head
theyre like beasts
maybe theyre angry because theyre grown in meccano breeders
logan interrupting grimacing instead of what
nine months inside a woman ugh were all raised the same but most of us dont become cubs in cathedral
some people say children need human mothering
nurseries are better than any mother could be
im only telling you what ive heard
slightest beat havent you ever wondered what your seed mother was like
after a beat when did you begin to question lastday
i dont remember exactly
except i was a green
another beat what would you like to relive logan
logan smiling lets see how long has it been
as jessica turns her head
looking somewhat guilty the maze car slides to a stop
a warning light pulses on the cars console and a recorded voice speaks before the hatch opens
cathedral station is a personal risk area
persons with business are warned to be careful
now the hatch opens
they step out logan first jessica timidly looking around
behind them the hatch closes the maze car sighs away into the distance
ive never been in this quadrant
looks off is that arcade off there
there are standing on the maze car platform a high overlook like an elevated station
arcade shining like distant fireworks
below them a narrow sharply angled concrete canyon buttressed walls rising featureless
the look of an old fortress blank dim and cool
still visible over an opening the chiseled legend cathedral plaza a
skidmore rosenfelt hennesy architects
jessica shivers looking around her
logan takes her arm and they descend into the canyon move toward the wall
their footsteps the only sound
let me go first
sometimes theyre waiting just inside there to rush you when it opens
quickly now he helps her through the narrow opening the portals walls are very thick
they turn abruptly and see a room of angled reflecting surfaces
at one end a jagged corridor also mirrored leads away
the zigzag angled effect creates an absolute confusion of images
but logan leads her unhesitatingly across the chamber to the corridor
jessica hangs back momentarily certain shes about to smash into something
logan guiding her just follow no matter how it seems
jessica doing her best but what is this why
logan as they enter the corridor the cubs
when theyre flying on muscle theres no way to catch up
without the dazzle theyd just go past us gesture too fast muscle
i dont know that one
logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor
its stop and go a fun house in which you can get hurt
no good for any one over thirteen anyhow shakes you to pieces speeds everything up to a blur he is amused you can see what happens when some flying cub
tries to go through this on muscle splat
to what logan has said
then a moment later as they approach the end of the corridor a small figure in a tattered garment approaches them
she stops singing as she sees logan and jessica
jessica gently dont be afraid
we see that it is a little girl of seven
her face is grimy and hair is tangled
whats your name
where do you live mary
why arent you in nursery
im very smart
when do you go up
i never go upstairs
youre a nice old lady
as soon as she finishes her last sentence mary grabs at jessicas clothing
tearing a pin piece of jewelry off
and running away swiftly
as jessica instinctively starts after her
holds her back
shaking his head not here
might be a decoy
cautiously logan and jessica exit from the wall stepping out into an area of rubble and dilapidated buildings
logan crouches holding the transceiver and fanning the area listening
sound a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady
logan gestures to jessica to follow him and moves carefully in the direction of the beeping quartering occasionally like a hunting dog
coming up to an angle of wall he stops flicks the sound off puts the machine back onto his belt
he gestures to jessica to stand still then he straightens steps out calls runner
jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does the runner moves from behind an upright and stands
the figure is shadowed the arms out palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender
in the runners left hand the tiny red crystal pulses on and off
the runner is a woman
there is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly jessica gasps grasping at him
as logan whirls suddenly from everywhere out of the shadows a pack of snarling cubs materializes moving with blinding speed
at their appearance the runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows
logan makes a futile gesture after her then turns to face the cubs
a strutting feral faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the pack dressed in fierce looking tatters and hung with rip off trophies
he gestures to one of his followers to stand still
speaking of the runner dont worry about her
well have that one later
right now i think weve got a runner and his pairup
and what a runner
the camera pans the other cubs
were going to have ourselves a time we are
there is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest
im a sandman
i cut up a sandman yesterday
they said id never get him
but i cut him up good i did
logan firm tone i feel sorry for you boy
some murmuring as the pack watches their leader
better feel sorry for your self sandman
no for you
how old are you billy
billy is silent
your days are running out
how long can you last
he points to the yellow flower in billys palm what happens when youre sixteen and you go green
billy lashing out nothing will happen
i make the rules as i go
cubs do what i say
i got cathedral and ill never let go
no cubs over fifteen billy
ever heard of a cub with a green flower
youll leave cathedral then billy when youre on green because they wont let a green stay here
slightest beat if you try to stay the young ones will gut rip you apart
shut up your damn mouth
logan falls back into a fighting crouch
but before he can strike a blow
he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned building
let him suck muscle
thatll shut his mouth
lets watch him shake himself to death
we see the cubs take out drugpads
they squeeze the pads and inhale the muscle
at once their movements become blurringly rapid
they take menacing positions some leaping overhead
give him some muscle
like lightning they change positions and flash around logan and jessica watching
being held against the wall by cubs as shake him to death
moving a drugpad against logans face
logan is holding his breath
desperately trying not to breathe the muscle directly from the pad into his system
billy chilling laugh hes trying to hold his breath
as billy presses the pad tighter against logans face with all his might logan wrenches his arms loose
drops to the ground and pulls out his gun
he fires and fire girdles a pillar
and they start to back away
we can rush him
we can take can take him again we can
the pack hesitates
stops backing away
moving the gun slowly back and forth all right
how many of you want this to be lastday
the pack moves back again
and disperses leaving billy facing logan alone
come on billy
you cut a sandman didnt you
logan tucks the gun back into his waist
come on billy
come on after a beat billy turns and runs away
logan comforts the shivering jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it
until it starts beeping
the camera pans logan and jessica
following the sound
they move over the rubble
and cautiously around abandoned buildings
we hear a scream
and hear the cubs whove only obviously found and attacked someone
the sound is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from
shaking his head theyve got someone else
why would anybody come here
jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly
the beeping is now very loud
logan homes in on an abandoned building enters crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down
we see the runner
the woman cringing expecting death
frozen for a moment
a figure stirs moves and we see it is francis
his weapon is drawn and aimed but as he watches he lowers the barrel and smiles
the is logans job
watching woman nearing hysteria theres been a terrible error
my lifeclock must have broken in some way
rising tone im nowhere near thirty
look at me
im twenty two
i should be green
did you hear me
logan quietly dont be afraid before logan can continue
who is now wild eyed and hysterical lunges at logan
and starts grappling with him
ill kill you
ill kill you
after logan pushes her away
and she falls down logan breathing hard im not going to hurt you
slowly she rises
logan takes out the ankh
logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object
the size of a large marble
if they find you throw this hard enough to break it
then hold your breath till you get away
its blind gas
her reaction is blank then with desperate ferocity she attacks logan again
during the course of the struggle logan subdues her again
jessica enters bends over the near crazed runner as logan holds her
eyeing him the woman stands and takes the small round object
she appears somewhat bewildered as logan and jessica move off
he is shocked unbelieving
stunned and uncertain francis aims his gun toward logan and jessica
but he wavers
watching them disappear into the rubble
shivering like a wet dog
he turns toward open window
francis in a firm cold tone runner
the woman turns staring insanely
her mouth opens like a fish as francis fires his gun
a moment later as the burning body topples to the floor hearing the unmistakable screaming sound of the kill they exchange a look
at the flash of fire from francis gun they turn
logan and francis eyes meet
a beat then logan grabs jessica and pulls her away
after a long long hesitation takes out his small plastic box and starts to speak into it francis quietly runner terminated at g
ready for cleanup at cathedral quadrant
the second and third men
very close to the maze car platform
peering into the darkness and seeing logan and jessica emerge onto the maze car platform
we can tell from the way the two men look at one another that they believe logan has fired the shot they have heard
they hide from the approaching logan and jessica
i almost believed her
they move off soundlessly
behind them a maze car has arrived
gun in hand
running through cathedral toward the maze car platform
i was bringing you to be killed
can you take me there
logan i dont know where sanctuary is
but if i take you to them theyll kill you
logan a beat all right
i didnt kill the runner
jessica interrupting yes but they wont know that
theyre hunting you logan
maybe me too now
logan wry laugh thats nothing
theres a sandman behind us too and therell be more soon
take me to them
jessica torn i i cant
then why dont you leave me go to them explain no
not that either
logan considers her
a long beat
thinking then all right
ill find out myself
ignoring the greetings of sandmen who are monitoring the city
walking past the giant lifeclocks into the debriefing area
the scanners begin moving
moments later the scanner stops
the word appears on a screen francis pauses a moment and places his palm into the groove
now he takes out the items of the dead woman runner and places them on the scanning table
an alarm sounds and the word flashes on and off on the screen
sandmen come running into the area
quickly as if changing his mind taking the items off the table can you beat it
ive got the damn wrong bag
you ought to put yourself on reliefcall francis
francis starting out yeah
as they enter new you they are being watched by a safe distance behind
the waiting room has many mirrors
male and female
are checking their faces and bodies
there are also various photographs on the walls
suggestions for changes to foreheads eyes cheeks lips etcetera
the chatty informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber shop
there is a receptionist seated behind a desk in a corner
logan and jessica walk up to the desk
the receptionist looks at logan
do you want to see doc
logan nods impatient he knows someones watching
we dont get many sandmen
i think weve only had one other since ive been here
logan brusquely a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else
wheres the doctor
receptionist smiling i like your face
would you mind if doc took a picture
id like him to give your face to somebody else
its all right with me
is he here
my names holly
in ancient times they said my number was unlucky
do you believe in luck
no look im in a hurry
docll be with you soon sandman
logan and jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and sit down next to an attractive woman
is this your first time
logan and jessica nod
woman customer smiling this is my third
a beat i did it when i turned yellow
showing her palm i turned red yesterday
logan looking beautiful work
this man do them all
but i hear hes terrific
have you seen any of his work
docs ready sandman
logan and jessica stand
they follow holly into a large shining stainless steel room where we see who looks about twenty one years old exchanges a pointed look with jessica
its a real privilege sandman
slightest beat i thought youd be older
i ex pected a red
doc showing his palm the flower crystal is red i am
your own work
doc with pride and i did it myself right on there
aesculaptor mark iii the latest in servo surgical designs
completely self contained tilt bed cryojector services embedded in the platform
the mark iiis laser heads are integrated into the whole cocoon swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or
wide bladed scraping
the machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x ray table on an angle the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and integral with it
from the cryonic receptor base there is a steady exhalation of cold the vapor seeping steadily downwards blurring the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers which join
in solid state circuitry so that any random or involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an equivalent move of the laser head keeping the focus precise
at one end where the halves of the mark iii join is n console of switches and dials lights nod servo recorders which control the operation from the first injection
of cold to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing
with the air of a magician demonstrating doc goes to the console and flips switches
instantly the table responds the platform tilting the crab like laser arms descending flexing small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash harmlessly across the table
beaming doc turns it off and the whole apparatus subsides
i designed it myself
slightest beat whatll it be
a face job or a full body job
just the face
holly will get you ready
youre in good hands believe me
holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on logans tunic
as holly brushes her fingertips lightly down logans arms holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the table
smiles and other things
ill be back in a minute
hes going to sterilize himself
do i have to undress
not for your face
logan follows holly to the table
jessica remains behind with doc who speaks to her with soft urgency
you shouldnt have brought him here
i didnt bring him whats the difference
he wants to run
hes a sandman
i tell you hes running
but i wish hed gone somewhere else
a beat a shrug all right
he gets a face
logan lies down
the table ripples
accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him
leaning close to logan i like dark hair
have him give you dark hair
would you take a picture of him doc
id like you to give his face to somebody else
doc pushes a button
there is a tiny flash
do you have anything special in mind
i dont care
just get it over with
doc smiling hurry
holly whispering dark hair
hollyd like dark hair
hollyd like a lot of things
studying logans face we can start by narrowing the cheekbones
doc presses buttons on the control board
jessica who is standing next to doc is slightly startled as the table begins to hum
as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward logan forming inner cones as they approach
cryojector needles start to close in on them nearing their faces and shoulders slowly
the visible cold streaming off the points
a vibrobeam begins to keen
sound an insistent chiming
doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man whos been called to the phone too many times
he turns to a phone like apparatus nearby shifting the table into neutral as he turns
the table and the laser heads stop moving
as if speaking on a phone hello listening yes listening yes they are
listening his expression changing done
doc turns back to the console pausing to stare intently at logan then up at the brightly smiling holly
something in his look registers and hollys smile fades
now doc engages the machine again
pay attention sandman
im proud of this machine
as he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near logans face
it pauses as with this one theres no waiting for scar burnishing
its all in one
the laser arm sweeps across logans forehead and cheeks leaving a bright trail of blood as but heres the improvement
instant healing before you feel a thing
doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track spraying healing fluid
magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole
his face tense he knows somethings wrong
over him hollys bright face with its rapt look
shes not sure but she enjoys whatevers happening
who is playing the console as he speaks
perfect depth adjustment on this one sandman
the beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath absolute precision
watch now and the machine does its stuff slashing through logans tunic a seam of blood following the rip
of course it doesnt mend uniforms sandman but otherwise it does everything doesnt it
just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning
and the arm moves back again spraying the healing fluid into logans new wound
again the blood disappears
suddenly docs look is ferocious
he turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely
the laser arms begin to move wildly and the sounds become shrill
holly looks alarmed
youre scrambling the table
hell be cut to pieces doc
it was a trap
no im running
machine begins to whine loudly
jessica tries to turn the machine off
doc starts to wrestle with her as moving
watching two stun beams lower
doc knocks jessica down
she is groggy on the floor as the stun beams lance into logans cheeks
the table holds him biting into his right leg below the knee
watching intently as as surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist leaving two threads of blood
a vacu head dips to suck the blood away neatly
as logan desperately sucks in his belly
trying to flatten himself into the table
as laser blades cut into his face
followed by a spray of healing liquid on the cuts
as as two wide blades of light sweep downward
and hover three inches above his neck
and keep lowering
and one inadvertently frees logans right arm
shocked as logan reaches for his gun
as dozens of laser beams slash toward logan
he twists away
and breaks off
jumping off the table
doc rushes logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy
in an instant he has knocked logans gun away
and as logan looks down at it
we see it lying on the floor completely frozen
slowly doc moves toward logan the short smoke colored stick menacing in his hand
logan out of breath what i told you is the
abruptly doc lunges toward logan
missing him as logan ducks away
as doc turns to attack
logan smashes his elbows into docs chest and doc falls back onto the table
screaming as doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and various fluids boil and spill
onto hot surfaces
holly tries to fight her way into the mess to help doc but jessica recovering pulls her down and the two struggle
in terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons
making an effort to stop the machine pulling levers and pushing buttons in vain
he sees whats happening pulls jessica away from holly and grabbing up his gun and tunic heads for the entrance
crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of entering
gun in hand
as they face francis
francis frowning whats going on logan
it has nothing to do with you
choking but still loyal what are you talking about
i saw you let a runner go
up a notch i saw you logan
suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke and noise momentarily drawing francis attention
instantly logan jumps him grabs and throws him sprawling
without a look back he and jessica run out
enraged finds his gun on the floor and before rising gets off a shot at them as they disappear
then leaping to his feet dashing off in pursuit
logan and jessica running through arcade
suddenly she pulls him in another direction
follow me logan
as they run into hallucimill
never too far behind
spots them and follows
exiting from the other side
and running through the crowd toward and into a love shop
followed by francis coming out of the hallucimill too
and running toward the love shop
as they enter the hot darkness
the love shop is throbbing with sexuality
in it the darkness breaks at irregular intervals when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance each time revealing an orgiastic tableau
the love shop is multi leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time blinding and stunning the viewer
logan and jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do a beautiful wanton grabs logan pulling and laughing i have an empty one sandman logan tries to pull
away looks around for jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off
then the light is gone again and jessica with it
as she tears at his clothing wrapping herself around him trying to pull him down
then as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man
logan is freed starts looking for jessica
logan hunting through the love shop fighting them off
intercut shots of the suddenly illuminated tableaus
sex manifold and multiform everybody doing it
entering starting to look around grabbed by one of the laughing wantons
brief glimpses of them looking for each other
as he suddenly collides with a woman shoves her away and sees its jessica
now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them
suddenly they are in darkness
then a heavy door slides open and jessica leads logan through the opening
behind them the door slides shut again
desperately trying to get rid of a woman sees a flash of logan and jessica far across the room sees them leave
then hes pulled down again as the orgy continues
after a moment jessica takes logans hand and they start down in the darkness
the sounds of love shop still heard from behind the wall
are you taking me to them
beat i dont know what else to do with him following us
she hesitates why do you keep running from your because hes my friend a beat and i dont want to be killed by him or anyone
hes good isnt he
will he find us and kill us
or one of the others
a beat you know theres only one place to go now
jessica hopelessly they wont believe us
beat id rather take my chances with them
than with francis
they won t listen
logan interrupting you think sandmen will
before she can answer theres no other way for me well convince them
he puts his hand over hers
jessica is silent
then she turns his hand over
the crystal blinks red on off
turning to him blindly im glad they didnt change your face
logan embraces her but his look is strange and remote
they continue down into the darkness
behind them the sounds of love shop die away and only their footsteps are heard
at the mirrored archway looking around carefully testing
he knows they went through somehow
hands claw at him he brushes them away as he searches
they have come to the foot of the stair
here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness
jessica softly exactly four steps now
let me lead you
they walk now to the right
its narrow here youll have to get behind me
logan whispering how will they know were coming
jessica whispering theyre watching us now
theyll let us in when theyre sure
as he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt punching out a signal
as the sandmen monitoring see the signal flash and move smoothly into action
close together he behind waiting alert as a voice is suddenly heard voice scratchy filtered sandman put your hands on your head
he does clasp your fingers together
now turn your hands over
beat in a moment a light will shine in your eyes
walk into it jessica first then you sandman
you will have to stoop but dont unclasp your hands
do you agree
jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark
then suddenly in front of her a blindingly bright narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely
jessica moves forward
even she has to stoop
logan is close behind
as he bends awkwardly into the opening the light goes out
as he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side pulling her with him
the move fails
both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass silver spear points pressed against them
logan is unable to draw his gun
hold still sandman or die where you are
is she the one
other voices like angry stage whispers she betrayed us
kill them both
jessica you sold us
logan and jessica stand rigid against the spear points only their heads turning to the echoing sibilants
the spotlight goes off
in the darkness we see the glass silver spear points are glowing all around them the long shafts falling away into darkness the points steaming gently when they touch making
an instant wincing burn
logan moves a spear point presses he flinches
im a runner
she brought me here because i begged her to help me
he turns his palm
the red crystal blinks impressively in the darkness
at the sight a babble of sounds
no sandman ever ran
you dont run
you kill runners
you have killed runners all your life
yes i have
beat now its my turn
and i want to live
another angry murmur of voices
over it jessica suddenly jessica shouting whats the matter with you
hes a runner hes blinking
we must help anyone who asks
we must or were the same as they are deciding who lives and dies
one of the points lifts and touches jessicas cheek
a quick fierce burn
she shrieks a tiny sound and is silent
reacts fiercely spinning against the spear points he is jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get jessica closer shielding her with his body
but the spear points are too much
he subsides as voices rise angrily kill him now
suddenly a ringing alarm
all sound stops at once and we hear a clatter of footsteps down the iron stair and across the outer floor
the spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber straightening into the light hair dishevelled hands in front against the glare
holly new you
docs dead and the sandmen came
voice gentle holly holly
remember the code
the code please holly
holly hysteria they smashed everything and i barely got away
she lowers her hands and we see her tattered frightened the bright smile strange
she comes to herself a bit looks to the side and sees logan and jessica pinned against the wall
she reacts with fear at the sight
the first sandman
no holly wait
tell them the rest
holly suddenly exhausted hes the one
he was in a hurry
just a face job
dark hair i said
then he killed doc and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and i ran
i ran holly
the other sandman
remember the one who came after holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid
holly pouring it out thats right
the other one came after
the older one
smashing killing burning
jessica coaching desperately and he was hunting the first one this one
this one was running the other one was hunting him
holly remembers yes
to logan he was after you
the spear points are withdrawn
logan and jessica relieved but shaken wary
may we move
a long beat
then i saw we pass them through
somebody help holly
other voices mumble agreement
holly moves off into the dark room hands reaching out to help her
just go straight ahead
follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end
then use the key
as the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter we see were in some kind of large underground chamber some part of
the vast undercellars of the city
the light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room reds and greens both but all are silhouetted no face seen
theres a kind of aisle open down the rooms center and its obviously the way they are to go
logan and jessica move off
i dont know who you are
id like to thank someone
it doesnt matter who we are
follow the tunnel to the end
i will there be someone to tell us where to go from there
a murmur of discussion then someone will follow
when you come to the lock he will tell you how co go on the other side
jessica may go with you as far as the lock
a deep breath no
jessica goes back now
take her back
suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her now
go on back
back outside jessica
she is bewildered by the change
im going with you
only to the lock
after that theres no way back
jessica small voice i dont care
im going to sanctuary
a babble of voices
she ignores watches logan
jessica contd will you take me with you
youre still a green
jessica shakes her head
she doesnt know why
logan puts his arm around her marveling trying to understand moved
but suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment
he wheels pulling her with him
come on then theyll be here any minute
uncomprehending she starts to run with him
an explosion shakes the chamber the wall bellies inward and a group of sandmen led by francis burst into the room firing as they come
people running screaming the alarm bell ringing ringing as sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage of the room
as the brief one sided battle rages echoing shots and screams in the dust filled room logan pulls her down out of the way
they watch helplessly
suddenly the figure of a sandman looms before them
he stares at logan unsure
logan reacts draws fires
the sandman is smashed away burning
suddenly aware that he has killed a sandman
jessica pulls him down again into the shadow
neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room
francis quartering the room like a hound searching searching stopping as he sees the crystal blinking red eerie in the darkness
believing the blinking crystal is jessicas logan
i know youre in here
whatve you done
gone crazy over a runner
whispering nobody knows except me
you know i wont say anything
i should have turned you in but i couldnt
come on out with me
itll look like youre part of the group that hit this nest
youre a sandman
slightest beat logan
after the slightest beat logan fires and francis falls a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and logan all vision obscured while explosions and screams continue
as he pulls her shakily to her feet
she nods shes okay
he leads her off down the tunnel
following the tracks
the way leads down curves recurves but always down
as logan and jessica rush toward it
the corridor has widened into a kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense submarine hatch
the tracks run straight to it and beneath it
the base of the door tands in a couple of inches of water
with great urgency logan and jessica examine the huge door
logan gives the wheel a tug
sound a whirring like clockwork
a metallic bell sound and then a runner this is the last gate
use your key now
when the bell sounds again
use your key
good luck runner
may you find sanctuary
then the bell chime sound and a light illumines the center of the wheel where theres a kind of keyhole
the whirring continues for about ten seconds
then it stops and the light goes out
hearing a sound they turn and see far behind them in the wet glisten of the tunnel a bobbing light and shadow the sound of running as jessica takes the
ankh from her neck fumbling with the chain
jessica breathlessly every key only works once
and only a lastday key must open this door
they said it would fit but
she tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one but her hand shakes
logan tries to steady her and in helping she drops it into the dark pool of water
they fall to their knees searching desperately
then logan remembers
wait i have the one i took from the runner
sound the same as before as logan searches his pockets for the runners ankh
logan finds it just as the whirring sound has stopped again
and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel
as logan and jessica wait for the sound etcetera to repeat again another tremendous explosion is heard rocking everything
in the distance jessica can see the shadow of a figure approaching
as the sound etcetera repeat s once more
logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel
the ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens
there is a hesitation
in which logan turning his head back
realizes what he has done and is shaken
as the shadowed figure looms larger theres no turning back is there
logan turns and pushes jessica through the door
as the door closes and they are now they can still hear the sound etcetera for the last time
beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which food was raised and harvested
what we see is an endless shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting the huge
the levels are multiple and everything is slimed rusted rotted and wet
in the tanks themselves are shoals of fish gardens of seaweed etc
the machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to rust and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and gear the kind of stuff cousteau
are using now
footing is dangerous a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow
from an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness
as he arrives at the door the ankh glowing as before
but francis has a light
he examines the door with it and as it lights the pool of water on the ground it picks out jessicas ankh
francis stoops gets it and looks from it to the one glowing bewildered uncertain as their eyes adjust to the dim light
finally logan gestures this way and sets out
note the action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth
they go along gripping a rail where possible sometimes sinking deep into water sometimes rising above it
they run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall
making their way along the walkway side by side
stopping as the walkway disappears under water
logan wading in while she waits until he re emerges
choosing between diverging ramps
having to return
how do we know this is the right way
its the only way
pov an alley way full of machinery
logan gives a wheel a half turn great rusty net combs start to winnow the water
helping jessica logan slips
falls into darkness
jessicas fear until he emerges hand over slimy hand
the water is cold
pov ancient signs protoplank
depot no do not decant
what do you suppose this was
some kind of breeding pens
they say people used to breed animal s fish anything at her disbelieving look to eat of course
shudders to kill things and then eat them
it must have been a savage world
logan shrugs but the idea makes him queasy too
they stop tired
peer through at the wreckage of a small inspection vessel and suddenly hear sound footsteps coming halting water sloshing
logan alert stay here while i see what it is
jessica nods frightened
logan slips off into the darkness
in a moment hes back
his face is grim
its francis isnt it
trying to move faster now logan makes a wrong turning and they must go back
but as they do so francis is ever closer a gigantic distorted shape now visible through the eerie glass then suddenly seeming small and distant
as they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall suddenly looming huge gun drawn apparently only a few feet away
logan desperately claws at machinery succeeds in starting motion somewhere what sounds like a generator begins laboring ancient machinery groans
they turn and run as they hear francis distorted echo etcetera is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see the door a waterlock with a wheel
as the light passes logan heaves desperately on it
it starts to give as the light comes back and they are revealed
aiming at logan
then slowly moving his hand until jessica is in his sights
francis fires tremendous sound echoing and resounding
one of the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over everything
through it logan manages to get the door open and pushes a half drowning jessica through
a sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning when the waterlock door closes
logan slumps to the floor
moving at an extremely high speed
we can see the outside flickering dark light dark light
and finally to a white color
they lie slumped motionless
finally it stops
the door opens into a kind of glistening darkness suffused by a bluish glow
it is now very cold
in the silence logan stirs
groping he touches jessica who moves close to him
logan puts his arm around her and they rise
slowly tentatively he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves
what little light there is seems to come from the left
arm around jessica logan starts to move
jessica whispering im afraid
its brighter there
besides we cant go back
he starts to move again but jessica hangs back
jessica contd i dont know whats going to happen to us logan but a beat are you glad you didnt kill him
it doesnt make any difference anymore
youre really one of us now arent you
you knew that i wasnt before didnt you
jessica nods why did you stay with me
jessica feelingly i wanted to
logan puts his arms around her and you
what made you kill sandmen
i had to
i did kill
for the first time in my life i killed
because you felt like a runner didnt you
i guess so
i know i felt something i never felt before
and i didnt like it
not a bit
after another long beat ill tell you one thing
sanctuary better be worth it
thats the last place for me to live now
logan mouths us
a strange word
and why not
in the last minutes he has done strange things
ice cavern suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side and revealing for the first time where they are
x angle before them a vase dim ice shrouded storage area row upon endless row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness their legends and contents unreadable in the thick
covering of ice and frost
to the side a bright light
x logan and jessica walk toward the light
x with logan and jessica we see a huge high domed cavern ringed and ornamented with extraordinary ice sculptures they are everywhere otters fish a tusked walrus overhead a flight
x another angle as they look in wonder overwhelming isnt it
logan and jessica turn and see box is half man
from the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables
one hand is a cutting tool
his head is half flesh
his legs are a chrome pedestal
are you too startled
am i too removed from your ken
slightest beat im neither machine nor man
but a perfect fusion of the two
and better than either
with great pride no human sculptor could match this greatness
dont you agree
all right what are you
box laughs your turn
its incredibly beautiful
ah but wait for the winds
then my birds sing
my walrus breathes
my palace chimes and bells
and the deep grottoes whisper my name
logan after a beat were hungry do you have anything to eat
anything to eat
box starts to laugh
he is roaring with laughter as jessica quietly were human and were hungry
box still laughing i know
this place is a link to sanctuary isnt it
box looks totally confused
logan angrily how do you think we got here
you walked in
i saw you
dont you remember
logan contains his anger
logan beginning again quietly where do you think we came from
we were sent here and you know it
others have been sent here
where are they
box looks around the cavern box mischievously hiding
where do we go
up a notch where do we go from here
we hear a noise outside
is that the wind
smiling not yet
slightest beat you must hear my birds sing
you know about sanctuary
i know you do
you have to help us
you dont have a choice
it isnt your decision
never a pair
i have never had a pair
where do you send them
youre a beautiful pair
ive never seen humans whom i thought worthy of being here
a beat id like to sculpt you
looking around where would i put you
smiling i know
youd be the base of the column
youd hold up my world
logan exasperated answer the question
do you know how long all this will last
not thirty years
or thirty thousand years
but thirty thousand thousand years
and youll be part of it
ages will roll
and youll be here
the two of you
logan to jessica there must be somebody else up here
i cant believe that hes box interrupting his voice tone changing very lucid let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone
slightest beat how do you want us
imagine a pair
logan starting to take off his clothes as jessica hesitates logan smiles itll be all right
box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs
logan helps jessica up to the pedestal
as they stand there how do you want us
box beat up there
logan looks at jessica
her beauty is glowing in the lamplight
logan takes jessica into his arms
is that what humans do
by this time logan and jessica are no longer listening to box
their arms are enveloping one another
with strong feelings
as his metal hand begins to buzz
he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern
as he works furiously
at incredible speed oblivious to box
their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another
box stepping back done
before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately
their mood is broken by done
logan and jessica break
they turn and see box has captured them perfectly
shimmering with life
filled with emotion
there are tears in jessicas eyes as she reacts to the sculpture
jessica squeezing logans hand its glorious logan helps jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress
now you keep your bargain
box rapt by his work wait for the wind
wait and hear the birds sing over you
logan only interested in getting out were ready
box mumbles as he leads logan and jessica toward the rear of the ice cavern
as box enters followed by logan and jessica
this room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide
it stretches back as far as the eye can see
the ice along the left wall is frosted
but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear
and embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are standing in erect positions
at first it appears that they might be more of boxs perfect works of sculpture
but as logan and jessica examine them closely through the clear ice
it is soon apparent that they are real people
who have been frozen
horrified as they move slowly along the wall
we can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm of their right hands
logan walks to the end of this wall
each frozen body has a number above it
the final bodys number is
that number which the voice in sandmans headquarters revealed as the number of missing runners
the camera pans logan back to box
as logan turns toward him
logan stupefied how did they get in here
regular storage procedure
the same as the other food
the other food stopped coming and they started
what other food
fish and plankton sea greens and protein from the sea
pointing to the frosted ice wall its all here ready fresh as harvest day
fish and plankton sea greens and protein from the sea
and then it stopped coming and they gesture came instead
so i store them here
and youre ready
its my job protein plankton grass from the sea logan pulls out his gun
tell us how to get out
or i ll destroy you
ill kill you
the same loud roaring laugh we heard earlier
then box calmly such a beautiful pair
ill stand you facing one another
box starts his saw hand buzzing
he turns all the flesh parts of his body away from logan and starts advancing toward him and jessica who is now standing behind logan
box is now like an armed vehicle
the fire reflecting harmlessly off boxs metal frame
box advancing resign yourself
as logan fires again and again
to no avail
as logan and jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and advancing we can see person after person
embedded in the clear wall of ice
a strange mute audience to this to the death drama
finally reaching the rear wall of this room as relentlessly moving toward them
seemingly pinned back against the rear wall
logan is firing his gun futilely with his right hand
while moving his empty hand against the rear wall
trying to find a knob or button which might open it
the entire time he never takes his eyes off getting closer
the saw is buzzing loudly
box chilling tone i make such a small quick incision
you can hardly feel it
against the rear wall
we can see
but they cannot
that above them
on the ceiling
there are a number of exposed cables
box is practically upon them
as he lunges forward with his whirring saw hand logan pushes jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her
box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as logan shoots at box from the floor level
trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body
he misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling
there is an explosion
box looking up screaming no
box rushes past logan and jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures
box still screaming all my work
all my work
as logan and jessica stand x angle the refrigerant coils bursting open discharging great streams of gases
x logan seeing the effect shooting again and again at the ceiling and walls
x another angle coils bursting everywhere vapor billowing into the cavern
x another angle huge slabs of ice instantly loosening crashing over
x full shot as the effect multiplies ln the hissing vapor sculptures crashing over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing
x box careening around wildly in the growing ruin as the lights dim and flicker out
the ceiling full of birds loosening crashing down upon box
again and again like great spears and wedges buried in his work still feebly moving then still as the roaring ice crashes down in the terrible darkness
cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks saved only by being in an angle of the cave
the screen blotted out by the cave in going out of focus
then sound ice melting water running
stir in the dimness amazed to be alive
sound a heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into the water
as it falls the cave is suddenly illuminated again
they look and see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall opened by the last ice fall
water rains across the opening
logan and jessica make their way to it step out
water is pouring down in a waterfall from the icemelt
they are blinded by as logan and jessica shield their eyes
then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away standing together
in fear of the sunrise
is there something on fire
logan shakes his head
he doesnt know
as logan looks up at the sun
it seems to be moving away
clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge
suddenly a fairly strong wind starts blowing
jessica frightened whats that
it feels like breath
it makes everything move
your hair is moving
jessica smiling and yours
they reach the level below and pause look around
jessica we must be outside
she looks at him uncertainly he puts an arm around her and they set out again
picking his way through the ruined cave puzzled
as logan and jessica reach it
they are startled by the sound of birds singing for a moment
then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched etcetera
a swarm of insects attack
logan and jessica fight them off jessica starting to panic i hate outside
i hate it
logan holding her comforting tone well be all right
a beat we will
the sun is starting to go down
as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass
startling them for a moment
coming out through the fissure in the rock squinting at the unexpected light from the sky then setting out as logan and jessica did
they come upon bushes of berries
logan picks a few looks at them and smells them
as he is about to put them in his mouth
jesslca grabs hold of his hand
sooner or later well have to try something logan eats the berries
as jessica watches intently
after a beat theyre good
logan and jessica pick berries and eat
when they are finished its getting dark and cold
why dont we rest here
we know we can eat these
they sit on the ground
sitting on the ground
jessica is shivering
logan has his arms around her trying to keep her warm
where do you think that heat ball went
do you think everythings going to turn to ice
i doubt it
dont ever let go
after a long beat it all seemed to make sense until box
do you think he was telling the truth
jessica trying to convince herself maybe were the first ones to get through
hopeful tone maybe sanctuary is near now
another protected place
it couldnt be outside
logan grunts how would anyone know
even if we find it we can never go back
at her stricken look
logan touches her in a caring way
it must be near now
well find it
jessica yawning closing her eyes resting on his shoulder thirty thousand years didnt last very long did they
looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun drawn
suddenly a rabbit darts by
francis jumps up in great fear and starts firing his gun
blasting the rabbit to smithereens
he is breathing hard fear
and looking around
gun in hand
walking in the hot sun
his face still betrays a wild frightened look as he moves very cautiously
he reaches the bushes of berries and sees some of them on the ground
he picks a few off the bush
too frightened that they might be some kind of poison to eat any
as he angrily crushes the berries in his hand
then wipes his hand on his trousers seeing shimmering in the distance
they walk toward it
they rush to it
and as they embrace in the water logan
logan turns around no
logan looks at his palm
the blinking crystal is clear
he grabs jessicas hand and looks at her palm
jessica quietly what does it mean
logan trying to assimilate its meaning himself the lifeclocks have no power outside
jessica takes logans palm and kisses it
jessica with laughter you can have any woman in the city
what do you really want
logan straight you know jessica
a beat but i still have the choice
then the answers yes
they embrace there in the water
coming out of the forest
climbing up a green hilly area
reaching the top and seeing the monument rising up out of a tangle of forest other buildings gleaming half hidden
in the foreground logan and jessica walk toward monument
walking toward camera to edge of swamp they stop and look at exiting camera right toward memorial climbing steps of memorial toward statue
logan and jessica walking up steps toward camera
they pass between two columns and exit camera right
logan and jessica walk toward statue l r
they stop and look up
looking up at statue
looking up at statue
i have never seen a face like that before
it must be the look of great age
whoever he was he was terribly old
jessica beat yes do you think thats why he looks so sad
they turn start to exit from memorial
logan and jessica exiting
they walk through pond toward capitol
logan and jessica walking past gravestones
as they pass the stones logan glances at them
they all have names and numbers on them
i wonder what they are
what can all that mean
just then their attention is focused by a distant sound as of shouting a mans voice
logan shakes his head
they exit cemetery toward capitol
logan and jessica walking up steps toward building
walking up the steps
many of which are cracked
they are proceeding with great caution
as they enter the capitol building
logan and jessica enter the ancient room
they stop and look around
sound hammering noise irregular
it stops after a bit
they walk to the door and open it cautiously
they exit right
logan and jessica walking down corridor left to right
the sound continues
logan and jessica as logan opens the aged door
react then they enter senate and stop and look
there are hundreds of cats
and thousands of books all over the place
jessica frowning whispering look at his face
and his hair
grimacing is that what it is to grow old
logan still stunned it could be
there are a couple of cats on the mans lap as he turns and faces logan and jessica
when he hears them move closer
the man is stroking the cats calmly
unperturbed by the appearance of logan and jessica
how old are you
as old as i am i suppose
your hair is white
it wasnt always
i remember when it wasnt
but it wasnt your color either
looking at jessica or yours
i have my color somewhere
those cracks in your face
do they hurt
could i touch them
jessica walks up to the man and touches his face
whats your name
its been so long since ive used it
logan and jessica exchange a quick glance
feeling they have come upon a nutsy fruitsy cupcake
but all of my cats have names
is that what theyre called cats
yes cats of course
what else could they be
of course each one has his own name too
but there are so many of them
do you know each one separately
yes indeed everyone
actually they all have three
reciting the naming of cats is a difficult matter
it isnt just one of your holiday games
you may think at first im mad as a hatter when i tell you a cat must have three a beat an ordinary name and a fancy name
do you want to guess what the third one is
logan and jessica are silent
old man reciting again but above and beyond theres still one name left over and that is the name that you never will guess the name that no human research
can discover but the cat himself knows and will never confess
reaching down and stroking another cat will you my pet
one of the cats jumps off his lap
old man reciting why did you go little fourpaws
you forgot to shut your big eyes
the man closes his eyes for a moment then i have a gumble cat in mind
as the man opens his eyes how long have you been living here
for as long as i can remember
what kind of place is this
just a place i suppose
the man looks puzzled
how did you get here
i have always been here
are there any other humans
have any other people ever passed through
the man shakes his head
then but there may be a few around somewhere
what makes you think so
my parents thought so
mother and father
logan astonished mother and
you knew your mother and father
the man nods
and how were you grown
inside your mother
are you sure
mother and father said so
where are they
jessica not knowing what it is buried
as he hears the noise of a door squeaking slightly
as it opens a bit wider coming through the opening did he push it
old man pleased reciting gus is the cat at the theatre door
his name as i ought to have told you before is really asparagus
thats such a fuss to pronounce that we usually call him just gus
may i see your hand again
logan and jessica extend their left hands
the old man takes them looks from one to another with delight
may i have one too please
no im sorry
its not possible
old man offended it isnt fair
ill give you one of my favorite cats
a jellicle cat
reciting jellicle cats have cheerful faces jellicle cats have bright black eyes they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise
im sorry but i dont have anything to give you
as the man continues to look petulant jessica simply sincerely thats the truth
jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man
here you can have this
the man seems pleased
what kind of jewel is this
i dont know
youre both full of secrets like macavity
looking at the ring did you steal this
reciting macavity macavity theres no one like macavity there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
whats beyond this place do you know
no no no did your mother or father ever mention another place
never never ever
after a pause may we stay here for a while
wed like to rest
of course you can stay
this belongs to the people
what belongs to the people
all of it
i dont know
but it does
the man stands
and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining room
ill be right back
stopping oh yes
about the cats
one rule is true reciting dont speak till you are spoken to
the man smiles and leaves
logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down
jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it
logan is deep in thought
jessica looks up from the book
jessica quietly how curious people used to be all these books
until that sweet madman how could he come to exist
he had a mother and father and he knew them
one in a million i suppose logan and jessica together smiling who knows
jessica after a beat were going on arent we
shaking his head theres nothing to go on to jessica
logan continues to shake his head through jessicas following line theres a sanctuary
you want there to be one
jessica interrupting urgent tone there has to be
i know it exists
it has to
logan gently no there doesnt
not really just so many want it to exist
so many who dont want to die
want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes real
but it doesnt exist
it never existed
just the hope
jessica becoming hysterical youre wrong
it has to be
it just has to be
as logan takes her in his arms
comforting her the man returns with a portrait in hand
oh my dont cry
the man proudly shows them the portrait
which is a portrait of himself in his twenties
he sort of brushes the hair
which is rich auburn
old man gesturing there are larger pictures of other people over there
i dont know who they are
perhaps theyre family
she man leads logan across the chamber to a far corner
remaining near the podium
she is dejected
logans argument that there is no sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold
x the corner logan and the old man we see portraits of presidents of the united states
we can recognize all of them
with the exception of the dozen or so that come after ford
as logan looks at the portraits he recognizes lincoln
thats the same fellow whos outside
if he was so important why isnt he first
the old man shakes his head
as francis suddenly appears alongside her
jessica is terrified
francis glances across the chamber sees logan
when he speaks it is softly but urgently
what did you do to him
jessica is silent
francis tone becomes increasingly sexual
grabbing her do you know you ruined him
do you know that
can you tell me why
a beat and now youve killed him you know
francis starts to tear off her clothes
obviously to rape
but his expression remains cold and without passion
jessica screaming logan
as she screams francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her x logan hears the scream wheels sees nothing for a moment
logan looks up
and we see francis crouched behind the railing of the first row of the gallery
with his gun pointing down at logan holding the terrified jessica with his other arm
old man cheerfully how nice
francis emotional disjointed thoughts we had such good times together
i let you go
frenzied you didnt terminate a runner and i let you go
a beat she did this to us
how could you let her
an ordinary available
with this he flings jessica down and away
she lies there
stunned and what about logan and francis
a tear in his eye why didnt you chink about them
up a notch theres over two hundred years of sandmens blood in you logan
and now youll spill it for a stinking runner
holding up his right palm
look at your palm francis
looking at his palm
dropping his gun
it falls on the why did you do that
i didnt do anything francis
theyve made us believe that
francis interrupting wild why did you do that
francis leaps from the gallery and falls on logan
scattering in all directions as in hand to hand combat punching
wrestling jessica deeply disturbed
the man enjoying himself as if logan and francis were putting on a show for him
francis manages to pick up a chair and smashes it down on logan
as logan slumps to the floor and francis cries to follow through his advantage by crushing logans face with his foot c
logan grabs francis foot and twists it
sending francis reeling backward
standing logan grabs a table and hurls it at francis
francis sees a steel flagpole with an american flag that has sixty one stars and takes hold of it
francis moves toward logan
with the menacing steel flagpole in front of him
logan is wary
watching every movement of the steel pole
francis swings the steel pole twice
we can hear the whish whish as it cuts through the air
with logan avoiding the blows
on the third swing
logan grabs hold of the steel pole and swings around on it
kicking francis in the chest
francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward
francis and logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment as logan crashes the steel pole which he is now holding down on francis head
francis crumbles to the floor
feebly he raises a hand toward logan
logan touches francis hand and francis grasps his wrist holding death off with the strong grip
francis delirious that was the right shot look out there hes trying to break free watch it logan steady now
his eyes focus briefly and he sees logans palm the crystal shining clear and white
francis is suddenly radiant
and he is dead
direct cut to the man walks over to francis and bends down
rubbing his face with the palms of his hands
we ll have to bury him
what s that
they re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living
logan s eyes are glistening with tears
the man starts out
i ll make the arrangements
jessica softly at least it s over
jessica s words don t help as logan shakes his head
then are you ready to put him in
the man sits down
gently logan lifts francis body
trying to straighten him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the floor
after resting francis body on the floor again
he cradles francis head in his arms
vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night
as they look down at francis body
in the open grave
jessica watches as logan and the man start shoveling dirt into the grave
starting to fill it
quietly watching on logan sleeping jessica and old man in a spirited but soft conversation in a far corner
as logan wakes he hears of course
thats settled then
but just you remember your promise
but thats a long time off
she sees logan awake and listening crosses to him smiling
logan rises to her
what are we promising him
what can we possibly give him
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes
logan beat we cant
were going back
im going to try and tell people what weve seen and jessica interrupting youre lying
youll never have the chance to tell anybody anything
youll be killed the moment youre seen
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them
things wont change
you know that
we can live here together logan
have a life as long as his
logan showing his palm things change
you want to go back to kill is that it
now youll want to kill your own
killings all you ever
logan shakes jessica who is becoming hysterical
logan softly jessica
listen to me
listen to me
as she quiets down the lifeclocks made me kill francis
they make people die or be killed every day
if i didnt try and destroy that
i couldnt live here or anywhere
do you understand
i want to be alive and with you thats all i want
logan puts his arms around her
the old man comes to them wondering
what a pity
i was hoping youd be here to bury me
come with us
where are you going
to a city with thousands and thousands of people
thousands and thousands
as many as my cats
and all alive you say
yes i would like to see that
is it a long journey
again logan nods
old man mumbling thousands and thousands alive
logan jessica and the old man are walking
with the capitol building blurred by overgrown foliage receding in the b
of the the old man has picked some wild vegetables
and hands a piece to logan and a piece to jessica
as they hesitate
the old man bites into it
as logan and jessica start eating it too old man marveling tone never see the sun or the moon
i hope we get there soon
on logan jessica and the old man as they emerge from a small grove of trees and stand looking o
past camera behind a flicker of firelight
old man weary but enthusiastic is that really it
it doesnt seem very far
will we be there soon
we go on as soon as its light
jessica gently turning o
away but now im tired
lets go back to the fire
they turn the old man still marveling at the sight
night matte view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills
as the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground
thats better than gold when its cold
turning to old man tell me what do those words mean
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife
beloved is a word they used to stay together
they lived together all their years
jessica reading moved beloved son
a beat so people stayed together for that feeling of love
they would live and raise children together and be remembered
another beat i think i feel that way logan
can we be that way
logan facing jessica yes
you and i jessica
a beat and sanctuary
sanctuary is the right to live
but nothing less either
there is a long beat
then jessica snuggles up to logan
she is ready for sleep
jessica whispering beloved husband
logan kissing her beloved wife
as they walk the great glowing dome is visible in the distance
the old man marvels at what he sees
they walk on
walking up the beach toward the domed city
we get an idea of the scale
they appear as ants in front of redwood trees
the wave power inlet in f
they as they approach cautiously
they see waves pounding over acres of strange stepped construction
what does that water do
its part of the hydrogalvanic system
the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow
is it inside the city
a beat i dont know where
frowning i just took them for granted
logan takes jessicas hand its our only chance
the camera pans logan jessica and the old man down the strange stepped construction until they reach at the center of this immense water flowing construction of steps
after a beat jessica looks at the old man logan softly i know
after a beat to the old man were going to try and get in this way
i dont think you can make it
old man sadly oh
i did so look forward to seeing all those people
can you make it back
jessica kissing the old man goodbye
the old man watches logan and jessica dive into the pool and disappear
he bends and plays with the water in the pool for a moment
like a young child at a pond or lake
emerging from the water
it is a labyrinth of humming turbines automonitored cables and impulse collectors
logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit
xl out as the crowd is pouring in no
dont go in there
the crowd turns and looks up at on a high balcony in the great hall
looking down at them
you dont have to die
no one has to die at thirty
you dont have to blink out on lastday
theres no renewal on carrousel
you can live longer and grow old
ive seen it
shes seen it
there is an angry murmur in the crowd as logan continues logan holding up his palm see
the lifeclocks are a lie carousel is a lie
trying to grab logan
there is a struggle
some sandmen are knocked over the railing
but remaining sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues logan and jessica
the crowd cheers
and continues into carousel as it is the same area where logan received the original assignment to find and destroy sanctuary
in the rear
with the panel open
the sign reading blinks on and off
logan is dragged in by a number of sandmen
we see jessica too still groggy being held by sandmen in the b
of the shot
logan is placed on the chair in which his crystal was altered
a shaft of light glows on and he stiffens bound by it
as around him in the air a series of spectral greenish heads appear one after the other in response to questions
each of these heads is logan
each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds
as the real logan in the chair is questioned each of the heads answers in turn
they are each a part of his persona and his brain
logans voice a jewelry store
logan himself twisting in pain
the word negative appears on the screen
logans voice a creature called box all frozen all frozen
logan writhes in the chair
again the word negative appears on the screen
logans voice no
there is no sanctuary
the screen seems to shimmer
a third time the word negative appears on the screen
logans voice there is no sanctuary k
the screens glow increases
to an almost blinding light
starting to frighten the sandmen present
at the same time we see jessica coming out of her tranquilized daze
still in the sandmens custody
logans voice an old man without a crystal
but there is no sanctuary
now the screen is starting to spark
behind it we see the intermittent glow of overheated electronic components
and we see the word negative
once more on the screen but broken now
logans voice there is no sanctuary
now the noise and the light from the screen are peaking
and we can see the increasing fear of the sandmen
on the screen the word negative is beginning to shake
as the screen begins to shake
logans voice emanating from all of them there is no sanctuary
there is no sanctuary
the sign probability bursts
the six heads of logan go out
the noise and the light coming out of the screen increase as it begins to burst into showers of sparks and flame
straining twisting as the light above him bursts goes out in a puff of smoke releasing him
logan staggers to his feet in time to meet rushing in from the ready room to join the others who have closed in on logan one holding jessica
manages to get one of the sandmens guns instantly blasting him with it
in the noise and confusion the fight becomes general
a sandman fires back at logan misses the shot hits one of the lifeclocks which flares electrically ribboning out a great arc
instantly logan gets off a couple of shots at the other lifeclocks which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and discharges
the electrical discharges smoke and noise making great confusion
sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the machinery
logan firing methodically at the lifeclocks moving
stumbles over jessica prone in the smoke
helps her to her feet
crouched they make for the exit
sputtering its life out in strange predictive words
probability flashing on and off
flashing vainly through the eddying smoke and the fierce discharges which fill the great room
the battle is lost the smoke and noise overwhelming
they pick up their wounded and get out as best they can
sandmen rushing out through the gathering smoke and the flare of fire behind them
sandmen pouting out through smoke and fire effects
pushing through passers by herding everyone away from the scene
people getting the hell out of there
ad libs get away from here
the whole things going
through the smoke etc
the lifeclocks explode
the building explodes great geyser of flame shooting upward
the sound of the explosion creates panic
lights begin to flicker
the great red crystal lights fitfully on and off
people are panicking running in different directions
some pressing into carrousel for safety
as people run in there the red crystal glowing and sputtering the petals moving spasmodically
as people look the white crystal comes on begins spinning wildly bursting into strange lancing lights
a great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the crystals
now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges
people flee the scene of destruction
the panic is full people getting the hell out of there
people are stampeding like cattle all heading down and for the exits trampling each other in their fright
the city under the dome fitfully lit as the dome itself seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it as from a gigantic line storm
the lights in arcade flicker and go dim
the chandeliers in arcade swaying a couple falling onto the screaming panicky people
maze car station
people fighting to cram into cars
car lights go out
people turn and bolt in another direction
love shop pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each other in fear struggling to get away
great hall emptying the signs of panic everywhere
the great crystal a wildly spluttering electrical fire wrecking it
intercut with above making their way through cathedral out the dazzle chamber running o
past maze car station
running past power center
the dome of the city torn
lightning effects playing on the stunned people
who look up and see the starry heavens too as they stumble forward into the darkness
a wind begins to blow
where air had never stirred anything
there is a sense of wonder
hysteria is lessening
as the people find themselves moving through the crack
as they discover the fact that the crystals have disappeared from their palms
some are joyful
as they emerge from the crack in the dome at we can still see the fires in the b
of the shot as logan holds on to jessica
like gable onto jeanette macdonald at the end of san francisco
full of happiness and hope for the future
as people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped construction
we see the old man walking into the shot
logan and jessica run to him
he looks around
people start to gather
they have never seen a white haired old man in their lives
as people continue to gather around the old man
who couldnt be more delighted
logan and jessica are smiling
inviting people to touch him
and some do
yes he is an old man
yes they will all live again to be old men and old women
yes this is the world renewing itself once again
