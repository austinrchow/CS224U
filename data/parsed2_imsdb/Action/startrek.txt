written by roberto orci alex kurtzman november over blackness we hear a bach harpsichord concerto
and then a woman breathing hard straining harder and harder until finally we hear a newborn baby crying and we
the image is spectacular aglow in dusk light a beautiful baby just born held in a womans hands
it is being cleaned warm water runs down its face and body
tight on the midwife female s who holds and cleans the baby as it cries
another younger midwife can be seen behind her assisting with the pitchers of water
as she cleans the baby she says to someone off camera he is strong
the baby now calm gets swaddled
he is then gently held out to the new mother amanda grayson late s
an original beauty
she lies on a divan spent but eager to hold her first child
she tenderly takes the infant into her arms tears in her eyes mesmerized
she holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly hello
close on the younger midwife standing at the rear of the room
she raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks the baby is healthy
why does she cry
a beat then she is human
a distant quiet buzz and the elder midwife stands looking into the distance
and this is when we see for the first time that the midwife has pointed ears
the midwife moves away we push in on amanda who looks up for a moment clearly disquieted
a planet of massive tortured rock forms distant cities constructed atop and underneath them
a hover speeder in the mid ground kicks up dust backlit by the sun as it traces the horizon
we pan with it revealing a family home built seamlessly into a rocky mountainside
the speeder parks outside the home sarek late s a vulcan comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home
he moves to amanda and kneels
he looks at the child his child and says well done
she looks at him for a beat then says flatly with just enough rancor thanks
he regards her
knows hes in trouble your tone suggests disappointment
the science council required my presence for a session regarding dont do that
you knew i wanted you here
the vulcan midwives share a look
sarek glances at them
the two women excuse themselves
sarek reaches over touches a small touchpad the harpsichord music stops
he says clinically as you are aware the vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery
well traditionally im not the one giving birth
then i moved here to another planet to be with you
i needed you to be with me today
holding my hand and telling me im doing great even when im just
breathing the best i can
sad that she has to tell him this at all she just looks back at the baby finding comfort in his innocence
sarek considers this
he moves closer to her
whispers intimately you are correct
i should have been here
i am sorry
and with her free hand she pulls sarek closer and kisses him
and the two look at the baby
i had a thought
that we might name the child after one of our respected early society builders
his name was spock
she looks at the baby not immediately taken by the name
your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm
smiles touches his face spock
she looks at sarek spock it is
the child has your eyes
she pulls back the babys swaddling revealing his ears
she gently rubs the top of his right ear and it unfurls revealing a small soft pointed vulcan ear
and your ears
and off the image of this tiny baby half human half vulcan we
and over blackness we begin to hear an alarm sounding growing and the super three years later appears and finally the blackness is split by turbo lift doors opening and
we reveal that were on with urgency we move down a corridor with captain robau and our sensors havent made no sir it looked like a sense of the anomaly
lightning storm in the middle how far are we from the of space klingon neutral zone
kilometers but the vessel is not klingon sir its registry doesnt match any recorded profile shwish
the doors part and we enter the bridge of the ship a flurry of activity the massive ship they are approaching on the viewscreen
robau moves to the center then he asks report
turning to the ships first officer all american face swiveling in a console chair to face us sir new contact bearing zero three four
are they transmitting on any negative captain all frequency
communications appear to be shut down
hail the ship
whats the nothing even close sir
closest match on registry
robau moves to pitts any response
no sir hails met with silence
maybe theyre incapable any identifiable damage
negative sir but our readings seem confused confused
not only is the ship unregistered but even its construction materials seem unrecognizable
robau sits in the captains chair his eyes on the ship as they approach and we see it on the viewscreen the narada enormous and threatening
he doesnt even realize that he says oh my god
to himself boggled a lightning storm
to deck signal all departments first contact protocols
looks like we have someone new on the block
and in the endless vacuum of space and in total silence the kelvin appears as a dot coming to a stop in front of the gigantic black claw that is
the narada crew members are glued to their telemetry working consoles sir should we initiate an invasive scan
that could be seen as an act of provocation all readings passive suddenly a warning beep sir i have a reading theyve locked weapons on us
alarms blare lights go red as the narada fires a torpedo it heads for the kelvin then separates fracturing into a multi hit projectile officers scramble brace for impact torpedo
locked on us at degrees mark two incoming evasive pattern delta
a direct hit smashes several decks along the dish of the ship in the massive engine room a huge blast men go flying in the captain robau helps a fallen
crew member up from the floor then on his chair com
intercut with moving with the kelvins chief engineer our shields did nothing sir
never seen anything like it
weapons off line
main power at percent
as the crew regains their footing the first officer pulls himself to his console true fear in his eyes as he places an inter ship call its ringing his fear
grows with every passing ring then we intercut with a woman answers her communicator she lies on an exam table afraid and pregnant
this is winona
what was that whats happening
but the first officer is just relieved that shes still alive youre okay thank god where are you
medical bay i had a few close contractions im fine what was that
just sit tight stay there well be fine or maybe not theyre firing another captain
another narada torpedo it separates pieces hit the kelvin
chief engineer runs past us consumed by a sudden explosion
a female crew member running down the hall suddenly holds on as a hole is ripped in the hall and shes yanked out of the corridor the camera finally getting
sucked out too
life support failing on this is the u
kelvin decks seven through thirteen
attemping to reach starfleet we have confirmed casualties command on subspace
kelvin under attack by unknown aggressor
shields at eleven percent were our shields even up
ten percent that was like nothing ive were at nine
ever seen this ship can not seven
were dropping here
take another hit like that
all remaining power to forward shields
prepare the shuttles f and he stops
they all do
a fucking face is now on their viewscreen
a romulan face the first officer of the narada whom well come to know as ayel my commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease
you will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft
your refusal would be unwise
screen goes dead
all eyes on robau
and he feels them
a tense horrible moment
finally to the first officer walk with me
the first officer follows robau off the bridge and into as they walk briskly if i dont report within fifteen minutes execute general order
sir we could issue a mayday call to frightened but firm there is no help for us out here
if were going down were taking them with us you save as many as you can
robau heads into a waiting turbolift turns they lock eyes knowing what this means
finally youre captain now
and we realize this is george kirk jims father
all eyes on kirk as he enters moves to the captains chair
not a small moment
speaking his first words as captain lieutenant pitts
transfer robaus vital signs to the main view screen
in a moment robaus vital signs appear on various monitors his heart rate oxygen levels blood pressure all of it
a low pitched beepbeep of his heartbeat is now heard vitals on line
slightly awkward thank you
tilt down as the turbo lift descends we push in as the doors open and captain robau gets out moves quickly hurries down a shuttle bay catwalk robau enters a
shuttle lights blink to life
he moves to the cockpit starts the vehicle up computer initiate departure sequence
a loud hiss and the craft shudders as it disembarks sparks dripping from the ceiling everyone is motionless eyes on the monitors and were tight on george kirk the beeps
of robaus heart might as well be representing his own
he realizes hes sweating wipes his forehead as the shuttles pulling out of main bay sir
i want to see him floodlights please
two massive floodlights on the kelvins dish go hot and turn flaring out the lens landing on the shuttle as it leaves the kelvin heading toward the imposing narada
backlit by the distant floodlights robau remains steely eyed as he moves for the darkened ship nerves and robaus heartbeat quickens the tension they all feel his heart rates elevated
thats what he is
robau watches as he gets closer the beepbeeping heard over the sounds of the shuttle but then all we hear is the low pitched beepbeep as the small shuttle seems
to get swallowed up by the massive forward facing spires of the narada the distant floodlights creating eerie shadows everywhere
a gigantic iris door turns slowly opens and the shuttle enters the naradas main hangar the door closes and everyone is just motionless and silent
only robaus vital signs can be heard beeping away
georges eyes glued ahead tight on robau as he faces the shuttle door considering his fate
finally the shuttle door opens standing there are eight romulan guards brandishing weapons
he steps down
they grab him hard hes scanned frisked pulled along and we reveal the absolutely massive hangar the insane architecture of the interior of this dark wet dripping ship robau is
led into the enormous dark bridge
a dozen romulans at controls
robau does his level best to portray confidence as he is led up a walkway to ayel
behind him sitting silhouetted and motionless turned away and looking off is his captain
a presence always felt in this scene
this is nero
ayel touches a panel then throws an image into the air before robau
a rotating hologram of a unique looking spacecraft we will refer to it as the jellyfish
are you familiar with this craft
robau regards it
then who is your commander
silence then re nero is it him
you will speak only to me
then ask your commander what right he has to attack a federation vessel
that was hardly an attack
my commander will easily destroy your ship
if you do not respond to the question
robau considers the hologram again
and what his answer might mean for the fate of his crew
ive never seen it
or any ship like it
are you familiar with or better know the location of ambassador spock
ayel has thrown another hologram a floating rotating image of spock who appears to be earth years old
the baby born just three years earlier
robau is as confused as we are
i am unfamiliar with ambassador spock
a final question
what is the current stardate
finally hey where are you from
neros activated his staff four large bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
robaus vitals go dead
push in on kirk as a screaming alarm is heard theyre launching again
delta five maneuver
fire full spread
the kelvin banks as it fires wildly another torpedo blasting from the narada it separates some miss others hit
debris flies trough the ceiling slamming into a bridge support beam
green coolant spews from under the floor grating im initiating general order
set self destruct for maximum matter antimatter yield
two minute countdown
i want auto pilot targeted for their fuel cells
sir unable to locate the ships power source
then just target the damn thing dead center
we got bigger problems the first hit destroyed auto pilot
the only way were gonna ram that ship is to fly manual control
tight on george as this lands
more honorable than terrified then ill do it myself get to the shuttles now
no one moves until agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off kirk takes the captains chair hits the comlink all decks this is the captain speaking evacuate the
ship immediately get to your designated shuttle crafts move fast around winona in fucking labor now being transferred onto a wheelchair by the doctor and nurse repeat evacuate ship and get to designated shuttles thats georges voice now
were packing it up youll deliver in the shuttle
and shes on the move out the door as her communicator sounds she answers george
alone now on the bridge piloting this massive craft by himself george talks to winona from the captains chair i have medical shuttle standing by get to it now can
you do that
yes where are you
hold on george for a moment as he hesitates his eyes glued to the screens as he pilots im on my way
good and george its coming our baby its coming now
push in on him his heart shattering having to out maneuver incoming torpedoes piloting the ship to its doom still he forces optimism ill see you in a minute sweetheart
he disconnects another alarm he turns the ship fires the kelvin banks again its photons slamming into the oncoming crew members scramble to their shuttles as the ship trembles and
we find winona among them being pushed through the madness
the med team arrives with winona in the wheelchair its chaos and for winona a huge contraction agh
that was that was a big one
as they put her into the shuttle bed just keep breathing honey youre gonna be just fine through the pain the baby too right
the baby too
as george kirk pilots he checks the monitors one reads the seconds
and another reads impact proximity meters
another screen that shows stats of departing shuttles more leaving as we glance at the screen but shuttle remains the narada is growing in the viewscreen he hits the comlink
captain to shuttle is my wife on board
the pilot is readying the controls yessir she is i need you to go now dyou hear me
were waiting for you sir no go take off immediately
shuttle pilot works the controls and winona in the back feels the shuttle shudder wait
we cant go my husband isnt here yet
but shes suddenly wincing as another contraction hits youll need to push now are you ready
clamps holding the shuttle slam back the med shuttle drops hard fusion impulse engines ignite and the shuttle moves george hits comlink a tone then winonas voice the shuttles leaving
where are you
as george evades enemy fire heading for the massive alien ship my love
listen carefully okay
winona holding her communicator were about to have this baby sweetheart
im not going to be able to be there
and she just stares realizing whats happening that hes been made captain that there was an evacuation and somehow she just knows
tears come to her eyes no no no wait i want you to hear me
are you still on the ship
no theres no other way my no you need to be here love you know all i want george i cant do this all i want in the world is
to without you be with you crying now please dont d
but shes wincing again okay you need to push
and she does the shuttle banks and and the shuttle leaves the kelvin bay turning to join dozens of other shuttles all heading off in escape as george pilots dodging
incoming we intercut with winona pushing giving birth to their baby and were back and forth between a husband and wife that will never see each other again music swelling as the kelvin turns hard avoiding torpedoes the shuttle banking as the doctor and nurse help winona and were on george as he hears a baby crying and tears come to his eyes as he says hey
hey so what is it
its a boy
its a boy
and now we see winona handed this beautiful little boy
and she cries just looking at him tell me
tell me about him please hes hes beautiful he looks like you
heartsick george laughs glances at the monitors self destruct countdown is at t minus seconds oh god
george you should be here i know so what should we call him huh
we could name him after your father
are you kidding me
no thats the worst well name him after your dad lets call him jim
jim it is
through the viewscreen hes about to hit the ship angles within the enormous narada blades george scared now sweetheart
i love you
can you hear me
yes yes i hear you
i love you
i love y his voice cut off as the kelvin slams into the narada an explosion begins and georges voice goes static confusion washes over her face suddenly lit by
a bright glow she looks over with wet devastated eyes what she sees is the massive explosion quickly sucked away in the vacuum of space and shes crying holding her new baby who just lost a father his life altered forever
the shuttle sails away with the others
hold on this
for a long beat
then pan over to see neros ship tumbling silently through space debris still raining from the explosion mayhem alarms and crew work to stabilize the ship overlapping romulan dialog to
be written we arrive at nero who with small specks of human blood on his face just stares at the fucking hologram of spock hes obsessed
ayel works a monitor yelling out something in romulan to one of their men and as a result gargantuan blades extend from the ship like otherworldly sails and the ship
begins to steady but then another ship appears decloaking from nothingness a fucking klingon vessel then another and another and were on ayel as he witnesses on his monitor ships popping up all around them which is when they hear a voice speaking klingon and we subtitle trespassing vessel you have entered the jurisdiction of the klingon empire
power down and prepare to be boarded or you will be destroyed
eyes wide ayel turns to nero still staring at spocks image subtitled in romulan commander nero were surrounded
finally nero looks up
subtitled in romulan sir what are your orders
and we push in on nero as our music builds then we cut to close on a young vulcan boy
hes standing in an abstract space images projected and hovering questions that hes answering as they appear then disappear what is the square root of
one thousand five hundered forty eight correct
what is the central assumption of quantum everything that can happen cosmology
does happen in equal and parallel universes correct
identify the th century earth composers of the following musical progression paul mccartney and john lennon
correct and we find another vulcan child then another all in these odd spaces until we pull back wide to reveal a large vulcan learning center white bowls sunk into
the dark ground where professors walk hands behind their backs surveying this mass mental martial arts test
were on another vulcan child as she gets an answer wrong and the light over her bowl goes out
then another child who gets an answer wrong and his light goes out
an extremely wide overhead shot reveals bowl after bowl as the lights go out
until only one bowl remains
he finishes his last question
gets it right
push in on him as the computer says your score is one hundred percent
off his face we cut to moments later as spock collects his things
as he does three young vulcan bullies walk up behind him
spock glances at them then back to his things
i presume youve prepared new insults for today
your mother lies with many men
spock just nods
tries to ignore the fact that it stings
i have no such information
you are neither human nor vulcan and therefore have no place in the universe
swallowing that too this is your thirty fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me
logic dictates you would cease by now
he has human eyes
they look sad dont they
perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli
and bully pushes spock who stumbles back almost falling into one of the bowls
he looks up as hes a traitor you know
for marrying her
spock stares we see him fighting the urge but hes unable and he charges the bully and tackles him into the bowl
they land inside spock cries flailing as he punches bully
the other two stand atop the bowl stunned shocked unsure what the hell to do and we cut to tight on spock chastened sitting glumly on a bench
a massive vulcan city seen through the window behind him
his parents argue at a distance down the hall where im from when someone hits you you hit back how is that not logical
spock had no reasonable they pick on him they expectation of being tease him every day
physically injured which is precisely when reason must guide his actions i want him to embrace above all
vulcan you know that
but he has to be himself which means occasionally being his humanity is very the human
source of his ostracism
when vulcans get disgusted with each other they never just walk away do they
well humans do
and amanda walks away leaving sarek standing there
he turns sees his son down the corridor
and were pushing in on spock studying the fear in his eyes
his father stops in front of him looming there looking down stoically i did not mean to create conflict between you and mother
after a beat sarek seems to soften a little
no anger in his face
takes a seat beside his son
a beat emotions run deep within our race
in many ways more deeply than in humans
long ago they nearly destroyed us
that is why we followed the teachings of surak
now you must choose
between you and mother
never my son
but you may choose the ethic of logic
logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience
the control of feelings
so that they do not control you
they called you a traitor
then you suggest that i should be completely vulcan
and yet you married a human
sarek is clearly conflicted by this
but he holds steady as ambassador to earth my duty is to observe and understand human behavior
marrying your mother
spock seems disquieted spock
you are fully capable of choosing your own destiny
the question you are faced with
is which path you will take
this is something only you can decide
bam a door opens year old george kirk jr
angrily exits the house carrying a duffel
his angrier redneckier uncle frank following
year old jim kirk nervously pursues them go ahead go run away
you know i could give a damn
where are you going
anywhere but here far as i can get
which wont be far enough know what your problem is
big luggie spit no one ever taught you respect
how to follow orders
do as youre told
to jim what the hell are you doing
i i just dont want my brother to go
well i do and i asked you to wash the car
how many damn times do i need to repeat myself
how many damn times
a glare to george and frank walks off
jim nervously follows his brother pulling out a small floating disc please stay you can have my flo yo
george hits it away this isnt about toys its uncle frank
i cant take him anymore mom has no idea what hes like when shes not here dyou hear him talking like hes our dad
and thats not even his car youre washing
that was dads car
you know why youre washing it
because hes gonna sell it
dont leave okay
we can tell mom when she gets back from africa
shes gone for five more months by then ill be in a different system
sees fear in kirk youre gonna be okay
you always are
always doing everything right good grades and obeying every stupid order
then i cant be a kirk in this house
show me how to do that and ill stay
but jim can offer nothing
george gives him a quick hug and walks off
jim sadly watches his brother go
kirk washes a vintage corvette
red white top
dumping the sponge in bucket hes sadly cleaning his mind spinning over his brothers departure
and hes wiping the soapy passenger window sqeeeeeeak
with the sponge when he stops seeing the keys in the ignition
push in on his face as a devilish idea comes to his mind
pre lap a loud screech and we cut to young jim kirk behind the wheel note the sound of the engine is a metallic whir not a gas engine
tight on jims face as he drives having never done this before hes as nervous as he is determined the corvette speeds while inside the car jim turns on the
updated modified radio scans stations momentarily losing control of the car but hes back on track as he finds a hard rock song and hes starting to fucking love it piloting he reaches for a convertible roof latch then the other but with the speed hes driving the roof rips right off the fucking car jim glances back wide eyed and the roof tumbles through the air landing on the road and we push and arc around as a police officer runs out from taking a roadside piss he races back jumps on his hovercruiser and takes off back in the corvette bloopbloop
jims eyes dart to the rearview as the cruiser weaves behind him then pulls up beside him the cop sees a child driving and is amazed he calls through his
pa son you pull over that car
but jim just blasts the radio louder george bag over shoulder thumb out
he turns at the sound of the siren sees whats approaching
and the the corvette shoots past him jim at the wheel then the police hovercruiser
george runs into the middle of the road mouth agape no
back at the corvette jim yanks the steering wheel toward the cop who rises to avoid the corvette which screeches onto a perpendicular dirt road kicking up wild dust as
the cop arcs quickly to follow jim is now officially loving this and he drives through a fence crash
the cop races through it in the corvettes dust and we push in on a sign that reads danger quarry ahead iowa mining co
in fact we see the massive quarry hundreds of feet deep and tilt up to the corvette and cop speeding toward it kirk eyes intense almost suicidal this is where
hes been headed all along and for a moment we think holy shit this is how james kirk dies
he speeds toward the edge closer closer but at the last second kirk slams the brake the car skids pivots and he leaps from the car which sails sideways off
the cliff edge falling
the cop comes to quick a stop in clouds of dust as the corvette explodes the angry cop hops off his hovercruiser hand on weapon as jim kirk out of
breath exhilarated gets to his knees
whats your name son
and as he stands we push in on him low and wide damn if that kid doesnt have a swagger
its like the first time hes ever stood in his life
my names kirk
james tiberius kirk
and as our music builds we cut to constant shocks of light as an alien prisoner intelligent bi pedal but with four terrified eyes is slammed down onto the wet
pavement a choke stick shoved under his chin then voices
brutal guttural klingon you say they are not yours
whip pan to see the scary klingon guards four of them standing above the alien chilling masks hide their hideous faces and one holds a fluorescent set of pages these
federation maps we found in your pockets
and the alien speaks an unknown language all eyes wild i speak the truth
then who are they for
but the alien just shakes his head afraid he will not talk
so they grab him and yank him upward you would rather die then tell us
push in tight as the alien finally whispers terrified and the guards look at each other
seemingly with concern
moments later eight guards walk together and we pan with them to reveal the horrifying expanse that is the klingon prison yard
we realize that the constant shocks of light was lightning that apparently never stops here
a super reads rura penthe klingon prison asteroid
and we see theyre heading for a muscular figure using a sledge hammer splitting rocks lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes
boom up to find that its nero
and he stops sensing the coming guards
and he manages a small smile
and he quickly turns to them they all stop suddenly
afraid of him
one of them tosses nero a set of manacles
nero picks them up
puts them on
and offers his cuffed hands willingly
guards drag nero through the massive pyramidal structure
neros arms and legs get strapped in tight
go wide to reveal hes pinned to an interrogation table three guards
a klingon interrogator approaches looms over nero studying the romulans face with clinical detachment
i have come far to meet you
the one who does not speak
ten years is a long time to maintain silence
beat perhaps you simply do not speak klingon just as i do not speak romulan
english now but i assume we both speak the language of our common enemy
unless otherwise noted
he reveals a worn leather journal
opens it flips through it almost casually
we see sketches of the jellyfish ship pages of complicated math equations
we found this book in your cell
cartography mathematics what do these mean
this date here eleven years from now what happens then
holds up the and why attempt to smuggle in maps of federation space
neros face betrays nothing no fear no doubt
cold as fucking ice
the interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book a drawing of spock
he closes the book
when you were captured we assumed you were a spy sent from romulus to surveil the empire
but because the romulans deny your existence i believe you are much more than that
interrogator looks over to the guards nods
a guard approaches with some kind of glass container we hear something wet flip flopping around inside but we cant see what it is
your ship remains in orbit above us now
weve been asking for its secrets for too long
that is why i am here
we want to know how it works and i believe now finally
you will tell us
a guard uses tongs to pull out the most disgusting creature youve seen from the container a slug with suckers and spikes covered in a grimy muck it flip flops
their native planet is in constant sunlight
as a result theres nothing they hate more
a guard grabs neros head and forces it back the second pries his mouth open with his hands
another guard shoves the thing into neros mouth nero keeps his eyes open furiously determined not to be broken as they force him to swallow it he doesnt scream as
the wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his stomach they try to claw and bite their way out of any dark space theyre in
nero stares at the ceiling in horrifying internal pain but straining to block it out
push down on neros wide crazed eyes tighter as we slowly dissolve to see what hes seeing quiet
a waiting area
amanda spocks mother stands alone in a passageway
she looks off camera to her son spock come here let me see you
reluctantly spock walks into frame
she begins adjusting his collar
this is our adult spock
gripped by anxiety but trying like hell to look impassive
there is no need to be so anxious
youll do fine
i am hardly anxious mother
beat then anxiously and fine has variable definitions
fine is unacceptable
she just smiles as she works his collar
he sees this and it annoys him
he tries to move her hands away to stop with his collar his annoyance her love for him all sweet but he doesnt let go of her hands
a meaningful silence between them
may i ask a personal query
should i choose to complete the vulcan discipline of kolinahr
and purge all emotion
i trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you
she stares at him moved
touches his face
whoever you choose to be
you will have a proud mother
hold on mother and son worlds apart but forever bonded an imposing yet beautiful indoor atrium
spock stands before the vulcan high council
among faces on the dais his father seated beside the science minister and other vulcan leaders
you have surpassed the expectations of your instructors
your final record is flawless
with one exception
i see you have applied to starfleet as well
it was logical to cultivate multiple options
logical but unnecessary
you are hereby accepted to the vulcan science academy
a distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half human pupil
it is truly remarkable spock
that you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage
welcome to the academy
they all start to rise
but spock is suddenly unsettled if you would clarify minister what disadvantage are you referring to
your human mother
as the council disperses we push in on spocks face the same look he had when he took punches as a kid
he glances at his father to say something but sareks the consummate diplomat
his eyes command remain calm
then makes the first spontaneous human decision of his life council ministers
i must decline
a solid beat
confused looks turn cold no vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy
then as i am half human your record remains untarnished
you have made a commitment to honor the vulcan at the moment father i can way think of no greater way to honor our race than to attend starfleet as
its first vulcan
why did you come before this council today
was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel
i came with the intention of enrolling as my father wished
however your insight has convinced me otherwise
therefore the only emotion i wish to convey is gratitude
thank you ministers for your consideration
a contained fuck you live long and prosper
he looks to his father whose disappointment is evident still god bless him spock walks out push down a hallway music heard what seems like a party is going on
through windows in the double doors ahead and a woman swoops into view in front of us we push behind her in the short skirt and high boots as she enters the place a local busy bar the woman makes her way to the bar and we see her gorgeous dignified face
this is uhura
she leans into the bartender warmly her smile glorious hi
id like a klabnian fire tea two cardassian sunrises and three earth beers no slim shots anything on draft
thats a lot of drinks for one woman
wearing those boots
james kirks face leans in at hes charming witty dangerous rebellious
he grins at her flirty
uhura gives him a look then back to the bartender and a shot of jack straight up
to the bartender make it two her shots on me
her shots on her
thanks but no thanks
dont you want my name before you completely reject me
im good without it
damn he likes her already
you are good without it
long beat if you dont tell me your name im gonna have to make one up
no way thats the name i was gonna make up for you
they dont have last names in your world
uhura is my last name
they dont have first names in your world
wait let me guess
is it jim
that makes her smile
so he moves closer to her okay so youre a cadet
whats your focus
lemme guess you dont know what that means
let me guess study of alien languages phonology morphology syntax it means youve got a talented tongue
and for a moment i thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals
you think youre smart
oh baby im the smartest
something sad in that
a burly starfleet cadet appears
this guy bothering you
beyond belief but nothing i cant handle
you could handle me
thats an invitation
the burly cadet spins kirk around hey
you mind your manners
at ease cup cake it was a joke
like your hairline
uhura turns back
the other cadets seeing trouble approach
hey jim enough
what was that
you heard me moon beam
you know how to count farm boy
theres five of us
and one of you
okay so go get some more guys come back and itll be an even fight
the cadet swings his fist but kirk headbutts his hand breaking it another cadet punches kirk then throws him into a table which kirk flies over landing hard another cadet
grabs him pulls him up kirk slams five fast punches that send the cadet back when another cadet punches him yet another holds kirk and that last punch is repeated three then four times enough
another punch and kirk flies to the floor hes out of it but wont give up
the cadets unleash on him and really pummel him and kirks spirited but losing about to lose bad when an ear splitting whistle makes everything stop they turn standing in
the doorway is a tall rugged starfleet officer outside all of you
the cadets file out in for it
pike moves to a dazed semi conscious kirk now upside down on a table
whistle really loud yknow that
and kirk passes out
high wide overhead shot of the almost closed bar
only kirk and pike sit here at a table
kirks bloodied tissue in his nose
i couldnt believe when the bartender told me who you are
and who am i captain pike
your fathers son
then smiles for my dissertation i was assigned the u
something i admired about your dad
he didnt believe in no win scenarios
he sure learned his lesson
depends on how you define winning
youre here arent you
off kirks look that instinct to leap without looking that was his nature too
and in my opinion its something starfleet has lost
were admirable respectable
but overly disciplined
beat those cadets you took on theyll make competent officers but you can bet your ass theyll run home to momma the minute theyre looking down the barrel of a
klingon phaser cannon
why are you talking to me
i looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor
your aptitude tests were off the charts what is it dyou like being the only genius level repeat offender in the midwest
maybe i love it
so your daddy dies
you can settle for a less than ordinary life
beat or do you feel like youre meant for something better
and that just hangs there for a beat
because pike just hit a nerve
kirk does his best not to show it still absent mindedly fiddling with starfleet ship salt and pepper shakers
come to think of it i do want to feel special
you know what
im gonna go start a book club enlist in starfleet
you must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month if youre half the man your father was jim starfleet could use you
you could be an officer in four years have your own ship in eight
hes getting under kirks skin but kirk keeps up the tude grabs his jacket stands were even right
i can go
shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow
kirk turns pike grabs him your father was captain of a starship
for twelve minutes
i dare you to do better
and its now pike who stands and walks off
and thats where it hangs
off kirk brooding
corn stalks whipping by kirk on his spokeless motorcycle rocketing across the plains his souls been stirred and hes fighting it he cranks it electric engine screaming kirk pulls up
to us kills the bike
camera starts to move around him hes dramatically backlit and we come around for an incredible reveal of a shipyard at its center the skeletal frame of a new ship
unmistakably the u
unformed raw like its future captain
our music swells we push in on him considering pikes offer his future his fate
the shipyard is abuzz with activity cadets loading into a shuttle and pike staring off waiting
the pilot approaches waiting for something cap
he climbs in
the pilot rapidly flips through switches running a pre flight sequence
pike straps in
glances through the viewshield
and he smiles
from his pov kirk on his motorcycle driving into the shipyard hold her a second
kirk rides past a waterfall of cooling tanks stops the bike near the shuttle steps off has nothing no bags just the clothes on his back
nice ride man
kirk kicks the stand tosses the guy the startcard live it up
kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches pike
im gonna do it in three
pike grins as kirk passes him
inside the shuttle kirk moves down rows of new recruits some of them alien
passes uhura and the barfight cadets who perk up when they see him one has a bandaged hand
at ease gentlemen
then to uhura never did get that first name
cant help it a grin and you never will
he smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle
straps in as it rises
are you people deaf
i told you i dont need a doctor damnit
i am a doctor
kirk turns to see a man being forced out of the bathroom by a female flight officer at he has a southern lilt and looks like a prisoner waiting for
the guillotine to fall you need to find a seat i had one in the bathroom darlin with no windows sir for your own safety i suffer from aviaphobia siddown or i will make you case you dont understand big sit down
do you hear me
words it means fear of dying right now
in something that flies
they glare at each other then the man drops into the seat beside kirk
the ship torques to one side and the man grips his armrests pale sweating glances at kirk i might throw up on you
i think these thingsre pretty safe dont pander to me kid one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds solar flare might crop up cook
us in our seats hell some of the damn passengers are blue
and waitll youre sitting pretty with a case of andorian shingles see if youre still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness
i hate to break this to you but starfleet operates in space
yeah well my ex wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce i got nowhere to go but up
jim kirk you really gonna throw up
maybe as the trek theme soars the shuttle ascends and we
nero lies on the floor of his cell semi conscious looking like death
behind him the door opens
two klingon guards enter backlit
the day youve been waiting for is upon us silent one
no sign of salvation
no sign of change
just more pain
and they both lift his limp body up as something miraculous happens nero snaps to life and single handedly beats the shit out of the guards taking them both down
in ten seconds in what seems like an instant hes the only one standing here holding both of the guards rifles which he twirls badass
push in on the door as it opens ayel chained looks up intensely and sees that its nero who has arrived we push in tight on him as he speaks
for the first time the wait is over
off ayel we cut to tilt down from a glimmering building to reveal a sea of red cadet uniforms hundreds of cadets head across campus mccoy and kirk among them
a miraculous view of san francisco beneath a blue sky golden gate bridge piercing the air
kirk struts so youll do it for me right
i have no interest
i didnt ask if you have interest i asked if youd do it
im about to ask you an obvious question why bother
because ive failed the test twice
and youre determined to make it three
weve all failed it everyone has and thats the point
no one goes back for seconds let alone thirds its not like you need to pass it to graduate
so bones why do they make us take it
i told you to stop calling me that
youre very annoying
and youre the greatest thank you
youd better study for it this time
oh no bones i gotta date
listen as smart as you are which aint much if you dont prepare you have no idea how prepared im gonna be no idea
and with a smile kirk heads off mccoy watches him go calling after him seriously stop calling me bones
to himself hating it bones
in moonlight a beautiful woman lies on her back in some kind of bra moaning in delight this is gaila oh jim
jim i love you
kissing her yeah
i sent you a message
gaila reaches over turns on the light and we realize shes green
and not particularly happy i say i love you and you say i sent you a message
but you can only open it tomorrow at three oclock on the dot what are you talking about
what is it
what does it say
gaila promise me youre not going to open it till what is it
tell me what three it says
ill erase it i swear if you dont promise me youll all right
wait i prom theyre interrupted by a door opening gasp
sotto you cant get caught in this dorm hide
under the bed quick
kirk falls lands hard on the floor scrambles under the bed as gailas roommate enters uhura
dropping her backpack hey i thought you were going to be in the long range sensor lab all night
i was supposed to be but it was crazy i picked up an emergency transmission from a klingon prison planet there was an escape and a ship stolen from th
suddenly senses you okay
yeah been running simulations all week just catching up on some rest
fake yawn thats all
uhura watches her
her eyes narrow
were you running simulations with the mouth breather hiding under the bed
gaila freezes caught
uhura looks down kirk peers out
your hearing is scary you sure both your parents are human
the hell are you doing with him in here
i cant help it
i love him
gaila loves me get outta here its my ass too if administration catches you in this dorm
getting dressed to uhura you and i have a big day tomorrow pushing him out youre gonna fail
if i pass will you tell me your first name
quiet tries to charm i think the fact that you picked up a transmission of a klingon prison escape is very interesting
she closes the door on him and we cut to the narada appears through space dead silence on the bridge
all eyes on the viewscreens empty starfield roiling clouds of methane ice
we have arrived at the coordinates you requested
nero stands looks out through his view screens
ayel studies his console hope in his eyes
long range scans of beta quadrant complete
romulus is there
we could go
right now go home
not yet not like this
not how we left
this is our chance
to serve our people
we owe it to them to do what no other romulan could ever do
ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly a lightning storm impossibly from nowhere lots of it and through the lightning erupts the jellyfish the ship nero has welcome
and we wont know where we are as music builds and we cut to uhura turns to us at her comm station push in on her
she seems wildly bored and almost resentful we are receiving a distress signal from the u
the ship has lost power and is stranded
starfleet command has ordered us to rescue them
whip to the command chair where kirk captains the battered bridge
confident cocky starfleet command has ordered us to rescue them
she glares turns away
then mccoy at a console reports klingon vessels have entered the neutral zone
and they are firing upon us
mccoy and uhura and the others look at him confused
yeah dont worry about it
mccoy and uhura share a look thats when we cut to looking at the bridge from above we pull back to reveal an observation room above the faux ship
this is the test kirk was referring to
console technicians monitor the proceedings
a test administrator turns to another and asks did he say dont worry about it
whats he doing
and we continue to pull back to reveal that sitting among the technicians is gaila
our resident green girl
she checks her watch push in on it pm
on her monitor awaits a rd century e mail a message from kirk three more klingon warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship i dont suppose this is a problem either
theyre firing captain
alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship
and how do you expect us to rescue them when were surrounded by klingons
annoyed she does as our ship is being hit shields at sixty percent
should we at least i dunno fire back
of course not
close on gailas watch as it changes to and she opens jims message and all it reads is im sorry
and just then something uploads and executes and all the screens in here and on the bridge die the system crashes everyone reacts the hells happening
the crew doesnt know whats up except kirk who is remarkably pleased when the lights and monitors come back on things are not the same perplexed works controls the kobayashi
maru is still in distress
the klingons have stopped firing
prepare to fire on the klingon warbirds
jim their shields are up
mccoy looks at his monitor
no theyre not
fire on all enemy ships one photon each should do lets not waste ammunition
target lock acquired on all warbirds firing
they fire and destroy all five klingon ships instantly
all mouths here are agape
begin rescue of the stranded crew
weve eliminated all enemy ships no one on board was injured and the successful rescue of the kobayashi maru crew is underway
for the first time kirk looks up to the testing room windows anything else
and theyre stunned up here too test administrator turns to someone off camera how the helld that kid beat your test
reveal who he was talking to spock is here
and not happy
i do not know
tight on a stern starfleet academy president james t
its a huge starfleet chamber
golden gate bridge visible through huge windows
cadets a nervous kirk among them
he stands moves to one of two podiums
an incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body
academic immorality by one is an assault on us all
cadet kirk evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation
of the starfleet code
is there anything you care to say before we begin
uncomfortable beat yessir
i believe i have the right to face my accuser directly
president nods toward the assembly
he and kirk meet eyes for the first time
its clock stopping
step forward please
this is commander spock one of our most distinguished graduates
hes programmed the kobayashi maru test for the last four years
spock steps up to the other podium
it is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub routine in the programming code thereby changing the conditions of the test
we happen to find gaila in the crowd fucking pissed
your point being
in academic vernacular you cheated
to deceive by trickery
now let me ask you something i think we all know the answer to the test is rigged isnt it
you programmed it to be unwinnable
kirk i dont see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings
because if im right sir then the test itself is a cheat
your argument precludes the possibility of a no win scenario i dont believe in no win scenarios find pike amongst the officers in attendance
his eyes locked on kirk
this is his boy
and hes invested
then not only have you violated the rules youve failed to understand the principle lesson
please enlighten me
you of all people should know cadet kirk a captain cannot cheat death
the first punch by spock that landed
the cockiness slips away as he senses where this is going i of all people
your father lieutenant george kirk had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action did he not
the daddy card
kirk a mix of anger and embarrassment how long did it take you to look that up
how long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat
the president smirks considers ending this now but doesnt its just too damn entertaining
maybe you just dont like that i beat your test
i am vulcan
like is not a verb in our vernacular
ive simply made the logical deduction that youre a liar
what an idiot i am for taking that personally agreed
furthermore you have failed to divine the purpose of the test
enlighten me again
the purpose is to experience fear
fear in the face of certain death
to accept that fear and maintain command of ones self and ones crew
this is a quality expected in every starfleet captain
kirk absorbs that
then so youre telling me the point
of the whole thing
is to be afraid
fear is necessary yes
have you taken the test commander spork
as a vulcan i require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions
no he dint
kirks hit guys for a lot less the crowd all but oooooohs
but kirk aint fucking done yet
you keep reminding me that youre vulcan
and im sure youre really proud of that who wouldnt be but isnt it true you people dont experience fear at all
he raises that eyebrow
and kirk sees
no matter how subtly
that he has fucking made contact
smelling blood and if thats the case whats that say about your ability to make command decisions
looks like kirk just hit him in his fucking weak spot
and before this lovefest can continue a redshirt bursts into the hall kirk turns to look they all do now were speeding in behind the redshirt who runs to the
president hands him a datapad
president reads it
everyone watches on edge finally quietly to all weve received a distress call from vulcan
spock reacts concerned cadet kirk you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing
cadets report to shuttle hangar one immediately this hearing is at recess until further notice dismissed
everyones on their feet moving quickly kirk suddenly irrelevant
pike passes by him all fucking business but before he goes cheating isnt winning
and as that settles on kirk mccoy now joins him
the two exiting with the rest of the cadets as kirk eyes spock who was that pointy eared bastard
i dont know but i like him
dolly through hundreds of cadets racing to their shuttles barracks leaders stand on platforms calling out ship assignments cadets hurrying off as theyre called blake
fugeman regula one
welcome to starfleet and godspeed
as the last of the cadets head off kirk stands there without a home he moves to his exiting barracks leader excuse me you didnt call my name
kirk james t
checks his tablet youre on academic probation
that means youre grounded until the academy board rules
kirk is poleaxed as leader heads off mccoy needing to run jim the boardll rule in your favor
kirk is just rocked look jim i gotta go yeah yeah you go
kirk forces a half smile
torn mccoy hurries off
pull away from kirk alone as the mass of newly minted cadets criss crosses around him
at the hangar entrance mccoy suddenly stops a lightbulb
he quickly returns to kirk pulls him off come with me whatre you doing
track with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets and suddenly were moving in the other direction as a pissed off uhura serpentines through the group to spock
commander a word
spock moves away from the officers a private moment with her yes lieutenant
was i not one of your top students
indeed you were did i not receive a gold rating for exolinguistic skills giving starfleet first place over kyoto and mit at the oxford invitational
a loud nearby shuttle leaves behind them it gets windy an exceptional achievement to be su and did i not on multiple occasions demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and i quote
unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies in subspace transmission tests
consistently yes and while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the u
enterprise i was assigned to the farragut
spock reacts unusually he seems almost embarrassed
it was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism
she gets closer voice low all pride and defiance no
i am assigned to the enterprise
their eyes hold
he checks his tablet makes an change oh
yes i believe you are
mccoy and kirk enter fast
mccoy goes through a cabinet preps a med in a hypospray syringe
what are you doing
doing you a favor
i couldnt just leave you there looking all pitiful roll up your sleeve im gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from melvaran mud fleas
mccoy fires the hypospray ow what for
to give you symptoms
i dont understand youre gonna start to lose vision in your left eye yeah i already have dont stand up yet he tries to stand whatd you do to me
youre gonna get a really in pain bad headache
this is a favor
yeah youre welcome
mccoy ushers kirk out of the room mccoy ushers kirk to a shuttle a scanning officer stops them kirk james t
hes not cleared for duty aboard the enterprise but i am and medical code states the treatment and transport of a patients to be determined at the discretion of his
attending physician which is me
re scanner you can see hes suffering he needs me as his doctor so since im assigned to this ship sos he or would you like to explain to captain
pike why the enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers
as you were
as you were
and with that he pulls kirk past the speechless officer a fleet of shuttles depart starfleet head out to space kirk in agony sweating sits beside mccoy as they pass
through the stratosphere
mccoys peering out a window i might throw up on you
you should look at this
and through his pain kirk does
and is amazed
the shuttle approaches a massive docking station where a dozen starfleet vessels are docked
but the ship were approaching is miraculous u
enterprise ncc is revealed on the hull and ready for her maiden voyage
the shuttle glides to the underside of the enterprise
a docking bay opens officers move quickly on the ship kirk and mccoy enter
kirk wiping his brow pretty much soaked
thanks for getting me on board
but i dont feel right
i feel like im leaking
oh look the pointy eared bastard
kirk looks up spock moves towards them not seeing them kirk yanks mccoy out of the way spock passes and enters a turbolift kirk looks back as the doors close
then we go into the turbolift for just a moment as the doors open and we enter with spock spock walks through the glorious gleaming new space taking his position
at the science console
pike at the command chair
captain engineering reports ready for launch
the maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today but her christening will have to be our reward for a safe return
toggles intercom all decks this is captain pike
prepare for immediate departure
whip pan to the helm hikaru sulu turns to pike at hes the federations best pilot
as he works the controls moorings retracted captain
dock control reports ready thrusters fired separating from space dock the enterprise moves away from the dock smaller satellite crafts floating around it
the other five starfleet ships already ahead moving into position
medical staff preps
mccoy enters with kirk in amusing agony mccoy helps him onto a bed prepares another hypospray
oh this wasnt worth it i wish i didnt know you im itching in my mouth this is heres a short lasting horrible sedative those symptoms wont last long dont
be an infant
and he shoots kirk with another hypospray as sulu works the controls the fleets cleared space dock captain
all ships ready for warp
set course for vulcan
course laid in
and sulu does and the six ships one then two then three then four then five snap into warp
the enterprise however
just sits there
pike and the others look at sulu who is confused concerned searching the controls
finally lieutenant wheres helmsman mckenna
uh he has lungworms sir
hell be fine but couldnt report to his post im hikaru sulu fucking with him and you are a pilot right
very much so sir im not sure whats
is the parking brake on
half laughs no ill figure it out just have you disengaged the external inertial dampener
sulu does and realizes spock is right
he makes it work
ready for warp sir
the external inertial dampener
the parking brake
laughs lets punch it
and now alone the enterprise snaps into warp and is gone
close on a small vulcan object
shaking as if in a small earthquake
boom up to find amanda as she moves through her home out to the balcony and in the distance a mile away is a massive column of light like a
ray from god which creates nuke like concentric clouds and massive dirt and dust slamming into the ground
amandas eyes go wide with terror looking down towards vulcan at the gigantic drilling platform the source of the plasma ray and we tilt up to see that the platform
is hung on a wide tether and we keep tilting until we see the tether is attached to the narada in orbit above the planet nero stares at holographic images of vulcan as ayel arrives behind him
captain nero drilling has begun
prepare the red matter
tell me when we reach core depth
ayel heads off ayel enters the massive hangar where spocks jellyfish ship sits
ayel moves to enters the jellyfish ayel moves into the containment hold a metallic room containing a large floating red ball some kind of energy source
ayel observes two romulans extracting some of this red matter sucking it into a tube workers place the tube of red matter into a space pod
the journeys underway
the bridge crew monitors systems engines at maximum warp captain
russian whiz kid whats your name again
an year old face leans into frame
heavy russian accent ensign chekov pavel h
fine chekov pavel h
begin shipwide mission broadcast
yessir happy to
into console ensign authorization code nine five wictor wictor two authorization not recognized please try again
chekov is a genius a graduate of the academy at seventeen he sighs aigh thees is the rd century what good is woice recognition that doesnt recognize your woice
again nine five victor victor two
your attention plees at twenty two hundred hours telemetry detected an anomaly in the neutral zone
what appeared to be a lightning storm in space
chekovs face appears on monitors throughout the great ship including engineering crane down stories of catwalks as engineers tend to the dilithium crystal chamber that operates the warp drive soon
after starfleet received a distress signal from the vulcan high council that their planet was experiencing seismic activity
we then lost contact with vulcan entirely
weapons bay tracking down rows of photon torpedoes stacked for war weapons officers arming the cannons
various shots of the crew at work in different ship locals
our mission is to assess the condition of vulcan and assist in evacuations if necessary
medical bay as the med staff sets up a triage area we should be arriving at vulcan within two minutes
thank you for your time
and as chekovs message ends kirk suddenly sits up in frame his mind spinning through the pain and sedative he tries to get off the bed to his feet as
mccoy hurries over jim i told you to stay d good god
what mccoy has just seen what we and kirk see now is that whats this
i dont know a reaction to the vaccine damnit kirk rushes to the video monitor where chekov was seen using his huge hands he rewinds chekovs speech replays this part
as mccoy scans kirk with a handheld diagnoser telemetry detected an anomaly in the neutral zone
what appeared to be a lightning storm in space
he freezes it eyes wild looks to mccoy bones we have to stop the ship youre not allergic to cardassian vole dander are you
how the hell would i know
is uhura on board
you need an antidote jim or youre gonna die
jim im not kidding you gotta keep your heart rate down
computer locate crew member uhura i havent seen a reaction this severe since med school
a map appears locates her lieutenant uhura is at signals monitoring station twelve deck four
were flying into a trap
kirk runs out mccoy hurrying after him with a bag of gear youre delusional you know that
kirk and mccoy enter kirk stops looks around come here jim dont move and mccoy injects him with another shot ow
and kirk runs into a enormous space giant steel collector tanks surround a dozen workstations where crew members collect data kirk races to uhura the transmission from the klingon prison
planet what exactly did you hear
what are you doing here what happened to your hands
kirk hides his hands behind his back as he talks it becomes who was it who escaped
what was the ship that was stolen
to mccoy indiscernible whats happening to my mouth
working hypospray youve got numb tongue impossible to make out numb tongue
thats not good i can fix that kirk grabs a pen with his huge hands and writes shows her what hes written the ship was it romulan
uhura looks at him somehow scared as mccoy injects him again epic wide shot amandas a spec against the massive ear splitting plasma twister
the image is almost religious
pop closer to her face mesmerized terrified suddenly a hoverspeeder races in behind her at the controls is sarek shouts against wind she turns to him in horror bridge doors
whoosh open as kirk runs in followed by uhura and a harried mccoy captain pike sir we have to stop ship
how the hell did you get on board the this man is under the enterprise
influence of a severe reaction to a vaccine
he is delusional and i take full responsibility for vulcan isnt experiencing a natural disaster its being attacked by romulans
on the crew as that lands
but most specifically spock
cadet kirk i think youve had enough attention for one day dr
mccoy return to medical well have words later
rebuked mccoy exits as as you know mr
kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel
by starfleet yeah i get it youre a regulations that makes him a great arguer id love to do stowaway
it again with you too
i can remove the cadet from try it
this cadet is the bridge sir trying to save the bridge
by recommending a full stop in trans warp in the midst of a rescue mission
its not a rescue mission listen to me
its an attack
based on what facts
and cadet or not the bridge is his
fact the same anomaly a lighting storm in space that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth before a romulan ship attacked the u
to pike you know that i read your dissertation
which was good
fact this ship which had formidable and advanced weaponry was never seen or heard from again fact the kelvin attack took place on the edge of klingon space and at
hundred hours last night there was an escape from a klingon prison planet rura penthe fact the escaped prisoners were romulans sir and it was reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock
and you know of this prison escape how
kirk just points to uhura
sir i i intercepted and translated the message myself
kirks report is accurate
were warping into a trap there are romulans waiting for us i promise you that
all eyes on pike
he looks to spock who could screw kirk here
but the cadets logic is sound
then and lieutenant uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics we would be wise to accept her conclusion
to comm officer scan vulcan space check if any transmissions are being made in romulan
sir im not sure i could distinguish the romulan language from vulcan
to uhura how about you you speak romulan cadet
all three dialects
uhura relieve the lieutenant mr
hannity hail the u
uhura sits at the console she puts on the earpiece
weve just watched the birth of an icon
she works the controls the other ships are out of warp and have arrived at vulcan sir but we seem to have lost all contact captain i pick up no
romulan transmissions or transmissions of any kind in the area
there seems to be something jamming all communication around vulcan
its because theyre being attacked
long tense beat shields up
ready all weapons
lights go red
hold on the faces of our people afraid hearts pounding as they dread what theyre about to see arrival at vulcan in five seconds
two sulu dips the enterprise fast and hard and the spinning debris just scars the ship
the bridge shakes but rights itself
the wide at the monumental ship meanwhile inside a proximity alarm rings out sir another federation ship
destroy it too
spock snaps to pike as images flash on his console captain theyre locking torpedoes
full reverse come about starboard ninety degrees
drop us down underneath them
prepare to fire all weapons
the narada fires a torpedo and in a wild move the enterprise drops and tumbles the separating torpedo passes right between the enterprises nacelles one piece hits our hero ships
deflector dish another the main dish and a crew member runs through the machine room catwalks as a huge explosion sends him and large steel tanks tumbling into we see the ship from a distance the scale of the destruction relatively small shields at thirty two percent
their weapons are powerful sir we cant take another hit like that
get me starfleet command
captain the romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the vulcan atmosphere its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities
all power to forward shields prepare to fire all weapons
photons loaded fast by crew members and the enterprise swoops around firing photons at the narada which takes the hits in stride the bridge in action fire torpedoes take them
and just before our heroes are blown into oblivion nero suddenly lurches forward and stabs out a hand neros eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills the hull magnify
on screen the enterprises hull is revealed u
nero lights up with recognition pike on the comm divert auxiliary power from port nacelle to the shields
but pike stops when he sees on the viewscreen captain were being hailed
pike looks over nods uhura works controls and on viewscreen nero appears
in english hello
i am captain christopher pike to whom am i speaking
i am called nero
close on kirk breathless suddenly staring at the man who murdered his father holy shit
youve declared war against the federation
withdraw and ill agree to arrange a conference with romulan leadership at a neutral loca i do not speak for the empire
we stand apart
as does your vulcan crew member
isnt that right
all eyes on spock
spock looks to pike who nods permission to nero pardon me
but i dont believe you and i are acquainted
no were not
then i would like you to see something
then captain pike your transporter capability is disabled
you will man a shuttle and come aboard the narada for negotiations
that is all
the transmission ends
the crew stares in grave anticipation hell kill you you know that your survival is unlikely captain we gain nothing by diplomacy going over to that i too suggest you
rethink ship is a mistake
i understand that loud to the bridge i need officers who have been trained in advanced hand to hand combat
sulus hand goes up i have training sir
then come with me kirk you too youre not supposed to be here anyway
to chekov radio the engine room have chief engineer olsen meet us at shuttle bay five
bridge doors whoosh open they exit
we track fast with pike kirk spock and sulu as they hurry through the enterprise toward the shuttle bay without transporters we cant beam off the ship cant assist vulcan
cant do our job
im creating an opportunity mr
sulu and mr
olson will space jump from the shuttle
youll have chutes youll land on that machine theyve lowered into the atmosphere thats scrambling our gear youll get inside disable that thing then beam back to the ship
kirk and sulu share a holy fucking shit look okay
spock im leaving you in command of the ship
once we have transport capability and communications back up youll contact starfleet and report what the hells happening here
something youve got only precious few minutes to figure out
if all else fails fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the laurentian system
spock is freaked then kirk
im promoting you to first officer
while im gone we need to keep the chain of command
and you two make a swell team
i apologize but the complexities of human pranks escape me
its not a prank spock
and im not the captain
and with that hes done
kirk finally shakes off the shock of his promotion once we knock out that machine
sir what happens to you
i guess youll have to come get me
turns to spock careful with the ship
shes brand new
they appreciate the pure balls of that
bravery washes over them theyd fucking die for their captain who now turns to kirk and sulu suit up gentlemen
sareks hovercraft speeds along the desert floor arriving at a massive cave opening he and amanda hurry off the craft into the cave bridge doors whoosh open all eyes on
spock as he enters their new captain
with cold certainty he takes the command chair hits the intercom dr
puri report chaos utter and complete
wounded men and women its bad bloody a hand hits an intercom mccoy badly shaken its mccoy dr
puri was on deck hes dead
beat then you have just inherited his responsibility as chief medical officer
quick cuts kirk sulu and the ships lead engineer olson are suiting up for the drop strapping on sleek airdrop armor
web they race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other across a narrow aisle red shirt engineer grins like hes going on a ski trip i am pumped
to kick some romulan ass
bring it on
kirk nods at him subtext what a fucking sack
he looks to sulu
so what kinda combat training dyou have
unimpressed beat fencing
in the cockpit pike works the controls motors whine and the craft lurches we see the shuttle leave the dock the shuttle soars from the enterprise bay the planet vulcan
a red orb below
thrusters flare as it descends and now we the shuttle glides to a hover feet above the drill a klaxon sounds signalling depressurization of the cargo lock the guys ready
their equipment snatching for handstraps standing on the lip of the airlock kirk and sulu meet eyes through their helmet faceplates the point of no return pikes voice over their headsets pre jump on one three two one
pike hits another control as the shuttle bomb bay doors open and kirk sulu and red shirt are instantly pulled out into the falling trio tracked on screen everyone watches
agape away teams entering the atmosphere spock and uhura meet eyes this is fucking insane and a mans enthusiastic yelling takes us to their chutes snap open jerking them hard upward as the red kirk approaches more terrified than ever he comes in hard too slams against the drill edge bounces but quickly gets his footing hits a button on his chute and slits appear in the fabric suddenly theres no more drag and the chute auto retracts into kirks pack a reusable parachute
but sulu isnt so lucky yards from the drill surface his chute gets snared in the cables jerking him upside down the wind is so intense sulu is blown sideways
his chute lines begin rubbing on the sharp metal of the suspension rig
kirk holds on to one of the chutes cables yells up as kirk tries to climb up sulus cables begin to snap
one by one and sulu tries to climb back using his chute cables toward the rig otherwise hes gonna fly off
as kirk makes his way up the rig suddenly kirk spins just as a romulan appears tackling kirk to the drill platform
the two fight precariously on the edge of the swirling plasma drill wind roaring and suddenly theres another romulan from an open hatch
sulu slides down the cable jumping and tackling the second guard and the shit is on our starfleet heroes battling these romulans to the death and sulu kicks off an
antenna piece and uses it as a saber fucking swashbuckling at feet
its a frenzied assault even the bigger romulan isnt ready for and sulu manages to kick him into the vortex where hes vaporized as kirk draws his phaser and point
blank shoots the romulan knocking him clear off the cylinder and into the sky falling to his death disintegrating as he falls against pummeling wind kirk and sulu move toward the hatch open it as pikes shuttle door opens
pike steps out
surrounded by a dozen of neros men
ayel steps forward
pike stands firm knowing this is the end for him im captain christopher pi whack
hes cut off by a punch to the face
drops to his knees
looks up at ayel with blazing eyes wipes a trickle of blood from his lip so much for diplomacy
hes dragged away as kirk and sulu drop in through the outer hatch to find a control console sulu madly flips switches no luck none of this is familiar the
interface the controls step back what you have an idea
yeahyeah i do kirk fires his phaser at the console blasting it the immense column of light disappears leaving only a towering swirling vortex of dirt uhuras console lights up
with activity the jamming signals gone communications are re established transporter control re engaged spock looks up from his console grave chekov run gravitational sensors i want to know what theyre doing to the planet
aye commander keptin sorry
a romulan helmsman runs to nero the drills been sabotaged sir
nero mind racing launch the red matter
the pod we saw earlier is fired from the ship it whips past
kirk and sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out onto the drills outer hull they start to hear a sound
a and for an instant
what looks like a puff of smoke billowing up from the planets core
then a shockwave blasts kirk to enterprise they just launched something toward the planet
keptin gravitational sensors are off the scale if my calculations are correct that pod they launched is creating a singularity
that will consume the planet
stirring inside him uhura watches spock heartsick for him theyre creating a black hole
at the center of vulcan
how long does the planet have
id say minutes
beat to uhura alert vulcan command center to signal a planetwide evacuation all channels all frequencies maintain standard orbit what
spock wait she goes after him as he moves to the turbolift where are you going
to evacuate the vulcan high council theyre tasked with protecting our cultural history
my parents will be among them you cant beam them out
its not possible theyll be in the katrik arc i must get them myself holograms of vulcan under destruction nero watching them pleased
he turns to ayel retract the drill lets move out
the drill platform lurches begins retracting the platform banks sulu falls back off the platform without a chute
kirk holding on watching this wide eyed and knowing what he must do he runs and jumps kirk falls fast hes only gonna have one shot at this presses his
arms to his sides and rockets downward building speed four hundred feet below is sulu freefalling kirk moves his feet and hands angling toward him slashing downward at mph closing like a missile the gap between them narrows sulus feet below him
feet to the planet surface
kirk slams into sulu in a mid air tackle they tumble together kirks made the grab and locked his arms around sulu in an iron grip screams in his face
sulu does it opens but holy fuck the double weight rips the transporter chief works his controls sweating trying to im trying
i cant lock on your signal
snap around as chekov hears this watching his controls uhura watching too youre moving too fast
no i can do that i can do that
chekov suddenly bolts uhura watches him race off a crew member steps into frame the black holes expanding we wont reach minimum safe distance if we dont leave immediately
chekov sprints through corridors engine room yelling and we take him to where he races to the controls out of breath yelling and he begins working the controls kirk and
sulu speed dropping terrified chekovs manipulating a joystick like targeting display trying to match the crosshairs on the dropping figures holdonholdonholdonholdon
a massive sheet of lava miles high bursts into the sky kirk and sulu enter frame bullet whoosh right past us dropping headset tight on chekov as he struggles to
lock onto them beep
compensating gravitational pull and he hits a button and and painful but safe
transporter engineers gape in utter amazement and relief chekov sweating laughs
kirk and sulu get their bearings peeling themselves up at stunned whispers thanks
yeah not a problem
and kirk looks up as spock hurries in step aside im going to the surface
as the console engineer works the display the surface of what
youre going down there
are you nuts
energize and spock dematerializes push in as spock materializes the distant landscape around him collapsing imploding exploding he sprints for the mountain the entrance to the ark a scared small
creature runs past spock as he heads up the mountain rocks falling spock races through the tunnels as the world shakes around him he enters the massive ark chamber sees atop the enormous stairs five vulcan elders sarek among them hands placed on the sarcophagus like ark
mind melding with it
amanda is here too kneeling beside sarek and she sees her son who is now running toward them she stands spock
spock rushes up the stairs the planets not safe it has only seconds left we must evacuate now and as they run out enormous rocks collapse around them and they
run through the tunnels the stone collapsing around them spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see the planet is collapsing coming toward them spock whips open a tri corder trembling like crazy spock to enterprise take us back now
chekov works the controls locking volume transport in to die and spock trying to hold it together even though their transport hasnt yet begun looks at amanda their eyes lock
the collapsing ground racing toward them and in a surreal intimate moment amanda says to spock quietly its okay
to be scared
push in on spock looking at her as the light darts start tracing them and they begin to evaporate as the ground drops from under amanda and shes sucked down
away as spock chekov in a panic at the controls as the vulcans materialize on the pad spock still reaching for his mother but all he gets it the ghostly image of her as it lands sarek too
has been lost
and kirk stands nearby having observed all of this without anything to do or say
theres no cheating death
and the enterprise blasts away in the distance the entire and over this we hear acting captains log
i have assumed command of the enterprise
the kind that crashes after the worlds changed
in triage the bays filled with wounded enterprise officers
the vulcan elders and sarek being examined as well
kirk sits here getting his hand bandaged from the fight
during this he looks up seeing one of the elders being treated for a slight wound her green blood seen through the bandage
weve heard no word from captain pike
i have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as nero
spock sits in the captains chair reporting
hes glassy eyed staring at nothing as he speaks
behind him uhura sits watching concerned
nero who has destroyed my home planet
and most of its six billion inhabitants
i estimate no more than ten thousand survived
beat while the essence of our culture has been saved in the elders who now reside upon this ship
i am now a member of an endangered species
spock considers this
clicks off the log recorder
spock moves off into the turbolift uhura follows him spock and uhura
she glances over wanting to say so much but not to invade what must be the worst moment of his life
he looks at her with kind eyes
and uhura does something odd she stops the lift
spock looks over as she wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him
just holding him
kissing his face with utter tenderness and comfort which he lets her do
and we realize this is why the intimacy before this is their secret
im so sorry
spock looks off taking comfort bewildered and lost
what can i do
tell me what you need
hes on the verge of some emotional release
but self consciousness returns and he clamps up starting the lift again i need for us all to continue performing admirably
he looks at her again gives her another kiss
the door opens and he exits
she watches him go and the door closes on her
kirk comes down the hall stretching his hand bandage when he stops
standing at the other end of the corridor operating a datapad is a familiar looking green girl
guilt overcomes him
after a beat he moves to her
she turns to him listen about what happened at starfleet
the test and everything i know it looks like i was
using you or whatever
and im sorry
i really am
i just hope youll forgive me
she just stares at him for a long beat as if shes just pissed
but kirks face changes
and then he says youre not gaila are you
and he walks off
version has gaila saying im uhura at her station scanning for enemy signals all of our principals are here in debate lieutenant have you confirmed that nero is headed for
their trajectory suggests no other destination captain
earth may be his next stop but we have to assume every federation planets a target
yes agreed but why didnt they destroy us
why waste a weapon
we werent a threat
thats not it
he said he wanted me to see something
the destruction of my home planet
and how the hell did they do that by the way
when did they jump so far ahead in the arms race
the engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time
damnit man im a doctor not a physicist are you suggesting theyre from the future
that is what hes suggesting and i dont buy it
if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth
then what would an angry future romulan want with captain pike
as admiral he knows details of starfleets defenses
what we need to do is catch up to that ship
disable it take it over and get pike back
theyre all looking at kirk like hes nuts
bitingly fantastic im in
captain pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant
were technologically outmatched in every way
a rescue attempt would be illogical
illogical youre funny
not to mention we couldnt do it anyway neros ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them what about assigning engineering crews to try and
boost our warp yield
remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks and damage to the main deflector shield without which we cannot communicate with okay okay
theres gotta be some way
we must gather with the rest of starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement there wont be a next engagement spock by the time weve gathered itll be
too late how many planets are you willing to risk
you say hes from the future
knows whats gonna happen
then the logical thing is to be unpredictable
youre assuming nero knows how events are predicted to unfold
the contrary neros very presence has altered the flow of history beginning with the attack on the u
kelvin culminating in the events of today thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party
does anyone understand him
stunned an alternate reality
whatever lives we might have lived if the time continuum was disrupted
our destinies have changed
sulu plot a course for the laurentian system warp factor three wait dont do that spock running back to the rest of the fleet for a confab is a massive
waste of time these were the orders he also ordered us to go captain pike issued when he back and get him
spock left ship youre captain now
i am aware of my every second we waste responsibilities mr
neros getting closer to his next target
that is correct and why im instructing you to accept i will not allow us to go that i alone am in command
backwards away from the problem instead of hunting then i must remove you from nero down
if i confine you to the brig youll likely escape
chekov have transportation prepare a deployment capsule
sulu escort him out
for a beat nobody moves an impossible choice for all of them
torn chekov and sulu close in on kirk im sorry
yeah dont worry ab but kirk swings sulu jerks faster spins grabs kirks wrist
kirk elbows him as chekov reaches for his phaser but kirk slams him the phaser drops kirk reaches for it but spocks fingers clamp on kirks neck the vulcan pinch
on pikes face strapped to a table
nero looks down upon him
you are only the second human i have ever met face to face
you must have so many questions for me
then i only have one for you
i need the subspace frequencies of starfleets border detection grids
specifically those surrounding earth
pike looks up at him quiet rage
then christopher pike captain u
enterprise registry ncc
beat hardcore answer my question
you answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet i prevented genocide
beat calms where i come from christopher
this ship is just a mining vessel
i chose a life of honest labor to provide for myself
and the wife who was carrying my child
beat i sit here now
knowing you as enemies
not just of today
but of tomorrow
i watched as your federation did nothing
they let us burn to death
as our planet broke in half
curiosity behind pikes eyes
then nero youre confused
romulus has not been destroyed
how can you blame the federation for something that hasnt happened
it did happen
i remember it
then pained when i lost her
i promised myself i would not speak another word until the day of my retribution
in twenty five years i forgot the sound of my own voice
but i didnt forget the pain
that feeling cannot be erased
turning to anger now a feeling that every surviving vulcan now shares
pike just looks at him
sees how fucking far gone he is
if what you say is true
you can save romulus
you have a second chance to yes which is a gift i wont waste on mercy
beat my purpose christopher is not simply to avoid the destruction of the home i love
beat but to create a romulus which exists free of the federation
only then will she be saved
and the she could refer to the planet
or to neros lost love
either way pike knows a losing battle when hes fighting one
ever so nobly he quietly says then we have nothing more to discuss
nero reaches for something under the counter pike lies upon
retrieves a familiar glass container inside dozens of centaurian slugs the very ones used on nero
its not the fault of the human race that starfleet chose earth as its center
youre a more noble race than my fallen cousins
ill take no pleasure in your extinction
nero opens the container reaches for a pair of tongs the frequencies please
christopher pike captain u
enterprise registry ncc
nero sad smiles
what he expected
as you wish
a romulan guard holds pikes mouth nero uses the tongs and our pov is blurry
we come into focus on a blinking instrument panel
kirk is stirring awake his shoulder kills
he sits up inside a one man pod craft
he wipes the glass looks up like a tunnel of snow feet long to the sky
the podcrafts embedded on the surface of a vast ice planet
kirks been marooned
he closes his eyes his face falls
where am i
current location delta vega class m planet unsafe
you have been ordered to remain in your pod until retrieved by starfleet authorities
bite me hows that
the canopy rises a blast of cold air hits kirk with some agony out he goes he climbs up the tube of snow and gets to the surface looks out
hes in the middle of fucking nowhere
finally tracking along a massive ice sheet
kirk enters frame walking along cold pissed
whips out a tricorder speaks into it lieutenants log supplemental im preparing a testimonial for my starfleet court martial assuming theres still a starfleet left
from overhead what we see what kirk doesnt is something huge slithering underwater beneath the ice acting captain spock whose only form of expressions apparently limited to his left damn
eyebrow has marooned me on delta vega in what i believe to be a violation of security protocol
governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a st kirk freezes at a nearby growl
he looks sees nothing then another growl he turns some thirty feet away an eleven foot tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla its a polarilla steps out
from behind a mass of ice
kirk takes a slow small step backward and the fucking thing charges him kirk runs terrified and the polarilla pursues gaining its gonna eat him alive when falls drops and
we see that kirk is falling down a massive snow mountain
the huge red creature stops at the edge and roars loudly until the ice shelf breaks away
the creature starts to fall as well
now kirk is tumbling the immense creature tumbling not far behind
and kirk lands on the ice hard sees a distant cave
looks up at the flailing creature that is about to crush him kirk tries to run but the ice is too slippery finally he gets footing and runs off toward
the cave as the red creature lands hard its sharp spear limbs stab into the ice as it pursues kirk kirk races through the darkened cave the creature comes after him kirk goes as fast as he can the creature reaches out and fucking grabs him pulls him toward the disgusting wet teethy mouth kirk tries to hold on to anything he can but hes fucking lunch and just as youre screaming theres light fire light and a figure appears waving a torch and the red creatures eyes all go wild and it drops kirk and backs off afraid the figure chases it until its gone
kirk on the ground is freaked out out of breath and cant take his eyes off this man
who says the hen gra
notoriously afraid of heat
and the figure turns
we may have recognized the voice
as in nimoy
lit in the darkness by the fire
well refer to him as spock prime
he looks at kirk moves closer to him finally seeing him
and is amazed
stunned how dyou know my name
how did you find me
does starfleet know of my presence
spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand but realizing he doesnt recognize him
i have been
and always shall be
no i dont know you the only vulcan i know isnt exactly a buddy
of all the things spock predicted kirk might say it wasnt that
hes analyzing a thousand steps ahead calculating you are james t
your father is george as is your brother
your mothers name is winona you were born in stop
i dont understand
as spock nods we pre lap i am spock
one hundred and thirty years senior to the vulcan you know
beat beat beat bullshit
firelight flickers shadows of kirk and spock prime dance on the ice walls
remarkable night stars outside
its remarkably pleasing to see you again
re vulcan especially after the events of today
sir i dont have any idea how you know what you know
but i dont know you and if you are spock were not friends
you hate me
you marooned me here for mutiny
you are not the captain
youre the captain
pike was taken hostage
realizing grave by nero
what do you know about him
guilty burdened he is a remarkably
allow me it will be easier spock prime reaches for kirks face kirk grabs his wrist whatre you doing
a skeptical beat but kirk finally releases his hand
spock gently places his fingers on kirks cheek and temple whispering a mantra our minds
one and together
one hundred and twenty seven years from now everything ends
spocks eyes snap shut kirk jolts as if by an electric charge and the screen overexposes to white as we cut to our mind meld a supernova
an exploding star like a light eating away at a star in beta quadrant will go supernova and like a cancer left untreated
it will grow
and destroy everything
now were seeing vulcan science academy where six vulcan scientists study a hologram of this event the stars origin its path of destruction and spock prime is among them i
saw the beginning of it myself
vulcan science academy devised a plan to stop it
push in as the jellyfish ship is under construction we built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova
a black hole
now were inside the ship the containment hold being assembled by vulcan scientists i agreed to pilot the ship
knowing i would not return
now we see spock prime in a ritual ceremony of a vulcan kamikaze pilot
tea sipped inside the ark my sacrifice in service of all races seemed only logical
now spock prime sits in the jellyfish cockpit unfortunately
before i could begin the mission
the supernova destroyed romulus
and suddenly were out of the mind meld as kirk grabs spock neros planet was destroyed yes
he of course blamed us
believed vulcan allowed his planet to die
which was hardly the case
let me continue
this annoys me i dont like i know i know im not it do we have to do it like surprised to hear you complain this
allow me to finish
spock prime touches kirk again and we go the jellyfish swoops past us and we pan and see the massive supernova in the infinite distance no sense of scale here
but then the narada appears fires torpedoes at the jellyfish
nero came after me
determined to thwart my mission
if romulus was allowed to die he said
all planets should share its fate
i needed an exit
i knew if this mission failed
would lose everything
spock prime leaves the cockpit prime enters an airlock tumbles in weightlessness and enters the containment room
quick cuts as he removes red matter from i realized a large black hole could destroy the supernova
a smaller one
could be my escape
could send me back in time allowing me to complete my mission
so i created a black hole
spock loads the cannister with a small amount of red matter into a jettison tube and he fires the cannister into space spock prime back in the cockpit takes aim
on his controls and a black hole is created spock prime pilots toward the hole nero must have understood what i was trying to do
because he began racing for it
the narada and the jellyfish aiming for the black hole spock prime watches as the narada goes in lightning storm style disappearing first then spock primes face white nero simply
got to it first
how long i was travelling
i couldnt tell you
it was timeless
but when i arrived
light on spock primes face goes away he and the jellyfish are back in space but now facing him is the narada
nero was waiting for me
kirk inhales sharply having been there with spock prime
back to the two men in a cave kirk stares at him
his mind spinning because now he believes him
the result is overwhelmingly emotional
emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld
sympathy surprise so you do feel
cthia is the stricture that binds our emotions
but few of us are that perfectly vulcan
kirk gathers himself wipes his eyes on his sleeve
going back in time
you changed all our lives
yet remarkably events within our timelines characteristics people
seem to overlap significantly
tell me about the rest of the crew
tactical and communications sulu hes the helmsman why
mccoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence
but rather indication of a higher purpose
hed call it a damn miracle
yes he would
perhaps the time streams way of attempting to mend itself
in both our histories the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis therein lies our advantage
rises we must go theres a starfleet outpost not far from here
but kirk stands stops him where you came from
did i know my father
you often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet
this is amazing for kirk he looks off trying to imagine that life
spock intuits what this means
you should know
he proudly lived to see you become captain of the enterprise
a ship we must return you to as soon as possible
the enterprise streaks through frame in a warp blur sulu at his controls warp three
course one five one mark three the laurentian system
the turbolift opens mccoy enters moves to spock you wanted to see me
discreet tone yes doctor
im aware that james kirk is a friend of yours
supporting me as you did must have been difficult
are you thanking me
im simply acknowledging your difficulties
were not sure how mccoy is taking this
permission to speak freely sir
i welcome it
okay then are you out of your vulcan mind
were you doing the logical thing
the right one
but one things for damn sure that kid doesnt know how to lose
just isnt in his dna
back home we have a saying if youre gonna ride in the kentucky derby dont leave your prize stallion in the stable
a curious metaphor doctor
as a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential
my god man
you could at least act like it was a hard decision
i intended to assist in the effort to re establish communication with starfleet
however if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping ill gladly defer to your medical expertise
a strong look and spock turns away as sarek enters the bridge
spock moves to meet him
off mccoy fuming a fucking blizzard
kirk and spock prime move through the maddening whiteout
kirk yells through it and spock points an outpost half a mile away
long tile corridor
the door at the end opens snow and wind as kirk and spock prime enter
they head down
after a beat a small dark oddly alien creature steps out
eyes them curiously
this is can i help you
are you the station chief
keenser looks them over
and they follow keenser into a massive warehouse filled mostly with junked space parts
a large tarped shuttle in the background
in the middle of the huge depressing space is a table
and a starfleet officer who is asleep legs kicked up leaning back in a chair a hat covering his face
keenser taps the officers boot
a beat and the officer peers from under his hat
a cool slow burn
you realize how unacceptable this is
re the officer fascinating
officer stands unhappy about something
keeser watches nearby im sure its no your fault and i know youse lads are just doing your jobs but could you no have come a wee bit sooner
six months ive been living on nothing but starfleet protein nibs and the promise of a real food delivery
six months boys
its pretty clear whats going on here isnt it
for something that was clearly an accident
youre montgomery scott
you know him
yes thats me scotty youre in the right place are there any other hard working and equally starving starfleet officers around
you eat nothing
a bean and youre done for a week i need food
and now youre here so
where is it
you are in fact the mr
scott who postulated the theory of trans warp beaming
thats exactly what im talking about
how dya think i ended up here
i got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics as they pertain to subspace travel
he seemed to think that the range of transporting say a roast turkey was limited to a few hundred miles so i told my instructor i could not only beam
a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system which is no big deal anyway but if i were so inclined i could actually do it with a lifeform
so i tested it on admiral archers prize beagle
was a mistake
i know that dog
what happened to it
ill tell ya when it reappears
what if i told you your trans warp theory was correct
that it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed
and that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium
i havent been stationed here that long
if such an equation had been discovered ida heard
the reason you havent heard of it mr
is because you havent discovered it yet
scotty reacts is almost spooked sobers up a bit
really regards spock prime
yfrom the future are ya
dthey still have sandwiches where youre from
piece and jam
mince n tatties
what is he talking about
allow us access to your shuttle
and i will show you what a genius you actually are
off scotty who cant help but be intrigued scotty pulls a tarp over much of the out of service shuttle
shes a wee bit dodgy shield emitters are totally banjaxed along wi a few other things
spock finishes speed typing the field equations on the transporter control panel amazingly fast
spock prime steps aside your equation for achieving trans warp beaming
scotty looks at the equations we watch his expression run the gamut from confused to dumbfounded to quiet awe and delight imagine that
never occurred to me to think of space as the part thats moving
point of fact it did occur to you
he works the console extrapolating enterprises course enterprise
had its maiden voyage already has it
well you mustve done something right to be assigned to that ship kiddo
shes a well endowed lady love to get my hands on her ample nacelles if youll pardon the engineering parlance
nows your chance mr
look even if i believed you where youre from what ive done which i dont were still talkin bout slingshotting aboard while shes going faster than light
without a proper receiving pad thats like tryina hit a bullet with a smaller bullet wearing a blindfold
on a horse
i calculate no more than a four meter margin of error
thats all well and good unless you rematerialize four meters outside the ship
as spock works the keyboard an enterprise schematic rotates agreed the aft engineering bay is your best option a large space and no unpredictable airlocks youre coming with us right
my destiny lies along a different path
your destiny can wait he simply strong wont believe me only you can under no circumstances can he explain w be made aware of my existence
you must promise me this
youre telling me i cant tell you im following your own orders
jim this is the one rule you cannot break
to stop nero you alone must take command of your ship
how over your dead body
there is however starfleet regulation
off kirks confusion yes
i forget what little regard you had for such things
states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand
must resign said command
so i need to emotionally compromise you
i just lost my planet
i can tell you
i am emotionally compromised
then what you must do
is get me to show it
pushing in on kirk as this lands for him hm
live or die laddie lets get this over with
he enterprise has a decent cafeteria im guessing
scottys on the pad
kirk follows looks at spock you know
coming back in time
a trick i learned from an old friend
something strikes kirk his eyes glint with revelation
spock responds enigmatically a silent acknowledgment of what kirk must do to get the ship
he raises his hand in the legendary vulcan salute live long and prosper
and spock activates the transporter and they dematerialize the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish the enterprise shoots through frame at warp amid the roar of
the ships plasma drives particles rematerialize
its kirk eyes wide in suspense
he looks down at his legs his chest his arms to make sure hes still in one piece glances over to share his relief with scotty
but scotty isnt there
a strange banging kirk turns the banging is coming from a large metal tank then scotty appears in a translucent pipe freaking out banging on the clear metal kirks mind
races he looks around for a way to save his new friend just then a strong current is felt inside the tube and scotty is yanked away down the tube
and kirk runs after him down the length of the orange twisting and turning tubes scotty seen every time he enters a clear tube area then disappearing again into the
orange tubes and scotty gets sucked upwards and kirk turns and looks giant water turbine essentially
a massive fucking blender
no nonono and kirk hauls ass to the control panel we see the huge machine overhead the release valve under the pipe and kirk works as fast as he can
comeoncomeoncomeon like the simulator manual control enabled pressure seal enabled shutdown but the computer says turbine shutdown not allowed
a display on the forward console an alarm flashes keptin were detecting unauthorized access to a water turbine control board
spock moves from sarek to chekov bring up video
chekov brings up two dozen security video images on one screen
spock points to one it enlarges and we see kirk and scotty racing through the ship spocks eyes narrow he moves to the captains chair hits comm security this is
the captain seal engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three set phasers to stun
inside the tube scotty tumbles yelling underwater as kirk at the panel accesses the release valve control he watches scotty disappear through a clear section kirk times it waiting then
he hits the button and scotty drops through the release valve and slams to the floor hurt wet but breathing deeply you all right
recovering looking around nice cough ship
lets get to the bridge kirk and wet scotty race through the ship only to finally turn a corner and be faced with phasers aimed right at them
but suddenly phasers are at their heads
two security guards one the guy he got into the fight with at the bar years ago
come with me
off kirk shit woosh bridge doors open kirk and scotty are ushered in by the security guards
spock moves to them containing his anger and dismay
mccoy is here as well
spock walks right up to kirk
raises his eyebrow
to scotty who are you
hes with me
were travelling at warp how did you manage to get aboard this ship
kirk stares at the young spock a different experience now youre the genius you figure it out
as captain of this vessel i order you to answer the question
well im not telling
that confounds spock
and kirk is off to the races does that frustrate you
my lack of cooperation
does it make you angry
spock again focuses on scotty you are not a member of this ships crew
under penalty of court martial i order you to explain to me how you beamed ab to scotty dont answer him
you will answer me
weighing all this
then id rather not take sides
spock nods back to the security guards over this escort them to the brig
but before the guards can do so what is it about you spock
your planet was just destroyed your mother murdered and youre not even upset
your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate ha
and yet you said fear was necessary for command
i mean did you see that bastards ship
did you see what he did
tense yes of course i so are you afraid or arent you
tenser i will not
allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion
kirk gets close to spock then why dont you stop me
sarek watches tense
spock blinks step away from me mr
what is it like
not to feel
or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you
volcanic back away closer still you must not feel anything
it must not even compute for you
you must not have loved her at all
spock has just hit kirk and kirk goes to hit back but spock fucking delivers a series of powerful blows security stand back as the captain attacks
and spock is now fucking choking kirk he slams kirk against spock
and everything everything stops
spock red faced releases his grip
kirk gulps air and tumbles to the ground
spock staggers back
kirks hardly able to speak close to collapsing
but despite his brutalized face his expression isnt about spite or hatred
spock sees the faces of the stunned crew staring at him
but worst of all
spock levels his chin
quickly wipes his eyes
trying to regain some semblance of dignity
looks to mccoy
i am no longer fit for duty
i hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that i have been
please note the time and date in the ships log
and after a beat he leaves the room
sarek follows a moment later
the crew just stands there in stunned silence
finally i like this ship
mccoy turns to kirk exasperated congratulations jim
now weve got no captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him
the moment is upon him
yeah we do
the crew confused
sulu just fucking points at kirk and they all realize holy shit pike made kirk the first officer before he left
thanks for the support
and kirk moves to the captains chair passing uhura i sure hope you know what youre doing
so do i
studies chair sits into mic attention crew of the enterprise
this is james kirk
tracking with spock hearing the announcement as he walks stoically past crew hearing this mr
spock has resigned commission and advanced me to acting captain
i know you were all expecting to regroup with the fleet but ive ordered a pursuit course of the enemy ship to earth
on kirk as he ends the announcement i want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes
either were going down or they are
push in on kirk staring off i want some answers
he looks up
uhura is there
pissed off right now
where the helld you get trans warp technology
yeah you know thats complicated do i look simple to you
im a phd in astrophysics i think i can handle it howd you get back
you vant us to trust you but you vont tell us the truth
no i wont hey im the captain now
i dont have to tell you anything
now listen we need to figure out a way to catch up and get to neros ship
theres not a chance
theyre gonna be in geosynchronous orbit around earth in ten minutes
well never make it
even if we could you cant go in guns blazing not with their technology thats suicide
then we find a way to get on that ship and steal the black hole device away from them
well you can forget transwarp
no way to predict the naradas position from here
uhura anything from captain pike
ive been monitoring all channels
spock stand here staring at the place where his mother should have but didnt arrive
sees his son
theyre alone for the first time in ages
a beat you must not punish yourself
beat speak your mind spock
that would be unwise
what is necessary is always wise
watch spocks face
struggling with whats pent up inside
i feel as conflicted as i once was
as a child
have i made so little progress
beat softly you will always be a child of two worlds
i am grateful for that
and for you
painfully and not only because you are all i have left of her
spock looks at sarek
this is as close to emotion as hell get
i feel anger
for the one who took her life
an anger i cannot stop
i believe she would say
do not try to
then you asked me once
why i married your mother
beat simply i married her because i loved her
their look holds and for spock a revelation
the strategy session continues in full swing now chekov the youngest of the bunch gets up the courage to chime in incidently becoming the very first officer to say keptin
excuse me plees could all eyes shift to the wonder kid who awaits permission to speak yes chekov you dont need to ask permission to based on the naradas course
from vulcan ive projected that nero will travel past saturn
if we could drop out of warp behind one of saturns moons say titan the magnetic distortion from the planets rings will make us invisible to neros sensors
we could follow him to earth by staying in his blind spot
what blind spot
its exhaust wake
if we adjust our shield frequencies they shouldnt detect us
wait a minute anyone understand this kid
how old are you
i am seventeen sir how old are you
were all old enough to shave here
chekov is correct
everyone turns surprised spock has entered the bay galvanized full of purpose i have reviewed his telemetry
sulu can maneuver us into position i can beam aboard neros ship
i wont order you to do that mr
romulans and vulcans share a common ancestry
our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ships computer to locate the device
beat a flicker of emotion also my mother was human
which makes earth the only home i have left
the crew looks at this very courageous vulcan with deep respect but his focus is on uhura whose eyes smile back at him
then im coming with you
beat considering i would cite regulation but i know you will simply ignore it
see were getting to know each other
and a moment a burgeoning friendship panning across an alien landscape
and even though its in shadow you start to recognize it as the dark side of the moon
our pov ascends now to see and we move past it along the orbit of the moon cresting the horizon to see earth and neros ship hovering above it
close on nero his face illuminated on the darkened bridge of the narada by soft blue light
light radiated by earth
a beautiful hologram before him
he doesnt notice behind him as those blades from his staff appear behind his neck
nero tenses only now sensing this unforeseen danger ayel holds the weapon
but under it all
the men and i have discussed this
what we are about to do
beat we have to turn the ship around
we can save our home
nero turns slowly and deliberately ayel tenses stop
nero now faces ayel blades at his throat ayel growing more nervous as he faces his master
the surrounding crew stare on frozen in the moment only slightly confirming their makeshift mutiny with scared looks
we can go back
thats what we want
we have taken our vengeance on vulcan
we want to go home now
nero considers this
there is no need ayel
to threaten me
beat i understand
ayel is massively relieved
nero gently reaches out holds the staff still aimed at him
he deactivates it the blades instantly retract
but you are wrong
and just as ayel realizes hes fucked nero somehow activates the staff in a way we have not seen and the blades appear on to the floor dead
neros hard face turns to the rest of his crew
we will return to romulus when the federation lies in ruins and not a moment before
when those who watched our people burn at last understand our pain our loss
i refuse to return as a slave
we will return as conquerors
on the faces of the men submitting to his will our music building and then his eyes on earth like a fucking lion eyes a gazelle deploy the drill
the drill bay doors open as they lower the plasma drill
no sign of kirk and spock
sulus in the captains chair
chekov at helm
chekov transfer manual control to the captains chair
works controls ive projected the parabolic course you must follow
if you deviate by so much as a meter we will be detected
give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds and ill do the rest with thrusters
on my mark
the impulse engines surge shutting off as the ship slips out from behind the moon and into open space sulu makes rapid fire thruster combinations to stay on track a
stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity
the narada appears over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit passing underneath the enterprise as they arc in behind it
all stop in three
the small enterprise pulls into position behind the massive naradas blind spot and comes to a gentle stop
tension transporter room
were in stable geosynchronous orbit behind the narada
scanning no sign theyve detected us kirk and spock ready themselves for transport
strap on utility belts com sets tricorders and of course phasers on communicator well done mr
whatever happens mr
sulu if you feel you have a tactical advantage fire on that ship
even if were still aboard
its an order
spock turns to uhura who hands him a small translator device well be monitoring your frequency
uhura gives the translator to spock and he kisses uhura
thank you nyota
they part revealing kirks shocked face
uhura walks off leaving the two men kirk looking stunned at spock
her first name is
i have no comment on the matter
kirk still stunned as scotty moves to transporter control
if theres any common sense to their ship design ill be puttin ya in a cargo bay shouldnt be a soul in sight
the moment of truth
scotty hits the transport and kirk and spock disappear kirk and spock materialize in the cargo bay
to find themselves suddenly smack dab in the middle of six romulan guards working at cargo consoles
for a split second theyre as shocked as kirk and spock until they attack kirk immediately engages the closest romulan struggles but spocks a machine his palm snaps up cracking
a nose slams a head against the wall as battle ready as the romulans are its like trying to catch a ghost kirk finally knocks his one opponent unconscious and turns to see its all a touch insecure mine had a gun
i am trained in the vulcan martial art of suus mahna
kirk and spock move to a still conscious romulan as he struggles to get up
spock reaches for the fallen romulans temples
i am unable to meld with these romulans there are subtle differences in their physiology i did not anticipate punch him in the face make him talk
suus mahna his suss mahna is only intended ass
for self defense hes no longer a threat then pretend its a threat im your captain thats an order
spock punches the romulan hard and via uhuras comlink translator speaks in subtitled romulan what is your computer access code
the guard spits green blood at spock who punches him again the plasma drill is repaired and fully deployed
the plasma beam slams into san francisco bay massive cadets run to see the horrific sight of the plasma beam as uhura returns to the bridge everyones stations go dark
static on screens theyve activated the drill communications and transporter inoperative theyre on their own now
a rotating ship schematic spock typing at a console searching accesses two inter cam windows on one spock primes ship the jellyfish in a lower containment hold on the other
pike unclear if hes dead or alive
what you refer to as the red matter device is in the main hangar and ive located captain pike
is he alive
they cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall captain pikes shuttle and the jellyfish sit parked among the equipment
kirk and spock stealthily board the jellyfish kirk hits a console a familiar voice comes to life voice print and face recognition analysis enabled
spock youll be piloting the ship alone
which may be problematic as i am unfamiliar with this ships design
the laser grid responds to spocks voice scans his features for welcome back ambassador spock
he looks to kirk in surprise spocks eyes fix with sudden understanding
suddenly all the pieces start coming together
computer what is your manufacturing origin
stardate commissioned by the vulcan science academy
spock looks at kirk a touch upset it appears youve been keeping rather important information from me
just trust me
can ya do that
spock weigh his options
finally ill get pike
kirk exits kirk moves through various areas of the ship spock works the control fires up the craft lights come on he starts it up the ship begins to rise
and with the enormous jellyfish now operating floating in the hangar spock turns the ship and fires at the massive iris door as the ship shudders from within alarms primary core rupture warp engines off line
someone has detonated weapons in the main hangar
engage auxiliary systems
as the bridge crew fights to regain control the drills been severed
ambassador spocks ship has been stolen as is heading out of the solar system
a beat the romulan commander looks up from his console darkly spock
off neros fucking mega rage the narada turns accelerates in pursuit of the jellyfish and away from earth and now were back to the imagery of the first few moments
of the movie the narada gaining on the to comms officer open a channel channel open spock i shouldve killed you when i had the chance
under authority granted me by the europa convention im confiscating this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel
just grins in perfect contentment
you cant cheat me again spock
i know you better than you know yourself
last warning unconditional surrender or you will be destroyed
to his men fire at will
sir if you ignite the red matter the i want spock dead
nero hurries to the controls operates them himself and fire it does torpedoes blast from the hold and to the jellyfish which performs evasive maneuvers the torpedoes explode as kirk
moves through shadow into an airlock shaft starts climbing ladder rungs the jellyfish tilts earth receding far behind it spock veers to avoid being blown apart neros ship gaining firing kirk moves through the space into the torture room where he finds pike close to death kirk begins unfastening his binds
pike sees him through his fog amazed kirk
came back sir
just like you ordered
kirk helps lift him but what he doesnt see are the four guards entering with weapons but pike god bless him does summoning his last ounce of strength he manages
to unholster kirks phaser and blasts the four guards out of existence
safe he slumps dropping the phaser the narada fires again tearing a gash in the jellyfishs side
an array explodes you shouldve fled spock
sight target standby torpedoes
warning shields off line
on spock bad as things are they just got worse his mind spins until computer prepare self destruct sequence
and the jellyfish turns a new course right for the narada close on spock bravely facing certain death on a collision course with the narada looks like hes gonna sacrifice
himself and we assume hell pull away at the last second of course he will but he doesnt as the ships rocked hard nero sees the black hole building through the cockpit window its a rush crazy tense as hell uhura mccoy a med team and nd officers race in as scotty finishes receiving incoming signals to transporter chief nice timing lieutenant never beamed two targets from two places onto the same pad before
that was pretty good
kirk transfers pike to mccoy who urgently scans pike and barks to a med tech were gonna need gastric stimulators lets prep him for surgery now
everyones hurled off their feet consoles fry fire nero its the enterprise
neros eyes come unhinged whoosh kirk and spock race back onto the bridge keptin
the enemy ship is losing power its shields are down
hail them now
nero appears on screen from the narada bridge the naradas on its last legs a beat before nero turns realizing kirks fucking grinning at him from the screen this is
captain james t
kirk of the u
enterprise your ship is compromised too close to the singularity to survive without assistance which we are willing to provide
sotto captain what are you doing
sotto we show them compassion it may be the only way to earn peace with romulus
its logic spock
i thought youd like that
no not really not this time
i would rather suffer the death of romulus a thousand times than accept assistance from you
you got it
turns lock phasers
fire everything weve got
kirk to engineering get us out of here scotty
you bet yer ass captain the walls are ripping away pylons pull free from their moorings into the ever expanding sphere nero in the forgive me
leaving only the enterprise its nacelles flare as the ship tries to make the quantum leap but the black holes now a titanic whirlpool so insanely strong that the enterprise
is held in place by the gravity well even at warp
it shakes into a blur trying to cut loose but it cant scotty shouts back into the com against the screaming drive last desperate thought scotty slams the activation panel
and we see the warp core eject down a tube like an instant pneumatic release everyone white knuckles their seats as the blast dissipates
and our crew sits wide eyed trembling
finally truly safe
spock is seen in a medical office with pike who lies in bed recovering mccoy monitors him spock exits walks through the corridor sees a vulcan in silhouette staring out
at the academy
spock moves to him says quietly father
sarek turns but it isnt sarek
its spock prime
who says i am not
an incredible beat our two spocks in eye lock
both minds processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate
surreal extensions of each other separate but connected
there are so few vulcans left
we cannot afford to ignore each other
young spocks eyes flicker in puzzlement
then why did you send kirk aboard when you alone couldve explained the truth
beat simply because you needed each other
opposing yet complimentary opposites
it was that balance between us i should say you and kirk that often made the impossible possible
it was a test
no his heart heavy im in no position to pass judgment
my actions have robbed you of much
i could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together
of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize
there is to young spocks surprise vulnerability in that
how did you persuade him to keep your secret
i inferred universe ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise
an act of faith
one i hope youll repeat in the future
young spock considers an enduring friendship between him and kirk
for the first time understanding it
but the futures not what it used to be
in the face of extinction its only logical i resign my starfleet commission and help rebuild our race
and yet you are in a unique position
you can be in two places at once
beat i urge you to remain in starfleet ive already located a suitable planet on which to establish a vulcan colony and assist in the foundation of a new science
young spock takes that in resolute
my future cannot be determined by your past
we are one but not the same
then i ask that you do yourself a favor
put away logic
do what feels right
the world youve inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation
but theres no reason you must face it alone
spock prime moves to the door stops
offers the vulcan salute as my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving i will simply say
their eyes hold
spock turns disappearing into the corridor
young spock stares at the empty doorway a beat his mind a jumble of thoughts
and our music builds
as spock prime walks off down the corridor he passes right by a man conferring with a nurse the man pauses turns
suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger whos just passed him is
music still building glass walls reveal the enterprise at dock utility crafts floating around it repairing
standing at attention in rows the enterprise crew over four hundred of them wearing dress uniforms track down the faces all proud and we stop on young kirk
composed focused a man
the academy president stands at a podium this assembly calls captain james tiberius kirk
kirk breaks from formation pivots marches down the hangar past uhura
notably absent is spock
kirk ascends the stairs snaps to attention your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to
yourself your crew and the federation
unique solution to the kobayashi maru its my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking
he opens a box glorious in repose a medal by starfleet order you are hereby directed to report to commanding officer uss enterprise for duty as his relief
in a wheelchair now wearing an admirals uniform
overnight his hairs turned totally grey but despite his trauma his prides overwhelming
they salute i relieve you sir
i am relieved
pike containing a smirk pins the medal to kirks chest
thank you sir
kirk turns to the crowd
as kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations we go to the back of the hangar
moved beyond words
he turns and leaves them to it
and our music swells as the turbolift whooshes open and in walks kirk to every fans delight wearing his iconic gold shirt
all around him our crew young and fresh faced but no longer children in charge of the greatest starship ever built maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at your command sir
weapons systems and shields on standby
dock control reports ready
yard command signalling clear
scotty how are we
dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency captain
wry grin same ship different day
and kirk pauses
his eyes go over to the empty science console with a sense of incompleteness
in fact everyone on the bridge feels it
a bitter truth theyll have to accept
sulu prepare to engage thrus whoosh the turbolift door opens
wearing his blue uniform
our hearts soar permission to come aboard captain
as you have yet to select a first officer respectfully i would like to submit my candidacy
should you desire i can provide character references
kirk nearly laughs
spocks eyebrow goes up
something passes between them
it carries acceptance and trust
it would be my honor commander
maneuvering thrusters mr
take us out
as the ship maneuvers out of dry dock spock takes his place next to kirk
gold and blue side by side
and the ship crests the drydock portal drifting into space
blessed one last time by the voice of our vulcan hero space
the final frontier
these are the continuing voyages of the starship enterprise
her ongoing mission
to explore strange new worlds
to seek out new life forms and new civilizations
to boldly go where no one has gone
the trek theme soars as the enterprise warps off into a universe of infinite possibilities
oh my god
to himself boggled a lightning storm
to deck signal all departments first contact protocols
looks like we have someone new on the block
all stations fc procedures initiated
broadcasting universal greeting on all open frequencies
sir should we initiate an active scan
that could be seen as an act of provocation all readings passive crew members are glued to their telemetry working consoles em sensors in passive sweep
power signature detected levels increasing
suddenly a warning beep sir i have a reading theyve locked weapons on us
alarms blare lights go red as the narada fires a torpedo it heads for the kelvin then separates fracturing into a multi hit projectile officers scramble brace for impact torpedo
locked on us at degrees mark two incoming evasive pattern delta
redirecting auxiliary power to forward shields
aft torpedo tubes are hot
a direct hit smashes several decks along the dish of the ship captain robau helps a fallen crew member up from the floor then on his chair com damage report
intercut with moving with the kelvins chief engineer diagnostics back online rerouting to auxiliary console
power grid junctions c and e are out
dispatch repair teams to deck
our shields did nothing sir
never seen anything like it
weapons off line
main power at percent
then i ask that you do yourself a favor
put away logic and do what feels right
the world youve inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation
but theres no reason you must face it alone
and from around his neck he removes the pendant that until now weve only caught glimpses of
places it on the table beside his younger self
the feeling in his eyes is profound
this was a gift to me
one we were unable to fulfill
softly the way you can now
and moves to the door
offers the vulcan salute as my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving i will simply say
their eyes hold
spock turns disappearing into the corridor
young spock stares at the empty doorway a beat his mind a jumble of thoughts
looks to the pendant
and realizes its a holo emitter
after considering a beat he hits an activation button and a moving holographic message materializes before him captain james t
as always brash wry confident and singing happy birthday to you happy birthday to you
stops grins i know i know its illogical to celebrate something you had nothing to do with but i havent had the chance to congratulate you on your appointment to
the ambassadorship so i thought id seize the occasion
bravo spock they tell me your first mission may take you away for awhile so ill be the first to wish you luck
and to say
beat emotional i miss you old friend
and were pushing in on young spock taking in the image of kirks future self the message but above all the clear unquestionable friendship these two men had
as spock prime walks off down the corridor he passes right by a man conferring with a nurse the man pauses turns
suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger whos just passed him is
i suppose id always imagined us
outgrowing starfleet together
watching life swing us into our emeritus years
music building glass walls reveal the enterprise at dock utility crafts floating around it repairing
standing at attention in rows the enterprise crew over four hundred of them wearing dress uniforms track down the faces all proud i look around at the new cadets now
and cant help thinking
has it really been so long
wasnt it only yesterday we stepped onto the enterprise as boys
that i had to prove to the crew i deserved command
and their respect
and we stop on young kirk
composed focused proud
and to every fans delight finally wearing his yellow shirt
the federation commandant stands at a podium this assembly calls captain james tiberius kirk
kirk breaks from formation pivots marches down the hangar past uhura
notably absent is spock
kirk ascends the stairs snaps to attention your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to

they salute each other i relieve you sir
i am relieved
he opens a box in his lap glorious in repose a medal and as fleet admiral for your
unique solution to the kobayashi maru its my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking
pike containing a smirk pins the medal to kirks chest
a touch choked congratulations captain
thank you sir
kirk turns to the crowd
our music soars
bones leans in to sulu rolling his eyes same ship different day
as kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations we go to the back of the hangar
moved beyond words
he turns and leaves them to it
as he goes
i know what youd say its their turn now jim
and of course youre right
but it got me thinking our montage comes full circle as we end on kirks transmission whos to say we cant go one more round
by the last tally only twenty five percent of the galaxys been chartered
id call that negligent
criminal even an invitation
you once said being a starship captain was my first best destiny
if thats true then yours is to be by my side
if theres any true logic to the universe
well end up on that bridge again someday
because this is the part he needs to say most
admit it spock
for people like us the journey itself

lost in feelings that flood through him
