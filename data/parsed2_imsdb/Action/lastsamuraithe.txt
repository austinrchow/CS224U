fade in surrounded by a pack of dogs ten of them snarling and gnashing their teeth
the tigers eyes burn with fury as he wheels in a circle lunging at one dog clawing at another keeping them all at bay
suddenly the tiger leaps over the dogs and transforms into a white bird soaring majestically into the sky
sits up into frame sweating waking from a dream
he is katsumoto
we will come to know him later
fade to black
the faint sound of a brass band
the leader in all forms of armament used by the united states army
when you need a friend winchester is by your side
as he smokes a cigar barely listening
captain nathan algren u
army ret years old and looking every da y of it
his eyes are lined and saddened
he takes a swig from a flask
he is backstage at where a trade show is in progress
scantily clad lovelies in red white and blue undies demonstrate the nations most important new export arms
every weapon imaginable is on display rifles pistols even howitzers
banners declaim the virtues of winchester and springfield
of colt and remington and smith wesson
crowds mill around a stage
where ladies and gentlemen
the winchester corporation is proud to bring to you
a true american hero
a patriot who has proven his gallantry time and again on the field of battle
little tin soldiers are all lined up
a mass of grey
rebel troops surrounding a band of blue union cavalry
a large metal diorama
i hope you will join us in welcoming
late of the u
the savior of sutter hill
captain nathan algren
a last swig
algren steels himself then strides onstage as we reveal a banner
garish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates algren
my thanks mr
ladies and gents
he looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the battle that made him famous
his narration is halting unsteady on that fateful day johnny reb had us in a spot perched on the lonely top of sutters hill nothing but grey as far as
the eye could see unhorsed and out of ammunition i gazed down into the um mael
squints to see better maelstrom below us and saw them moving up
we realize he is reading from cue cards
the little rebel soldiers begin sliding up the metal hill
i knew it was fight or die
into the teeth of the enemy or we would all be buried
loses his place under his breath shit
finds it again on the same hill with our comrades a ready gone to merciful heaven
a sudden flash algrens mind
the real battle of sutters hill
the grim reality is ver y different from the dashing tale
union soldiers scream in agony
those horses still alive buck and froth at their tether
algren a lieutenant then moves among the panicked bloody men
he stops beside a private his brother david algren blonde not much more than a boy
theyre coming nate
he looks over the wall
rebel troops are moving up the hill
keep your head down
smiling papa alwa ys said we shouldve joined the navy
whatd he know
looks fondly at his brother you watch me now
do whatever i say
aye a ye lieutenant
algren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line
nearby algrens friend sergeant zebulah gant though severel y wounded reloads his revolver with the last of his ammunition
howre the horses
better than you
smell better too
looks at him can you hold on zeb
fighting the pain i got i choice
algren smiles sadly
his mend will die loon without medical attention
algren moves down the line bullets whizzing overhead
he kneels beside colonel bagley his commanding officer
panicking we need a flag
find me a goddamn white flag
what are you talking about
surrender damn it
thats an order
back to the convention hall no thought of surrender among those boy
better to die as god made us we thought as soldiers
so i gave the order
mister bugler sound mount up
mister bugler sound prepare arms
there were only thirty of us but we had fire in us yet
i looked down the hill at the destiny ordained for us
and gave the order
mister bugler charge
the little union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill
on sutters hill algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel infantry artillery explosi ons bullets snapping trees shattering
algrens brother davey rides beside him
the wounded sergeant gant pulls himself up waves his cap and yells
bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall
back to the convention hall and straight into them we went
on sutters hill carnage
union and confederate soldiers slam together falling drowning in mud and blood stepped on by panicked hones
algren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other serving death on all sides
a soldier riding next to davey is shot
a horse falls into a shellhole
back to the convention hall hip hip hurray we shouted for we had spirit in us yet more flashes algren slices right and left with his saber
he is a truly gifted swordsman
a tree branch knocks davey from his horse
he sits dazed on the ground
algren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him
single handedly be rallies his men screaming orders then lifts his wounded brother onto the saddle beside him
he leads them downhill toward safel y davey clinging to him for dear life
back to the convention hall before they knew what hit them we had broken through into the rear of the rebel army
on sutters hill algren and his men gather in a copse of trees
they are giddy with the exhilaration of having survived
we did it bro we did it
algrens smile is shortlived though
suddenly the woods erupt with gunfire
trees are shredded
algrens men are literally cut to pieces davey is riddled with bullets his dead body shielding algren from harm until he slides lifeless to the mud
men and horses are torn apart they contort and writhe in agony jerking grotesquely as the bullets rip into them
algren frantica ly tries to locate the source of this firepower
then he sees a gatling gun
six barrels glisten like steel teeth
this early machine gun is the pinnacle of current military might rounds a second a triumph in engineering
with insane courage he wheels and charges the gun
bullets rip into horse and rider alike
algren falls lifeless into the mud
back to the convention hall and the rd rode on to glory
at the back of the hall three elegantly dressed japanese men watch algrens performance
they wear western frock coats and top hats now let me tell you gentlemen if theres one thing on earth i could have had with me on that glorious day
it would have been this beauty
algren holds up a winchester repeating rifle
at the back of the audience we note someone else watching algren
sergeant zebulon gant whom we last saw on sutters hill
the winchester model lever action rifle
shot capacity one round per second accurate at yards
youll note the patented loading port just beneath the cartridge chamber and the smooth cocking action
lets just see here
he peers into the ejection port as he cocks the weapon and sights out over the crowd
the report echoes among the screams of the ladies
dust and glass fall from a rear chandelier
smooth trigger action too
audience members murmur nervousl y
this is gentlemen the gun that is winning the west
step on up and take a look
mccabe is here to answer any question and take orders
i thank you
a winchester representative is handing algren an envelope
what the hell was that
got their attention didnt i
boston in three weeks
and sober this time
algren immediately starts counting the cash
algren sits alone on the bed
he takes out a leather bound journal and begins to write
the dead are with me tonight
they return each time i am obliged to tell their story
algren sips absinthe
he stares at the milky green liquid before him
i can almost see them in the shadows their bodies whole and beautiful once more
sometimes its as if they call to me in a sweet invitation
algren walks in the fog
sputtering gas lamps give an unearthly glow
we are dead they whisper and we are happy
algren is back in the hotel room
from his small suitcase he takes the medal of honor looks at it for a long moment
do not be afraid they whisper
you have been dead too
a sudden flash we are back on sutters hill
algrens slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody ground dead to the last man
a rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at each body before it is loaded onto a wagon
algrens turn is no different than the others
he is declared dead and hoisted unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses
back in the
algren sits staring into the middle distance
is this why they gave their lives
so that i might disgrace their memory
he reaches into the suitcase and takes out a colt revol ver
stares at it cracks the cylinder to make sure its loaded
his finger wraps around the trigger the barrel makes its wa y toward his head
and then unaccountabl y he is laughing
and why after taking so many lives do i find myself incapable of taking just one more
a knock on the door
algren shuts his eyes then calls out
go awa y
not exactly the greeting i imagined
algren looks up
he knows that voice
he carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before opening the door
thought youd seen the last of me i expect
algren is filled with emotion which he tries to hide
gant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp
saw your little melodrama toda y
given up soldiering to become a critic
gant smiles and shakes his head
got a job for you unless youre running for office
i have i job
i mean a real job
back in uniform
i m retired
i dont mean a u
algren looks at him
curious despite himself
gant leads algren into a lush san francisco restaurant
flickering gaslight and trays of lobster
colonel benjamin bagley whom we saw in flashback sits with the three japanese men
bagleys hair has greyed
has his eye on a political future
nathan good to see you
stunned colonel bagley
this is mr
omura from japan and his two associates who so far as i can tell dont have names
omura is a handsome and intelligent man
he watches algren closel y as algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter
theyre looking to hire real american soldiers to create the first japanese imperial army
algren looks at him
japans got it in mind to become a civilized country and theyre willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts to do the job right
algren takes a slow lip of whiskey
sergeant gant has already agreed to serve
you would be m y second in command
with approval from washington of course
both governments prefer to consider our mission unofficial
wed be there as non combatants only advisors to the japanese officers
help them with training ordinance and the like
you ought to think about it
unless you intend to take up a career in the theater
i have an agreement with the winchester corporation im sure these people have some concept of what an agreement is
omura suddenly speaks
his english is flawless
you are paid seven dollars for each performance
you do on average fourteen performances a year
we will pay you dollars
algren looks at him
the figure in is staggering
a steamship chums its wa y across the great pacific
algren leans on the ships rail and looks out into an endless processi on of wa ves
it is impossible standing here not to appreciate ones own insignificance
a dolphin crests the surface arcing into the air
here there is neither past nor future
only an oblivion of water
in his tiny cabin algren finishes writing in his journal and takes out a daguerreot ype of a hauntingly beautiful blond woman
and yet i ask myself will the dead follow me across the ocean to this strange new land
he stares at the woman in the picture
in the main cabin algren sits with gant and omura
algren is drinking
after the shogun gave up power the daimyos you would call them warlords knew that japan needed a centralized government
so they asked
the hereditary emperor his highness the enlightened meiji to lead the country
and these warlords just
gave up hundreds of years of power
economic incentives were offered
most provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of modernization
what about those that didnt
to deal with those who have resisted the emperor has decided to create an army with allegiance only to him
we considered hiring advisors from germany but your ambassador reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious elements in your civil war
this evocation of the civil war is not lost on algren
who are we supposed to be fighting against
his name is mori katsumoto
he is samurai
the word you might use it warrior
but that does not quite capture it
katsumoto once served the emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a band of traitors
he must be punished
algren looks pointedly at bagley
you told them about our experiences together on sutters hill did you colonel
they know i was your commanding officer
algren glares at bagley then stands
excuse me gentlemen
i need some air
to omura im sure colonel bagley can amuse you with more stories of patriotic gore
he walks away
he is insolent
get him in front of the troops youll see
top of his class at west point
even wrote a book
why did he leave your army
whats a hero to do when theres no more great battles
is that an evasive answer
sir this man was left for dead at sutters hill
doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating but before they could bury him he came back to life
after the war he fought the sioux the cree and the blackfoot
point him at the enemy
he was born for it
algren lies in his cramped berth
a sudden flash on the wagon of dead bodies algrens eyes open to stare into the unblinking eyes of his brother davey half his face shot off
he tries to move but be is buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him
blood drips down into his eyes and mouth blinding and choking him
back to the ship algren awakens bathed in sweat
a silhouette in the doorwa y
colonel bagley stands looking down at him
i hope you realize the kind of second chance this is for you
i wont tolerate insubordination
algren reaches for a nearby glass drains it
court martial me
would you rather i hadnt recommended you for the medal
is that it
we both know why you helped me colonel
dont expect me to go all weepy with gratitude
i expect you to do your job
save the self pity for your own time
he turns and walks out leaving algren to stare at the empty glass
algren and gant stand at the rail
if the lord bad wanted man to sail he wouldnt have created infantry
how many rimes you puke today
im down to two
omura comes up next to them
i understand you are a scholar captain algren
to gant have you read his book
cant say i have
an analysis of the triumph of weapons technology over antiquated military tactics
wr y a real page turner
sold twelve copies
nonetheless i was impressed
i enjoy reading military history
i spent two years studying english at princeton university
and where did you learn to speak japanese
omura is perplexed by algrens remark then realizes he is being kidded
he laughs heartily
algren laughs with him
a connection is made
yes and in japanese there are twenty seven words for war
i will be impressed if you learn only half of them
he walks away
algren watches him go
his face darkens
i got twenty seven words too reb sioux pawnee blackfoot jappo
only one language when it comes to war
like all japan yokohama is at the cusp of a new era
ancient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships
after days at sea they are all glad to climb down the gangplank
the yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds
japanese competes with german and english and french and russian
warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries
one striking japanese character dominates the symbol for omura
it is seen on buildings warehouses and the headbands of scores of laborers
a series of palanquins litters carried by bearers await our voyagers
as does simon graham a dissipated englishman who has lived in japan for many yean
slender and pale with an occasional consumptive cough in his s he wears a white linen suit a bit worse for wear
captain algren this is mr
he will be your translator
youll be quartered at the embassy for now
the emperor will summon you at his pleasure
graham ushers algren and gant into their own less ornate version
if you please captain
theyre gonna carry us
youre guests of the emperor
you cannot walk
algren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers
why the hoods
so you wont have to burden your eyes by looking at slaves
oh excuse me theyre servants now
coughs wipes a bit of blood this wa y gentlemen
their bearers maneuver them through the bustling streets of yokohama
white face painted geishas walk alongside bearded russians
traditional japanese kimonos alongside european suits and hats schizophrenic world of ancient japan versus modern commercialism
twenty years ago yokohama was a lovel y little port
then your commodore perry arrived and changed all that
all this in twenty years
western wa ys
hired lawyers from france doctors from germany naval architects from britain civil engineers railway designers scientists teachers
and of course warriors from the united states
buying the future
or selling the past
a shoji screen is opened by a bowing servant to reveal the clean classic lines of a japanese room
algren is about to enter when graham stops him indicating for algren to remove his boots
algren scowls confused and struggles to pull off the high filthy boots
he takes in the foreigness of the room an arrangement of fl owers on a low table
and this points to a mat is your bed
he points to a block of wood
you mean to say there are no real beds in japan
for its entire history japan his been completely aakoku i closed country
thirty years ago if you had washed up on japanese soil
you would have been beheaded on sight
now they let you keep your head
and give you a wooden pillow
in the pristine grounds of the embassy a garden party is in progress
incongruous lilting yankee tunes are heard from the japanese band
algren and gant now in their dress uniforms wander through the party with graham
liveried servants pall trays of canapes
elsewhere we see diplomats representing all the powers currently trying to devour japan russia england germany france spain etc
i remember when it was just america and the dutch
now ever ybody s getting into the game
they pass two german diplomats
the germans glance to algren and gant with suspicion bow tersely
graham greets them in german
the germans are particularly eager
what do they want
same thing your country wants
most favored nation status
how long have you been in japan
oh western time quickly loses its meaning here i first came as part of the british legation in
but i was soon relieved of m y position as a result of various
disagreements with the crowns attitude toward the locals
omura separates himself from his entourage and approaches
i hope you are enjoying a taste of home
ive done with worse believe me
america has much to offer us though
its industry and ingenuity are without peer
ingratiating i have spoken to the emperor about you
he is interested in the most modem theories of warfare
i look forward to the opportunity of meeting him someday
you will have that chance sooner than you think
he has requested an audience
graham is open mouthed at this turn of events
algren and bagley sit with graham in an ornate carriage as they cross the moat and enter the ancestral palace of the shoguns
algren waits with bagley and graham outside the throne room
remember that he is arahitogami
a god in human form
during the last two hundred years no emperor was even seen by commoner
you may look at him with deference but do not speak unless you are spoken to
algren and gant are surprised to discover the living god is barely in his twenties
the divine emperor meiji is an intelligent and curious young man yet there is a tentativeness about him
his throne is surrounded by advisors principal among them is omura
nearby the american ambassador swanbeck a cagey diplomat the throne room itself is sweeping beautiful and extremely restrained
everywhere tasteful displays of the traditional flower of the monarchy chrysanthemums
the vibrant yellow bl ossoms haunt the chamber
as the emperor considers his guests omura whispers into his ear
then the emperor bids you welcome
he wishes you to know that he is most grateful for the assistance your country offers ours in order to rid ourselves of the brutality of the provincial warlords and
to accomplish the same national harmony which you enjoy in your homeland
the emperor speaks in japanese
the advisors are non plussed and omura leans down for a moment to confer with him then smiles indulgently the emperor is most interested in your american indians and wishes
to know if you have seen them firsthand
algren looks at graham who nods
he may speak
i have seen many of them and have fought them too
they are very brave
the emperor nods and smiles
accented english thank
everyone else hurries to follow suit
the audience is over
a gren graham and bagley walk through the palace grounds
that young pup runs this country
that pup runs the country no more than i do
he was installed as a figurehead at age twelve when the warlords realized japan needed a central government
but dont be fooled he may be a powerless god but to these people hes a god nonetheless
general yoshitaka appears
he is a seasoned soldier in his s
a decent man
he stops before them bows quickly
gentlemen may i present general yoshitaka
he will assist you in training the army
algren offers his hand
general yoshitaka does not take it
he bowl his head and speaks a few words
graham translates he greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if you are ready to meet the imperial army
about a thousand japanese soldiers in baggy uniforms are milling around a large parade ground
each has an old single shot rifle
algren gant and yoshitaka look down on them from a reviewing stand
ask the general what training they ve had
graham speaks to general yoshitaka then translates his response
he sa ys
we have trained them not to shoot their
algren glances to general yoshitaka who looks back wr yl y
sergeant gant have the men stand to attention
imperial army atten tion
graham translates rather mildly
for gods sake lets not keep it a secret whos in charge here
roars as the soldiers immediately stand to attention we begin a montage of the training of the first imperial army we see gant drilling the men
shouting at his translator
trying to get them to march in formation
algren is nearby watching
as i watch this new army train i cannot help but think of those who rode with me in me rd cavalry
algren sits in his tent writing in his journal
outside the japanese are being taught the basics of firing tactics
for four years they had survived never once shrinking from the fire
and so when given my order to charge the advancing rebel infantry they never hesitated
and they all died
we see algren showing the japanese how to fire in formation
the old single shot rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process
now i am training another army
in another civil war
algren and gant spar with sabers algrens expertise far exceeds gants a fact which gant accepts with good humor
is this why i was spared
once again to lead men to their death
it is sunset algren graham and general yoshitaka watch the training
general yoshitaka speaks
yoshltaka graham the problem is theyre peasants
they have never had this sort of responsibility or power
algren watches gant march beside the japanese
they are illuminated by the majestic red sunset to graham ask him if they have a flag
genera yoshitaka responds
they need a flag
tokyo is a city in chaos
everything seems out of balance
a collision of eastern and western
algren and gant watch as graham prepares to take a photograph of an old merchant in front of his store
ive been doing this for years
trying to capture it before its all gone
afraid im losing the battle
algren silently watches the passers by
something draws his attention across the street
a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk
his martial bearings two swords traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly identify him to us as a samurai
we will meet him again later he is ujio
a terse grim man in his s
his proud gait and rigid imperious manner intrigue algren
most of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y bowing in deference
but two young japanese in western dress do not
ujio stands before them waiting for them to move
tense words are exchanged
ujio glares at them
now this should be interesting
hes waiting for them to show deference
across the street uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two japanese men
they laugh in response
then one of the men raises a hand and barks some clearly disrespectful words back like lightning ujio pulls out his long samurai sword it flashes cleanly beheading the disrespectful
japanese man the beheaded corpse begins to fall in one smooth motion ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls and sweeps it back into its scabbard
the other man immediately drops to his belly prostrating himself
without another glance ujio walks awa y
his face is completely impassive
what the hell was that
is a samurai
sergeant gant gazes unhappily at his dinner glistening raw fish tepid beancurds boiled rice
algren gant graham and general yoshitaka sit cross legged on the floor
gant finds this extremely uncomfortable
before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate himself in the presence of a samurai
what edicts are those
the council of state has been passing a series of laws designed to eliminate the samurai
because you are here now sergeant
for the last years guarding japan and fighting her wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai
the next course arrives
thick black eel
men like mori katsumoto were the most elite caste in japanese societ y until the council of state led by your friend omura decided the whole class had to go
munching eel most of the samurai accepted the new laws
but some didnt
general yoshitaka speaks up
graham translates general yoshitaka bids you to remember that the word samurai means one who serves
their whole existence is based on serving their country as warriors
graham finishes translating then continues on his own your imperial army is taking awa y their only reason for being
so what are they to do now
algren considers this as he pours another cup of sake
this is sake
to yoshitaka good
enthusiastically tries an english word
vexing people the samurai
blood thirsty honorable cruel fabulousl y artistic
wanted to write a book about them for years but no westerner can get close enough
ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle
graham looks at a gren
he is samurai
algren looks at yoshitaka with new eyes
later that night
algren and gant a little drunk by now wander tokyos bustling red light district
like amsterdam the geishas sit in windows facing the street
this is certainly not the whorehouse they expected
elegant japanese furnishings
lovel y flute music
the madam lowers her head and speaks quietly in greeting
my friend and i were looking for some companionship
the madam speaks no english
gant speaks louder as if to a deaf person
ladies of the evening
tries a bow to the madam so sorry
gant flashes a fistful of japanese currency
the madam nods and bows
almost magically two beautifully dressed geishas appear their faces are painted pure white
one of the geishas smile
her teeth are blackened to better set off the whiteness of her face paint that ones yours
algren and gant are led into an elegant room with paper screens and a table set for the japanese tea ceremony
gant tries to take the arm of one of the geishas but she moves awa y gesturing for him to sit the other begins the tea ceremony
a musician plays a traditional lute
the geisha begins a graceful fan dance
saw this once in chicago
algren smiles at the geisha preparing the
she smiles back
algren pours himself a cup of sake
the sake bottle is empty
the interminable lute music continues
gant is increasingly agitated as the geisha continues her dance
algren cant help but laugh at his frustration
finally gant has had enough
he rises a bit unsteady from the sake
okay darlin time to get down to business he shoos the musician out of the room then approaches the geisha who shrinks from his intention
i dont think she shes just shy
who knows what we white devils have got in our trousers eh darlin
he takes her arm
she resists her voice rising
come on now
he tries to pull her along
her kimono tears
she calls out in terror
two men appear bouncers presumably but alight of build
the madam yells angrily at gant in japanese
pushing him out roughly
now hold on there sister
i paid good money
one of the bouncers puts his hand politely on gants arm
back off short stuff
this time the bouncer is more insistent
gant takes a swing at him
before gant knows what hit him the little man uses gants momentum in an akido move to flip him to the mat hard
algren can only stare in awe at the lethal move
as the second bouncer moves to confront him bowing apologetically algren speaks in english smiling knowing they cant understand a word hes saying
obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people much larger than you so well be leaving now
the training continues
we see gant now sporting a black eye
algren walks with general yoshitaka and graham
graham translates the general wishes to know if you bad a pleasant evening
algren looks at yoshitaka who gives him
educational yoshitaka nods would the general mind telling me more about our common enemy
yoshitaka looks at him
has algren deliberately used the word enemy knowing that yoshitaka too is a samurai
algren gives nothing awa y
mori katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader
to those who honor the old ways hes a hero
his force is estimated at about five hundred and growing by the day
what kind of man is be
general yoshitaka considers his words
katsumoto has no fear
he has no pity
he is kotsutai the soul of old japan
he is my honored kinsman
we grew up together in yoshino
marched together and fought together
he is kaishaku the brother of my spirit
algren considers this as they observe rifle practice
erratic but improving
algren notes yoshitakas reaction
the rifles seem to make him unhappy
ask him what kind of guns katsumoto has
the samurai dont use guns
no ask him what kind of firearms they have
yoshitaka responds with disdain the samurai no longer dishonor themselves by touching firearms
algren is surprised at this bit of information
a servant approaches bows
colonel bagley requires you
colonel bagley and algren stand at a map
theyre not a fighting unit yet we have no choice
refers to the map the railroad has been stopped here
just as it entered yoshino katsumotos province
captain we cannot govern a country in which we cannot tr avel freel y
katsumotos provocation is strategic
his defeat will demonstrate to the other disloyal samurai that resistance is an act devoid of honor
the rebels dont have a single rifle
theyre savages with bows and arrows
you get up there and show em how it done
with respect sir i need more time
with all due respect
this railroad cannot wait
he bows and leaves them alone
bagley spins on a gren
you think were the only country interested in japan
you dont think the germans and the french would like to oversee the new army
colonel brutally why do you think were here captain
because remington and colt and winchester have powerful allies in washington
were here to sell a shitload of american guns
that shouldnt be bud for a winchester whore like you to understand
algren looks at him murderously
a steam engine lends plumes of smoke into the air as it waits
algren bagley and general yoshitaka ride along the railroad line
the imperial army follows with sergeant gant on foot
a traditional japanese village is being torn aside to make room for the railroad line
houses are being leveled and black smoke drifts up
the displaced villagers gather belongings
omura guards herd them about rather bruta ly
railroad workers are laying a new spur building a brick station
a gren notes the by now familiar omura symbol on the new water tower and on the headbands of the guards and workers
what is that sign
its the symbol for the omura zaibatsu
old family businesses that own ever ything worth owning
the molt powerful is the omura zaibatsu
thats your friend omura
they own all of this
they do now
severed heads on pikes line the road a warning to those who continue to resist october
today we entered kansai province
here the local warlords have all been convinced to accept the emperors rule
they pass a particularly wrenching sight
villagers kneeling outside what used to be a shinto temple
the railroad tracks cut straight through it
our destination is yoshino home of the rebel katsumoto
protected by high mountain passes it can be reached only during the summer months and even then with great difficulty
the army moves on
ahead are towering mountains
the imperial army winds its way up i steep mountain pass
a long march
and then a battle
a new enemy but the same feeling i had in my guts at twenty one in the cornfield at antietam men will die here today and will i be among
algren and bagley on horseback wait with graham
general yoshitaka and a few japanese commanders are mounted as well
the thousand strong japanese army is on foot they stand rifles ready
to graham ask him how theyll come at us
graham speaks to general yoshitaka
yoshitaka responds theyll come straight on
they will push forward and keep on attacking
and he adds that there is no samurai word for retreat
algren prepares himself
general yoshitaka is suddenly alert
he speaks quietly to graham
he sa ys theyre coming
algren gazes into the thick fog ahead sees nothing
bagley looks worried
captain algren have you posted a rear guard to protect our supply train
who is overseeing their deployment
algren is somewhat confused by the question
graham you will accompany me to the rear
i want to be certain we are protected from any surprise assault
before algren can respond bagley has left the front lines with graham in
gant watches as they head out of harms wa y
son of a bitch
almost to himself im going to kill him
waste of good ammo
gant checks his two revol vers
the methodical clicking of the chambers as he checks his rounds is the only sound
then absolute silence
a light snow begins to fall
algren continues to peer into the fog
then a sound
building through the fog
the steady rumble of horses
slowl y approaching
closer and closer
algren notes some of the japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear
algren peers again into the fog
but the sound is closer
then the sound abruptly stops
silence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers
sergeant gant order the troops to assume staggered firing positions
imperial army assume staggered firing positions
his order is translated
the japanese soldiers prepare to fire one row kneeling the other standing behind them
one of the japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension
algren can see nothing through the dense fog
the tension is unbearable
then a form on horseback
like lame sort of medieval monster
an elaborate horned helmet
sweeping samurai armor
all we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog
like something from a nightmare
and then another figure
as mounted samurai warriors slowl y move into position
the japanese troops are terrified quickly hold the line
hold the line
the order is translated
a terrible beautiful moment of absolute stasis
the japanese soldiers wait
the ghostly silhouettes wait
then as if a silent signal were given the samurai suddenly charge emerging from the fog in a great wave
the force of a tsunami
the silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war cries that chill the blood sweeping forward on their hones like lightning swords and spears flashing the japanese
troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot rifles others fumble at the ask and then break and run panic and chaos hold the line
too late the samurai are on them they attack with an intensity few have ever seen many of the japanese soldiers try to escape turning and running in blind panic
they are butchered run through by the ashigaru cut inhalf by the naginata
those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows fired by mounted samurai
sound fall back
sound fall back
a bugler sounds the order
the army begins to retreat
but suddenly they are attacked from behind as well
arrows shoot from the fog and more mounted samurai appear
they are surrounded
algren gant and the japanese offi cers call out orders but all discipline soon breaks down it is every man for himself the battle swirls ever ywhere around us
fleeing soldiers are run through by lances run down and trampled by horses
each samurai wears individual vibrantly col ored armor
various battle flags sweep through the fog
gant uses his two cavalry revolvers firing constantly finally out of ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a winchester repeating rifle crouching and
quickly firing algren uses his revol ver first firing as he turns on his horse when the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber
he manages to parry the lethal blows as the samurai hurtle past but one samurai his armor all in black comes at him on a collision course and slams into
him sending both horse and rider to the ground
algren scrambles to his feet his saber nowhere to be found as another rider heads toward him carrying a lance
algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground wrestling the lance from his grip and running him through
in the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing
one samurai is just sitting on his horse
this samurai wears a black mask
the masked samuari watches algren fight
algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past
he spears one and then unseats another
when a third samurai cuts his lance in half algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down
the masked samurai continues to watch algren
algrens tenacity is amazing
he continues to fight with heroic passion refusing to give an inch long after those around him have fled
then a blaze of bright yellow a samurai in yellow armor galloping past firing arrows steadily from horseback
his control and speed are astounding
we will come to know him as yoritomo a handsome young samurai
yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow the speed is breathtaking two arrows slam into gant knocking him to the ground
the battle meanwhile has become a rout
those imperial soldiers who fight are easily cut down
those who flee are run down like prey
left alone algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru samurai foot soldiers carrying pikes
he turns to discover his retreat cut off by other
samurai wielding katana the lethal long sword
but rather than give any quarter algren launches an attack
he kills one samurai before he is run through at the shoulder by a lance
in agony algren snaps off the hilt of the lance leaving its tip buried deep in his chest and fights on
he manages to parry a blow which slices into his side
the next blow takes off a piece of his scalp
blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes
algren is now surrounded by ten samurai
a mans heroic stand against certain death is of great interest to them
as they begin to close in algren whirls the lance around a tattered battle flag with tiger insignia still dangling from the end
the masked samurai removes his mask
it is the japanese man whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story
his eyes wide in surprise he watches his dream come to life the blue tiger holding the dogs at bay
in slow motion algren whirls the lance as one samurai wearing blood red armor advances
with a murderous smile he draws his katana
algren seems spent he drops to one knee swaying on the brink of losing consciousness
but as the red samurai lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow algren suddenly leaps up and propels the jagged wooden end of the
broken lance into the unprotected throat of his attacker
as the samurai falls the rest of his comrades close in to cut algren off
a harsh command stops them in their tracks
the masked samurai leaps from his horse
everyone steps aside deferentially so that be might pass by without being jostled
he looks down at algren then removes his battle helmet
and we meet mori katsumoto the leader of the samurai
he it an imposing man of about algrens years
sensing that he is about to be killed algren pulls himself t o his knees and swings his saber at katsumoto
with blinding speed katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard
algrens saber is snapped cleanly in two
katsumoto looks down at algren
then gant appears behind katsumoto limping toward him cocking his rifle urgently trying to save algren ujio the samurai we saw earlier on the streets of tokyo leaps to protect
his sword flashes
gant is eviscerated
algren watches in horror
a dreadful beat as gant stands pathetically trying to hold his guts in
then he sinks to his knees
katsumoto turns leaps back onto his horse and trots off
algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse
he crawls to gant blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder
gant is dead
algren looks up to see the battle is lost
the japanese soldiers have fled
or are surrendering injured or dead
and he sees one other thing
general yoshitaka is still on his horse head down
he has not pulled his sword
he has not been hurt
katsumoto rides to yoshitaka
a few serious words are exchanged
katsumoto bows his bead in respect seems to agree to something
both men climb from their horses
general yoshitaka pulls out a small b ade and hands it to katsumoto who holds it out firmly
general yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade plunging it into his stomach embracing katsumoto
it is seppuku the traditional form of samurai suicide
algren watches stunned
then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield
algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured imperial soldiers
killing them one by one with a single stroke
algren looks over the slaughter
and then passes out bill wounds overcoming him
algren is unconscious tied to a horse
the mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass disappearing into the soaring mountains of yoshino
katsumotos village is the other japan
the japan we have not yet seen
the gorgeous mountain scenery of yoshino envelopes the village
snow capped mountains soar in the distance
a valley below with rice fields
after the turmoil of tokyo this place seems a bucolic paradise
traditional wooden japanese architecture
the sense of harmony so markedly absent from the cities
algren barely conscious hunches over his horse
he has lost a lot of blood
katsumoto leads his samurai into the village
as he passes ever y person in the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect
most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at algren with curiosity
katsumoto dismounts in a large square the rest of his men follow suit
a samurai helps algren painfully slide from his horse
katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house
his officers fall into formation around him
algren notes ujio the grim samurai who killed gant in jet black armor glaring at him coldl y
ujio walks forward and screams at algren in japanese
algren doesnt move
this only makes ujio more angry
he paces back and forth like a caged panther spitting invective at algren
algren doesnt move
he watches uji o evenly
this takes incredible will
his wounds are so bad that he can barely stand
suddenly ujio draws his long sword it slashes through the air the blade singing and stops an inch away from algrens face
algren doesnt move
ujio brings the cutting edge into contact with algrens check
blood runs where even this feather light touch cuts algrens skin
algren doesnt move
ujio glares at him
then sheathes his sword and walks away
katsumoto looks at algren deepl y gauging him
then be speaks
algren is surprised
you cannot escape
we are deep in the mountains and winter is coming
katsumoto turns and walks into his house
uji o follows him
fade to black
as algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world
a woman is leaning close her eyes intent on the task of sewing up his wound
she is beautiful but he is not really conscious enough to notice or
even feel the pain
he blacks out again
algren wakes again
he is lying on a simple mat
his injuries are such that he can barely move his head
he takes in the traditional japanese furnishings
a red ball rolls across the floor
and after it
toshiie a little boy
the boy l ooks at algren
offers him the ball
a gren blacks out
algrens eyes open
through the archway he can see toshiie and his older brother higen around ten
also the beautiful woman who earlier was stitching his wound
from his recumbent position algren watches as she ministers to the boys who are dearly her sons
algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet attention she gives them
she seems to sense him
her eyes raise meet bit
she speaks to someone and yoritomo appears
he is twenty one too young to be the womans husband
yoritomo comes into algrens room
speaks to him
algren shakes his head
doesnt understand yoritomo speaks to the woman who approaches and places bowl of soup in front of algren
he ignores it the boys stand in the doorwa y
yoritomo shoos them awa y
algren glances up at the woman
her eyes avoid his her expression is opaque
algren now sits in the main room
the woman is changing the dressing on his wounded right shoulder and arm
yoritomo kneels across from algren
he is impressed at the many battle wounds on algrens body the old bullet wounds and scars
in japanese he indicates his admiration
algren his no idea what yoritomo is saying
finally he interrupts with the only japanese word he has bothered to learn sake
yoritomos face breaks into a wide smile
yoritomo glances to the woman
she nods and brings a gren a saucer of sake
he drinks it down
holds out the saucer for a refill smiling yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply but before she can pour another saucer algren takes the jug out of her other
yoritomo laughs as algren drinks it down
autumn leaves fall to the ground
in a tiny hut the village swordsmith begins work on a samurai blade
algren writhes on his mat
trapped in his recurrent nightmare
a sudden flash the wagonload of the dead
daveys bl oody corpse closes in on algren suffocating him
back in the house yoritomo and the woman are asleep in separate rooms
a piercing scream shatters the night the screaming continues
lamps are lit around the village
yoritomo and the woman hurry to algrens room algren in the throes of his recurring nightmare awakens disoriented
yoritomo and the woman confer
yoritomo looks it algren and shakes his head no
yoritomo refuses algren roars and tries to rise
laughing at algrens ferocit y in his weakened condition yoritomo easily pushes him back down
algren folds in on himself rocking like a feral animal
katsumoto stands outside the house drawn by the commotion
ujio stands with him shaking his bead
subtitles my lord why do you spare the barbarian
he is shamed in defeat be should kill himse f
subtitles the barbarian doesnt know hit shame
subtitles then i will kill him
pats him subtitles ujio san he will still be shamed tomorrow or in a month
for now there are things i wish to learn
a glimpse of village life fish are hung on lines to dry children chase each other clothes are washed in the river and in the rice fields below farmers squat
as they have for thousands of years
in his hut the swordsmith continues to hammer and fold the blade
algren sits hunched in a dark corner
his body is convulsed with shivering
his withdrawal from alcohol his wounds his isolation and his imagined sins are devouring him
then we see he is not alone
the woman stands in the doorway watching him closel y
finally she enters with a bowl of soup
he glances up something like panic in his eyes
she kneels and attempts to hand him the soup but be knocks it out of the wa y and grabs her by the throat
she stares at him the breath being squeezed out of her but there is not even a whisper of fear in her eyes
she is utterly impassive
shaken he lets her go and crumples to the floor
mumbling to himself sake
the woman leaves the soup and wa ks away
daylight streams in finding algren lying on his back
the worst of the detox is past
as be lies there these first moments of repose lead to a sudden flash of memory the beautiful blond woman from the picture laughs merrily and falls back languorousl y
in a grassy fi eld
back in the room algren shakes off the memory as harsh sounds from outside draw him to the window
algren watches from the window as the samurai train
it is like nothing else in the world
part sacred ritual part martial preparation samurai training com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole
finally well enough to walk algren comes out onto the porch to watch the spectacle
in front of him is a kendo the way of the sword master practice with their long and short swords
they have incredible control
nakao a mountain of a man is a karate master
he stands unarmed four samurai facing him
they attack with wooden swords
he effortlessly defeats them the agility of the huge man is shocking
kyudo the way of the bow masters use their bows for target practice
yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows
in the distance a line of plums
yoritomo just seems to stand there his eyes hall open
and then in a stunning blaze of movement yoritomo fires the arrows one after another amazingly fast cleanly hitting each plum
the final arrow splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree
a wooden sword leans against the porch
algren idly picks it up feeling its balance
in a flash uji o has raced over and grabbed it from him
algren stands motionless as ujio screams at him
the training stops as everyone watches uji o berate algren
even as ujio continues screaming
algren simply shakes his head turns awa y and walk back into the house
as the sounds of training resume outside algren explores the house
he comes upon higen and toshiie playing with the red ball
they are embarrassed to encounter him alone
theres a moment of suspension and then higen throws the ball to algren
algren looks back and forth between the two boys fixes his gaze on higen but throw the ball to toshiie causing both boys to laugh and run awa y
algren walks on
algren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been made into a kind of shrine
cand es and incense burn a small buddha sits on a dais and algrens eyes are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner
the bright red armor of the warrior algren killed in the fog is held upright by an unseen stand
it is almost as if the dead warrior himself is swing back at him
algren senses someone behind him and turns
the woman is standing across the hall
their eyes meet
she turn and walks away
a first light snowfall has covered the ground
a gren walks out into the still night
he turns a corner and confronts curious sight ten warriors kneel motionless in the snow their eyes closed in concentration
as algren puzzles over this he becomes aware that katsumoto is now standing next to him
they are training
it is called bushido
algren looks at him
he has never heard the word
the wa y of the warrior
we study from when we are young
are my words correct
algren does not respond
i will practice my eng ish with you
why do you learn english
to know m y enemy
if i am your enemy why have you not killed me
katsumoto doesnt answer
was general yoshitaka your enemy
no i honor his memory as my kinsman
that why you helped him kill himself
if a samurai is defeated in battle he must take his own life to spare himse f the shame of capture
it is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend help him
i was honored to by his kaishaku
hell of an honor
it was his destiny
he knew it he died at peace
who was the warrior in the red armor
my son in law
his name was hiroshi
and the woman who cares for me
my daughter hiroshis wife
her name is taka
algren is incredulous
i killed her husband
it was an honorable death
katsumoto walks awa y
algren it now well enough to kneel at the table with the others
taka treats him with utter politeness and dignity
he watches her intently seeking any sign of the animosity hes certain she must feel
she hands him a bowl of rice
smiling politely you hope i choke on it dont you
she bows uncomprehending
you want to poison it and watch me fall over the table and foam at the mouth
yoritomo bows in response to algrens new willingness to communicate
to taka subtitles i promise ill make him take a bath
yoritomo leads algren to a large wooden bathing tub in i secluded part of the village
a banked fire smolders beneath it
embarrassed yoritomo indicates to algren that be needs to bathe
algren strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water
yoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono
a gren is taken aback
used to western privacy he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man
yoritomo unconcerned climbs into the tub
he chats pleasantly as they bathe showing off his old battle wounds
algrens discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother appears
she happily strips and joins them in the tub
algren sinks a little lower into the water
the old grandmother smiles at him with her toothless grin
feeling self conscious in the clean kimono hes wearing for the first time walks back with yoritomo
kids start walking with them pointing at his japanese garb laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs
they pass by ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords
nearby higen and toshiie are imitating the grown ups sparring with wooden swords that are much too big for them
yoritomo watches his nephews proudly murmuring details of their prowess to algren who has no idea what hes talking about
higen charges his little brother but goes careening past right toward algren who deftl y dodges out of the wa y
this causes gales of laughter from the boys one of whom takes toshiies sword and offers it to algren
algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f ourish causing the boys to applaud
yoritomo bows and encourages a gren in higens direction
algren shakes his head politely but higen is already on the attack
algren dodges one thrust then parries another as the boys begin to cheer
suddenly ever yone goes silent
ujio is standing behind him arms folded
ujio barks a command in japanese
he wants algren to drop the sword
it is obvious to algren what it must mean but he does nothing
ujio approaches algren slowl y
algren holds the wooden sword casually only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment
ujios wooden sword flashes quicker than the eye can follow
algrens sword is knocked from his hands then somehow in the same fluid movement ujio brings the sword around and cracks algren across the chest hard enough to knock the
breath from his body and lend him to his kneels
satisfied with himself uji o starts to walk away but the expressions of the bystanders cause him to turn back
algren is standing again and again holding the sword
with grim purpose uji o returns to algren who has assumed a ready pose
again ujios sword flashes
algren manages to parry one blow before he is cracked across the face and blood begins to flow free y from his nose
ujio knocks algrens legs out from under him and while algren is sprawling on the ground ujio kicks algrens sword out of his hand and starts away
again algren manages to stand up and before ujio can turn charges him
but uji o doesnt need to turn
in a sliding move he dodges and cracks algren in the side then the legs then the neck
gasping for breath at least one rib broken algren writhes on the ground
ujio digs the point of his sword into algrens hand until he releases his grip
again ujio kicks the sword away
the ever enlarging crowd gasps as algren once again struggles to his feet
this time without hesitation uji o runs back and rains blows upon algrens now defenseless body
first the wrist then the back then the stomach then finally the head
algren hits the ground unconscious his fingers still clutching the sword
ujio reaches down pries it from his fingers and breaks it across his knee
algren lies painfully on a mat his eyes unfocused
a sudden flash of memory the lovel y blond woman tears in her eyes looks up to algrens shining face the epaulets on his crisp officers uniform gleaming gold in
the reverie is broken
as taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face
he stares at her darkly
who are you people anywa y
she makes no attempt to understand or respond
you have no god you have no mercy you dont even have any fucking walls
your walls are made of paper whats the matter with you
she pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck
this man tries to kill me and ive done nothing to him and you i kill your husband and you act like what
like im a guest in your house
what is wrong with you
this last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl of soup she had brought for him and bringing it to his lips
do you have a soul at all
he stares at her for a moment then knocks the soup out of her blinds
her eyes flash for one moment before resuming their usual mildness
but that flash is enough to satisfy him and he calms down
she walks away
he sighs exhausted only to see her approach again with a new bowl
their eyes meet and hold for a moment
she does have a soul
he takes a sip
algren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine
katsumoto kneels before a small altar
he doesnt seem aware that algren is present
ujio is teaching you the wa y of the japanese sword
is that what hes doing
at what age did you become i soldier
to fight in your american civil war
tell me about that war
what about it
everything about the civil war
katsumoto sits impassively staring at the altar
that would take a year
you have pressing business elsewhere
shaking his head algren sits down
the civil war began on april
when the rebs attacked fort sumter
well actually it probabl y began three years earlier when the supreme court decided a runaway slave had to be returned to his master the two of them hours later
and pickett says he wants to do it over longstreets objections and lee doesnt know what to think but he lets him
so men go up that hill
and most of them die
was that wise
no it was stupid
the point of a battle is to win or at least have enough men survive to fight another day
you did not try to survive when we took you prisoner
algren eyes him frustrated
what do you want from me
what do you want for yourself
you know theyre not going to ransom me
we have little use for money
mounting fury then what are you doing why are you asking me these questions what is going on here
the snows will melt in may and the passes will open and the events of the world will unfold
until that time you are here
smiles i enjoyed this conversation in your english
i hope you will honor me with more tomorrow
katsumoto stands bows and leaves
young toshiie sits near algren
he labors over a scroll with a brush the gentle brush strokes are hypnotic as they sweep across the rice paper
algren tries to indicate that he would like pen and paper for himself
toshiie gives him what he asks
algren begins to write day unknown month unknown
i continue to live among these strange people
katsumoto watches ujio bark orders to the men he is training
a sudden movement of their eyes causes uji o to stop
he turns to find algren standing at the end of the line holding i wooden sword
an almost imperceptible look passes bet ween ujio and katsumoto but ujios resentment is over ruled
without a word he continues
algren does his best to follow the exercise
katsumoto the slightest hint of a smile on his face walks away
each day i am confounded by their strange customs and contradictions savagery followed by mildness
algren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat
he is in considerable pain from the rigors of training
he tries to roll the stiffness out of his neck when be notices that higen it imitating him
they seem to value nothing more than their families and yet they kill defenseless wounded men without a shade of remorse
yoritomo sternly tells higen not to make fun of their guest
yoritomo apologizes to algren who shakes his head unnecessary
they stop shocked
he has spoken
yoritomo calls for taka to serve him more rice then begins yammering enthusiastically in japanese
algren holds up his hand
not so fast ko
bolds up chopsticks what is this
yoritomo is hysterical with glee now
the boys are suddenly dervishes pulling various objects from the table and around the room shouting the japanese words for each
algren shakes his head and smiles for the first time in this stor y
yoritomo manages to quiet the boys
he points to himself
points to himself algren
algren nods and the boys start screaming all gren
points to each in rum higen
turns to taka taka
she meets his eyes for the slightest moment then looks down and walks away
katsumoto is arranging flowers
algren watches in confusion as this powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate
finally the parliament of your country has two houses
why is that
to keep either one from being too powerful
does not a people need a powerful ruler to protect them
we believe the opposite
katsumoto thinks about this
i have a question
how do you come to speak english
members of the council were required to study it
yes i was a member of the government
i helped restore the emperor to the throne
so that japan could have a powerful ruler to protect it
katsumoto understands algrens irony but doesnt smile
and now you must hate him for what hes done
he is my blood
i serve him with my life
by fighting his army
katsumoto looks at a gren
i do not fight the emperor
i fight those who seek to influence him those who betray the soul of my country
he slowl y draws his long samurai sword and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him
the emperor gave this blade to my ancestors years ago
it has been used only to defend his sacred honor
katsumoto hands the sword to algren
algren studies it
it takes many years to make a sword
it is a holy act
a samurais sword is his soul
this sword is flawed
what is this uneven line near the edge
katsumoto smiles at algrens ignorance
one man is flexible and compromises too much to avoid conflict
another man is so fierce he wins ever y battle but so rigid he can never know peace
a man who knows both is the perfect warrior
the lame is true of a blade
one steel bends and the other cuts
and where they meet is never perfect hold the blade up
algren holds the sword cutting edge up
katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it
it gently billows down and splits evenly on the edge
some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the blood of its enemy
algren hands the sword back
suddenly katsumoto swings the sword cleanly splitting the table in two
the crew at winchester can produce one rifle ever y seven minutes
we gave up firearms two hundred years ago
it takes no courage to kill
a man from half a mile awa y
you must look into the eyes of your enemy to know who you have killed
im not sure an artillery officer would agree
i think all killings a filthy business
to taking a mans life is nothing
it is his honor you can never take awa y
in other words you have no respect for human life
what do you know of human life
you come here to kill for money where is your family
where is your wife your sons
what is your legacy
undaunted and what is yours
to rebel against the future
i fought the south in our civil war
their leaders believed they were fighting for honor just as you do
and their people died by the thousands
katsumoto simply looks at him
and my wife is dead
they look at each other
some unexpected recognition has taken place
tomorrow we will discuss your countrys wish for dominance in the
i look forward to it
algren turns to go
we see the village swordsmith at work
he has been forging the same long samurai blade for months
algren watches him as he works
i have never known such a disciplined people
algren trains with the other men
he attempts an attack which is easily brushed aside by nakao
algren ends up in the dirt again
from the moment they wake they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue algren walking with katsumoto they are deep in conversation
and yet the more time i spend here the less i understand them
two women are bowing repeatedly chattering in smiling earnest argument
everyone is polite every nuance of behavior seems to have a great meaning and increasingly i am convinced that the lower they bow the leas they mean it
algren holding the wooden sword in baseball manner is coaxing higen to throw the ball at him
the children laugh as algren hits it onto the next porch
taka watches her sons impassively
it is dear how much they like algren
and i am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding and unfathomable as i find theirs
starts to drip
spring bas begun
villagers laugh as they go about the business of life
a man throws a sack of rice to another
two women hurry awa y from a farmer who is teasing them
algren is once again among the training warriors
he and another man face off each waiting for the other to attack with his wooden sword
algren moves first but his opponent counters and strikes him easily
they wheel around and engage again and again algren is bested
furious he throws himself at his opponent reverting to classic saber technique
in a flurry of movement his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock algren to his knees
yoritomo approaches and bows
a gren san
too many mind
pointing as he explains mind sword mind face mind people watch too many mind
on algrens confused expression no mind
algren nods uncertainly and picks himself up
again he faces the opponent shaking off the tension and trying to stay calm
this time the opponent charges first and algren manages to parry one blow before he is again bested
yoritomo bows happily and begins yammering in japanese clearly taking credit for algrens progress
across the square katsumoto watches
the cherry blossoms have emerged creating a scene of intense col or beauty and serenity
the emperor sits cross legged next to a shrine
he is approached by omura and two other advisors
your majest y beg permission to approach
the emperor nods your humble servants are most anxious to know if his majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress
after a long moment i am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float upon the air as if held by unseen hands
yes they represent the highest form of gyoko
about the order your majest y
this railroad must go through yoshino province
it is absolutely necessar y your highness
if you sa y so i shall sign
algren walks through the village past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade carefully sharpening it
algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village
the pink and red blossoms are dazzling and abundant
other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms
it is a place of otherworldly beaut y
it is all so beautiful that algren just stops
takes it in for a moment
he reaches out and touches a blossom
a perfect blossom is a rare thing
katsumoto is kneeling nearby meditating
you could spend your life looking for one
and it would not be a wasted life
were you praying
i do not think i have the word
satori it means maybe awareness
this moment alone apart from all others
you know this
algren shakes his head i am writing a poem about this time we hive spent
i have only written one line on his eyes were like my own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean
can you suggest a second line
im not much of a writer
is this why you spend so much time with your journal
how do you know that
no answer she told you
katsumoto appraises algren
did you love her husband as your own son
you have sent men to their deaths just as i have
the difference is you feel nothing
before you were a soldier you were a farmer
what does that have to do with anything
you lived on a farm
or in a forest of trees
how do you know
the wa y you look at the cherry blossoms
reluctantly we lived in a place called connecticut
brother and i climbed the maple trees
were they beautiful
and you were sad to see them die in the winter
something flickers in algrens eyes
you were something before you were a soldier
you were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the trees die
katsumoto looks at him deepl y
like those trees we are all dying
the future is an illusion our plans are an illusion our fears an illusion
we live life in every breath
eat drink fuck
every cup of tea
every word we write
every blossom we hold
he smiles sadly
every life we take
he stands takes in the beautiful cherry orchard
life in every breath
that is bushido
the wa y of the samurai
algren stands for a moment deep in thought algren is asleep
and then we note that the ground is vibrating
he slides across his mat
wakes with a start an unholy rumbling algren bolts up
just as a paper wall rips open the wooden framework to the room splits and the roof collapses an earthquake
common for this part of japan
he and algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches violently part of the house contorts and caves in around the village the wooden frame houses are
swa ying and lurching they have some torque but not enough ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire taka appears calling frantically for toshiie
then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly tears through the houses are ripped apart the whole world shifting
though the smoke algren sees toshiie cowering under an eave
a heavy ceiling beam breaks loose threatens to crush toshiie algren dives forward grabs toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y
the front of the house collapses the beams smashing to the ground
taka and higen race to algren and toshiie
the boy is safe
taka grabs the child and cradles him
her look to algren is fierce protective almost feral as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer
algren watches the villagers rebuild
yoritomo and higen strugg e with a large wooden framework
i am str uck by these people and their acceptance of fate in a l it s variations
at a time like this they seem utterly without sentiment
even the children have a gravity beyond their years
algren goes to them
silently begins to help them
algren works with yoritomo binding the wooden framework
higen prepares the paper walls nearby
he does this with considerable skill
taka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes algren helping rebuild her home
yoritomo is working nearby
algrens japanese is rough but improving in japanese subtitles would last longer
house go back easy with wood
algren shakes his head
taka appears with cups of water
algren looks at her for the first rime she holds his gaze
torches illuminate a small stage in the center of the village square
several samurai perform a ritualistic noh drama
a form which by the wa y the samurai invented
others play flutes and large steel drums
and yet i have never seen a people with more capacity for the joy found in the simplest things of life
katsumoto himself plays the lead role
an enthusiastic actor he plays to the children in the audience
they are delighted with his broad theatrics
taka is carrying in a huge lack of rice
algren goes to help her
subtitles no please
he carries the rice for her into the pantry area
subtitles japanese men do not help with this
subtitles i know
she looks at him a little surprised
subtitles i am not japanese
in spite of herself she smiles a little
there is an awkward moment
didnt know he was your husband
struck subtitles he did his duty
you did your duty
subtitles and you do yours
softl y hai
they look at each other for a long moment
she starts to move but he stops her
they are close enough to smell each others hair to feel the warmth of the others breath
she looks up at him pleading with her eyes not to take this any further
he lets her go
algren stands across from ujio ready again for the ken jutso
they stand frozen for a long time hands on the hilts of their wooden swords
other samurai watch
algren and ujio stare at each other
but there is something different about algrens expression
not as much fury and competition more a sense of balance and alertness
he studies ujios eyes his hands the folds of his kimono the attitude of his body
we watch a gren closel y
gradually all sound drains away
we hear only algrens steady breathing
he is aware of everything
a bird in a tree
a woman grinding rice
a plum about to fall
a gently swa ying battle flag slow motion as algren attacks no fury just control ujio tries to deflect the blow algren anticipates he swings his sword elegantly ujio blocks
it algren counters algren presses forward his sword slashing masterfully forcing ujio back ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats algren keeps moving forward calm finally ujios sword is swept aside in one clean movement
algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword it ujios throat
the other samurai watch
algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry fl ourish
the pride he has alwa ys taken in his swordsmanship has been restored
he bows to uji o
ujio nods his head slightly in respect the other samurai led by the hearty nakao congratulate algren
algren carries water from the river through a riot of spring wild flowers
something makes him stop and see the sunlit clouds in the deep blue sky the colors around him hear the buzzing of the bees feel the kill of the air
a sudden flash of memory his beautiful wife in green field not unlike this one laughing tossing her hair falling back into the long grass
back to algren
the force of the memory causes him to link to the ground
another flash of memory longer this time his wi fe leans over and kisses his mouth and his cheek and his forehead
he holds her al tightly as be can
back to algren as tears begin to course down his face and he sinks down into the flowers and the grass looking up into the impossibl y beautiful sky
he gives in to the sobs wracking his body
as algren returns with the water he sees katsumoto approaching with ujio and several warriors
the emperor has requested my presence
we leave tomorrow
you will be released in tokyo
algren stands not sure how to react
algren writes on parchment by the light of an oil lamp
tomorrow we return to civilization
as eager as i am to be among my own kind i confess to a curious reluctance
algren stands overlooking the village as the sun rises over the misty peaks
these months have marked me and i dont fully know yet wh y
algren prepares to mount up
yoritomo says goodbye to his family
i do know it is here that i have known my first untroubled sleep in many years
taka comes to algren bows her head
subtitles you are alwa ys welcome in our home
he glances at the unfinished house
subtitles you will finish it soon
subtitles if that is my destiny
she bows her head again
toshiie hands him a scroll it is a picture of the family
algren is included
japanese characters list all their names
algren bows and tucks the scroll into his coat
algren and yoritomo move out with katsumoto ujio nakao and his bodyguard of several dozen samurai
the villagers bow and honor the warrior as they pass
algren trots alongside katsumoto
the emperor sends a message for you to return to tokyo and you go
even though youre in rebellion against him
against the emperor
i serve him
as i have alwa ys done
i dont understand
our emperor is young and there are things i must sa y to him
but ever yone around him wants you dead
and if the emperor desires i will take my own life at his command
he spurs his horse and rides on
a gren watches him
they approach a large inn
a boy working in the fields see katsumoto approaching
he doesnt believe it the great katsumoto
he drops his hoe and races awa y calling out
we will stop here for the night
samurai guards have been posted around the perimeter
algren is escorted in
katsumoto kneels at a table
preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony
by now he has learned how to sit on the ground
katsumoto begins the exacting delicate and precise tea ceremony
do you drink tea
ive had little else for some time
katsumoto continues with the tea ceremony
hows your poem coming
i am having trouble
the truth is i am not a very good poet
algren smiles do you know wh y you were sent here
to protect the railroad
why is the railroad here
so tokyo can control the whole country
you have seen my province
far from tokyo
yet the rail line must come here
katsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table
algren watches carefully
you have something they want what do they want in my mountains
smiles there is no gold in japan
katsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier
the coal flares a bit
katsumoto looks at him for steamships
and why would steamships be so important
katsumoto looks up at him
japan has nothing
china has ever ything
mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to china
freeze the europeans out and japan and america have a monopol y on the china trade
add to this the omura zaibatsu
you know the zaibatus
the wealthy families
as patron of the railroad omura owns all land within four hundred feet of ever y new rail line
as my country grows so will his wealth
looks at him this is why you are fighting
katsumoto completes the tea ceremony
he pours a cup for algren
bows his head and offers it to him
and you will tell the emperor to stop them
i do not tell the emperor what to do
then what do you hope to accomplish
katsumoto looks at algren the slightest gleam in his eye
will you return to america
algren watches him why didnt katsumoto answer
i have a job here
you should return to your home
because i do not wish you to be m y enemy again
katsumoto returns to his poem he does not look up
go home captain
i wish you peace
algren waits but katsumoto just continues to work on his poem
the samurai guards are alert their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions
but there is another way
another way of learning combat
a wa y without the beaut y the philosophy and the moral code
they are almost imperceptible at first
their head to toe black clothes a perfect camouflage
their silence and stealth are otherworldly
they were then known as shinobi masters of stealth and spying
we know them as ninjas
they float across the ground
creeping an inch ever y hour
complete physica control
one black gloved finger moves
then the next
they crawl and then wait poised on their fingertips and toes
there is no sound as they strike
the samurai guards are garroted in an instant
other ninjas catch the samurais weapons as they fall
no sound disturbs the peaceful night
two samurai guards are in position
one of them glances up at the stars
a ninja throwing star instantly slices into his jugular blood sprays the other guard turns a series of ninja slice into him
the ninjas use mew claws to crawl up the walls like spiders
a samurai guard stands at the edge of the roof
a ninja silently moves toward him
ten feet awa y
he pulls out a shuriken a small needle shaped projectile dips it into a sack of poison
places it carefully into the palm of his hand
and with the flick of his wrist the needle flies stabbing into the samurai he crumples
other ninjas immediately pour over the edge of the roof catching the samurai before he falls
katsumoto cannot sleep
he stares out the window at a nightingale
ujio sits in his room
he is unblinking
swords at the ready
algren cannot sleep either
he sits leaning against a wall
yoritomo drinks tea with nakao the huge martial arts master
a guard stands sentinel
above his head unbeknownst to him two ninjas descend on ropes
one of them swings a long chain to which i barbed knife is attached
as it lodges in the guards chest the second ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard silently before his body hits the ground
katsumoto lies in bed listening to the night bird
it stops singing
katsumoto smiles sadly
he decides to give up on sleep leans forward to rise
this act saves his life
for when the ninjas come they come all at once a ninja suddenly comes tearing straight through the paper wall his sword slashing down
just missing katsumoto
katsumoto calls out an alarm diving and rolling across the floor for his sword
he instantly kills one ninja using his steel tipped war fan to slash his attackers throat
another smashes in through the window
ninjas explode into the main hall
samurai who come out of their rooms are cut down by a variety of weapons one takes a throwing star in the face others are felled by the traditional ninja
to short swords ideal for fighting in confined spaces chain knives nun chaka and others
more ninjas drop from the rafters on ropes
a ninja smashes through the paper wall algren grabs the nearest object a low tea table
and swings it at his head
the ninja dodges the blow and slices at algren with short sword
algren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword lodges deep in the wood
algren flings himself bodily at his attacker
ninja throwing stars spin across the room killing a samurai
yoritomo emerges from his room readying his bow but the dead samurai falls back blocking his wa y
from behind the rice wall yoritomo lets fly an arrow without even looking
it passes through the wall killing the ninja on the opposite balcony
ujio screams a war cry and begins to battle his way up the stairs
with breathtaking moves he slashes hands and limbs forcing the ninja back
nakao fights his wa y up beside him desperately trying to reach katsumotos room
using only his bare hands he catches a ninjas wrist and hurls him over the railing
algren and the ninja are in a death struggle kneeing gouging butting
they awkwardly smash through a paper wall into the next room
katsumoto wields his long sword in one hand and his short sword in the other
it is the first time we have seen him in action and his movements are both beautiful and deadly
but more ninjas are pouring in through the window threatening to overwhelm him
rolling on the ground algren manages to grab a chopstick and stab his adversary through the eye
he picks up the fallen short sword and steps out into the hall
arrows whiz past thudding into the wall beside his head
katsumoto breathing heavily his kimono shredded and bloody is fending off the ninjas increasingly savage attacks as algren enters
algren screams distracting them just long enough for katsumoto to take advantage and kill one
then just as a ninja it about to kill algren katsumoto flings his short sword
it pin wheels across the room hitting algrens attacker in the chest
without missing a beat algren pulls the short sword from the dying ninjas chest and uses it to stab another ninja who thinking algren defenseless has launched an attack
ujio and nakao are back to back a perfect fighting machine as they fight their wa y to katsumotos rescue
they battle ninjas wielding lethal kusarigamas the ninjas swing chains the attached blades slice the air nakao catches the chains and flinging the ninja over the balcony
yoritomo is pinned down
darts and throwing stars shred the rice paper wall above him
he picks off another ninja before changing his position
the blazing sword battle continues
algren throws a beautiful painted standing screen in front of an attacking ninja momentarily confusing him
then he stabs through the screen as a blood stain spreads across the pastoral painting
but another ninja catches algren off guard and slices at him with his short sword
as algren lifts his sword to parry the blow his litile finger is chopped off
he drops the sword momentarily defenseless
across the hallway yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice paper walls
algrens attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow
in katsumotos room algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade
suddenly the ninja jackknifes as if punched by an unseen hand
as he spins dead to the ground we see an arrow lodged bet ween his shoulder blades
yoritomo has fired blindly through the wall killing algrens attacker
nearby a ninja hurls a throwing star at katsumoto
with blind instinct katsumoto turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm
algren meanwhile has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand
he uses the rest of the fabric to tie his hand to his sword before launching himself back into the fray slicing an attacker just as he is about to
together he and katsumoto force the last two ninjas through a paper wall to the next room
they fight all the wa y through that room and blast through another paper wall to the next
the battle continues unabated on the stairs the ninjas spring for position with incredible grace perching and fighting on banisters leaping from one level to the next
it is a mayhem of flashing swords and flailing limbs and flyi ng arrows and spinning ninja stars
sprays of blood splatter against the white rice paper walls
some of the fighting is less than elegant
men bite and wrestle and gouge to survive in close quarters
all of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired heaving for breath their skin flayed open their kimonos ripped their hands and arms and faces blood stained
but more samurai reinforcements follow ujio up the stairs together with yoritomo and nakao they have begun to gain the upper hand
ujio flings both his swords through the air killing two ninjas and dives to fight others his martial arts skills are dazzling
algren and katsumoto are fighting sidc by side and we cut to outside of the inn we slowl y pull away
the sounds of the battle gradually fade
soon it is nothing more than a lovel y rustic inn nestled in the mountains
the battle is over
ninja and samurai corpses litter the inn
we slowl y move up the long stairwa y from the bottom
yoritomo pulls a ninja star from nakaos shou der
then one from his own
we move up another level past more bodies
ujio moves through the ninjas
making sure they are dead
before sheathing his sword he angrily flicks it at the rice paper wall spattering it with the bloody spray
katsumoto wipes his sword on a nearby corpse replaces it in its sheath
he sits beside algren on a stair
both men are exhausted
a long beat as we watch the two warriors
slow fade to
algren katsumoto and the others are nearing the palace
algren slows to a stop his path is toward the city
katsumoto stops looks at him then does something absolutel y extraordinary
he kneels and bows before algren
quickly touching his head to the dirt
then he rises turns and walks toward the palace
algren stands stunned
algren walks onto the parade ground
the change he sees could not be more remarkable
thousands of new japanese troops are drilling with new bolt action mausers
they are precise exact and frighteningly mechanistic their uniforms new and crisp
new german advisors are barking commands
colonel bagley sees him
my god you never cease to astonish
bagley runs over hand extended but algren turns to look at the troops
they have new weapons
the kaiser was only too happy to help
along with his friends at mauser and krupp
thank god we americans still have a few teeth in our head
and they come to the teeth
a row of them
artillery officers in us army uniforms arc instructing japanese offi cers
the ambassador and i have spent eight months kissing omuras ass so hell sign the damn trade pact with us
you spent all this time living with those savages
a gren looks at him hes going to want to talk to you
i need a bath
and your back pay i imagine
algren starts walking away
they got their flag
and we see it
snapping on i flagpole high above the parade ground
it is immediately familiar
a red circle on a white field
the rising sun
the howitzers fire in sequence
thundering blasts that shake the heavens
omura stands above emperor meiji respectful but persistent
the emperor is kneeling tending to his iris garden
it is one of the wonders of the palace a sea of white pink blue and purple blossoms
retainers and servants stand at a distance
one holds a standard with the imperial seal a yellow chrysanthemum
omura sees katsumoto making his way toward them
he talks a bit more quickly to the emperor
katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the emperor the usual sign of extreme respect but the emperor stops him subtitles no mori san
we arc civilized now
katsumoto stops prostrating himself
the emperor offers his hand
subtitles i cannot touch the sacred one
subtitles you can
it is a difficult moment for katsumoto
he simply cannot do it
subtitles did you have a pleasant journey minister katsumoto
subtitles it was uneventful
omura appreciates katsumotos droll response
he assumes that katsumoto is aware of his part in the assassination attempt
subtitles if it is not a great imposition
i desire a moment alone with minister katsumoto
subtitles enlightened one perhaps i can be of service in a conversation of state
subtitles so kind of you but i fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid me in private for neglecting my studies
omura bows his head quickly and goes
the emperor gazes at katsumoto
then subtitles you rise against me my teacher
subtitles no highness i rise against your enemies
subtitles they are my teacher my advisers like you
subtitles they advise in their own interest
subtitles the world is changing mori you have not seen what goes on beyond our borders the inventions the science
i need men who can look outward or soon we will be left behind and defenseless
subtitles i am sworn to defend you even to my last breath
subtit es the samurai live in the past
you cannot defend against a future you dont understand
subtitles if i am no use then i will happily end my life subtitles no mori
it is my wish that you rejoin the council of state
i need your voice
subtitles it is your voice that needs to be heard highness
you are a living god you can do what ever you think is right
the young emperor is silent a moment
subtitles i am a living god only as long as i do what they think is right
subtitle your highness may i beg forgiveness for saying what a teacher must that such a statement is pathetic drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy let alone a
young man i know to have some modest intelligence
the emperor laughs warmly almost happy to be scolded as he once was
subtitles is it possible a living god can be too afraid to make his voice heard
katsumotos look is not unkind tell me what to do mori san
subtitles you are emperor my lord not me
you must find the wisdom for all of us
a series of warehouses beyond which we see warships in the harbor
a gren walks with bagley and two other officers
the cavernous warehouse piled high with huge crates
as soon as they sign the agreement theyre obligated to buy the entire weapons package from colt revol vers to ha liwell twelve pounders
plus this particular item you might recognize
a few stevedores tear open one of the crates
algren hides his astonishment a gatling gun is revealed
theyve been calibrated to fire rounds a minute the new copper cartridges cut down on jamming
algren closes his eyes trying to keep his memories at bay
algren fights the crowds with colonel bagley and ambassador swanbeck
the city i return to is immeasurabl y changed new construction ever ywhere
telegraph wires strung next to an ancient temple
a modern european hotel is going up dwarfing the traditional japanese buildings
huge billboards advertising western goods
a new invention the rickshaw has replaced many of the palanquins
as though tokyo were determined to become another new york or chicago
all in one headlong rush
spiders web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building
it is like a new york office building stabbing into the heart of old japan
the familiar omura character is emblazoned on the side
aside from the occasional bit of japanese decor this could be a buzzing wall street firm
telegraph operators click away
accountants use adding machines
secretaries use pneumatic tubes to send documents back and forth
engineers plot out railway lines
all are dressed in western clothes
algren colonel bagley and ambassador swanbeck enter
to algren if he asks you can talk about ordnance and tactics
but remember this has to do with a lot more than just weapons
an anteroom holds waiting delegations from the various european powers
a babel of language
a pretty american secretary looks up from her desk
ambassador swanbeck if youll follow me
some of the delegates arc craning forward watching algren and the others hungrily as they head into the final office
omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of tokyo
the only decoration in the room is an enormous caravaggio
please sit down gentlemen
omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up
cigarettes are the newest western fad sweeping japan
re cigarette case a gift from czar alexander
it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill effect
hes an extraordinary man isnt he
he is samurai
omura gazes at him
slowl y takes i puff from his cigarette
omura my people have been drawing up the documents we discussed
i have a draft were not quite ready to announce the treaty ambassador
the emperor is
katsumoto was his old mentor he is not eager to offend him
it will take i few more days
how many da ys is a few
i assure you the samurai will not stand in the wa y of our agreement
you are prepared to make deliver y
soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line
captain algren you are the expert
will this array of ordnance be sufficient
depends on what youre trying to accomplish
i want my country to take its place as a modern power
then they will set you well on your way
i am pleased
omura you assured us you had the influence with your emperor to make this deal come to pass
with all due respect perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to
with all due respect ambassador perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to for instance the french
or the english
or any of the legations waiting in the next room
ambassador swan beck stands swallowing his rage
yes we l we look forward to hearing from you
good afternoon gentlemen
they start to go
captain algren perhaps you can stay a moment and tell me of your experiences in our rebellious provinces
bagley looks at algren
do as he asks
he leaves a gren alone with omura
omura lights his cigarette
a moment as he takes algrens measure
you fought bravely on behalf of our army against the rebel katsumoto
algren says nothing
and yet you helped save his life when attacked by the ninja
my role was much less significant than you may have heard
tell me about your role in katsumotos plans
i have none
and your sympathies
again i have none
i know you have little sympathy for colonel bagley
i thought it was we who are inscrutable
now it is algren who smiles
you have gained important knowledge of katsumotos province his army and his rebellion
this is extremely valuable to me
he watches algren to see how this lands
you also possess significant knowledge of m y army my weaponry and my plans
this is extremely va uable to katsumoto
again you flatter me
i am a businessman
i recognize what is valuable
and i buy it
looks at him in this case i value your loyalt y
algren considers the implications of what omura is saying
i didnt know loyalt y was something that could be sold
then perhaps you will give it as a token of future friendship for which as a friend i would be in your debt
stands then i will consider it
and i will be grateful
algren is in a shipping office
a clerk consults his schedule of departure
all righteee the andrew jackson leaves tomorrow if you want a steamship youll have to wait six weeks
algren is silent gets ya to frisco by the th
dollars for a private cabin for a shared or for a lower berth
what can i put you down for
algren is silent concentrating on a calendar hanging behind the clerk
it features a beautiful hiroshigi watercolor of mountains
after a moment private cabin
graham walks with algren
wh y would you leave now
no white man has ever been in your position
do you have any idea what it will mean to have omura as your friend
you want land you want women you want boys
algren starts to walk faster but graham stops him
i wanted to leave too
for three years
you must believe me there is a majest y about these people can you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and the discipline
and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little people
then raised voices from across the street stop them
they see yoritomo surrounded by four imperial army soldiers
the soldiers are rough and imperious drunk with power
they carry gleaming rifle
the soldiers bark orders
yoritomo stands proudly responding calmly
whit is this
my god its the edicts
algren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile the soldiers are pointing to yoritomos head screaming algren steps toward the soldiers thats enough one of the soldiers screams at
him raises his rifle all the soldiers raise their rifles yoritomo reaches for his sword algren tries to push through
subtitles one of the soldiers smacks algren in the chin with a rifle butt
algren reels and by the time he stands straight again four others are pointing their ba yonets at his face
graham takes hold of algrens arm
dont be stupid
algren makes eye contact with yoritomo who in deference to his friend puts his sword away
the japanese soldiers continue to scream at yoritomo
they force him to his knees
rifles pressed to his head
yoritomo bows his bead speaking quietly as if praying
algren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet another grab
yoritomos hair jerks his head back and begins hacking off yoritomos traditional top knot of hair
yoritomo remains kneeling head down blood flowing down his face
the soldiers laugh and move off
algren kneels by yoritomo
yoritomo looks up at him
there are tears in his eyes
katsumotos house on the outskirts of tokyo is spacious and harmonious
samurai guards in full regalia stand menacingly outside
ujio kneels with yoritomo dressing the wounds on his head
graham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth nakao taking notes in a small notebook
nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot as well
his shame is apparent
servants he p dress katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as algren is ushered in
captain i had not thought to see you again
im leaving tomorrow
but before i go i need to tell you whats going on here
you mean the gatling guns and the howitzers is that how you sa y it
theyre about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine
yes if the emperor agrees but omura knows the emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons before be will sign
realizing and you are to be the cause
elegant isnt it
omura passes laws sure to cause a samurai revolt creating a need for the weapons
the emperor sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty giving your country what it wants and the omura zaibatsu what it wants
and my country is sold to yours
as katsumoto dresses algren notes that katsumotos body it at battleground of old scars so like his own
today the council passed two edicts
the first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots
the second banned the wearing of sword
he knows what swords mean to the samurai
re his swords hand them to me will you
algren picks up katsumotos two swords
looks at him deeply
if you do this they will kill you
i am hard to kill
you dont know what their weapons can do
all your men butchered
just for pride
not for pride
for the emperor
but the emperor is the one signing the agreement
he has not signed it yet
he holds out katsumotos two samurai swords
is it worth it
just for these i cannot live without my soul
they regard each other
algren leaves katsumotos gate and sets off on foot
as algren walks he becomes aware that he is being followed
two dark figures lurk some distance behind him
after a few moments he whips around to face them
they stand for a moment then melt away into the shadows
the council of state meets in an august chamber
many of the council members wear western clothes
cigarette smoke billows
the young emperor sits on a dais off to the side as befits his ceremonial role in the proceedings
omura is speaking
looking at something
all the council members turn
katsumoto strides into the chamber his swords proudly displayed
subtitled minister katsumoto you honor us
subtitled it is my honor to join again the men who are leading japan into her glorious future
subtitled you arc perhaps unaware of this councils edict regarding the wearing of swords
subtitled i read ever y edict with singular attention
subtitled yet you would bring weapons into this chamber
subtitled this chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred years interrupting subtitled we need no protection
we are a nation of laws now
we are a nation of whores
selling ourselves to our western allies
katsumoto slowl y looks around at the members of the council but his words are addressed to the emperor
subtitled does japan no longer need its patriots
omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty
subtitled who is the patriot
the man who would keep his country trapped in the past or the man who would help his people into the future
subtitled a future with no honor subtitled honor means less to me than feeding our children
and teaching them
and giving them modern medicine so they will live
and lining your own pockets in the process
they stare at one another with barely concealed hostility
subtitled minister katsumoto it is with great regret that i ask you to remove your sword as this body has declared in its edict
katsumotos hand closes on his sword hilt this sword serves the emperor and only he can command me to remove it
katsumoto looks to the emperor as murmurs fill the room
quickly ah but it is our tradition that the emperors voice is too pure and great to be heard in such worldly circumstance as the council of state
one last time katsumoto meets the emperors eye
then with great regret i must refuse to give up my sword
omura looks to his associates and a silent decision is made
minister katsumoto i must invite you to accompany our soldiers to himeji castle where you will be our honored guest
i think you will find the surroundings there quite harmonious
guards with mauser rifles move into position around katsumoto
he turns to the other council members
looks at them
one day you will know what you have done and feel what i never will
omura nods to the guards
the guards lead katsumoto out
a bearer is loading the last of algrens luggage on the back of a rickshaw
algren emerges from the building sees the same two disreputable men who followed him earlier lurking nearby
he resists the temptation to confront them
instead he climbs into the rickshaw and it starts off
but a moment later graham has jogged alongside huffing and puffing
thought id missed you
were you going to leave without even saying goodbye
i have a fear of sentimental englishmen
trying to keep up christ give us
second here algren indicates for the bearer to stop
graham tries to catch his breath
youre making a mistake i promise you
katsumotos under house arrest omuras made his move hell need you more than ever graham stops sees the look on algrens face realizes
oh my goodness
how silly of me
all that time you were with him up in those mountains i told you they were a remarkable people
algren doesnt answer but isnt denying it either
then you should get out
because omura will become rather impatient with anyone who isnt on the team
graham notices algren staring at his followers
case in point
who are they
ronin would be m y guess
disgraced samurai doing odd jobs for his nibs
what do they want from me
to make sure youre on the side of god and country or to make sure you get the hell out
youve been a great help graham
i thank you
look whos getting sentimental now
a look bet ween them then algren nods for the bearer to continue
algren stands at the gangplank
porters wait with his luggage
algren looks back into the crowd and sees the ronin
they glare back no longer trying to keep out of sight
a blast from the steam whistle
algren looks from the ship to the ronin to the bustling chaotic city behind them
finally he looks out at the harbor and the ocean beyond which used to lie his home
he turns to the bearer
subtitles take back to quarters
and algren starts back into the city
down a shadowy street lit only by t orches
slowl y we realize he is being followed and that he knows it
up ahead the street appears to dead end
the two ronin step out from the shadows and face him their hands on their swords
behind him another dangerous looking ronin joins the one who has been following him
they begin to close in
algren stands completely still
they grow closer
algren appears to close his eyes
and the sound of the approaching footsteps fades as we hear only the sound of his breathing
the ronin draw their swords
algren gently opens his eyes
ever ything has slowed down a sign in the breeze a piece of rubbish on the street the flame of a nearby torch
everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place
in the strobing shadows all we really know is that algren has leapt to the attack
within seconds four bodies lie in the street algren holds bloody sword
his face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped but other than that he is unharmed
ujio has taught him welt as he stands catching his breath we hold on his face in close up
a sudden flash we see algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronins face
it is the attack replayed in real time
rolling to avoid a death blow he grabs the fallen mans sword and eviscerates attacker
the two remaining ronin strike
he parries the blow of attacker whirls to slice the legs of attacker whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker who has returned to the attack
meanwhile attacker serums and charges just lit attacker is trying to stand
algren steps back as attacker impales attacker
algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker
even now it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated
we move closer still on algrens face
a sudden flash and so we watch the attack again
in super slow motion now so we can fully appreciate its terrible beauty
a torch smashes across a face
a sword slices the sleeve of a coat
sparks fly as two swords meet
a severed hand falls in the dirt
blood sprays from a decapitated head
a sword is wiped clean
in real time algren kneels to examine one of the dead ronin
on his arm is tattooed a familiar emblem the sign of the omura zaibatsu omura lives in a huge medieval castle on a promontory directly above tokyo ba y
a testament to japans martial past
two guards arc standing at attention in a dank corridor high in one of the towers of the castle
cell doors line the corridor
katsumotos samurai swords lean against the wall next to them
katsumoto kneels in a cramped cell
a sound draws his attention
he rises and looks out a barred window
bel ow he sees two rickshaws moving up the twisting road to the castle
algren and bagley in formal dress uniforms sit in one of the rickshaws
bagley looks him over
oughtta shave more often algren
thought i would follow the japanese fashion
heard you were leaving actually
why would i do that
omura wants me to train his personal guard
certainly seems obsessed by you
why do you think that is
could it be my nose isnt permanently lodged up his ass
bagley shakes his bead turns away
algren stares up at the looming aide
the two rickshaws stop by the heavily guarded main gates
guards check the occupants
motion to other guards atop the gates
the main gates slowl y swing open
the bearers lower the rickshaws
algren and bagley climb from one
ambassador swanbeck climbs from the other
omura waits in elegant evening clothes
a woman plays a harp
the interior of omuras castle is heavy oppressive
old masters paintings dot the walls
leather bound boob
omura you have a lovel y home
it must be very old
nothing is old in japan ever ything is ancient
but the views are pleasant
they move to chairs by the roaring fireplace as omura turns to algren noticing the cut on his face but saying nothing
do you know your wagner captain
this is the leibestod from tristan and isolde
im surprised you enjoy it
literally translated it means love death
looks at him
a samurai concept dont you think
the two men take each others measures
servants appear with trays
and cigars of course
servants light their cigars
re cigar a gift from president grant
smiles queen victoria
omura may i use the necessit y
omura summons a servant
the servant escorts algren out
swanbeck regarding our agreement i noticed a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the investment protocols for coal
the servant leads algren through a corridor head bowed
then stil puffing on his cigar algren taps the servant on the back and as the man turns decks him
the servant falls
algren flicks hit cigar out onto the sloping roof
we follow the burning ember as it rolls off the roof and lands at the feet of two the guards look up trying to determine where the cigar butt has
but their curiosity lasts only a moment arrows pierce their necks strangling any sound
we reverse to discover that one of the rickshaw bearers has fired the arrows
as he peels back his hood we see it is yoritomo
we realize the other bearers are ujio nakao and simon graham
they hurry past the dead guards and up the stairs
the three samurai and graham race up the winding parapets
three guards round a corner
swords flash as ujio and nakao dispatch them without even slowing
they race on graham laboring to keep up
algren rounds a corner ujio yoritomo nakao and graham are moving toward him
this wa y
clearly this has all been algrens plan
they move up a stairwa y
the three guards are still standing at attention outside katsumotos cell
his swords are next to them
algren keeps the others out of sight and lowers his head to whisper with ujio
ujio nods then walks into sight and calmly approaches the guards
still hidden algren gestures for the others remain to silent
after a moment he gestures that they can proceed
algren and the others round the comer to discover the bloody remains of the three guards whom ujio has dispatched in absolute silence
they unlock the cell
katsumoto is shocked to see algren enter
algren tosses him his swords
hows the poem coming
the ending is proving difficult
omura glances up from the documents
what has become of captain algren
algren katsumoto and the others race through an upper corridor
re graham who is this
names simon graham
wants to write a book about you
i have followed your activities with great interest
i think the european public would be fascinated by a book about your adventures
not a book
suddenly from below the raised voices of guards
they hurry a wa y
guards carrying pikes race up the stairs algren and the others are moving swiftl y down a stone corridor
the sound of the approaching guards is growing louder
a silent wild bunch moment of preparation as they stride down the corridor five abreast
algren pulls the cavalry saber from his dress uniform
katsumoto prepares his swords
nakao stretches his huge arms
yoritomo and uji o draw their bows
ten guards with rifles patrol the upper battlements
yoritomo and uji o crouch and fire
arrow a fter arrow a fter arrow as fast as a repeating rifle the arrows streak through the night
it is a dazzling display
they time shots to sail over walls shoot through tiny windows shoot out torches
in a matter of seconds all ten guards are dead
they continue across the courtyard up some steps they stride through a tight dark stone corridor
suddenly a cadre of omura guards emerge from the shadows
without hesitation they launch into battle
algren and katsumoto wield their swords
yoritomo and ujio fire arrows
nakao fights with his hands dramatic martial arts from the huge man
but this corridor is just too tight it is a sea of combat
the guards and our warriors are slammed together the swords and pikes sending up sparks in the darkness as they strike the stone walls
the right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords
more guards appear
these guards have rifles
rifle blasts thunder startling strobe like bursts of light in the darkness algren dives in front of katsumoto to protect him yoritomo is hit he jerks back blood ujio fires
arrows at the guards with rifles hitting two but more guards with rifles are appearing bullets sending showers of debris and ricochets algren sees a stairway leading to a higher evel barks out a command
as nakao drags yoritomo toward the stairs the others bolt a heavy siege door designed to keep attackers at bay
ujio fires arrows through the siege ports momentarily delaying the guards as algren leads them toward a rear stairs
algren starts down only to discover more guards blocking this means of escape
he backs out of the wa y just in time as rifle blasts splinter the wooden stairwe
meanwhile an explosion from behind them indicates that the guards have blown the siege door
algren graham and ujio have no choice but to continue upwards into the castle keep
nakao helps the wounded yoritomo as they climb
a narrow ladder leads to the final redoubt
they start to climb but yoritomo leans against the wall
he is gravely wounded
subtitled you go algren san
i will stop them
yoritomos determination is absolute
finally algren nods
katsumoto moves to yoritomo leans in for a few final words taking his head and pressing his forehead to yoritomos
bullets begin ricocheting around them yoritomo looks to algren subtitled tell my family
algren bows his bead in respect
then algren leads them up the stairs
ujio fires a final volley nods with respect to yoritomo then follows the others
yoritomo pulls himself erect
draws his two samurai swords
he closes his eyes
then he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs the guards fire hitting yoritomo but still he comes wading into them swords flashing he is hit again and
again but still he comes
it is a glorious death
algren leads them into the highest room of the castle the siege room
the echoes yoritomos death rings in their ears
katsumoto glances at ujio and nakao
without a word they kneel on the floor open their kimonos and unsheathe their short swords preparing to commit seppuku
katsumoto glares at him harshly furious to have his concentration disturbed at such a moment
theres a wa y out
reluctantly katsumoto joins him at the window
this place is designed to keep people from getting in not from getting out
we can make it this was your plan
do you have a better one
nakao and ujio look at katsumoto awaiting his response
he turns to algren
i may die
but ill die trying
and without another word he launches himself out the window onto the sloping roof
like his cigar butt earlier in the sequence he rolls then falls hits another roof rolls slides falls hits again
katsumoto and the others share a look
has he survived
gunfire begins to pepper the floorboards bullets whistling past them
algren slides bumps rolls falls hits then slides again
until he finally plummets into the moat
as his head rises above water he lets out a scream of absolute joy
katsumoto hears the scream
a look of disbelief spreads over his face
then the beginnings of a smile
without a second look be leaps out the window
graham shrinks away in fear
nakao lifts him bodily throws him out and then follows
omura stands very calm smoking a cigarette listening to the report of his guards
colonel bagley tries to apologize
dont know what to say sir
i never would have thought him capable of treason
i would say captain algrens acts tonight have assured our success
what do you mean
katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen
they will fight
we will destroy them with your new weapons
what if he just goes off to the mountains and becomes a damn sheep herder or some such
you still do not understand us
katsumoto can do nothing but fight
it is his role in the drama
he must act out his destiny
he knows it
you trust a lot in destiny
this story was written years ago
from the first sight of your warships in our harbor
stares out the window it is a l inevitable
algren katsumoto and the others ride over rocky ground
yesterday i passed the field where zebulon gant was killed by the man with whom i now ride
in the distance a steam train chugs along
they climb a steep trail
beyond the glaciers glow pink
i am beset by ironies trained to fight rebels now i am one
and yet ask mysel f
can a man be reborn
algren katsumoto and the others ride through a dense forest katsumoto reins his horse
the others follow suit
they wait and if so what would he make of it
mounted samurai emerge from the thick forest as it they were invisible
the leader leaps from his horse and bows touching his head to the dirt
all the other samurai follow suit
katsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry orchard
then he reins his horse and falls in beside algren
his voice troubled i was prepared to die in omuras castle
and yet here i am
i cannot help but ask why were you sent into my life
what is the lesson you were meant to give me
maybe that neither of us is as smart as we thought
and then in a surprisingly deft imitation of algren you
aint whistlin dixie
he spurs his horse and heads off
algren shakes his head and follows
the returning warriors are warmly welcomed by the villagers
algren rides directly to yoritomos house dismounts
taka and toshiie are waiting
he goes to them
his expression tells them all they need to know
algren sits with the family
the boys sit next to their mother
subtitles he gave his life to save us
he died bravel y
subtitles thank you algren san
subtitles will you fight the white men
subtitles if they come here yes
subtitles because they come to destroy what i have come to love
taka looks at him moved and surprised
suddenly higen jumps up and bolts
out of the room
algren looks to taka
subtitles the wa y of samurai is difficult for children
he misses his father
and he is angry because i am the cause of that
she smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness
he it angry because he fears you will die as well
higen stands looking up at the stars
subtitles my father taught me it is glorious to die in battle
subtitles that is what he believed
subtitles i would be afraid to die in battle
subtitles so would i
subtitles but you have been in many battles
subtitles and i was always afraid
higen looks at him tears welling in his eyes
subtitles i dont want you to go
algren has no answer
he can only gather the boy up in his arms and hold him
nakao is standing proudly his massive arms folded across his chest
we pull back graham is bunched behind his photographic equipment
a flash of phosphorous and the moment is immortalized
meanwhile algren is working with higen on the house
katsumoto silently watches algren working with the boy
they are corning
algren and katsumoto perch on a precipice looking down into a valley
it is a beautiful setting
towering peaks and peaceful valleys
it is here that the final act of the inevitable drama will play out
bel ow they see the imperial army thousands strong marching across the valley toward them
terrifying martial columns in strict formation
i call it five thousand troops
theyll come in waves of about a thousand a few minutes between each wave
katsumoto listens carefully to algrens expertise
german formations have the infantry staggered with on y light flanking
theyll come straight on with rifles and fixed bayonets
mausers are only accurate to about yards
theyll look to overthrow us
katsumoto takes this in
colonel bagley omura several german advisors and japanese officers ride at the head of the imperial army
bagley sees something raises a hand
the troops halt
algren and katsumoto ride up to them
sir the imperial army of japan demands your surrender
if you and your fellows lay down your arms you will not be harmed
that is not possible
as omura knows
omura meets katsumotos look nods
bagley turns to algren
captain algren we will show no quarter
you ride against us and you are the same as they are
i take that as a compliment colonel
a deadly calm ill look for you on the field
algren and katsumoto wheel their horses and go
algren and katsumoto ride
they have the howitzers
about a dozen
katsumoto considers this
algren looks up into the mountains
a man could get lost up there
build an army
hold out a very long time
have you seen what happens to the villages that stand in the way of the railroad
that is what will happen to my village if we do not stand and fight
looks at him no
we serve the emperor here
at least make it battle not a suicide
and what would that accomplish
algren lifts his head enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face
it might give you one more day
one more fine day like this
katsumoto stares at him for a long moment then smiles and spurs his horse
they ride together side by aide the wind billowing their cloaks we enjoy the ride as they do the trees strobing by the sun slanting through the leaves
it is the eve of battle
and the samurai rejoice
katsumoto is on stage at the center of the village square enthusiastically performing a noh drama
algren sits with toshiie and taka in the audience enjoying katsumotos theatrics
other samurai can be seen around the village eating singing and playing instruments
tonight is for celebrating life
elsewhere a flash as graham takes a photograph of some children
on the stage katsumoto spots algren in the audience points to him and encourages him to join him
toshiie prods him
algren surrenders and joins katsumoto on the stage
the villagers are delighted
katsumoto embroils algren in the performance
algren does his best laughing at katsumotos antics
it is the freest and happiest we have ever seen algren
time slows as we savor his simple enjoyment toshiie is highly amused
taka has a deeper response she is moved as she watches algren give himself over to the part
a somber mood has descended
algren sits and writes in his journal
for so long now i have managed to convince myself that there was nothing worth believing in
a samurai plays a melancholy bamboo flute
the gentle sound floats through the village
certainly nothing worth dying for
we see samurai preparing for the final battle
some check their armor
now i am not so sure
some make up their faces so they will look handsome when they greet death
some methodically polish their swords
some sit with their families
and so for the first time in my life i am truly afraid
not of dying
but of losing something worth living for
ujio is performing a graceful ritualistic sword dance to the song of the flute
algren joins graham to watch him
what is it
his dance of death
taka comes to them
subtitles algren san will you come with me
algren leaves graham and accompanies taka toward the house
they pass higen and toshiie who sit with other children at the feet of the massive nakao listening to a quiet story he tells the gentle flute music from outside
one of yoritomos beautiful kimonos is elegantly spread on a mat
subtitles if you wear this it will honor us
she steps to him
she gently reaches forward and unbuttons his collar
a tender silent scene as she undresses him and carefully wraps him in the kimono
her hands move gracefull y around his body never quite touching him
his movements are gentle in response
when he is fully dressed then are tears in his eyes
suddenly fiercely they are holding each other
the quiet evening continues
algren now dressed in the kimono finds katsumoto carefully dropping little leaves of incense into a small flame that simmers inside his battle helmet
so m y hair will have a pleasing scent when i meet my ancestors
you do not do this
algren smiles sits
i studied war at a place called west point
they taught us about a battle called thermopylae
three hundred brave warriors held off the king of persias army of a million men
for two da ys they made them pay so dearly that the king lost all appetite for further invasion looks at him i have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow
bemused do you really think we can defeat them
i sure as hell want to find out
you believe a man can change his destiny
but i think a man cannot know his destiny
he can only do what he can until his destiny is revealed
a si ent beat
then katsumoto picks up a long bundle wrapped in cloth
he unwraps it
a beautilu long samurai sword
he bows his head and offers it to algren
there are japanese characters etched on the blade
what does it say
i belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new
algren is moved beyond words
as the camera pulls away algren and katsumoto squat side by side drawing in the dirt with a stick planning the next days battle strategy
across the square ujio continues his elegant dance of death his graceful form illuminated in silhouette by a fire
it is the day of the battle
algren is buttoning the long coat of his cavalry uniform
he looks up to see higen standing in the doorwa y holding the breast plate of his fathers armor
algren emerges from the house wearing the breast plate over his coat
taka is at his horse tying a bag of food to the saddle
she turns and sees her husbands armor on this man
and her breath stops
algren approaches her
they stand very cl ose
subtitles if that is my destiny
i wish you peace
he bows his head to her she responds
the boys stand on the porch watching
he mounts his horse and trots off
they watch him go
algren joins the line of samurai leaving the village
it is the first time we have seen them in their full battle armor since the battle in the fog
katsumoto in his black armor ujio in his jet black
and algren in the blood red breast plate
it is dazzling
we move along the line of waiting samurai
the faces are stoic
their horses are corralled well behind them
algren stands with katsumoto and ujio
graham is nearby
they peer into the plain beyond
they have chosen a strong defensive position
a steep mountain pass
slopes on either side create a funnel ahead of them
the imperial army will have to pass through the funnel to reach them
on a hill above them higen is revealed
he looks down first at the five hundred samurai then sees beyond the overwhelming mass of the imperial army
back on the battlefield a distant thud followed by a high pitched whine
a massive explosion ahead of the samurai
algren finds graham cowering at the base of a straw barricade
would you please stay with the horses
graham would like to be brave enough to remain but he is not a soldier
as you suggest
graham starts to go mr
from his coat algren takes his journal hands it to graham
maybe you can use it for your book
he heads back to the relative safet y of the horse corral
meanwhile the samurai remain impassive as artillery is stepped in closer the range bracketed
then artillery rounds begin to fall among them
samurai are blown to pieces as they bravel y stand and await death
katsumoto barks a command to ujio
suddenly the samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense alignment
the artillery rounds now fall ineffectually where once they stood
bagley directs the artillery to be re targeted it is a laborious clumsy process
they fire again
the samurai change position again
bagley is furious
their fluid tactics have rendered his field artillery useless
katsumoto and algren share a look of grim satisfaction
they are leveling the playing field
bugle calls are heard from the imperial army
the call to advance
the rattle of the snare drums
the sound of marching boots
and then they appear
thousands upon thousands of them
the imperial army marching relentlessly forward in strict formation
the rising sun displayed
katsumoto gazes at the awe inspiring sight
his samurai face a staggering soldiers
what happened to those three hundred warriors at thermopylae
a grim smile dead to the last man
katsumoto glances to him smiles
the first division of the imperial army moves into the funnel their numbers reduced by the size of the access and head toward the barricade
katsumoto and algren watch as they move closer and closer
we are expecting the samurai to open fire but they do not
they just wait
finally the imperial soldiers are in rifle range
they stop to fi re a volley
bullets begin hitting among the samurai
algren nods to katsumoto katsumoto then calls out a command and the samurai retreat
they race back toward the rear of the funnel
the imperial army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and pursue the samurai meanwhile have taken cover behind a second barricade that had been hidden from the imperial soldiers
now safel y behind the second barricade katsumoto calls out a command and the samurai fire
arrows explode almost instantly followed by more like an image from agincourt the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky imperial soldiers fall the attack falters from behind the new
barricades archers fire flaming arrows that hit the old barricade
it explodes into flames trapping the imperia army bet ween the two barricades
and from the second barricade two large ca tapults send balls of flaming pitch into the already panicking soldiers
colonel bagley omura several german advisers and japanese officers watch through binoculars
as the first wave is routed
what the hell
it seems katsumoto will resist his destiny
snaps an order send in the second wave
algren and katsumoto wait behind the second barricade
we note that this barricade is the real thing
katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm a bullet wound beneath
algren looks over the barricade
they see imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders on the opposing hilltop
they need to regroup and report our position
then theyll come hard
katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead imperia soldiers
it is sad to see brave men die without faces
you cannot tell one warrior from another
theyre not warriors
its a modern army
not my world anymore
the attack is reforming
ranks now bolstered by reinforcements
they come at a trot through the narrow defile skirting the first barricade continuing at a trot toward the second barricade
katsumoto pulls his long sword
algren does the same
katsumoto calls out an order the archers fire another round
the imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place
they race forward stepping over their fallen comrades bayonets poised the mauser rifles flash
bullets explode around the samurai many are hit
the imperial army has been trained to keep firing on the run
the waiting samurai will be decimated except from the hills on either side fully half of the samurai force who have been kept hidden until this moment
charge screaming into the flank of the attacking army
even rifles cannot fire in three directions at once
algren and katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade
some are cut down but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand to band combat
algren and katsumoto fight back to back as if one person slashing with their swords shattering bayonet dealing death on all sides
ujio crouches his back leg straight and planted his front leg bent
still using his bow firing off arrows with stunning speed refusing to budge on the opposing hillside bagley and omura watch the battle through binoculars
a classic v ambush
sonofabitcb is using welt point tactics
in the midst of the battle a charging soldier thrust s his bayonet into katsumotos arm katsumoto kills the soldier with his short sword but is awkwardly tangled with his
body a second soldier races toward him for the kill algren spins and attacks killing the second soldier but a third races toward algren bayonet f ashing he dodges but the bayonet slices into his side algren kicks the soldier away tries to use his sword but the soldier springs back ath etically
ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the coup de grace
all sound gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo flute
the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic
bur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight they are simply outnumbered
nakao is like a cornered bear arcing his two swords wildly around him
he is shot in the chest and staggers a moment before continuing
another soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range
nakao sword goes fl ying so the giant samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily twirling him around like a wrestler throwing him finally onto the upraised pike
of a fellow imperial soldier
but now three more soldiers have levelled their weapons and a ruthless volley staggers him again
shots rain on him as he tries to continue fighting but his strength leaves him
finally with one last lunge he manages to pull an imperial soldier with him crushing him as he falls
more and more fall as algren katsumoto and their comrades fight desperately
the mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as ujio is mortally wounded
the grim award master is cut through with bullets
still he fights
an imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself and ujios blade cuts through the barrel
the soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement before a second sweep of uji os sword beheads him
but there are too many to take the mans place and finally fi ve men run uji o through with bayonets and he is pinned against the barricade still upright
at last what is left of this second wave of the imperial army retreats
the plain before the barricade is littered with imperial army dead
algren and katsumoto sit exhausted leaning against the barricade
they are both wounded
hundred samurai are still alive
algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment
even those still alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of imperial soldiers
katsumoto is looking at ujios body nearby
he was kaishaku
my trusted friend
we wont be able to hold them back this time
this is not your battle
you do not have to die here
a long beat
i died a long time ago
but now you live again
it was not your time
maybe i survived just to live this one last day
algren looks at him
he slowl y pulls himself up
he and katsumoto gaze at the plain before them
at the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop
algren looks at katsumoto
he reaches into the pocket of his old uniform and takes out the medal of honor he received long ago at sutters hill
he affixes it to his old cavalry tunic
katsumoto looks at algren
they are both thinking the same thing
the hundred mounted samurai are a beautiful sight
they wait in formation in front of the barricade the long plain through the funnel to the opposing hilltop before them
katsumoto draws his long samurai sword
algren draws his
and they slowl y begin to trot forward
and then to canter
colonel bagley and omura watch transfixed
there is something approaching admiration on omuras face
on bagleys there is only malice
the gatling guns
katsumoto points his sword and screams out his war cry
and they charge
it is suicidal it is glorious
it is the end of the samurai
they charge forward their war cries echoing in the canyon
the imperial troops fire rifles samurai fall
but still they come pounding over the earth like something from an ancient dream
algren and katsumoto charge side by side
bagley and omura watch as the samurai fall one by one
fifteen or twenty of the samurai including algren and katsumoto somehow manage to fight their way through the lines
they break into the open
and continue riding straight toward the rear
are both wounded yet still they charge
they have only one thought in mind death to their enemies
they gallop forward toward bagley and omura
looks around in abject terror
he screams out an order
are moving into position
their rear gates fall open
revealing the gatiling guns
are near enough to see them
yet they will not be deterred
they charge on
are not yet ready to fire
japanese soldiers slam ammo belts into the chambers
have almost reached their goal
cowers in fear looks around but there is nowhere to hide
even while riding at i full gallop they have fixed arrows into their long
they let loose a lethal volley
but before the guns can open up he is impaled by arrow after arrow a human pincushion
the final arrow pierces his forehead
the gatling guns finally fire
ripping into the samurai destroying them one after another is hit and still they come their voices raised in glorious cries of triumph graham watches from a hilltop tears in
katsumoto is hit blood explodes
his horse falls he spi ls off then algren is hit he falls algren drags himself to katsumoto bullets exploding ever ywhere algren looks up to see
the remaining samurai still charging and still the gatling guns tear through them and still they charge until they are all down
a japanese officer shouts out an order the gatling guns stop
omura screams at him to continue firing
the japanese officer barks out response
omura sees all the samurai are dead or dying
but he also sees algren kneeling by katsumoto dragging him awa y
he screams at the japanese officer to resume fire
the japanese officer refuses
he just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment
then he does the most remarkable thing
he slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt
then a soldier near him does the same thing
then another and another
and then by the thousands
they kneel and touch their heads to the dirt
honoring the last samurai
a gren drags the dying katsumoto to a copse of cherry trees nearby
both men are bleeding profusel y
help me up
just stay there
help me up
algren helps him to stand
without algrens support he would fall
you have your honor again
let me die with mine
algren looks at him deeply moved
katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword
you must help me
hold it firmly
algren supports katsumoto as he holds the swords point firmly to his stomach
are you ready
katsumoto looks at him deepl y warmly
we will ride together again
katsumoto embraces algren firmly the sma l sword impales him algren holds him tightly
katsumoto is looking over algrens shoulder as he dies
katsumoto sees something
a look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features
whispers it is perfect
they are all perfect
his eyes cl ose
he is dead
algren gently kneels with katsumotos body he holds him for a moment and then turns to see what katsumoto was looking at
a display of perfect beauty
we slowl y fade to
ambassador swanbeck omura and a retinue of advisors are presenting the treaty documents for the emperors signature
the emperor sits restively on his throne
will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and cooperation between our two great nations
a servant comes and whispers into the emperors ear
subtitles highness if we could just conclude the matter at hand
the emperor ignores omura and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened
algren enters with graham
algren carries something wrapped in a blanket
he approaches the emperor
kneels and sets the bundle at the emperors feet
algren remains kneeling with his head bowed
he unwraps the bundle
it is katsumotos long samurai sword
the emperor looks at it
subtitled all your enemies are dead enlightened one
the emperor continues to look at the sword
he does not look up
to algren you were with him at the end
he asked that i bring you this that the strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys
the emperor rises from his chair and sits on the floor in the traditional japanese fashion before the sword
after a moment en ightcned one we all weep for his loss but the future of our country lies in the emperor interrupts him speaking in english to ever yones
my ancestors have ruled japan for years
and for all that time we have slept
during my sleep i have dreamed
i dreamed of a unified japan
of a country strong and independent and modern
touches the sword lovingly and now we are awake
we have railroads and cannon and western clothing
but we cannot forget who we are
or where we come from
the emperor looks up at the gathered dignitaries
ambassador swanbeck i have concluded that your treaty is not in the best interests of my people
sir if i may you may not
from this moment on economic investment from ever y nation will be considered equally
ambassador swanbeck is stunned
this is an outrage the emperor gestures
a servant escorts swanbeck to the exit
omura takes a step closer to the emperor
subtitled enlightened one we should discuss this subtitled omura do you know our northern island
omura is confused
subtitled there is a small one called taraku
a rock in the sea
there is nothing there but crabs who have been known to tear a sleeping man apart
i have had a small house constructed on the island
you will go there now and await our summons
subtitled i hereby seize your familys assets and present them as my gift to the people
omura looks at him stunned
subtitled further i have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion into yoshino
subtitled enlightened one subtitled you have served your function
i have no more need of you
you can conspire with the crabs now
protests subtitled honored emperor i do not know wh y you disgrace me
the emperor finally looks up from the sword
subtitled if your shame is too unbearable
i offer you this sword
omura looks at him for a moment
then bows tersely and goes
the emperor looks at algren still kneeling before him
in english again the samurai is not a man now
he is an idea
a beat tell me how he died
algren looks at the emperor
i will tell you how he lived
we slowl y fade as algren begins to speak
a few years later
there are no samurai training in the square but otherwise the village is bustling with life
we hear grahams voice and so the days of the samurai had ended
graham stands at a lectern on a book tour
a well dressed audience listens attentivel y
a banner proclaims the last samurai by simon graham
and in the years to come the rising sun of imperial japan would fl y in triumph over korea over russia even over china
nations like men it is sometimes said have their own destiny we see that yoritomos house has finally been completed
toshiie sits on the porch instructing a group of younger children in calligraphy
as for the american captain no one knows what became of him
all that is left is his journal which i have published according to his last request
taka steps from the house and passes toshiie she carries a basket
we move through the village with her
some lay he died of his wounds others that he returned to his own country
she passes an old man teaching the noh drama to a group of teenagers
she passes higen working on a new building
apparently he has found a good life as a carpenter
he seems content
we go with taka as she leaves the village
taka moves through the cherry orchard
but i like to think he may have found at last some small measure of the peace we all seek but few of us ever find
we follow her gaze to discover algren sitting alone
gazing peacefully sat the cherry bl ossoms
waiting for the perfect one
he turns to her a smile of quiet joy spreads across his face
i wish you peace
