a mysterious warrior treks across the rugged landscape
legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend
the warrior his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and wide brimmed hat gnaws on a staff of bamboo
he traveled the land in search of worthy foes
the warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his bamboo
the door blasts open
the manchu gang rushes in and surrounds him
to warrior i see you like to chew
beat maybe you should chew on my fist
the boss punches the table
the warrior said nothing for his mouth was full
then he swallowed
and then he spoke
dubbed hero voice enough talk
the warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes flying
he was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness
the gang members blindly flail about
how can we repay you
there is no charge for awesomeness or attractiveness
one hundred assassins appear and surround the warrior
the entire bar swells packed to the rafters with ninjas
the roof explodes and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky
like a tornado the warrior spins and knocks them all down
it mattered not how many foes he faced
they were no match for his bodacity
the warrior beats up a thousand ninjas delivering his final blow while doing a split between two trees
the warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god rays shine down upon him
never before had a panda been so feared
and so loved
even the most heroic heroes in all of china the furious five bowed in respect to this great master
we should hang out
as the five salute the warrior he turns to see more bandits approaching
the five strike an attack pose
the warrior brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain into the sea of bandits
but hanging out would have to wait
cause when youre facing the ten thousand demons of demon mountain theres only one thing that matters
and thats in mid air the five talk to the warrior in a strange voice
youll be late for work
po lands hard on the floor
he tries to clear his head and wake up
we see his room is filled with various kung fu posters including a poster featuring all of the five and souvenirs and a wooden version of the sword of heroes
the green sword
he attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas his belly is too worthy a foe
what are you doing up there
po hops to his feet imitating his kung fu action figures
outside on the balcony of the neighboring house a pig watering flowers stares at po
po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight
youre late for work
he takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall
it bounces off
he throws the star again but it bounces off again
he picks it up and heads downstairs
he trips and falls the rest of the way
po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor
a panda shaped shadow looms over po
sorry doesnt make the noodles
reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small duck
this is pos dad
po gets to work which is not easy since the kitchens not really made for a panda his size
what were you doing up there
all that noise
just had a crazy dream
he gets back to work
what were you dreaming about
what was i
eh i was dreaming about uh
push in on po is he going to admit his dream
he hides his throwing star behind his back
dad stops chopping vegetables
you were really dreaming about noodles
what else would i be dreaming about
po hands a noodle bowl to a customer then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it
to customer careful that soup is
oh happy day
my son finally having the noodle dream
he throws his arms around po
you dont know how long i have been waiting for this moment
when dad pulls out of the hug po is now wearing a noodle apron
this is a sign po
po looks at the apron nervously what has he gotten himself into
a sign of what
you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup
and then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant just as i took it over from my father who took it over from his father who won
it from a friend in a game of mahjong
dad dad dad it was just a dream
no it was the dream
we are noodle folk
broth runs through our veins
but dad didnt you ever i dunno want to do something else
something besides noodles
po looks surprised
when i was young and crazy
dad gets a wistful look in his eyes
i thought about running away and learning how to make tofu
so why didnt you
oh because it was a stupid dream
can you imagine me making tofu
laughs at the thought no
we all have our place in this world
mine is here
and yours is
no its at tables two five seven and twelve
he loads pos arms with bowls of soup
service with a smile
a gong sounds in the distance
po looks out the window at the distant jade palace
slam zoom in towards palace
end next to palace on an old red panda shifu playing a flute
he is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the palace buildings
wider we dolly around from behind the bushes
stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground
back on shifu still playing
he seems oblivious
five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously diving on shifu
shifu moves like lightning the flute now wielded like a staff he deflects blocks dodges parries the attackers go flying they roll and pick themselves up turning to face shifu
who is now standing poised ready for their next move
well done students
if you were trying to disappoint me
he uses his flute to correct the fives technique
tigress you need more ferocity
monkey greater speed
each of the five bows respectfully as their name is mentioned
mantis shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared palace goose
its master oogway
he wants to see you
shifu looks up concerned
shifu strides purposefully down the hallway which is lined with palace geese
candles incense and smoke fill the room
the door bursts open the candles flicker
you summoned me
then looks up without unbowing
is something wrong
reveal master oogway
a wise old tortoise
why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend
well i didnt say that
shifu looks up concerned
oogway opens his mouth
and blows out a candle
and another candle
finally shifu uses his kung fu to blow them all out
oogway smiles knowingly
you were saying
i have had a vision
tai lung will return
shifu looks stricken
quick impressionistic images of shifu battling a large shadowy figure tai lung
shifu is rattled
he looks at the claw marks that still scar the wall and quickly looks away
but he regains his composure
that is impossible
he is in prison
nothing is impossible
shifu makes a split decision
he comes flying in
shifu gets in his face
fly to chogun prison and tell them to double the guards double their weapons
tai lung does not leave that prison
yes master shifu
the goose flies off but
he hits a column
then he is off
back on oogway as he walks toward camera away from shifu
one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it
we have to do something
we cant just let him march on the valley and take his revenge
hell hell oogway looks into the water of the moon pool
your mind is like this water my friend
when it is agitated it becomes difficult to see
but if you allow it to settle the answer becomes clear
shifu and oogway stare into the pool
oogway settles the water revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a scroll in its mouth
the dragon scroll
it is time
who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power
the dragon warrior
dramatic music as we push in on oogways face
i dont know
po is serving customers but has trouble squeezing between tables
watch it po
suck it up
he sucks his belly in but this causes his butt to interfere with a bunny familys meal
a thousand pardons
a couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a palace pig hits a tiny gong
this gets pos attention
he rushes up to the poster
master oogways choosing the dragon warrior
customers jump up excitedly
get to the jade palace
po urges the villagers out the restaurant
one of the five is gonna get the dragon scroll
customers rush to finish their food
weve been waiting a thousand years for this
just take the bowl
other customers are finishing their soup
one old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them on the table
this is the greatest day in kung fu history
dont worry about it just go
he starts to run
where are you going
po stops dead in his tracks busted
but youre forgetting your noodle cart
the whole valley will be there and youll sell noodles to all of them
but dad you know i was kinda thinking maybe i
i was kinda thinking maybe i
po wants to say something to his dad but he loses his nerve
could also sell the bean buns
they are about to go bad
thats my boy
i told you that dream was a sign
yeah ha ha glad i had it
throngs of villagers are streaming into the arena
a couple bunny kids run by
im a kung fu warrior
pan down a long long long long flight of stairs
po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart looking up at the daunting task before him
po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs
the sun beats down on po but he presses forward
po is still struggling up the stairs
come on ya almost there
he stops flopping onto his back to catch his breath
widen to reveal hes only made it up seven steps
two pigs pass by
well bring you back a souvenir
po watches as they run up the stairs
his eyes narrow
this is his heroic moment
ill bring me back a souvenir
po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs
oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a palace pig bangs a gong
it is an historic day isnt it master oogway
yes and one i feared i would not live to see
are your students ready
yes master oogway
now know this old friend
whomever i choose will not only bring peace to the valley but also to you
as shifu contemplates what this could mean oogway starts walking off
shifu quickly joins oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below
the pig bangs the gong
let the tournament begin
throngs of villagers are streaming into the arena
po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step laughing victoriously
out of breath yeah
the doors to the palace arena begin to close
no no no
po runs to the entrance and proceeds to bang on the door
open the door
drums inside drown out pos pounding
let me in
inside spectators screams drown out pos yelling
po panics for a beat and then finds a window
he jumps and weakly struggles to pull himself up
po struggles to peek through the window
citizens of the valley of peace
it is my great honor to present to you
the furious five
the five jump into the middle of the ring
the furious five
po manages a brief glimpse of the five before a gust of wind knocks po to the ground and shuts the window
po runs over to a crack in the wall
ready for battle
inside the arena po catches a glimpse of crane as he spreads his wings
the thousand tongues of fire
one of the spectators walks in front of po cutting off his view
look at that
hey get out of the way
po backs up to get a better look at crane in the sky and accidentally falls down the stairs
po climbs back up and drops his head he missed it
po tries karate chopping the door open
to no avail
he slumps to the ground
po attempts a pole vault but falls on his back
the pole whips around and hits him into the arena wall
po rigs a catapult only to get clobbered by it
the crowd po sits atop the stairs
po snaps to attention
po pulls on a rope tied to a tree
and believe me citizens you have not seen anything yet
face iron ox and his blades of death
tigress sets up to deliver her move
po launches himself up above the fence gets a peek at tigress then falls out of view just as she does her move
po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent
oogway senses something
he raises his hand and the crowd hushes
i sense the dragon warrior is among us
shifu motions for the five to gather in the center of the ring
citizens of the valley of peace
master oogway will now choose
the dragon warrior
po comes to
he sees the fireworks and has an idea
oogway closes his eyes and raises his hand as ceremonial drums start to play
po struggles with something his back turned to us
reveal he has tied a load of fireworks to a chair
he hops on and lights the fuse
pos dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse
what are you doing
what does it look like im doing
im going to see the dragon warrior
but i dont understand
you finally had the noodle dream
po looks uneasy
i dont dream about noodles dad
he looks at the fuse
almost all gone
po holds onto the chair for dear life closes his eyes and braces himself for liftoff
i love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
po finally opens his eyes
hes still on the ground
the fuse was a dud
po falls face first into the dirt
he looks away embarrassed
pos dad holds out his apron
come on son
lets get back to work
po sighs starts to reach for the apron then boom
the rockets ignite propelling po into the stadium wall
pos rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of fireworks
po climbs up and up
until the rockets die out and the chair loses power
oogways arm sweeps down the line of the expectant five
po falls towards the center of the ring
the tension builds as the five wait to see who will be picked
po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud obscuring the ring
po pov he sees the five looking down at him appalled
po comes round slowly getting his bearings
he looks around and sees oogway
strangely the old turtle is smiling
whats going on
what are you pointing
he looks up
an awful realization starts to dawn
he is desperately embarrassed
i just wanted to see who the dragon warrior was
he tries to shuffle his butt out of there mumbling apologies
master are you pointing at
po tries moving out of the way of oogways finger but it keeps following him
oogway grabs pos hand and holds it up for all to see
the universe has brought us the dragon warrior
the pig bangs the gong
the crowd goes wild
a palanquin is carried past shifu
who told you to
po stands there utterly stunned his mouth hanging open
he is abruptly lifted up out of shot
cut to the palace geese straining
po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin
he is carried off
shifu elbows his way urgently through the thronging crowd to get to oogway
master oogway wait
that flabby panda cant possibly be the answer to
you were about to point at tigress
that thing fell in front of her
that was just an accident
there are no accidents
oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off screen crash
the camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under po
shifu looks at oogway
oogway just smiles
a squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists po the palanquin and the geese onto their shoulders and they head off for the jade palace
stunned shifu watches them go
behind him the five approach and bow
forgive us master
we have failed you
shifu spins around
if the panda has not quit by morning then i will have failed you
confetti flutters through the air as the celebration continues around them
a huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain
fifteen stories of iron and rock
one door locked bolted and sealed tight
rhinoceros guards in armor patrol the perimeter
zeng the palace goose flies into frame and a rhino sentry spots him in the distance
he lands sliding on the ice and crashing into the gate
the rhinos point their spears at him
wait wait wait
i bring a message from master shifu
the doors creak open
the terrified goose peers in
reading double the guard
your prison may not be adequate
the goose is quaking in fear
stern rhinos surround him staring daggers at him
the commander snaps the scroll shut
you doubt my prisons security
then shifu does
im just the messenger
ill give you a message for your master shifu
escape from chogun prison is impossible
the goose is awed by the cavernous prison
the goose looks over the bridges edge
the prison goes down a long ways
the commander hits the goose on the back
impressive isnt it
a feather from the goose drifts down the prison
yes very impressive
its very impressive
one way in one way out one thousand guards and one prisoner
yes except that prisoner is tai lung
take us down
several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down
the commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator trying to scare the goose
what are you doing
the commander just laughs
the elevator finally lands sending an echo throughout the prison
a number of doors unlock one after the other
finally a drawbridge is lowered out onto an island
behold tai lung
im just gonna wait right here
its nothing to worry about
its perfectly safe
he shoves the goose out ahead of him
at the ready
they approach tai lung a giant muscular snow leopard bound in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains
he barely registers signs of life
the commander walks right up to him
hey tough guy did you hear
oogways finally gonna give someone the dragon scroll and its not gonna be you
the goose cant believe it
what are you doing
dont get him mad
whats he gonna do about it
ive got him completely immobilized
the commander stomps on tai lungs tail
we hear a crunch
the goose flinches
but tai lung does not react
did i step on the witty kittys tail
tai lung doesnt move
his eyes stare coldly straight ahead
ive seen enough
im gonna tell shifu hes got nothing to worry about
no he doesnt
okay ill tell him that
can we please go now
the commander starts to walk back to the elevator
the goose hurries after him
the gooses feather flutters into frame
we follow the feather as it lands right in front of tai lung
his eyes open
tai lung grabs the feather with his tail
the palace doors open to reveal po on the palanquin hundreds of villagers behind him
chanting dragon warrior
po is ushered in and the doors close
he is alone
he runs back to the closed palace doors
wait a second
i think theres been a slight mistake
everyone seems to think that im uh
po finally realizes where he is
the sacred hall of warriors
would you look at this place
he rushes up to a display of armor
master flying rhinos armor
with authentic battle damage
he rushes up to a green sword making sure not to touch it
the sword of heroes
said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking ow
he stares at a black sopt on the wall
the invisible trident of destiny
he admires a painting
ive only seen paintings of that painting
po runs around the room amazed by all the ancient kung fu artifacts
something special catches pos eye
he runs over to it
the legendary urn of whispering warriors
said to contain the souls of the entire tenshu army
calling into vase hellooo
have you finished sight seeing
to vase sorry
i shouldve come to see you first
my patience is wearing thin
to vase oh
well i mean its not like you were going anywhere
would you turn around
po turns and sees shifu
hey hows it going
po turns back to the vase
to vase now how do you get five thousand cutting himself off master shifu
po bumps the vase which falls and breaks
but im gonna fix it
do you have some glue
the vase debris screams as po tries to pick up the pieces
po fumbles around
shifu looks irked
so youre the legendary dragon warrior
i guess so
shifu smiles and shakes his head
you are not the dragon warrior
you will never be the dragon warrior until you have learned the secret of the dragon scroll
he points to a dragon on the ceiling with a single scroll in its mouth
in awe whoa
then so how does this work
you have a ladder or trampoline or
you think its that easy
that i am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power
one must first master the highest level of kung fu
and that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you
someone like me
shifu walks around po pointing out his weaknesses
look at you
this fat butt
shifu hits po on the butt with his staff
those are sensitive in the flabby parts
shifu swats po on the arm with his staff
and this ridiculous belly
shifu hits po in the belly with his staff
and utter disregard for personal hygiene
pointing at shifu now wait a minute
thats a little uncalled for
dont stand that close
i can smell your breath
oogway said that i was the shifu pinches pos outstretched digit
gasp the wuxi finger hold
not the wuxi finger hold
sly oh you know this hold
developedbymasterwuxiinthethirddyna sty yes
oh then you must know what happens when i flex my pinky
po nervously eyes his finger locked in shifus grip and nods quickly
no no no
you know the hardest part of this
the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards
take it easy
now listen closely panda
oogway may have picked you but when im through with you i promise you youre going to wish he hadnt
are we clear
yeah were clear
we are so clear
i cant wait to get started
the doors open revealing po nursing his wounded finger
shifu steps out of the way and pos face goes into shock
the five are performing death defying kung fu moves in the training hall
tigress smashes a swinging spiked ball of wood
angle on an awestruck po as shards of wood blast into his face
po is intimidated and overwhelmed
shifu scowls at po
he gestures to the gauntlet
pos eyes go wide
wait wait wait
unless you think the great oogway was wrong and you are not the dragon warrior
well i dont know if i can do all of those moves
shifu walks away and po half heartedly follows
well if we dont try well never know will we
its just maybe we can find something more suited to my level
and what level is that
well ya know
im not a master but uh lets just start at zero level zero
there is no such thing as level zero
maybe i can start with that
po points at a rather friendly looking dummy
we use that for training children
and for propping the door open when its hot
but if you insist
relieved po turns to the dummy
the five gather around him
the furious five
youre so much bigger than your action figures except for you mantis
youre about the same
mantis gives him a look
go ahead panda
show us what you can do
um are they gonna watch
or should i just wait until they get back to work or something
i mean i just ate
so im still digesting
so my kung fu might not be as good as later on
just hit it
po psyches himself up doing some jack fu
you got nothing cause i got it right here
you picking on my friends
get ready to feel the thunder
im comin at him with the crazy feet
whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet
im a blur
im a blur
you never seen bear style you only seen praying mantis
i could come at you monkey style
im comin at ya snikity snake
shifu and the five stare at po perplexed
would you hit it
po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place
why dont you try again
a little harder
po punches it again knocking it all the way backwards
he turns to shifu smug
hows tha whap
the dummy rights itself and smacks po
totally dazed po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course
the five instinctively step forward to help po but shifu holds up his hand to stop them
ow that hurts
a spiky tethered ball sends po flying into the jade turtle exercise where it rattles him around
to the five thisll be easier than i thought
back to po in the turtle bowl
feeling a little nauseous
the turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of wooden dummies
ow those are hard
i think the last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes still
he struggles to get on his feet takes one step and reaches out to a dummy arm
and immediately gets pummeled all over again
po comes out the other side battered and bruised and finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of flame
we see reflections of fire on the five and shifu as po gets singed
he comes crawling into frame
how did i do
there is now a level zero
the five are walking to the bunkhouse which sits high on a hill
theres no words
no denying that
i dont understand what master oogway was thinking
the poor guys just gonna get himself killed
mocking he is so mighty
the dragon warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire
when he walks the very ground shakes
one would think that master oogway would choose someone who actually knew kung fu
yeah or could at least touch his toes
or even see his toes
as the others walk off we reveal po who unbeknownst to them has been walking behind them this whole time hearing everything
he attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut
he lifts up his stomach leans forward
and falls over
he gets up and watches them go inside
po peeks around the corner
he tip toes into the hall
the floorboards strain beneath him
po takes a gentle step
cre e e a aa chunk
pos foot goes through the floor
po tries to recover
squeak squeak squeak
po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom door
crane is staring back at him
i was just uh
some day huh
that kung fu stuff is hard work right
your biceps sore
crane looks at his wing
ive had a long and rather disappointing day so uh
yeah i should probably get to sleep now
yeah yeah yeah of course
relieved okay thanks
im such a big fan
you guys were totally amazing at the battle of weeping river
outnumbered a thousand to one but you didnt stop and then you just
po does a spastic series of kung fu moves
we hear a rip and reveal that hes kicked his foot through the paper wall
ooo sorry about that
look you dont belong here
po looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes
i just my whole life ive dreamed of crane stops po before he embarrasses himself even more
no no no
i meant you dont belong here
i mean in this room
this is my room
property of crane
po is mortified but covers
yeah you want to get to sleep
im keepin you up
we got big things tomorrow
last thing im gonna say
po shuts the door
the door flies open
po enters with an eager smile
what was that
i didnt say anything
po backs out into the hall and closes the door
seemed a little bit awkward
po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room
creak tigress opens the door behind him
didnt mean to wake you
you dont belong here
uh yeah yeah
this is your room
you dont belong in the jade palace
youre a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do you will be gone by morning
she closes the door on po who slumps sadly
a dejected po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight
i see you have found the sacred peach tree of heavenly wisdom
po spins around his face dripping with peach juice
mouth full is that what this is
i am so sorry
i thought it was just a regular peach tree
you eat when you are upset
im not upset
what makes you think im upset
so why are you upset
po sighs theres no use trying to lie to oogway
i probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu in the history of china in the history of sucking
and the five
man you should have seen them they totally hate me
hows shifu ever going to turn me into the dragon warrior
i mean im not like the five
ive got no claws no wings no venom
even mantis has those
he imitates a mantis front legs thingies
maybe i should just quit and go back to making noodles
quit dont quit
noodles dont noodles
po looks confused
you are too concerned with what was and what will be
there is a saying yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift
that is why it is called the present
oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a peach falls into pos open hand
using the gooses feather to pick the lock tai lung bursts free from his armor
an alarm rings out
the commander runs to the ledge the goose right behind him
the goose looks over the edge and sees tai lung at the bottom of the pit
tai lung struggles with his shackles
tai lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls creating a makeshift staircase
tai lung is free
i must warn shifu
the commander shuts the goose up
youre not going anywhere
and neither is he
let go of me
to guards bring it up
the winch turns and the elevator starts to rise
a rhino guard tries to reach it but just misses
bring it back
hes coming this way
he wont get far
to guards archers
leaping across the spears tai lung catches the elevator as the volley of arrows flies down past him
the guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit
tai lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and catches the guards by surprise
he grabs the chain and jumps over the edge and swings around launching himself up to the next tier disappearing into the shadows
tai lung lands on a bridge fights his way through finally reaching the top tier where the commander and the rest of the rhino army await
so very very dead
the commander hushes the goose
to goose heh heh
not yet were not
archers set off charges on the ceiling
massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble
tai lung leaps across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump towards the commander
but he falls short claws scraping and sparking against the rock wall
the commander laughs maniacally
on his way down tai lung looks up and sees a fuse burning down to the last group of explosives
he leaps across the raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern
grabbing a hold of the dynamite tai lung falls and slings it ahead of him at the guards
can we run now
the door blasts open and rhinos go flying everywhere
the goose hits the ground
the commanders horn prosthetic falls in front of him
tai lung picks up the goose by the throat
im glad shifu sent you
i was beginning to think i had been forgotten
with a creepy tenderness tai lung smooths the gooses ruffled feathers
fly back there and tell them
the real dragon warrior is coming home
tai lung throws the goose into the air and he flutters off
close up of a gong being struck
shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse
the five burst out of their rooms and land ready for inspection
good morning master
one door remains closed
panda wake up
he slides open pos door
the room is empty
shifu walks with a bit more energy
what do we do now master
with the panda gone who will be the dragon warrior
all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time the true dragon warrior will be revealed
shifu enters the training hall only to find himself face to face with pos butt
shifu and the five are taken aback
what are you doing here
reveal po is in the middle of the floor his legs spread wide apart
po looks back over his shoulder to see shifu and the five enter the hall
good morning master
i thought id warm up a little
yeah im stuck
to crane help him
crane approaches po
crane gingerly grabs pos waistband and attempts to pull him up by flapping his wings
maybe on three
two crane pulls him up and po flops onto his back
dont mention it
no really i appreci you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night
it takes years to develop ones flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat
shifu flings two boards into the air
instantly tigress leaps up and executes a perfect split kick
po is awestruck
as tigress lands the broken chunks of board land all around po knocking him on the head
po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir
shifu notices and steps forward
put that down
the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones
he laughs excitedly and salutes shifu
lets get started
shifu snaps his fingers
viper and po face off
are you ready
i was born ready viper lashes her tail around pos wrist wrenches his arm back flings him into the air and brings him crashing back down on his head
im sorry brother
i thought you said you were ready
that was awesome
lets go again
salutes shifu snaps
monkey twirls a bamboo staff
he lunges at po who takes a comical beating
po and crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl
po falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup
we see a series of shots of po falling on his face at the hands of some invisible opponent who turns out to be
flat on his back po manages a salute
shifu has had it
ive been taking it easy on you panda but no more
your next opponent
will be me
po looks excited
the five exchange worried looks
to po step forth
po doesnt even finish the step as shifu whirls him around and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him
the true path to victory is to find your opponents weakness and make him suffer for it
delighted oh yeah
shifu whips po around again
to take his strength and use it against him
again this time shifu holds po by the nose
until he finally falls or quits
po is totally inspired
but a real warrior never quits
dont worry master i will never quit
at his breaking point shifu flings po into the air and then leaps at him with a flying kick
po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps
the five watch him fall
if hes smart he wont come back up those steps
but he will
hes not gonna quit is he
hes not gonna quit bouncin ill tell ya that
cut wide as po continues to tumble
close on po who grimaces
i thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better
mantis pops up from behind po holding a handful of needles and sticks po again
trust me it will
its just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this fat
fur i was gonna say fur
sure you were
who am i to judge a warrior based on his size
i mean look at me
po looks for mantis
im over here
but mantis is now on his other shoulder
he jabs another needle into po
maybe you should take a look at this again
viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians onto which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda
re diagram oh
quick cuts to monkey meditating in his room and crane doing calligraphy in his
pos yelps distract them
laughing stop it stop yow
i know master shifus trying to inspire me and all but if i didnt know any better id say he was trying to get rid of me
the others look at each other and chuckle awkwardly
i know he can seem kind of heartless he violently jabs another needle in po
but ya know he wasnt always like that
according to legend there was once a time when master shifu actually used to smile
cut to tigress out in the hallway
she can hear them talking
but that was before
before tai lung
cranes shadow is silhouetted on the wall
uh yeah were not really supposed to talk about him
well if hes going to stay here he should know
trying to ease the tension guys guys
i know about tai lung
tigress turns to po
he was a student the first ever to master the thousand
tigress approaches po and leans in towards him
nervously trailing off scrolls of
then he turned bad
and now hes in jail
tigress shakes her head at the pandas ignorance
he wasnt just a student
shifu peeks out of the training hall and finds a baby leopard cub on the steps
shifu found him as a cub
and he raised him as a son
baby tai lung pulls on shifus whiskers
and when the boy showed talent in kung fu
baby tai lung punches the training dummy across the floor
shifu trained him
shifu teaches baby tai lung how to punch
he believed in him
he told him he was destined for greatness
hard cut to a full grown tai lung demolishing a training dummy
it was never enough for tai lung
he wanted the dragon scroll
but oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused
outraged tai lung laid waste to the valley
he tried to take the scroll by force
and shifu had to destroy what he had created
tai lung ransacks a village on his way up to the jade palace
he crashes through the doors running towards a waiting shifu and oogway
shifu leaps at tai lung to deliver a kick
but how could he
seeing only baby tai lung running towards him shifu pulls his kick short
tai lung counters with a devastating strike and shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg
tai lung leaps for the scroll but oogway stops him with strikes at his pressure points
he falls to the ground in a heap
shifu loved tai lung like hed never loved anyone before
young tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the same manner as tai lung
shifu corrects her form
young tigress looks crestfallen
the sad young tigress cross dissolves to adult tigress
everyone is quiet in the moment
and now he has a chance to make things right to train the true dragon warrior
and hes stuck with you a big fat panda who treats it like a joke
po makes a googly eyed face
charging at po oh
that is it
mantis pops up and halts tigress
i accidentally tweaked his facial nerve
po falls face first to the floor revealing his back is covered with needles
and may have also stopped his heart
shifu is sitting in meditation fidgeting incessantly
he finally opens one eye
would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down
satisfied with the silence shifu nods and resumes his meditation
zeng drops in from the ceiling
i could use some good news right now
oogway stands under the peach tree deep in thought
shifu rushes in emerging from the mist extremely agitated
out of breath i have its its very bad news
there is just news
there is no good or bad
master your vision
your vision was right
tai lung has broken out of prison
hes on his way
that is bad news
he turns to face shifu and stares at him eyebrow raised
if you do not believe that the dragon warrior can stop him
master that panda is not the dragon warrior
he wasnt even meant to be here it was an accident
there are no accidents
yes i know
youve said that already
well that was no accident either
my old friend the panda will never fulfill his destiny nor you yours until you let go of the illusion of control
look at this tree shifu
i cannot make it blossom when it suits me nor make it bear fruit before its time
but there are things we can control
shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet
i can control when the fruit will fall
a peach falls on his head and oogway chuckles
shifu tosses the peach in the air leaps up and splits it with a chop
and i can control shifu punches the ground creating a hole and places the seed in it
where to plant the seed
that is no illusion master
but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree
you may wish for an apple or an orange
but you will get a peach
but a peach cannot defeat tai lung
maybe it can
if you are willing to guide it to nurture it
to believe in it
oogway covers the seed with dirt
i need your help master
no you just need to believe
promise me shifu
promise me you will believe
i will try
oogway smiles then glances up at the sky then back down to shifu
my time has come
you must continue your journey without me
he hands his staff to a confused shifu
what are you
oogway backs away into the swirling fog
master you cant leave me
the petals surround oogway as he approaches the cliffs edge
you must believe
shifu runs after him
oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms
as the winds settle shifu is revealed standing at the edge of a cliff
oogway is gone
we pan across to the bunkhouse
so im like fine you may be a wolf you may be the scariest bandit in haijin province
reveal po is cooking for the five
he chops some veggies mid air
but youre a lousy tipper
howd you get out of there alive
i mean i didnt actually say that but i thought it
in my mind
po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm
he ladles soup into them
covering if he
could read my mind hed have been like what
then order up
po looks around expectantly and the five minus tigress dig in
hope you like it
this is really good
bashful no cmon
you should try my dads secret ingredient soup
he actually knows the secret ingredient
what are you talking about
this is amazing
wow youre a really good cook
i wish my mouth was bigger
the others laugh
but not tigress
tigress you gotta try this
tigress looks up from her meal
it is said that the dragon warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe
on the others for a beat
then po shrugs
i guess my body doesnt know its the dragon warrior yet
im gonna need a lot more than dew
and uh universe juice
he picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp
when he lowers the bowl we see a noodle hanging from his face it looks like a moustache
the rest start laughing
po realizes hes wearing a noodle moustache
he plays it up
imitating shifu you will never be the dragon warrior unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth
the five laugh
imitating shifu what is that noise youre making
i never heard of it
the five keep laughing
po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears
imitating shifu work hard panda
and maybe someday
you will have ears like mine
as the rest of the five laugh tigress sneaks a moment to smell pos soup
leaning towards the bowl she suddenly looks up and stops
the five also look up and stop laughing
reveal shifu has entered behind po
he is holding oogways staff
its not working for you
i thought they were pretty good
po looks at the stone faced five
tigress jumps to her feet
of course its shifu
what do you think im doing
he finally notices shifu standing there doing a slow burn
embarrassed he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra
po slurps up the noodle moustache
monkey cant help but snicker
you think this is funny
tai lung has escaped from prison and youre acting like children
he is coming for the dragon scroll and you are the only one who can stop him
the bowls fall off
a beat as this sinks in
then po starts to laugh
and here i am saying you got no sense of humor
im gonna stop tai
shifu just stares at him deadly serious
and i have to uh master oogway will stop him
he did it before hell do it again
oogway cannot not anymore
they notice shifu holding oogways staff
they know what this means
they are saddened by the news
our only hope is the dragon warrior
yes the panda
let us stop tai lung
this is what youve trained us for
it is not your destiny to defeat tai lung
it is his
he dramatically points at po
but po is gone
whered he go
shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after po
super wide shot as po runs away from the compound
closer as he continues running
he checks over his shoulder turns back
shifu lands right in front of him
you cannot leave
a real warrior never quits
he tries to maneuver around shifu but is redirected back
how am i supposed to beat tai lung
i cant even beat you to the stairs
you will beat him because you are the dragon warrior
he pushes po back with the staff
you dont believe that
you never believed that
from the first moment i got here youve been trying to get rid of me
shifu pokes him again this time causing po to fall on his back
but now i ask you to trust in your master as i have come to trust in mine
youre not my master
and im not the dragon warrior
po shoves the staff away and gets up
then why didnt you quit
you knew i was trying to get rid of you and yet you stayed
yeah i stayed
i stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said i smelled it hurt
but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me
po looks down at the valley then turns back to shifu
i stayed because i thought if anyone could change me could make me
not me it was you
the greatest kung fu teacher in all of china
but i can change you
i can turn you into the dragon warrior
and i will
cmon tai lung is on his way here right now
and even if it takes him a hundred years to get here how are you gonna change this
indicate belly into the dragon warrior
in frustration shifu yells out the answer
i dont know
then resigned i dont know
thats what i thought
shifu walks away leaving the path open to po
tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace
she has seen what just transpired between shifu and po
she turns away a look of resolve on her face
she flies through the air finally landing on a rooftop in the valley below
she looks back up at the palace
this is what you trained me for
she takes off running
the other four are right behind her
she keeps going and they give chase
dont try and stop me
the chase continues through the village
were not trying to stop you
were coming with you
the others join her
they leap off into the night
night dissolves to dawn
shifu sits under the peach tree
he stirs hearing kung fu noises from the training hall
he goes to investigate
shifu looks inside its empty
the noises continue from somewhere else the bunkhouse
as shifu turns the corner he sees pos shadow as he performs some amazing kung fu
entering the kitchen shifu finds po is stuffing his face with food
seeing shifu he stops mid munch
in silence they eye each other
shifu surveys the room broken lock smashed doors unhinged cabinets
mouth full what
i eat when im upset okay
shifu gets a glimmer in his eye
he has an idea
oh no need to explain
i just thought you might be monkey he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf
shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway waiting to see if his hunch is correct
shifu peeks back inside and finds po perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his mouth
po notices shifu walking back in
mouth full dont tell monkey
he glances back down at shifu whose disbelief turns to a wise smile
look at you
yeah i know
i disgust you
no no i mean
how did you get up there
i dont know
i guess i i dont know
i was getting a cookie
he looks at the cookie and then cant help but eat it
and yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split
this is just an accident
he and po stare at each other for a beat
po slips and crashes to the kitchen floor
a cookie rolls over to shifu
he picks it up
there are no accidents
come with me
shifu leads po through the mountains
i know youre trying to be all mystical and kung fu y but could you at least tell me where were going
shifu just continues walking
shifu is sitting beneath a tree
winded and wheezing po slowly works his way up the hill
po sets his gear down and looks around
shifu breathes in the morning mist as po approaches
you dragged me all the way out here for a bath
po begins to pat his armpits with water
panda we do not wash our pits in the pool of sacred tears
po quickly stops
in awe the pool of
this is where oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus
this is the birthplace of kung fu
the camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol
as the camera pulls further out it pulls back through a vision of oogway doing kung fu moves
flash frame shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks down at po
do you want to learn kung fu
then i am your master
tears of joy well up in pos eyes
po sniffs the tears back and smiles
shifu leads po out into an open field
when you focus on kung fu when you concentrate
but perhaps that is my fault
i cannot train you the way i have trained the five
i now see that the way to get through to you is with this
shifu produces a bowl of dumplings
oh great cause im hungry
when you have been trained you may eat
let us begin
pos training unfolds deep breathing exercises balance tests push ups sit ups climbing etc
through it all he never gets to eat although he does indeed learn kung fu
shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder
after you panda
po stops short suspicious
just like that
no ten mile hike
i vowed to train you
and you have been trained
you are free to eat
po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks
po raises the dumpling to his mouth
shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself
i said you are free to eat
have a dumpling
po reaches again as shifu leaps across the table and kicks the dumpling into the air
shifu eats it and po scowls
you are free to eat
upset am i
challenging are you
po and shifu ready their chopsticks
po slams the table and sends the bowl of dumplings airborne
back and forth po and shifu spar vying for the dumplings
until there is only one left
shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from po
he hides it underneath one of the bowls
he uses his chopsticks as weapons to smack pos chopsticks away
he attacks po with his bamboo staff
but po skillfully manages to best shifu for the final dumpling
po has passed the final test
but then po tosses the dumpling into shifus open hand
im not hungry
master and pupil bow to each other
the five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks
tai lung appears at the other end of the bridge
he roars and races toward them
the others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain
tai lung is almost upon them when tigress cuts the final rope
but tai lung is too close tigress must launch herself into him
the two cats end up in the middle of the bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below
the five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life
wheres the dragon warrior
how do you know youre not looking at her
tai lung laughs
it echoes off the mountain walls
you think im a fool
i know youre not the dragon warrior
none of you
the five exchange quick worried looks
nodding confidently i heard how he fell out of the sky on a ball of fire that hes a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen
the five exchange quick confused looks
so that is his name po
finally a worthy opponent
our battle will be legendary
tigress charges at him
the battle begins
tigress punches tai lung as he hangs from the bridge
but tai lung counters with a maneuver that sends tigress slamming backwards through the bridges wooden slats
then tigress gets choked by the bridges ropes
monkey turns to crane and viper
weve got this
viper grabs tai lung which causes him to let go of the ropes
tigress plummets down into the gorge
but crane manages to catch her
viper punches tai lung repeatedly with his own fist
tai lung manages to get a paw around vipers throat
angle on mantis and monkey
mantis is straining to hold the rope by himself
what was i thinking
monkey leaps into action kicking tai lung in the chest and sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge
he gets back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single strand of rope
mantis whips his end of the rope sending a sine wave shooting toward tai lung
the rope whips tai lung in the face and he gets tangled up
the five see their chance
working as a team the five kick tai lungs butt every which way
tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up tai lung
he plummets down
disappearing into the mist
mantis whips his end of the rope returning his buddies safely to the mountain
the five look relieved
but the relief is short lived
tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling the far mountain peak
her eyes go wide with dread
the rope whips up
but tai lung isnt there
with a crash he suddenly appears behind the five
shifu taught you well
tai lung jabs a finger at monkey who instantly freezes
but he didnt teach you everything
tai lung lunges toward the rest
shifu and po walk through the palace courtyard
po has an easy spring in his step
you have done well panda
ive done awesome
he swings his belly around and knocks shifu off balance
shifu staggers back regaining his dignity
the mark of a true hero is humility
after a moments thought though he leans toward po but yes
you have done awesome
and he punches him playfully on the arm
po smiles at him
as they laugh an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them
crane carries the five to the palace grounds crashing in a heap
po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them
no theyre breathing
no their eyes are open
crane struggles to lift his head
we were no match for his nerve attack
his head collapses to the ground
he has gotten stronger
shifu starts freeing the five
first viper then mantis then monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis hes too fast
he delivers a kung fu punch to pos head and then slowly realizes where he is
shifu kneels before tigress and works to free her
i thought we could stop him
he could have killed you
why didnt he
so you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts
but it wont work
uh it might i mean a little
im pretty scared
you can defeat him panda
are you kidding
if they cant theyre five masters
im just one me
but you will have the one thing that no one else does
close up of the dragon scroll
po stares at shifu then looks up at the scroll
then back at shifu you really believe im ready
you are po
they look at each other
this is a big moment
oogways staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles
as po and the five stand by shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool
shifu bows his head then eyes still closed he raises the staff up above his head
po and the others watch expectantly
the peach blossom petals rise in a flickering spinning cloud up from the pool
the gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the dragon scroll
the petals loosen the scroll from the dragons mouth and it falls
at the last second shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it
he turns to po holding it out
the dragon scroll
it is yours
wait what happens when i read it
no one knows but legend says you will be able to hear a butterflys wing beat
and see light in the deepest cave
you will feel the universe in motion around you
can i punch through walls
can i do a quadruple back flip
will i have invisibility focus
read it po and fulfill your destiny
read it and become
the dragon warrior
po takes a deep breath
then he grasps the tube and tries to pull the top off it
it doesnt budge
he strains at it
its impossible to open
he strains again
he tries to bite it off
come on baby
come on now
shifu sighs and holds out his hand
po passes him the tube
shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to po
i probably loosened it up for you though
okay here goes
he glances at the five
they look on in awe
monkey gives him the thumbs up
po starts to unroll the scroll the golden light bathing his face
across the scroll we see shifu excited that he is witness to history
on pos face as he finishes opening the scroll
then shifu looks concerned
the five look concerned
po looks utterly terrified
po tries to show shifu the scroll
shifu covers his eyes and turns his head away
i am forbidden to look upon but he cant help himself
he takes a peek
then he grabs if off po
he turns it around then upside down
he closes it and opens it again astonished
i dont understand
shifu turns away contemplative
what can this mean
so like oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all
oogway was wiser than us all
po sits heavily on the floor dejected
oh come on
he picked me by accident
of course im not the dragon warrior
who am i kidding
the five dont argue
but who will stop tai lung
hell destroy everything
shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it
he looks oddly calm as he turns around
no evacuate the valley
you must protect the villagers from tai lungs rage
what about you master
i will fight him
i can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape
but shifu hell kill you
then i will finally have paid for my mistake
the five and po look devastated
listen to me all of you
it is time for you to continue your journey without me
i am very proud to have been your master
shifu salutes them and turns away
po is heartbroken
crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around po pulling away
po resists for a moment then lets the five lead him off
the five arrive at the base of the stairs
weve got to get them out safely
monkey picks up a small child
come little one
lets find your mama
viper gather the southern farmers
mantis the north
crane light the way
they split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate
po is left by himself
he makes his way through the bustling town
skeptically look its the dragon warrior
po approaches the noodle shop
seeing po pos dad hurries over and wraps his arms around his son
po bends down to reciprocate the hug as pos dad pulls away having fastened an apron around pos waist
good to have you back son
listlessly good to be back
pos dad goes back to packing things up
lets go po
so for our next shop its time to face it the future of noodles is dice cut vegetables no longer slices
dad starts to walk off unaware that po isnt following
also i was thinking maybe this time well have a kitchen you can actually stand up in
you like that
he turns and notices that po hasnt moved
he walks to po sympathetically
po im sorry things didnt work out
wasnt meant to be
po slumps against the cart
po forget everything else
your destiny still awaits
we are noodle folk broth runs deep through our veins
i dont know dad
honestly sometimes i cant believe im actually your son
dad is taken aback
po i think its time i told you something i should have told you a long time ago
dad pauses dramatically
the secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup
po feigns excitement
the secret ingredient is
you heard me
there is no secret ingredient
its just plain old noodle soup
you dont add some kind of special sauce or something
dont have to
to make something special you just have to believe its special
po looks at his father with dawning realization
he picks up the scroll
for a moment po stares at his reflection on the scroll then he smiles serenely
he gets it now
there is no secret ingredient
po turns back to look at the palace
at the top of the stairs shifu looks upon the valley awaiting his fate
with a gust of wind tai lung appears before him
i have come home master
this is no longer your home
and i am no longer your master
you have a new favorite
so where is this
did i scare him off
this battle is between you and me
that is how its going to be
that is how it must be
tai lung punches shifu clean through the doors of the jade palace
tai lung enters
i rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness
obeying your master is not weakness
you knew i was the dragon warrior
you always knew
dissolve to flashback
a young tai lung looks expectant
oogway shakes his head
but when oogway said otherwise what did you do
what did you do
tai lung looks to shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present
shifu takes a kung fu stance
you were not meant to be the dragon warrior
that was not my fault
enraged tai lung knocks over the kung fu artifacts and throws them at shifu
shifu dodges each attack
it was never my decision to make
tai lung pulls oogways staff from the shrine
it is now
tai lung pins shifu down with the staff
give me the scroll
i would rather die
they struggle for a beat until finally the staff splinters into a hundred pieces
shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by
caught off guard shifu gets kicked by tai lung into a column
shifu climbs the column to the rafters
tai lung follows and sends them both crashing through the roof
grappling in mid air tai lung gets his hands around shifus throat as they crash back through the roof
they kick apart
shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard
tai lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the floor
flames go everywhere
tai lungs arms are aflame as he charges at shifu
all i ever did i did to make you proud
tell me how proud you are shifu
a fiery punch sends shifu skidding across the floor and crashing against the reflecting pool
the flames extinguish and tai lung extends his claws
weakly i have always been proud of you
from the first moment ive been proud of you
and it was my pride that blinded me
i loved you too much to see what you were becoming
what i was turning you into
tai lung stops in his tracks
tai lungs expression goes cold
he grabs shifu by the throat
i dont want your apology
i want my scroll
he holds shifu up to the ceiling
looking up tai lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing
tai lung slams shifu to the floor
weakly dragon warrior has taken scroll halfway across china by now
you will never see that scroll tai lung
tai lung is furious
he roars ready to strike shifu
tai lung turns around to find po standing in the doorway
out of breath stairs
tai lung casts shifu aside
who are you
buddy i am the dragon warrior
exhales hard huhhh
to shifu hes a panda
back to po youre a panda
what are you gonna do big guy
sit on me
dont tempt me
im gonna use this
you want it
come and get it
po shows him the dragon scroll
from out of nowhere tai lung appears and punches po across the room grabbing the scroll knocked from pos hands
po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into tai lung sending him flying into a column
po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as tai lung recovers and charges
po turns to run
tai lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the palace steps
po clings to the scroll as tai lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below
po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and smash tai lung
he briefly skids across the rooftop and comes right back at po
that scroll is mine
down the theater steps po and tai lung grapple for the scroll
po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion his voluminous butt presses down on tai lungs head
as they crash through the gateway the scroll is knocked loose
tai lung goes for the scroll but po snatches it away using a noodle lasso
the scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head
tai lung leaps for it but po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see saws po into the air
in mid air po slurps the noodle
up and over the rooftops po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop
the scroll rolls to a stop in the street
as tai lung makes his move on the scroll po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game sliding the woks around to hide the scroll
tai lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as po uses his bamboo stilts to block tai lung
the leopard swipes out the stilts and brings po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river
po gets thrown into a fireworks booth
as tai lung chases down the scroll he turns back to see po flying through the fireworks filled sky
po slams through tai lung and crashes into a rock wall
the scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon
he looks back at tai lung who sees where the scroll has landed
via the magic of cookie vision po effortlessly scales the building
tai lung is shocked
the scroll has given him power
then he takes a giant leap and kicks the wall
the resulting shockwave collapses the building
amazingly po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid air as tai lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends po
smashing into the ground
as tai lung lands he delivers a final devastating punch
as the dust settles tai lung is looming over po in the impact crater
out of breath finally
the power of the dragon scroll
tai lung grabs for the scroll and opens it
his face falls
i didnt get it the first time either
po gets to his feet
there is no secret ingredient
its just you
tai lung snarls and lunges at po
tai lung attacks pos nerve points
but po begins giggling
im gonna pee
tai lungs nerve attack has no effect on po
frustrated he delivers a double fisted punch to pos belly
the shockwave ripples through pos entire body and pos arms come back and strike tai lung sending the leopard crashing back into a building
po looks at his hands amazed at what he just did
tai lung rises from the rubble and runs at po again
but po strikes back using an unorthodox panda style technique even getting tai lung to chomp down on his own tail
po gives tai lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building
tai lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at po
but po prepares
and tai lung is swiftly met by pos iron belly
he is launched into the air
until finally tai lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground
tai lung is battered but still defiant
heavy breathing you
cant defeat me
youre just a big fat panda
po grabs tai lungs finger
tai lungs eyes go wide
im not a big fat panda
im the big fat panda
pos pinky pops up
tai lung gasps
the wuxi finger hold
oh you know this hold
shifu didnt teach you that
i figured it out
he flexes his pinky
a mushroom cloud appears over the valley sweeping past the furious five and the fleeing villagers
villagers emerge from hiding
po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream
the dragon warrior
as he nears we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron
villagers cheer the dragon warrior
pos dad emerges from the crowd
thats my boy
that big lovely kung fu warrior is my son
po hugs his dad
the wok falls off pos head and rolls on the ground until mantis appears in frame and stops it
the rest of the five are with him
po takes notice
tigress bows deeply
the others follow
then remembering master shifu
po races toward the jade palace
he climbs the steps
then more steps
po arrives breathless at the jade palace
shifu is still lying in the scroll room his eyes closed
po rushes to his side
are you okay
shifu weakly opens his eyes
then darkly or were both dead
no master i didnt die
i defeated tai lung
shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief
it is as oogway foretold you are the dragon warrior
you have brought peace to this valley
and to me
thank you po
shifu closes his eyes
he is still
po starts freaking out
no no no
dont die shifu
eyes snapping open im not dying you idiot ah dragon warrior
im simply at peace
so um i should
if you can
po nods reverently as shifu closes his eyes again
master and pupil lie next to each other
the camera pulls up and back away from them
po tries to remain still but its hard
hes about to say something but he stops himself
he fidgets for a beat then cant control himself any longer
want to get something to eat
