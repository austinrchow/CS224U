starship enterprise on training mission to gamma hydra
approaching neutral zone all systems functioning
as the angle widens we see the crew at stations screens and visual displays are in use commander sulu at the helm commander uhura at the comm con sole dr
bones mccoy and spock at his post
the captain is new and unexpected
saavik is young and beautiful
she is half vulcan and half romulan
in appearance she is vulcan with pointed ears but her skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless facial immobility of a vulcan
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
im getting something on the distress channel
can you amplify
course change projected
its an emergency distress call
filtered breaking up imperative
this is the kobayashi maru nineteen periods out of altair six
we have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power
our hull is
breaks up static and many casualties
this is the starship enterprise
your message is breaking up
give your coordinates
repeat enterprise our position is gamma hydra section ten
in the neutral zone
hull penetrated life support systems failing
can you assist us enterprise
data on kobayashi maru
tactical on big screen
subject vessel is third class neutronic fuel carrier crew of eighty one three hundred passengers
sulu plot an intercept course
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone im aware of my responsibilities mister
with a nod now entering the neutral zone
we have entered the neutral zone
estimating two minutes to intercept
on screen enterprise approaches the stricken vessel
stand by transporter room ready to beam survivors aboard
captain ive lost their signal
sensors indicate three klingon cruisers bearing mark closing fast
on screen we see the approach of the klingon vessels they are dark and sinister
continuing battle stations
the alarm sounds
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission
theyre jamming all frequencies captain klingons on attack course and closing
screen verifies this
saavik makes an agonized choice
were over our heads
sulu get us out of here
ill try captain
klingon cruisers approaching bearing mark
the image flops more klingons approach
they fire photon torpedoes
continuing evasive action
sulu does his best but enterprise is hit sulu is hurled from his station and bones hurries to him
main energizer hit captain
engage auxiliary power
prepare to return fire
the bridge takes another hit a big one
in its wake there is a second electrical explosion along the communi cations panel
uhura falls from her station
bones rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms
shields collapsing captain
captain were losing auxiliary power
fire all phasers
no power to the weapons system sir
another hit reverberating flashes of spark and flame on the bridge
bones comes to him but even as he coughs his way through the smoke a final hit and bones falls
the room is smoke filled and a shambles
saavik looks about in shock
captain its no use
were dead in space
saavik digests this for a painful moment
then touch ing a comm button activate escape pods
send out the log buoy
all hands abandon ship
repeat all hands all right open her up
there is a loud clanging and the side walls of the bridge slide apart revealing a lighted room beyond
through the opening strides kirk
he stops surveys the shambles and shakes his head
any suggestions admiral
the klingons do not take prisoners
to spock captain
trainees to the briefing room
sulu awakens with a grin
uhura straightens herself demurely
the trainees head toward the distant room spock rises and leaves
bones remains on the floor head propped in his hand whimsically
physician heal thyself
thats all you have to say
im not a drama critic
bones rolls his eyes and rises
kirk sees saavik who has not moved
continuing well mr
saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship
permission to speak candidly sir
fights emotion i dont believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not
there was no way to win
a no win situation is a possibility every commander may face
has that never occurred to you
it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life wouldnt you say
falters as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
then you have something new to think about
she stays at attention
wouldnt it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship
galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young doctor
they look at each other
offended what is that supposed to mean
hold on saavik
kirk rounds the corner and sees spock leaning against the wall
dry arent you dead
spock almost smiles
continuing i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets
i am understandably curious
they walk together
they destroyed the simulator room and you with it
the kobayshi maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment
dry as i recall you took the test three times yourself
your final solution was shall we say unique
solemn it had the virtue of never having been tried
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
so you said at the time
speaking of which your protgs first rare a trifle emotional shes half romulan jim
the admixture makes her more volatile than me for example
yes i see that
by the way thank you for this
he lifts the book
i know of your fondness for antiques
reads it was the best of times it was the worst of times
none of which i am consciously aware except of course happy birthday surely the best of times
kirk looks around uncomfortably overlaps hrummm
and where are you off to now
i must check in before your inspection
spock studies him something oppresses you
they are old friends something
he steps into a turbo elevator
the doors close as spock watches wiping the scene
is the u
reliant an older somewhat battered starship of the enterprise class with a slightly different configuration
reliant approaches an inhospitable looking yellow planet ceti alpha v starship log stardate
this report classified most secret
log entry by commander pavel chekov duty officer
starship uss reliant on orbital approach with ceti alpha vi in connection with project code name genesis
we are continuing our search for a lifeless planet which will serve as a suitable test site for the genesis experiments
this is the th planet we have visited so far no success
well aged and distinctive
the usual compliment of officers and crew
captain clark terrell about soft spoken and in good shape but somewhat laconic
behind terrell surveying the data screen is commander chekov aged some but still boyish
standard orbit mr
standard orbit sir
any change in surface scan
limited atmosphere dominated by craylon gas sand and high velocity winds
incapable of supporting life forms
forward screen ceti alpha does it have to be completely lifeless
terrell rises and crosses to chekov
dont tell me youve got something
points weve picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
are you sure
maybe the scanners out of adjustment i suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right lets get on the comm pic to doctor marcus
maybe its something we can transplant
you know what shell say
a functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific complex a futuristic white sands orbiting a small barren plantoid in b
something you can transplant
i dont know big but deserted except for carol in contact with reliant
surrounded by equipment clearly meant for many workers carol marcus is in her early forties attractive and intelligent
static mars the trans missions
on the monitor terrell and chekov looking hopeful
it might only be a particle of preanimate matter
then again it might not
you boys have to be clear on this there cant be so much as a microbe or the shows off
she thinks why dont you have a look
if it is something that can be moved
eager you bet doctor
were on our way
carol sighs as the image fades not happy
carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with david her son a bright young scientist of twenty
he is good looking and humorous
how can you let them pull that stuff on you
theyre just lazy
but maybe it is something they can
come on mother thats just the military mentality
never put off tomorrow what you can put off today
if theres one atom of life
i know i know
well dont have kittens
genesis is going to work
theyll remember you in a wreath with newton einstein surak
mock outrage thanks a lot
no respect from my offspring par for the course
you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner
every time we have dealings with starfleet i get nervous
shrugs were dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon
remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with
thats exactly the they walk past the camera their voices fading
listen kiddo jim kirk was many things but he was never a boy scout
hold on the empty corridor
kirk reads the novel trying to focus
his flat befits an admiral and a loner with few possessions except a collection of antiques
startled kirk lowers the book and pushes a button
the door slides open and bones enters
he carries two packages one of them wrapped in brown paper
continuing bless me doctor and what beams you into this neck of the woods
beware romulans bearing gifts
with a flourish he pulls out a bottle of blue liquid
bones you know this stuff is illegal broad i only use it for medicinal purposes
dont be a pring
reading the label with difficulty twenty two eighty three
takes the stuff a while to ferment
he takes the bottle and pours continues talking
continuing now open the other one
kirk starts to obey
im almost afraid to
what did you bring me contraband klingon more antiques for your collection cheers
the package is opened a pair of gold ben franklin half glasses
romulan ale is an instant drunk both men react
bones these are
four hundred years old
you dont find many with the lens still intact
uh what are they
for your eyes
for most patients of your age i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens
but im allergic to retlax
kirk is unsure how they work
continuing slide them down your nose
now look at me over the top
and you read printed matter through the bottom
i dont know what to say say thank you
an awkward silence
damn it jim what the hells the matter
other people have birthdays
whyre we treating yours like a funeral
bones i dont want to be lectured
what do you want
damn it why isnt there a girl here
you know this has nothing to do with age
this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies
spare me your notions of poetry please
we all have our assigned duties and
youre hiding hiding behind the rules and regulations and who am i hiding from
from yourself admiral
kirk pours another drink
dont mince words bones tell me what you really think
mild take im your doctor and im your friend jim
get back your command
get it back before you really do grow old
before you turn into part of this collection
they look at each other
orbiting ceti alpha v
voices over indicate the transporter room is ready
a yellow planet in constant swirling hurricane winds of sand
terrell and chekov materialize
their voices filtered are hard to make out
with the tricorder to guide them they set out
are you sure these are the coordinates
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi i can hardly see the difficult search the men leaning into the wind is ahead of chekov on a slight
rise theres nothing lets go terrell waves him frantically forward
as chekov moves up we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down
a ruined series of man made structures half buried in sand
they look at each other in consternation
chekov is worried something about all this is familiar
they descend towards the structures now seen to be the wreckage of some sort of space craft
they pass but do not notice the federation logo half buried next to their feet
they look like cargo carriers
as chekov looks at the porthole a face suddenly looks back
it is the face of a child
the apparition scares the daylights out of chekov and us
continuing what is it
he comes clumsily over a face
i saw it was like a child he points
the porthole is empty
i saw it
theres an air lock
he points and they go into the airlock
terrell and chekov enter dumbfounded
someone lives here there are beds food all jury rigged but no people
terrell checks a monitor
theres breathable atmosphere in here
he takes off his helmet chekov likewise
continuing what the hell is this
did they crash
wheres the rest of the ship
they wander as they talk picking up objects that be speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment a laboratory in one hold a kitchen a large sand tank filled with
disgusting ceti eels
abruptly a sound they start childs gurgle
terrified i told you
i told you i saw a ssssh
they start looking
they enter a new chamber on its side in the sand the walls are now the floor etc
all in crookedness like its owner
on the floor smiling at them i
the wall is a baby
tentatively they come over to it looking around lethal looking odd swords on one wall a bookshelf camera pans by th century volumes moby dick king lear the holy bible
and a seat belt dangling with the name on it botany bay chekov mouths the words softly at first then aloud botany bay oh no
examines the child whats the matter
chekov runs tries to get his helmet on tries to drag terrell captain weve got to get out of here now damn
terrell catches his urgency but the child never mind
terrell and chekov emerge helmeted then stop dead
a ring of suited figures has them surrounded
beach the duty officer stands looking at ceti alpha v on the forward screen
starship reliant to captain terrell this is lieutenant kyle
will you please respond captain
captain terrell respond please
thinks lets give them a little more time
terrell and chekov are held by four strong men
they seem to be waiting
one of the men is joachim
out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure
a moment of suspense as terrell and chekov watch terri fied
the mask is peeled back
aloud despite himself khan
khan is startled by the recognition comes over and examines chekov and terrell
finally i dont know you
i never forget a face
mister chekov isnt it
wonderingly i never thought to see your face again
chekov who is this man
a criminal captain a product of the late th century genetic engineering what do you want with us
i demand mild you are in a position to demand nothing sir
i on the other hand am in a position to grant nothing
what you see is all that remains of the ships company and the crew of the botany bay marooned here fifteen years ago by captain james t
listen to me you men and women save your strength captain these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born
do you mean he
chekov never told you the tale
to amuse you captain
never told you how the enterprise picked up the botany bay lost in space from the year myself and the ships company in cryogenic freeze
ive never even met admiral kirk admiral
he didnt tell you how admiral kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us
on ceti alpha v there was life a fair chance to this is ceti alpha v ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here
the shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste
admiral kirk never bothered to check on our progress
it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive
on earth two hundred years ago i was a prince with power over millions now like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails
captain kirk was your host
you repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him
moves closer and ill wager he never told you about his shipmate the beautiful and courageous lieutenant mcgiver who gave up everything to join me in exile
out of love
and see how admiral kirk requited her devotion shes dead as earth
the wind howls in the silence
when khan turns his eyes are filled with tears
continuing a plague upon you all
he recovers his poise and returns to them continuing you didnt expect to find me
you thought this was ceti alpha vi
why are you here
they dont answer
khan goes over to terrell and with continuing why
terrell gasps stays silent continuing no matter
he lets go terrell falls with a thud continuing you will soon tell me willingly enough
he goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in pulling out two ceti eels wriggling items continuing let me introduce you to ceti alpha vs only
remaining indigenous life form what do you think
theyve killed twenty of my people including my beloved wife
oh not all at once and not instantly to be sure
their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex
this has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion
later as they grow follows madness paralysis and death
these are pets of course not quite domesticated
as he speaks khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis khan listen to me
captain kirk was only doing his duty
you there is some pain at first i am told and then the effects are quite benign until the end
that was what i learned from watching my wife
at a sign the helmets are slammed down
as the muffled shrieks are heard from within the eels crawl across the faces of chekov and terrell with unerring in stincts they head for the ears of the two
there is some atrocious pain as they enter then dazed calm
continuing thats better
now tell me why you are here and tell me where i may find james kirk
this is reliant please respond
no answer beach makes up his mind mr
kyle muster a landing party with full arms
alert the transporter room
were beaming down
he heads for the door but is stopped by filtered reliant this is terrell
this is reliant
clark are you all right
filtered everythings fine commander
ill explain when i see you
oh by the way were bringing several guests aboard
prepare to beam up on my next signal
beach and kyle look at each other
maybe we are transplanting something
a space shuttle moving toward us
a new composite
bones sulu uhura and kirk who sits reading
through the windows we can see the approach to the starship enterprise
kirk looks up nods
sulu activates a comm button
enterprise this is admiral kirks party on final approach
filtered enterprise welcomes you
prepare for docking
kirk looks up from his book as sulu sits next to him
i really must thank you
embarrassed i am delighted any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally
by the end of the month youll have your first command uss excelsior
thank you sir
ive looked forward to this for a long time
youve earned it
but im still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks
i dont believe these kids can steer
the shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip
as we near the ship a few work crews in space flit about her hull working
the shuttle makes its way to the docking lock of the mother ship and settles in place
a reception group awaits led by captain spock
saavik stands at his side in company of the trainee crew
also present chief engineer mr
scott and members of his staff in their distinctive uniforms
docking procedure complete
prepare for admirals inspection
the group comes to attention
continuing open the air lock
the doors open
kirk and his staff are piped aboard by an electronic version of the boatswains tradi tional whistle
kirk salutes the federation symbol and steps forward to exchange salutes with spock
permission to come aboard captain
welcome aboard admiral
i believe you know my trainee crew
certainly they have come to know you
dryly to saavik yes weve been through death and life together
saavik stiffens slightly humor is not her forte
continuing to scotty mr
scott you old space dog
i had me a wee bout but dr
mccoy pulled me through
a wee bout of what mr
uncomfortable scotty exchanges a glance with bones shore leave admiral
he stops before a bright faced fourteen year old stand ing so stiff he looks like hell break in an engineers uniform
continuing and who is this
breathless midshipman first class peter preston engineers mate sir
a big salute
kirk is amused returns the salute
your first training voyage mr
well shall we start with the engine room
he moves followed by his staff
eyeing his protg i believe youll find all in order well see you on the bridge admiral
very good mr
kirk and party leave
camera pushes in on spock and hes not what i expected sir
what did you expect lieutenant
uncertain hes very human
we cant all be perfect saavik
you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land
around you are humans and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence
you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you
tolerance is logical
saavik is humbled
as always my mentor
the inspection party dwarfed by the size
silence as kirk looks around runs a finger for dust etc
scotty his team and preston stand at attention
featuring power room separated by glass from the rest of the facilities
bones sulu uhura and some train ees watch as kirk inspects one console clearly the responsibility of the bursting midshipman preston
blurting i believe youll find everything shipshape admiral
sternly puts him on oh do you
have you any idea midshipman preston how many times ive had to listen to mr
scott on the comm telling me his troubles
have you any idea the ribbing ive had to endure in the officers mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap
scandalized oh no sir
this is the finest engine room in the whole star the repressed grins of the others and a smile on scottys face tell preston hes being had
he stops confused
continuing if the admiral cant see the facts for himself then with all due respect hes as blind as a tiberion bat
kirk looks amused
midshipman youre a tiger
my sisters youngest admiral
crazy to get to space
every young boys fancy
i seem to remember it myself
brisk very well
scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise
give the word admiral
scott the word is given
he moves off followed by preston who gives one last salute as kirk leaves followed by bones
dry what about the rest of the inspection admiral
the inspection will continue once were underway doctor
they step into the turbo lifts
the real one no doubt
camera reveals the maze detail winking and blinking displays all hands at station a hum of activity uhura and sulu in familiar chairs spock is in the captains chair saavik
in the first officers position
kirk and bones stand towards the rear
this is starfleet operations
enterprise is cleared for departure
admiral on the bridge
very well mr
saavik clear all moorings
saavik punches data into her console
the dock slowly folds away from the ship
saavik watches instruments punches data in response
all moorings are clear captain
thank you mr
spock casts a glance at kirk then to saavik continuing lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock
kirk tries to conceal his reaction
spock enjoys it
take her out mr
saavik settles herself in the chair looks again at the console spock looks at kirk
theres a first time for everything admiral
casual to be sure captain
they all stifle their responses
kirk is like a father watching his kid drive the family car for the first time
aft thrusters mr
aft thrusters sir
as the ship slowly and majestically leaves the dock
ahead one quarter impulse power
kirk starts to say something but doesnt
bones looks at him
sotto voice would you like a tranquilizer
kirk shakes his head takes a breath ahead one quarter impulse power
the ship clears the dock and begins heading into space
kirk quietly lets his breath out
we are clear and free to navigate
course heading captain
spock turns inquiringly to kirk
spock digests this with a slight smile
sulu you may follow your nose
she gathers speed into the vastness of space
moving towards us in opposition to the previous shot close enough for us to read her markings
khan occupies the captains chair
we pull back the crew of the reliant has been replaced by khans fol lowers in their odd looking clothes
at the helm is joachim khans lieutenant
he is in the largest and brightest of khans group
terrell sits in the first officers chair chekov at the comm console
their behavior is normal save for subtle hesitation symptoms of their mind controlled state
steady on course
all systems normal
its not much different from enterprise
beat when i was a guest aboard her some years ago captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals
and now mr
chekov let us review you say you have no details of project genesis
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
and would admiral kirk have access to such information
i would think so sir
hes on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
thinks i see
may i speak
were all with you sir but consider we are free we have a ship and the means to go where we will
we have escaped permanent exile on ceti alpha v
you have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans of admiral kirk
you do not need to defeat him again
he tasks me and ill have him
ill chase him round the moons of nibia and round the antares maelstrom and round perditions flames before i give him up
as no one speaks prepare to alter course for space station regula i
huge and busy
among the scientists going about their tasks are jedda a deltan march thin intense madison black easy going
they are all young and earnest
carol and david huddle over a computer console
does that about do it
i dont think theres another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks
next time well design a bigger one
who jedda at the comm console overlaps
comm pic coming in on hyperchannel its reliant
carol moves forward as the others close in
on the screen please jedda
buttons punched the screen ebbs flows and crackles on
on screen is chekov
come in please
this is reliant calling regula i
this is uss reliant commander we are receiving
this is regula i
were en route to you and should be there in three days
we werent expecting you for another three months
has something happened
pause has something happened do you read us
fractional pause all went well
nothing has happened
ceti alpha vi has checked out
pleased reaction from the scientists
i still dont under we have received new orders
upon our arrival at regula i all materials of project genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi
consternation in the lab
david is livid the words bullshit are overlapped by his mother
will you please be quiet back to console commander chekov this is completely irregular
who gave the order you are quoting
who gave the order
still smiling the order comes from starfleet command dr
marcus direct from the general staff
but genesis is a civilian project under my control i have my orders
pin him down mother
who gave the orders
chekov hesitates seems to be listening to someone off the monitor
the orders come from admiral james t
sensation in the lab
i knew it
i knew it
all along the military has wanted to get their hands on this he starts to press a button carol pushes his hand away and communicates herself
this is completely improper commander chekov
i have no intention of allowing reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials
pauses listens im sorry you feel that way doctor
admiral kirks orders are confirmed
please prepare to deliver genesis to us upon our arrival
the image fades
chekov in a matched cut turns away as camera widens to reveal khan by his side
he is charming
well done commander
you realize sir that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order
khan smiles more charming than ever as we move in
everyone is talking at once
will you please be quiet
we must have order here
as they subside this has to be some sort of mistake
were all alone here
they waited until everyone was on shift leave to do this
reliant is supposed to be at our disposal not vice versa
it seems clear that starfleet never intended that i know but ive tried to warn you
scientists are always pawns of the military angry starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years i cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event
deltan cool you may be right doctor but what about reliant
shes on her way
carol reacts this is certainly true
get your gear together where its handy
where are we going
thats for us to know and reliant to find out
we have only three days
lets not waste time
they split off in different directions as ordered
in no particular hurry
kirk waits for the turbo lift which opens at last
as he gets in hold please
kirk holds and saavik dashes in
she is surprised to see him
continuing thank you sir
kirk nods the doors close
there is an uneasy forced intimacy between them
lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently
it is still regulation admiral
she reaches out and touches a button
the lift stops
continuing may i speak sir
lieutenant self expression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
youre bothered by your performance on the kobayashi maru i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution
it is a test of character
may i ask how you dealt with the test
amused you may ask lieutenant
continuing that was a little joke
that is a difficult concept it is not logical
we learn by doing lieutenant
shes a laugh a minute
kirk pushes the button the elevator starts
continuing you want my advice
she studies him considering
no doubt about it the attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle it
take the test again
the lift stops and the doors open
whos been holding up the damn elevator
he reacts to them
saavik exits demurely
thank you sir
bones enters and the doors close
kirk studies the ceiling
has she changed her hairstyle
kirk says nothing
finally wonderful stuff that romulan ale admiral kirk kirk here
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral
in my quarters uhura
it never rains but when it pours as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re opening old wounds
the elevator stops
the doors close
annoyed with himself sorry
featuring view screen a scramble of interference and noise
a piece of carols voice breaks through now and again as we pull back revealing a frustrated kirk
cant you augment
im trying sir
carols face appears
the image will never be stable for long sometimes the sound will be covered
can you read me
message breaking up carol
cant read you
taking genesis away from us
who is taking genesis
see you but cant hear
whos taking genesis
please help us jim
wont let them have
on whose authority
jim please but the picture is irrevocably scrambled now
kirk pounds the comm in frustration
transmission jammed at the source sir
alert starfleet headquarters
i want to talk with starfleet command
the activity is normal
the turbo lift opens and kirk strides in
bones and saavik react to the following stop engines
they look wonderingly
kirk takes a breath an emergency situation has arisen
by order of starfleet command as of now hours i am assuming command of this vessel
duty officer so note in the ships log
plot a new course for space laboratory regula i
pushes a button mr
well be going to warp speed aye sir overlapping course plotted for regula i admiral
engage warp engines comes out of being stunned prepare for warp speed
sulu go to warp
sulu does and with a great thrust of energy the ship accelerates and then with an eye filled burst whips ahead to warp speed disappearing
spock is at meditation as kirk enters quietly
spock looks up
weve got a problem
spock raises an eyebrow continuing something may be wrong at regula i
weve been ordered to investigate
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
i told starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but were the only ship in the quadrant
spock those cadets of yours how good are they
how will they respond under real pressure
like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts
the ship is yours
that wont be necessary just take me to regula i
excuse my presumption but i do not agree
as a teacher on a training mission i am content to command a starship
if we are to go on actual duty it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command
but it may be nothing garbled communications
why dont you
you proceed from a false assumption
i am a vulcan
i have no ego to bruise
kirk smiles in bemused wonderment
you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions
i was going to remind you of nothing least of all that which you know well
pause your mistake if i may be so bold was promotion
commanding a starship is your first best destiny
anything else is a waste of material
i would not presume to debate you
that is wise
in any case were i to invoke logic logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
or the one
spock inclines his head
you are my superior officer
you are also my friend
i have been and always shall be yours
kirk is moved
he starts to speak cant finally will you accompany me to the bridge
id best talk with mr
scott first so that he may in his own words explain the situation to his cadets
kirks face tells us the wisdom of spocks choice
floating quietly around the planet below
tranquil as we push slowly in
over we can hear filtered uhuras voice regula i this is enterprise
this is enterprise calling
do you receive
featuring spock and uhura as she keeps trying again this is enterprise calling space lab regula i
come in please
please respond please its no use no response from regula i
but no longer jammed
spock considers moves to kirk
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond
twelve hours and forty three minutes present speed
give up genesis she said
what in gods name does that mean
give it up to whom
it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was
kirk looks at him nods rising now
uhura ask dr
mccoy to join us in my quarters
saavik take the con
they start for the turbo lifts as saavik reacts ive got the sick bay ready
will someone please tell me what is going on
dims lights computer
request security procedure and access to project genesis summary
identify for retina scan
kirk admiral james t
starfleet general staff
the screen is suddenly busy with coded read outs and then computer graphics of retina patterns
then it glows green
security clearance class granted
continuing summary please
more coded read outs a red line security scan then over it approved in green
replaced by carol appears facing camera not used to it
to one side stands david and behind them the lab
carol marcus yes
carol marcus and i am the director of the project genesis team at regula i
what exactly is genesis
put simply genesis is a procedure whereby the molecular structure of any given matter can be restructured changed into anything else of identical mass
wait stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora tory
stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground stage three will involve the process on a plane tary scale
what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three
please watch closely
it is our intention to introduce what we call the genesis device or torpedo into the targeted area of a lifeless space body a moon or other inert form the
device is fired react with wonder
unleashing almost instantan eously what we call the genesis effect
particulate matter is reorganized and electrified with life introduced results
instead of a dead moon a living breathing planet capable of sus taining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it
the reformed object you see represents the merest fraction of the genesis potential should the federation wish to pursue these experiments to their logical conclusion
when we consider the problems of population and food supply the usefulness of this process begins to become clear
this concludes this demonstration tape
thank you for your attention
the genesis team eagerly awaits the decision of the federation regarding the next phase of our work
the tape becomes snowy and blinks off
kirk looks at bones and spock they are stunned
it literally is genesis
the power of creation have they proceeded with their experiments
the tape was made a year ago
i can only assume theyve reached phase two by now but dear lord are we intelligent enough to suppose this thing were used where life already exists
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix its new have you any idea what youre saying
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications doctor
as a matter of cosmic history it has always been easier to destroy than to create not anymore
now you can do both at the same time
according to myth the earth was created in six days
watch out here comes genesis well do it for you in six minutes i dont dispute that in the wrong hands would you like to tell me whose are the
right hands my cold blooded friend
are you in favor of these experiments
gentlemen this isnt really dr
mccoy you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn
logic suggests logic
were talking about universal armageddon you inhuman bloodless
intercom admiral sensors indicate a vessel in our area closing fast
what do you make of her
its one of ours admiral
whats she doing here
chekovs on reliant isnt he
the whoosh of the turbo doors and kirk bones and spock assume their posts
saavik stands next to kirks chair
shes not responding
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant
come in reliant
space a tiny dot in the distance growing larger
attempt visual communication
is it possible their comm system has failed
it would explain a great many things boring forward ominously
khan and his crew no sign of chekov and terrell
on khans screen the enterprise grows larger almost sing song with joy slow to one half impulse power
lets be friends
slowing to one half impulse
theyre requesting visual communications sir
let them eat static
theyre still running with shields down
were one big happy fleet
ah kirk my old friend do you know the klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold
pause it is very cold in space
reliant in our section this quadrant sir and slowing visual
visual of reliant appears
sir may i quote general order on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
watches the screen this is damned peculiar
beat yellow alert
energize defense fields
the lights on the bridge dim into the soft reddish glow of battle illumination
additional crew troop in to man vacant consoles
im getting a voice message
wait short range band
they say their chambers coil is shorting their comm system
he steps to his station
the two ships are very close barely moving as they inch toward each other
they still havent raised their shields
khan is half out of his seat sweating with anticipation
careful not all at once
the engine room lock on target and prepare to fire
locking phasers on target
computer graphics monitor cross hairs on enterprise
he reacts to his blue lit scope their coil emissions are normal
wait their shields are going up
theyre locking phasers
energize phasers stand by to but the entire bridge is rocked by a shock impact some of the crew sent flying
reliant firing phasers at enterprise
a hit in the rear of the engine room area debris flying into the void
an explosion rips through the facility sending yellow ish green gas hurtling down the long facility towards us
crewmen are hurled through the air screaming
roll closed sealing off the damaged tail section terrified scramble to get out amid the deadly yellow ish green smoke the cries
trying to rally them respirators
use your respirators
and he puts his own respirator on as do some of the veterans
preston dons his respirator and stays
the angle we saw during inspection
the trainees in panic amid the gas crawl over each other trying to get out
they scramble over each others shoulders in the efforts to escape screaming and shouting
the bridge is slowly righting
crew members getting back to their stations
on speaker we hear the cries and shouts of the engine room
medical alert engine room
bones dashes out
i cant get power sir
scottys voice is faint drowned by the screams and cries from a dozen intercom stations
continuing uhura turn off those damn channels
there is a dead silence
scott on discrete
scotty lets have it
behind the crew chief and a few others work feverishly in respirators
scotty in respirator with a throat mike which filters his voice
just hanging on sir
main energizers out
on screen computer graphics red flashing lights indi cate damaged areas
spock steps up to kirk evaluating the display
they knew just where to hit us
who knew just where to hit us
and why shakes head one thing is certain we cannot escape on auxiliary power
sees visual mr
sulu divert everything to the phasers re screen too late on visual screen photon torpedoes approach
the bridge is shaken badly screens go dark fires spark and erupt
alarms and sound full
crew personnel try to put out electrical fires help the fallen circling enterprise
the glow of the o
screens and battle illumination highlighting the passion in his eyes
the firefighting continues
scotty whats left
just the batteries sir
i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes we dont have minutes
can you give me phaser power
a few shots sir
not enough against their shields
who the hell are they
commander reliant is signaling
a pause he wishes to discuss terms of our surrender
there is a moment
kirk looks around the battered bridge and his eyes meet spocks and saaviks
hesitating admiral do it while we have time
all eyes go to the screen
after momentary visual confusion khans face appears smiling continuing dumbfounded khan
you still remember admiral
i cannot help but be touched
of course i remember you
what is the meaning of this attack
where is the crew of the reliant
surely i have made my meaning plain
i mean to avenge myself upon you admiral
ive deprived your ship of power and when i swing round i mean to deprive you of your life we can see reliant making a large arc as she prepares
to come back for another round
on screen but i wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you i khan noonian singh the eagle you attempted to cage forever
khan listen to me if its me you want ill have myself beamed aboard
all i ask is that you spare my crew
that is a most intriguing offer
typical i must say of your sterling character
let me think
reliant continues her slow arc
on screen i make you a counter proposal i will agree to your terms if in addition to yourself you turn over to me all data and material regarding the
project called genesis
reactions from spock and kirk
genesis whats that
dont play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control give me some time to recall the data on our computers i give you sixty seconds admiral
kirk turns from the screen admiral you cant give him genesis
at least we know he hasnt got it
just keep nodding as though im giving orders
saavik punch up the data charts of reliants command console hurry
the prefix code
its all weve got
to khan were finding it
urging please please youve got to give us time the bridge is smashed computers inoperative
time is a luxury you do not have admiral forty five seconds
reliant her arc completed is coming back
i dont understand kirk puts on his spectacles youve got to learn why things work on a starship
to khan its coming through now khan
descends the prefix code is
all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically each ship has its own prefix combination code
to prevent an enemy from doing just what were attempting using our console to tap in a message an order to lower reliants damn shields
at the weapons console lets hope he hasnt changed the combination
hes quite intelligent
grim wait for my signal spock too soon and hell have time to figure it out and raise them again
spock nods kirk turns to the screen continuing khan how do i know youll keep your word
on screen ive given you no word to keep admiral
in my judgment you simply have no alternative
i take your point
stand by to receive our transmission
he turns from the screen again softly continuing mr
sulu lock phasers on target and await my command
quietly phasers locked
theyre all sweating
times up admiral
dry here it comes
followed by other signals
stares at his console sir our shields are dropping
raise them joachim punches frantically they wont wheres the over ride all monitors are haywire now that enterprise is tapped in
they search wildly for the right switch but
enterprise fires at reliant inflicting heavy damage
a shambles debris flying khan knocked to the deck
he struggles to his feet through wiring enraged at them
why cant you
we cant fire sir theyve damaged the photon controls and the warp drive
we must withdraw
sir we must
desperate urging we must repair the damage
enterprise will wait shes not going anywhere
khan calms as the other holds him he breathes deeper
reliant turns away
they watch on screen as reliant hauls off
breathless sir you did it
enraged i did nothing except get caught with my britches down
i must be senile
saavik you just keep right on quoting regulations
meantime lets find out what the hell is going on and see how bad weve been the turbo doors whoosh open as kirk reaches them
scotty stands there tears streaming down his face he holds the body of midshipman preston
both of them are covered in blood
he sways into kirks arms as the others rush forward
the enterprise motionless scars of battle showing
the crew wearing respirators amid the motionless ball of gas work frantically at a dozen jobs trying to put things aright splicing wires etc
some trainees who panicked are back
making a final adjustment
hit your blowers
a turbo whines and a great wind of suction pulls the gas towards appropriate vents
the crew chief watches then yanks off his respirator wipes his brow
many casualties in evidence
kirk enters and leads camera through them he has a word or two for men he doesnt know by name
kirk leads us to the operating theatre where bones works over preston
scotty stands by his lips trembling
preston opens his eyes sees scotty and kirk
faint is the word given
soft the word is given warp speed
almost smiles aye
scotty looks across the body at kirk
looks at preston he wants to kill me for passing sentence on him years ago and he doesnt care who stands between him and his vengeance
scotty im sorry
he stayed at his post
when the trainees ran he stayed
if he hadnt wed be space by now
admiral this is spock
kirk hits a wall intercom yes spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored
we can proceed at impulse power
thinks best speed to regula i
scotty ive got to ask any chance of getting the mains back on the line
i dinna think so sir but youll have my best with an effort he gets to his feet continuing thanks i know you tried doctor
squeezes his shoulder and limps off we now hear the sound of impulse power taking effect
are you all right
bones shrugs unhappily looks at preston
doctors lose patients sometimes
im still in the dark howd he know about genesis
at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it
you said it yourself were talking about a bang that would re arrange the universe
there may still be time
you gave as good as you got
looks him in the eye i got beat
were only alive because i knew something about these ships that he didnt
he turns and leaves as bones watches looks again at preston
regula the dead planet beyond
as she moves slowly past camera we pan with her to see that she is approaching the space lab
battle damage some repaired some not
the bridge is filled with tension all hands at station
approaching regula and space lab regula i
space station regular i this is starship enterprise
come in please
as before uhuras image imploring a response
i say again
space station regular
this is starship enterprise
during this camera has panned close among the techni cal clutter
sound eerie frightening
our ears cannot place it
and before we can it is gone a warning
no response sir
scanners and sensors still inoperative
theres no way to tell whats inside the station
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
with irony blind as a tiberian bat
what do you make of the plantoid beyond
regula is class d
it consists of various remarkable ores
essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
scotty do we have enough power for the transporters
just barely sir
the decision im going down to the station
he starts out
bones stops him
khan could be down there
hes been there and hasnt found what he wants
can you spare someone
there may be people hurt
i can spare me
begging the admirals pardon general order no flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort
there is no such regulation
saaviks gaze falters continuing all right join the party
spock the ship is yours
aye sir establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when youve talked with mr
be careful jim
kirk bones and saavik head for the turbo doors
closer angle now
the silence is ominous
empty except for the hums and crackles of abandoned equipment
with a familiar sound bones kirk and saavik materialize
all have phasers communicators and tricorders
for a moment they look around seeing emptiness
like being in a haunted house
a weird echo reverberates his cries
raises tricorder indeterminate life signs
phasers on stun
each begins to search
she moves to the electronic and data area examines the consoles the equipment then settles for the data bank
she starts keying sequences with the computer
he shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted place like a scuba diver exploring a cave
we want him to go back
bones reacts with brave apprehension
rounding a corner he starts a rat scuttles right in front of him
bones sighs with relief and moves forward
we think hes safe
suddenly something falls right on his face an upside down human arm
kirk helps bones cut down the last of the five bodies from where they were hanged upside down
having recovered his composure bones examines the corpses
we recognize madison march among others
one is clearly the cook
stunned they even killed the galley chief
this one looks like a steward
theyre not warm but rigor hasnt set in
this didnt happen all that long ago jim
kirk looks around despairingly carol
with saavik working with console
something puzzles her
she frowns but a new sound distracts her
she looks up and moves off
a moan is heard
all three now converge on the area
as they near it saaviks tricorder hums furiously
be this a room a locker of some other place this time they open the door
the limp bodies of chekov and terrell fall out
on screen admiral kirk enterprise
come in please
come in please
she will continue sporadically
chekov emits a live reassuring moan
thats clark terrell jim ive served with him
bones is passing his medical tricorder over chekov
continuing brain disturbance
appears to be drug induced
he reaches into his kit
he shoots chekov moves off to terrell
uhura voice continues in the b
saavik for gods sake tell her were all right
i say again
this is enterprise
please acknowledge signal
please saaviks face appears on her screen
on screen hurried commander uhura this is lt
were all right
please stand by
baffled aye aye
chekov opens his eyes and stares into kirks
oh god admiral
he weeps like a child and kirk holds him
meanwhile terrell opens his eyes and stares at bones
do you remember me
chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety
it was khan
we found him on ceti alpha v
tell me what you can
no life signs but he was there
he he put creatures in our bodies
to control our minds
bones takes over chekov its all right youre safe
made us say lies
but we beat him
the captain and me
he thought he controlled us but he didnt
the captain was strong
chekov breaks into tears
kirk looks at terrell who is more composed
where is dr
where are the genesis materials
he couldnt find them
some of the scientists were still here but everything else even the data banks were empty
thats true admiral
all the memory cells have been emptied
he tortured those people
none of them would tell him anything
he went wild strung them up and slit their throats
he wanted to tear the place apart but he was late he had to get back to reliant in time to blow you to bits
he came damn close
he left us
with irony we were no longer of use
where is the reliant crew
marooned on ceti alpha v
hes completely mad admiral
he blames you for the death of his wife
i know what he blames me for
thinks the escape pods are all in place
looks around wheres the transporter room
kirk wearing his spectacles studies the transporter consoles
angle widens to reveal the transporter pods and the others b
did he make it down here
chekov and terrell look at each other they seem a bit stronger
it was not my impression
he spent most of his time trying to wring the information out of the people
saavik approaches kirk anything
kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses somebody left the unit on
if everyone else was dead it implies that no one remained to turn it off
those people back there bought escape time for genesis with their lives
saavik studies the console
it doesnt make sense
these coordinates are well within regula a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless
wheels turn if stage two was completed it was underground she said it was going to be underground
stage two of what
kirk gets it
on communicator kirk to enterprise
damage report spock
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
beat i read you captain
lets have it
the situation is grave admiral
we wont have main power for six days at least
auxiliary power has temporarily failed but maybe we can restore that in two days by the book admiral
meaning you cant even beam us back
not at present
kirk looks at saavik and bones decides captain spock if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can take the
enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range
sir we wont leave you behind
uhura if you dont hear from us there wont be anybody behind
to terrell and chekov you gentleman can remain here or
if its all the same admiral wed like to share the risk
hesitates very well
where are we going
points to console where they went
kirk walks onto the pods as saavik works the console rolling in electronic coding
the others join kirk
but what if they went nowhere
then this will be your big chance to get away from it all
she presses a button joins them on the pods
slowly they vanish
camera moves toward it as the beam sound continues with irregularity
the plantoid is ugly and dead
the sound frightens us and climaxes with the beam sound screeches then settles into its comfort able mode as the five figures fluctuate fade then appear
they look around in wonder and relief
admiral she indicates something o
they cross as camera reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a large projectile a giant version of the model we saw earlier
feature genesis i presume
they walk by a group of crates
it all happens very fast david leaps out and tackles kirk throwing him to the ground and landing atop him a knife at his throat
at the same time bones and saavik reach for their phasers but jedda already armed steps out
he has them covered and helpless
youre the sonavabitch who committed mass murder up there
he raises the knife im admiral kirk
we were still there you dumb bastard
we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room again he raises the knife wheres dr
marcus im doctor marcus
carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave david mother go back
carol sees kirk jim go back
im going to kill him
takes a breath you do that and youll have murdered your father
david and kirk facing each other are turned to stone
bones jedda and chekov turn to look at carol wondering
terrell very casually takes the phaser from jedda
cool ill hold onto this
but kirk and carol ignore them and walk towards each other
there are tears in carols eyes
she reaches up trying to smile and touches his hair youve got a little grey she cant
kirk takes her and holds her tightly look ing at david over her shoulder
he stands there stunned looking back
is that true
she nods continuing why didnt you tell me
shes making it up
my father was professor david youre just making this harder im afraid its even harder than you think doctor
he and chekov have their phasers trained on them
continuing please dont move chekov
im sorry admiral
terrell speaks into his wrist recorder
your excellency have you been listening
filtered i have indeed captain
you have done well
i knew it
david makes a reckless break for terrell saavik instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as terrell fires hitting jedda who was behind david a killing ray
carol screams and david reacts with horror and guilt
most importantly chekov begins to tremble
terrell himself is shaken by his reflexive action
hes in semi panic
dont move any of you
thru thru reliant motionless in a parking orbit
joachim over his shoulder
others in evidence
khan speaks into his console
whats the delay
all is well sir
you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
first things first captain
kill admiral kirk
reactions by all only kirk and bones are unsurprised
david and saavik dazed fight the urge to do something
chekov is close to a seizure
terrell fights conflicting mental signals
it is difficult
i try to obey but kill him as though tearing off a leach terrell grabs at the wrist recorder and flings it to the ground
a shock wave of pain hits terrell
he recovers trembling and tries to obey
chekov is shaking badly
terrell aims his phaser at kirk
chekov slowly raises his phaser and aims at terrell though his hands are like lead
we think chekov is going to do the right thing
then shockingly terrell turns his phaser on himself
still emanates from wrist recorder kill him terrell
terrell does blowing himself into oblivion
he screams horribly drops his phaser clutching his head
bones leaps to his side pulls an injection device from his belt pack jabs it into chekovs arm
chekov almost with a sigh of relief drops
jim for gods sake
they rush to his side as do carol and david
from the fallen mans ear something begins to emerge
the ceti eel crawls out
it has grown quite large
horror from all
kirk picks up a phaser
as the eel clears chekov he fires and destroys it
he shudders then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it
khan you bloodsucker theyre finished
youll have to do your own dirty work now
do you hear me
do you khan reacts to kirks voice electronic shock
he clutches the communicator his eye whites rolling
kirk you are still alive my old friend
still old friend
youve managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target
ironic perhaps i no longer need to try
he punches several buttons
in the rocky cavern the transporter beam locks on to the genesis torpedo and its arming control box
as kirk and the others watch horrified khan beams up the materials
david tries to reach the torpedo but saavik holds him fast let go he cant
only half of you would get there
the beam disappears and genesis with it leaving them alone
desperate khan you have genesis but you dont have me
you were going to kill me khan it was your sole purpose
youll have to come down here to do it
youll have to come down
ive done far worse than kill you admiral
ive hurt you
and i wish to go on hurting you
i shall leave you as you left me where no one will ever find you poetic justice marooned for eternity in the center of a dead planet buried alive
oh and dont count on enterprise
she cant move
my next act will be to blow her out of the heavens
khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction
joachim enters and khan looks at him
warp drive still inoperative
all other systems should be restored shortly
khan sighs contentedly
we have all the time in the world
as before saavik is on the communicator
this is lt
saavik calling enterprise
she keeps trying
chekov stirs hes alive
bones goes and tends chekov who moans tries to sit up
chekov tries to smile kirk takes his hand no use admiral theyre still jamming all channels
looks across chekov it wouldnt make any difference
if enterprise obeyed orders shes long since gone
and if she couldnt obey shes finished
so are we it looks like
i dont understand
whos responsible for all this
who is khan
its a long story
we appear to have plenty of time
dry you and your father can catch up on things
bitter my father
i hope you realize another man has just been killed because of
because of you son
you shouldnt have tried to rush someone holding a primed phaser
anyway it isnt one man dead its two in case youve lost count
david has been effectively spiked
do you have anything to eat
i dont know about anyone else but im starved
how can you think of food at a time like this
our first order of business is survival
theres food in the genesis cave enough to last a lifetime should that be necessary
we thought this was genesis
carol laughs theres an edge of hysteria to it
it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this
what we did in there we did in a day
david why dont you show dr
mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food
but we cant just sit here
unruffled oh yes we can
is there really something to eat
david looks at his father who checks his watch putting on his spectacles
to kirk this is just to give us something to do isnt it
he shrugs come on
saavik and bones make to follow
saavik turns to kirk admiral
as your teacher mr
spock is fond of saying i like to think there always are possibilities
thru thru dark side of gamma
reliant sits idle
carol sits on the ground chekovs head in her lap looking at kirk
david was right wasnt he
its just to keep them busy
why didnt you tell me
how can you ask me that
were we together
where we going to be
you had your world and i had mine
i wanted him in mine not chasing through the universe with his father
kirk turns away overcome
she watches him
continuing hes a lot like you in many ways
nothing i could do about it
hes smarter of course that goes without saying
most of genesis is really his
her joke doesnt take effect
he doesnt turn
continuing this is it isnt it
were never going to get out of here
kirk says nothing
tell me what youre feeling
kirk hesitates comes back and sits next to chekov he changes bones compress on the ear as he finally speaks
theres a man i havent seen in fifteen years who thinks hes killed me
you show me a son whod almost be happy to help him
my life that could have been and wasnt
what am i feeling
im feeling old worn out
carol studies him gently she sets chekovs head down on a sweater then stands
let me show you something that will make you feel young young as when the world was new
she offers her hand
kirk looks at chekov who smiles faint assurance
continuing hell be all right
after a moments hesitation kirk takes her hand and she leads him to the tunnel
trucking before carol and kirk
a rising light falls on their faces as they walk then run with excitement toward the source
kirk races ahead
toward an iridescent light at its end blindingly beautiful with color
intercut these two angles until we can hardly wait for kirk to reach the end of the tunnel and then when it does where the rock tunnel ends
kirk comes out of the tunnel and his mouth drops open
a huge cavern
kirk is actually standing at the middle of it
space extends vastly above and below his point of view
like eden lush growth everywhere water falls and a cobalt blue sky high high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward
there is a path from where kirk stands down to the lower level where bones and the others are waiting and calling to him
mist and haze waft gently across the cavern
as carol comes up beside him
you did this in a day
the matrix formed in a day
the life forms grew later at a wildly accelerated rate
can i cook or cant i
the turbo doors open and joachim stands there
impulse power restored
more than a match for poor enterprise
he punches at his console
thru thru reliant ominously pokes her nose into the lit side of the planet heading for enterprise
departing dark side regula
visual the regula i space station but where is enterprise
frowning with puzzlement
where is she
not a trace
kirk and the others eat fruit from the huge matte forest beyond
chekov has been moved to join them
who watches him
what are you looking at
the admirals son
dont you believe it
oh i believe it
she almost smiles
david returns her stare and it throws her
continuing what are you looking at
confused i dont know
saavik rises paces
kirk puts down his food
now thats what i call a meal
its like the garden of eden
only here every apple comes from the tree of knowledge
kirk watches saavik
whats on your mind lieutenant
the kobayashi maru sir
the no win scenario and with what philosophy a commander faces defeat
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now lieutenant
on the test sir will you tell me what you did
id really like to know
kirk looks at bones who smiles lieutenant you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no win scenario and almost got tossed out of the academy
he looks at his watch again using his glasses how
i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship
i changed the conditions of the test
i received a commendation for original thinking
pause i dont like to lose
then you never faced that situation faced death
we each face death every day were alive saavik
he picks up the communicator
continuing spock this is kirk
its two hours
are you about ready
right on schedule admiral
just give us your coordinates and well beam you aboard
the others are on their feet stunned with amazement right
i dont like to lose
he clicks off
david gapes at his father
we can see now where enterprise is she has slipped behind the plantoid clockwise even as reliant was rounding into the lighted side
kirk david saavik carol and bones holding the semi conscious chekov materialize
spock is there to greet them
but the damage report we were immobilized
come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book
you remember dr
they are moving through the room as they talk certainly
overlapping by the book
regulation a if transmissions are being monitored during battle
no uncoded messages on an open channel
saavik steps in front of spock
continuing you lied
hours instead of days saavik now we have minutes instead of hours behind im taking this bunch to sick bay
camera stays with them holds on david awed
saavik and kirk follow spock
they stop at a turbo lift theyre inoperative below c deck
they race down corridors as they speak what is working around here
not much admiral
we have partial main power
best we could do in two hours
full crew in place as doors whoosh open overjoyed admiral on the bridge battle stations
alarms sirens etc
crew rush into place as kirk spock and saavik approach the big screen
we see the enterprise emerging from the dark side of gamma regula where reliant is now a moving blip
continuing uh oh
she can out run us and out gun us
but there is the mutara nebula at mark four
studies his console scotty can we make it inside
the energizers bypassed like a christmas tree so dont give me too many bumps
no promises mr
on your way
trouble with the nebula sir is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display
visuals wont function and shields will be useless
kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at spock they smile with faint amusement
whats sauce for the goose mr
the odds will be even
as the lights change the crew runs to their stations
carol david and bones react to the light change and the sirens bones works on chekov
im going up there
youll be in the way dr
best stay here
carol and david are civilians on a battleship
saavik approaches kirk and spock
what happens if reliant fails to follow us into the nebula
kirk and spock exchange looks i think we can guarantee shell follow us mr
remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego
best speed scotty
the enterprise whooshes by camera leaving regula behind
reliant now appears in far b
and camera begins a move to her
full impulse power
not so wounded as we were led to believe so much the better
reliant moves to and past camera in hot pursuit
call them space bys
enterprise rushes toward us flashes by and continues towards the swirling nebula
then reliant does the same closer in pursuit
at this moment half the distance between regula and the nebula has been covered
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes
reliant is closing
steady as you go
reliant can clearly see where enterprise is headed well lose them if they go in there
reliants shot crosses enterprises bow the ship reverberates with the near miss
chekov wakes up looks wildly about take it easy but i must listen to me pavel you havent the strength or the equilibrium but as they talk david unnoticed leaves
the enterprise is buffeted again dr
mccoy i cant just sit here
tell me what i can do
grim you can help get my surgery squared away
im expecting customers
she whitens in fear
another shot reverberates
that was close unfazed they just dont want us going in there
one minute to nebula perimeter
the bridge door slides open and david enters
he stares in wonder
saavik reacts to david
continuing admiral theyre reducing speed
uhura patch me in aye sir
why are we slowing
we darent follow them into the nebula sir our shields will be useless
this is admiral kirk
khans eyes bulge continuing we tried it once your way khan
are you game for a rematch
khans eyes bulge continuing khan
im laughing at the superior intellect
full impulse power
we have genesis whatever you want full power damn you and he reaches across and executes it himself
they react to reliants speed up
the nebula approach is on screen
dry ill say this for him hes consistent
were very close now and see clearly the swirling slowly moving gases magenta purple etc
there are veils of luminescent materials and through all an interlace of unpredictable electrical charges
like lightning these intermittent great flashes illumine whole sections of the nebula
our view is moving slowly forward
timing and were
as enterprise whooshes into the picture headed into the purplish gas and disappears into a cloud bank of the stuff
a moment then reliant appears pursues enterprise into the gloom also disappears
on screen the picture is squirrelly purple breaking up
raise the shields
electrical forces raging without are also reflected on the circuits within
its bumpy on top of everything else
as i feared sir
im reducing speed
khan does not argue
cautiously reliant emerges from a massive cloudbank
electrical discharges abound
barely moving she feels her way forward
a treat enterprise is above and behind reliant
reliants image is breaking up
phaser lock inoperative sir
best guess mr
fire when ready
sulu strains then fires just as an electrical dis turbance bounces the bridge the bounce causes sulus phaser shot to go wide of reliant amid crackling discharges rolls from the
near miss concussion aft torpedoes fire
reliant is wide of the mark with a photon torpedo
a blinding electrical discharge
when it clears enterprise appears to be alone
on screen nothing but magenta amid picture breakup sweating hold your course
enterprise feeling its way
all peer into the lousy picture
occasional electrical flashes
still enterprise moves forward
a large flash
a sudden glimpse reliant boring in on collision course
a sudden clearing on screen reliant evasive starboard
hard over but not fast enough
reliant fires a phaser
reliants phaser shot hits the enterprise torpedo room in dorsal fin area of ship
an explosion rocks the room and
the bridge rattles from the explosion below sulu is thrown from his chair
saavik leaps to her post phaser bank one fire
the enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot which rips along the side of reliants primary hull
the bridge is damaged joachim and others are wounded
for the first time his friend wounded khan hesitates holds him yours
i shall avenge you she veers to one side with the impact and disappears into a deep purple mass
sulu is being helped by david damage scotty
bones is there helping some crewmen
the reactor room flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue light
the air is heavy with smoke but the doors damaged earlier still hold
admiral ive got to take the mains off the line
the energizers shaken loose and i cant get in there to fix her radiation all right well do the job with auxiliary power
the bridge door opens and closes chekov faint stands there
could you use another hand admiral
man the weapons console mr
angle favoring david as the others react to chekov taking his place
spock is bent over the scanner sporadic energy readings port side aft
could be an impulse turn
he wont break off now
if he followed me this far hell be back
but from where
hes intelligent but not experienced
his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking
kirk looks at him smiles
saavik all stop
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters
stand by photon torpedoes
reliant in purplish mass banking slightly completing a long turn then boring ahead
as reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear almost tranquil place
reliant moving slowly stops as if looking around
the screens are empty
where is he
where in gods name is he
reliant motionless in the f
amid occasional flashes
now behind reliant and from below like a great whale rising from the depths enterprise rises vertically slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy
when enterprise is above behind and quite close reliant on screen intermittent but clear
torpedoes ready sir
fires torpedo one which hits destroying reliants weapons pod on top
c explosions rock the interior of reliant
fires two more times
the first causes general damage
the second close behind blasts reliants port engine off into space debris scattering
khan is blown from his chair and were uncertain of his fate
reliant now a scarred battered hulk her main hull still intact but dead in space
no cheers just deadly professionalism
power levels quite low sir
to intercom mr
scott can you get the mains back on line
breaking up slightly ill need ten minutes sir til the radiation dissipates
uhura send to commander reliant prepare to be boarded
amid the smoke and ruins we see no signs of life
commander reliant this is enterprise
surrender and prepare to be boarded
chillingly khan rises into shot by the main console
he is horribly burned and it is clear that he is clinging to life by his will
the games not over
as uhuras voice continues o
khan pulls himself into a chair at the console one of his hands useless at his side
continuing to the last i will grapple with thee
painfully with one good arm he starts arming the genesis console
there sits the genesis torpedo lights start blinking in response
as we watch the child we met on ceti alpha walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights
enterprise to reliant you are ordered to surrender your vessel
to kirk nothing sir
well beam aboard
alert transporter room admiral
scanning an energy source on reliant
a pattern ive never seen
david peers closer over spocks shoulder reacts
its the genesis wave
hes on a build up to detonation
how soon we encoded four minutes well beam aboard and stop it you cant
the briefest stunned moment
kirk hits intercom scotty i need warp speed in three minutes or were all dead
spock leaps from his place and disappears through the bridge doors
continuing saavik get us out best speed
enterprise backs away from reliant
her speed is pain fully slow
on screen enterprise intermittent image backs away
khan smiles triumphantly through his pain
an elec tronic power sound has been building
you cant get away
from hells heart i stab at thee
amid the pain for hates sake
i spit my last breath at thee
khan topples forward dead
the whine continues to build chillingly
spock rushes in
bones ministers to scotty b
spock sizes up the situation starts for the radiation room bones intercepts him
are you out of your vulcan mind
no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there
but as you are so fond of observing doctor im not human
youre not going in there
im afraid i cant stop to discuss this logically he gives bones the vulcan nerve pinch
bones goes down
spock presses the access button and enters the reactor room a separated area behind radiation proof glass and metal red flashing lights and an iridescent blue glow within
in horror spock get out of there
bathed in blue light arcing energy around him spock is a silhouetted figure as he goes to work door clos ing behind him
the whine increasing the dead ship reliant alive with danger
a snails pace compared to the escape speed needed
time from my mark
two minutes ten seconds
intercom engine room
outside the glass scotty and bones screaming captain please
get out man
oh dear god
we can see the silent urging of bones and scotty
spock is oblivious
amid the fire blue arcs he moves to the control panel
between his hands and the con trols power arcs insanely
spock is in an inferno a radiation hell fighting now with all his strength to control it
slowly the damping rods move out
spock moves to a manual control begins to turn it
on the manual control slowly turning black
his face using all the self discipline he is capable of to control the pain continuing to work bones and scotty react in helpless horror
enterprise still well within the nebula reliant a figure still visible in b
shes crawling still
reliant now symbol of death on screen
three minutes thirty seconds
distance from reliant
four hundred kilometers
kirk looks at david but david shakes his head no way
the mains are back on line
bless you scotty
she increases power and a with a burst of warp speed enterprise accelerates out of the lazy pace and whooshes put of scene leaving reliant behind
disappearing in the swirls of which clears the flame and roaring through space and the whine increases to fever pitch then she goes
as reliant goes so goes the nebula
the genesis effect we saw in its earliest experiments now seems familiar on a gigantic cosmic scale
the blinding flash at first followed by the same tumbling turbulence of the miniature test
it is awesome
the bridge doors open and carol appears
instinctively she draws near her son
finally kirk turns sees carol reduce speed
my god carl
look at it
on screen and intercut genesis tumbles and starts evolving
a moment in history
continuing on intercom engine room
after a beat jim youd better get down here
the tone frightens kirk
saavik take the con
he moves through the doors quickly leaving the rest staring at the new world evolving
it is endless
kirk runs forever feet pounding down down down the clouds tumble and move new things lie beyond kirk races kirk emerges to encounter scotty and bones
their looks tell him
he sees the flashing light over the reactor room
he dashes for the control panel
bones grabs him
youll flood the whole compartment
also holds him hes dead already jim
kirks eyes bulge
with stunned understanding kirk stumbles to the door sees spock on his knees hands blackened face cracked with radiation lines and scars
spock shakes his head
with a feeble hand he reaches the intercom button filtered communication
the ship out of danger
yes spock is satisfied he fights for breath dont grieve admiral its logical the good of the many outweighs he almost keels over
kirk has tears streaming down his face
the good of the few
or the one
he props a hand on the glass to support himself
kirks hand reflexively goes to match spocks on the other side of the glass continuing i never took the kobayashi maru test until now
what do you think of my solution
i have been and always will be your friend
bones and scotty react
intercom admiral youve got to see this
theres new life a whole new world a genesis world
but kirk is past hearing or caring
he is huddled up against the glass destroyed
bones looks on helpless
a spectacular look at carols planet being born
the ships company in full dress uniforms assembled for ships burial service
over the pullback we hear in accordance with the traditions of starfleet and of article starfleet regulations we are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead
carol and david are prominently featured
david watching kirk attentively
so are sulu uhura chekov and saavik
bones stands next to kirk
scotty carries his bagpipes
saavik wears her hair down
continuing and yet in the midst of our sorrow it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life the sunrise of a new world
a world that our beloved comrade gave his own life to protect and nourish
he did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one and we will not debate his profound wisdom in these proceedings
of my friend i can only say this that of all the souls i have encountered in my travels his was the most he falters human
he tries to go on but catches bones face bones is streaming tears
kirk cant go on
continuing lieutenant saavik
saavik steps forward
we commend the soul of our brother departed
we love we commit his body to the depths of space
all starfleet personnel salute
scotty begins to pipe an odd blare which mellows into amazing grace kirk nods a signal
a gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers into the launching chamber which locks behind it
at a hand signal from a torpedoman the projectile is fired
spocks remains seen on their way to the new world
the capsule grows too small to see
the bagpipes stop
the salute drop
she steps to him and they exchange salutes continuing very quietly after you dismiss the company you will take the watch
set course for ceti alpha v and well pick up survivors
ill be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
aloud dismiss the company
she about faces as kirk walks towards the turbo lift
saavik issues dismissal and posting orders but we truck with kirk until camera stops and he leaves frame and we hold on david
he finally understands
after a long moment the camera discovers kirk
he pours a drink then decides not to have it
he sits wearily not knowing how to shake the ghosts
then he sees the book
kirk picks up the battered volume the gift from his friend and closes his eyes a moment
almost idly he starts turning pages looking for a clue
but he cant see the writing he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half glasses one of the lenses is broken
it has a deep impact on kirk
he puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes
a soft bong
kirk clears his throat
the door whooshes open and closes to admit david
the last person kirk expected to see
i dont mean to intrude
rises i should be on the bridge
are you running away from me
davids strength is turning a corner with kirk i suppose i was
pause i poured a drink
would you like it
i i guess im not what you expected
rueful i didnt expect anything
that makes two of us
he studies his father lieutenant saavik was right you never have faced death hoarse not like this no
i havent faced death i cheated death
i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity
i know nothing
you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life it was just words
but good words
thats where ideas begin
maybe you should listen to them
im trying david
so am i
my friends were killed too
i am truly sorry
they study each other
i was wrong about you
and im sorry
is that what you came here to say
he starts out then turns and also that im proud very proud to be your son
a stunned moment then kirk lets it all hang out for david for carol and for spock
he hugs his son hold ing onto him as if to life itself
the enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty
the door whooshes
kirk strides on the bridge david with him
carol is there with bones they are glad at what they see
admiral on the bridge
as you were mr
on course to ceti alpha
all is well
good i believe you already know my uh son saavik comes close to blushing continuing yes well why dont you show him around and
aye sir she takes him off deadpan amusement continuing so you turn out to be the dumb bastard
they stare at her
continuing that is a little joke
kirk has a smile
he joins bones and carol facing the screen
shes changed her hair again
pause will you look at that
think theyll name it for you doctor
not if i can help it
well name it for our friend
quietly it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before
a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known
soft is that a poem
something spock was trying to tell me
on my birthday
he shakes his head remembering you okay jim
how do you feel
considers smiles young
i feel young doctor
he turns to saavik and david continuing lieutenant new course second star to the right and straight on till morning
the bridge crackles with lights and chatter as we
space the final frontier
these are the continuing voyages of the starship enterprise
her ongoing mission to explore strange new worlds
to seek out new life and new civilizations
to boldly go where no man has gone before
she is moving out now passing camera and heading toward the distant stars
she is beautiful and they are beautiful
