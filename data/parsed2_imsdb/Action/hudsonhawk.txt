hudson hawk by steven e
de souza revised by daniel waters screenplay by steven e
de souza revisions by dan waters based on an original idea by bruce willis robert kraft a silver pictures flying heart films june production beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle a
small renaissance fair with florid awnings demented acrobats and roaring puppets is unfolding
rustic farmers and their families rumble with enjoyment at the sabbath afternoon entertainment
encircled by children a juggler with an unforgettably etched face elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule
as he begins to juggle a loud explosion is heard causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap
everyone at the fair including the puppets looks up
leonardo che pazzo
the juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle
where the charismatic leonardo da vinci laughs down at him
da vinci wears a pair of very early very cool sun glasses with his trademark beard
he turns and loses his smile something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses
removing his shades da vinci moves to the something a gloriously incredible machine
the opening credits reveal its dazzling idio syncrasies
two coughing apprentices haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing mysteriously spectacular machine
mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a renaissance laser show
silencing authority basta vapore
the apprentice throws a lever
a shunt near the furnace turns
steam escapes upwards
the machine immediately slows down
da vinci oh so gently coughs and moves for ward with tongs
comes to a trembling mystical halt
right behind this trough is a conplex polyhedron crystal as intricately modulated as any rubik stocking stuffer but much more dazzling in beauty
it gleams like a jewel in the yellow glow which pours from a pleasantly grinning demonhead into a trough a glow of heat and something more than heat
the tongs enter the frame
da vinci brings the object closer to his face
a murmur goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the master peers at the smoking yellow bar
maestro che meraviglia
lei e proprio fantastico
da vincis pride goes dead as the implications hit
the apprentices scurry out
mind reeling da vinci turns his back to the viewer before a wall of frescoes
spinning back around using the edge of his cloak da vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop
with an accompanying blast of smoke da vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the
his workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio on a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue a large volume of sketches the inkwell
nearby a model of what looks like a helicopter da vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies
pocketing the crystal da vinci meanders through his work shop casually tinkering with various experiments
he snaps his fingers at a bathing suited apprentice wearing a diving helmet prototype
the apprentice jumps into a pool of water
leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished except for the mouth portrait of mona lisa who happens to be seated in a stool before the easel
she broadly smiles revealing the worst dental work of her epoch
da vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a a flying apprentice sails past leonardo in a bat winged glider enthusiastically shouting
da vinci grins back until he touches his pocket
he pulls out the crystal and after a beat angrily twists it apart into two separate geometric pieces revealing a small intricate mirror
he quickly folds the surprisingly shapable geometric pieces
calming down da vinci looks from the three components of the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the table in his workshop
he ponders then looks back out to the vinci vista
the bat winged glider dissolves into who is revealed to be flying over sing sing prison
the shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window over the face of eddie hudson hawkins causing him to break out of an eye closed trance
before the viewer can get a good look at him hudson hawk turns to an oddball version of the mona lisa that has his face and tears it off the
cell back wall
two prison guards one wise and black the other young and green march down a cell block
the former is smoking a pipe which the young guard lights with a lighter
were losing our biggest celebrity today
youre kidding petey the paint thinner killer is getting paroled
not that slime you fizzhead
the last of the great cat burglars
a hand tears down a picture of a happy hudson hawk and a little monkey identically dressed in black cat burglar gear
the wise guard and the young guard rumble forward
as a thief hawk was a poem
iambic fucking pentameter
you know crime used to have a little class
a hundred reporters were here when he came in now theyre probably out covering some tired crack gang war
the guards approach hawks cell
hawk with his back turned hefts on a nifty blazer
remind me to fire my publicist
the wise guard chuckles as the young guard fumbles with his key ring
darn these are for l block
hawks hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe cleaner from the wise guards pocket
then the lighter from the young guards pocket burns off the fabric fuzz with the lighter beside it bends the now blackened wire and with a quick turn of the
wrist uses it to unlock the door
go back down to security and he stops dumbfounded as the door clunks open
the guards double take as hawk finally in full view struts past them down the hall
the guards hustle to catch up
the wise guard puts his finger in the air and sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating from hawk
guess this means hawk youll be able to let yourself back in
hawk and the wise guard hit fists half smiling
hawk unfolds the painting
oh give this back to petey in a block
tell him it was a sweet gift but i think he got some wrong ideas about our friendship
the paint thinner killer did this
i think you picked a good day to get out
the trio comes to the final checkpoint
hawk takes a deep breath
hope i lose the bet
have that cappuccino on me
flipping him the pipe cleaner you got it
hawk strides to the massive sliding concrete door wall between him and freedom
as music crescendos and hawk glows his first smile the door opens to reveal two mafioso brothers cesar and antony mario the latter sitting upon the hood of a tinted
window lincoln continental
cesar is of cool hair slicked back attitude his scumbag brother is not
welcome back buddy ol pal
weve got a proposition
answers no not even if you bathe
cesar mario antony mario hows the family
kill any monkeys lately
how many times do i have to say it
i didnt put the hit on little eddie
never had anything against that kooky chimp
i actually found him endearing
two endearing shots to the back of the head
thats your mark man
what did little eddie ever do to
smouldering hawk struts off
cesar takes a black canvas bag from a scarfaced driver and hustles up to hawk
the lincoln rumbles behind them antony riding on the hood
youre hitting rutherfords auction house
easy as my brothers wife
directions are in the bag
just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie
or you cut off my thingie
directions even your brother would understand
defensively yeah directions even i could understand
the car squeals to a stop
antony bounds off
cesar shove throws the canvas bag into hawks unwilling hands
hawk youre a great thief
got set up did some time nothing to be ashamed of
dont give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down open a hardware store and sell spatulas
if the mario brothers werent jerseys third largest family id say kiss my ass
but considering your status ill say slurp my butt
hawk fiercely push shoves the canvas bag back into cesars hands
whats your favorite sport hawk
antony opens the back door of the lincoln and says baseball
he is handed a baseball bat
hawk backs up as antony moves threateningly toward him
i meant ping pong
listen id rather go back in than whore for you
stopping oh i need to borrow ten dollars
a prison guard from above turns as not to be a witness
hawk feebly calls up to him
antony swings at hawk who pretends not to notice until the last second
hawk ducks and slam kicks his calf
antony crumples using the bat as a crutch
hawk boots up the bat for a two handed catch then savagely pivots it across antonys face knocking him into the backseat of the car
unfazed you need some time to think
thats cool but next time im not going to say please
cesar floats into the backseat
the lincoln takes off
i dont believe this
ive been out forty seconds
a backfire rings out
hawk hits the ground thinking it is a gunshot
a gasping caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too fancy to be tasteful shoes comes out
hawk looks up to see alex messina his older maybe maybe not wiser best friend
thats the first thing i did
smooch the ground and taste the freedom
sorry i was late
getting up your timing and your shoes are impeccable
good to see you alex been having a lousy day
the mans getting out of prison and hes having a lousy day
what you missing out on the cell block water ballet pageant
believe me its overrated
hawk pauses to say something then just hugs alex
wheres the kiss
no tongue this time i promise
a laughing hawk gives alexs stomach a slap before getting in the car
looks like youve been expanding your
dont say it hawkins
im incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure
my next word was gonna be consciousness
swear to god
the caddy thunders past a sweet manhattan view
come fly with me is playing on the radio
hawk casually com pletes an intimidating hand puzzle
thats your definition of hard
hey boss tune
come fly with me
three minutes seconds

god id kill for a damn cappuccino

oh man you still got a thing for those unmasculine european coffees

alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag
the man knows the man knows
hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff
coffee what went down outside the prison
oh not much
mario brothers want me to do a job
alex brakes and cappuccino flies
hawk half heartedly tries to lick up with his fingers
those dago guinea i can say this shit im italian wop motherfu ah had the perfect amount of foam
just get me to the bar
its the one good thing in my life thatll never change
the guys move through the personably jersey face of the bar
the empire state building beams in the background
sinatra cuts off
hawk and alex enter into what has become the ultimate pseudo art deco fern littered nightmare packed with noisy insufferably self absorbed yups
a violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon elevated t
sets set up all around the place
hawks mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening couple toasting wine coolers and two very young brokers high fiving each other after missing a dartboard
i didnt know how to tell you
a couple brokers stopped in for stoley spritzers one night
next thing i know fast track digest votes us watering hole of the month
now im shopping for aqua salmon wallpaper
i read about these people in newsweek
wheres all the regulars crazy jeff cava the todd sisters indian joe
wheres ed kranepools autograph
captain bobs steering wheel
hey get this irritable guy a cappuccino
i gotta go be a boss
alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it
snatching up a menu hawk calls out
this is pizza
reindeer goat cheese
i admit ive been known to go wild and order a canadian bacon in my time but
hawk lights up a cigarette
a tortoise shell non smoker immediately turns to him wearing a yes i mind if you smoke button
can you read
can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with dew
the candy man can felix
you know i thought this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted drive to work naked make love to a v
guess im wrong
maybe thats why i became a serial arsonist
hey its okay big guy
smoke all you want
the non smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and flees
a cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the bar saloon style
a smiling hawk picks it up turns away from the bar and closes his eyes bringing the cup to his lips until a police badge swirls into frame and splashes
into the cup splattering coffee over hawks blazer
youre under arrest
hawk makes eye contact up to a crude coarse and cackling island of a man officer gates amid the sea of oblivious and self obsessed yuppitude standing by a table
have a seat
good to see you buddy ol pal
the pleasures all yours officer gates
with concern alex watches hawk sit at gates table
gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with terrifying precision
hawk tosses the badge onto the food
gates eats around it
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect
especially after i got you such a nice job
gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the table
the auction house asshole
one nights work and youre free like no ex cons ever been
no checking in with a shrink no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey
its a great deal i cant lie
the only thing you cant do is get sex for free
i know i was in prison for like basically the s but call me daffy arent you supposed to stop me from committing crimes
you know book em dano call for backup give a hoot dont pollute
gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer down at hawk
behind gates on the t
screens are analogous images of disgusting animals and monsters
you wouldnt be out if it wasnt for me
i did dog and pony for you
you think they would have let you out after what you did you told the board members they looked like the three stooges
how was i supposed to know they were women
besides one of them was bald and kept saying soitinly
gates simmers into his seat with a self control smile
remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself
remember that shoe you lost
cut to the chase
gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table
one phone call and your shoe will become a piece of evidence and that suicidell become a murder
hawk bobs under the table and up
what else do you got under there i dont want to be rude but this is all pretty lame
thats the beauty
its bullshit but i can make it stick because im a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy whos about to find out that theres a thin
line between ex con and escape con
alex suddenly approaches the table
how is everything tonight sir
beat it alex
youre a dinosaur
alex did you know this ape was going to be here
thats why his meatballs are made out of marinated chuck wagon
mouthful youre full of shit
as alex speaks an eating dog is on the screens
no man actually you are
just add water and it makes its own gravy
keeps your teeth healthy and your coat shiny
gates grabs the shoes and races off gagging
hawk gets up to laugh next to alex
their laughter dies as they turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table between them
hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a monkey sized chalk outline on a city street
behind him alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag
sinatras witchcraft blares on the radio
yo pandora quit hummm ing
look at this
hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old true bar
round lamps tacky mirrors pictures of hawk and the regs at the bar
managing a weary smile hawk lifts a ship steering wheel while alex puts on a pair of granny classes and pulls out blueprints
its captain bobs steering wheel
remember when the captain
hmmm nasty little safe on the th
hawk nervously picks up a rubiks cube and holds it behind his back
he brings it back around completed
sighing hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp
alex starts rubbing his stomach
they pace in pre job syncopation and speak rapid fire
the safes a simpson
last time i played the game simpson only had a
just means itll take you an extra seconds to seduce
you re still the best i know it
but you got three guards who
shit what am i doing
wheres the want ads
gonna sell some spatulas
hey im sorry man
im putting out a fire with kerosene
alex gives hawk a consoling two hand shake then jumps back to reveal he has put hawk into thumbcuffs
this isnt funny
im not into this
there goes five seconds
my records eighteen
out of annoyance hawk breaks out of the cuffs and violently throws them at alex who sits down a little wounded
im sorr goddamn mario brothers
goddamn rutherford auction house
by the way how many seconds
alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain
dont wet your diapers
ill have to change them
whats the running time
alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of drawings of different kinds of vaults
he sets himself up for an insulin injection
i cant get you involved man
this is my sewage and
re drawings god you love all this dont you you bastard
havent you ever heard of stamp collecting or curling
hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to alex
have you seen the public service announcements for diabetes
we can ride horses play lacrosse and knock off auction houses
i got a plan
you wont have to hail cesar or gates
hawk collapses next to alex resigned to his fate
im a bum
two grubby derelicts one pushing a shopping cart the other inside it situated atop the usual two glad bags
they are drunkenly warbling witchcraft
impeccably dressed night lifers give them a wide berth
our derelicts pass beneath a massive red canopy of a distinguished eight story edifice upon which is written rutherfords auction house
a doorman shoos them away
a newspaper truck pulls up in front of the auction house
the driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to a dispenser on the corner
the bums wheel around the truck
the driver loads the papers and bounds back
the truck pulls away from the corner
the shopping cart rolls off the bums nowhere to be seen
the truck turns the corner revealing the derelicts climbing up the back of it with glad bags around their necks
the truck moves toward an enclosed walkway bridge that connects the auction house with another building
launching low tech grapples the vagrants latch them selves onto the walkway window as the truck passes beneath
the viewers viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the dangling derelicts revealing them to of course be hawk and alex
getting a footing on the small window ledge each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a plunger
whoa you better cut a bigger hole than that
hey you promised
dont worry im wearing my girdle
hawk and alex come through their window holes
hawk immediately flattens himself against a wall whisper ing
guards stations right there
alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where laughter and shadows emerge
hawk tries to flee but a grinning alex pulls him toward it
hawk and alex slide across the wall to a closed room marked power which is right next to the open guards station
the viewers viewpoint moves past hawk and alex lock picking into the power room to
two security guards sit before a console of seven security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke
wires coming out of the security console run across the floor and through the wall into
the wires go up to a row of seven humming record button flashing v
hawk and alex stand before them sharing a cig
they record everything their video surveillance takes in
yes master thief i can see that
you said something about a plan
alex presses the rewind buttons on the v
am i boring you smartass
a little rewind and re wire action and the guards are going to be watching a rerun and miss out on our exciting episode
alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked monday
moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling set of hanging horse mobiles a heavyset guard big stan moseys through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium
the auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a turbo floor washer
next to a painting of happy children riding horses at the back of the auditorium stage big stan hefts himself upon a comparatively tiny blue chair and begins to tip
back and snooze
the security guards look to the seventh floor screen to see an unfolding shot of big stan mid snooze
check out big stan
walkie talkie big stan
startled by his walkie talkie big stan falls back on the little chair crunching it to the ground
the laughing security guards see the crunch
alex puts the last of the monday tapes into a v
you got about five minutes and change
swinging on a star
you know they invented something while you were inside
called a watch
a freight elevator pings
hawk opens it up as the music of swinging on the star kicks in on the soundtrack
a mule is an animal with long funny ears
he kicks up at anything he hears
hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his glad bag
strenuously upbeat ray conniffesque singers continue to sing the song orchestrally accompanied when hawk isnt
hawk takes over the song sardined in the elevator
or would you rather swing on a star carry moonbeams home in a jar
alex goes up to a circuit box and pulls down two large switches
the soundtrack singers continue to warble
the lights of the floor wobble and die
the console screens blink off
the security guards stop laughing
check the power room bud
security guard one harrumphs into a standing position
alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the v
they now all have their play buttons lit up
swing on a star carry moonbeams
security guard one fishes for keys to open the power room
the soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away alex
alex briskly slams back up the switches
the singers go louder as the lights come back on
security guard one harrumphs and heads back to the guards station
hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left wall of the auditorium glancing to the clock
or would you rather be a fish
he pulls out the black canvas bag from his glad bag and takes out the blueprints
hawk follows them toward the painting on stage
big stan comes up from behind his fellow guards dumping the remains of the chair on the floor
moving back off very funny
the seventh floor screen shows a peaceful auction auditorium
and the blue chair
from the exact angle the viewer sees the current state of the room with hawk flinging off the painting of the horseback children revealing a safe
but no blue chair
spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor plugged into a walkman and affixes it to the safe above the dial
lyric trouble a fish is annuh nan na nan na brook
alex is now packed into the freight elevator
he cant write his name or read a book
to fool people is his only thought
remembering and though hes slippery he still gets caught
wearing headphones hawk cranks up the walkman and spins the dial
the clicks from the dial are so loud he winces and turns down the volume
then theres a clunk
with the soundtrack singers taking over guard two sips a cup of coffee
he doesnt swallow
his sights zero in on the blue chair on the seventh screen
he looks to the chair remains then back again
im looking at the seventh floor and i dont know how to say this i see the blue chair
you think thats weird check out screen two
screen two shows the two security guards themselves hatching open some on duty beers going down a hall
guard two looks to the empties atop the console
somebody rewired the recorders
hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door open
inside the safe along with the holy da vinci music cue is the clay equestrian model from leonardos worktable
hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag
and all the monkeys arent in the zoo
every day you meet quite a few
alex gives hawk a congratulatory pat
so you see its all up to you
you can be better than you are
you could be swinging on a star
big stan reconnects the wires of the seventh v
suddenly on the seventh screen the image and voices of hawk and alex in process comes on
shit lets roll
hawk puts the painting back up but stops to stare at the playful children
the songs over
you could be swinging on a star
what am i doing here
there are so many things i wanna do that arent this
paint a lighthouse
kiss a woman in italy
more frantically you could be swinging on a star
paint a woman in a lighthou i dont want to steal a horse
hawks soliloquy is cut short as security guards one and two crash into the auction auditorium
you could be swinging on a star
you couldnt have waited to see a psychiatrist
no you had
alex whips his chair at the floor washer tipping it forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and trip the guards into a bellyflop
hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them into alexs thumbcuffs
he then limbos under their connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer cord
the security guards clumsily turn and re trip themselves
lets go down the freight elevator
big stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator
keep those ideas coming
hawk and alex run toward an office located at the right wall
they both do a gene kellyesque chair tip over before simultaneously bashing through the office door
hawk and alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and rub their funny bones
alex stops laughing
im not as unpleasantly plump as that guard am i
big stan fires off a warning shot
hawk and alex quickly tear up a window
moving out on to a ledge hawk and alex look down to the huge auction house awning and trade gulps
big stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door
i got a bad feeling
i cant even swim
hell the fallll probably kill ya
big stan raises his gun
hawk and alex jump and aaagh down the face of the building
closer and closer to the awning
the viewer focuses upon hawk as he free falls
hawk continues his fall into a ridiculously huge reclining chair
the foot stand swooshes out with a thump
a hand pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle
hawks weirdly reclining viewpoint makes gates and his pad more grotesque than they are no small feat
a sub radio shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch bowl of red margarita like substance beneath the instantly recognizable framed picture of those dogs playing poker all atop
a jungle shag
gates in shorts and a hawaiian shirt over a keep on truckin t shirt raises a loud tumbler with one hand the black canvas bag in the other
hudson hawkins gets the chair of honor
how about a gates arita
toward bowl i used real hot dogs
werent you the bartender at jonestown
suddenly a light is turned on in the corner revealing a seated cesar and antony mario the latter taking a painful gatesirita sip
good job not pretty but good
ah the mafia the cops do i know how to party or what
gates pulls out the horse and looks at it
all this trouble for a horsey
i may not know art but i know what i like
to dog picture you certainly do
so whens that sebastian cabot buckingham palace looking butlerhead getting here
any minute now dear mr
a malevolently snobbish british butler alfred enters in distaste
he makes a stressful glance to three vanity fairs on a coffeetable that has a photo of a magnetic husband wife dog combo with the caption mayflower power
hawk notices this
oh sorry jeeves
alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jewelers loupe studies it carefully
ah such craftsmanship
leonardo da vincis last commission for the duke of milan
french im delirious for you
now wheres my cut
with dignity alfred smashes the ancient horse over gatess head
alfred rummages through the debris revealing a perversely labyrinthine crystal piece
recognizable from da vincis workshop
you son of a
i dont believe this
you come into my house
alfred pockets the goodies but not before hawk can give them a confused peruse
i ought to take big ben and shove it up your limey blimey bunghole
a blade slides down alfreds arm
half yawning he
spins before gates and the bystanders behind him
the blade goes back up alfreds arm
the rooms only sound is the stereos inappropriate music
gates shrugs but his voice is off
like i said
wheres my cu u
suddenly a line across gatess neck turns red and blood begins to gush like a tourist attraction
gates crashes down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo sending it to the ground cutting off the music
the dog poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid
blown away hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the recliner
alfred pats some stain remover on the blood on his shirt
so much for his cut
post chortle excuse my dry british humor
rising lovely work alfred taking the concorde back
indeed i am mr
im really racking up those frequent flyer points
i hate to interrrupt you two lovebirds
you know i think gates promised hawk a cut too
the mario brothers cackle out
hawk tries to flail out of his chair
alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm
hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair
ta ta hudson hawk
breathless too do loo babe
hawk bursts into the bar
alex sits on a stool reading the paper
did i miss anything
oh not much
gates just had his tonsils taken out
the hard way
geez gates was killed
who do we send the thank you note to
hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle with the cappuccino machine
the butler did it
guy was a cross between alistair cook and a cuisinart
dude took mr
ed and humptied dumptied it over gatess head
he said it was made by get this leonardo
professorial ah yes a rare renaissance piece
da vincis sforza an equestrian model of a never executed statue
i consider it to be the prize of tonights auction of objets dequestrian
the cappuccino machine sparks
a perplexed hawk takes a couple extra seconds to back off
okay you got me mr
holding up newspaper morning edition
seems two thieves attempted to steal it last night but thanks to three courageous guards it will be ready for tonight
at tempt ted
im not happy about having to steal that horse but i do have my pride
face it when it comes to burglary and sex i
hawk takes the newspaper
there is a picture of the three security guards in a cheery pose behind the sforza
hawk squints to see that security guards one and two are still wearing the thumbcuffs
uh this i don t understand
hurdling the bar because im tired of not understanding things
cops mafia and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something which it turns out i really didnt steal its fucked up
pulling back newspaper you re not thinking of going to
alex my man its time to play a little offense
wheres your tux
dressed in a not quite fitting but suave tuxedo hawk enters the now well lit auction house auditorium chairs all set out
bored workmen in coveralls lug equestrian items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator
fan taas tic example of florentine marble
who will start at
someone raises their paddle as hawk passes beneath the hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage
hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one seated next to him an enchantingly beautiful woman
all these years of attending auctions i still get goosebumps
the paintings the sculptures
the things that arent really paintings or sculptures
the pretentious vultures who dont even look up from their calculators to see what theyre buying
now that gives me goosebumps
auctions are disgusting
i couldnt agree more
the woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself
lot fifteen an equestrian sconce attributed to the cellini school
big stan the hefty guard from the heist enters the area wearing a blue ribbon
big stan is walking in back of the seated bidders an oblivious hawk in the foreground starts to scan varied bidder types raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures
a gaudy rock star and his gloomy chic entourage a king farouk type with a bored teenage american hooker and a scary nordic princess in a monocle and a tiara
three standing assistants frantically man a table of phones set up down before the stage
one raises his arm
to the caller from newfoundland
a stylish female assistant takes out an impressive replica of the sforza from the safe behind the podium and brings it to the auctioneer
the crowd a a hs
hawk laughs and shakes his head
and finally lot number thought to be lost in the war and again last night the da vinci sforza the jewel of the sale
fan taas tic
re auctioneer is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite to getting a job in the art world
there have naturally been questions of its authenticity so to verify we have doctor anna baragli of the vatican
rising to hawk some of us warthogs are more constipated than others
hawk uneasily laughs as anna makes her way up the stage and pulls out a large magnifying glass
a look of distress passes over her face
hawk closes his eyes in anticipation
oh the shit is going to hit the fa suddenly serene fantastic
the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder
well begin the bidding at
to you sir
eighty three ninety your bid madame ninety point five
hawk opens his eyes in confusion
he scans anna coming off the stage gliding toward the phone table
hawk floats into the aisle curling toward her as she picks up a phone and murmurs into it
loo million clams francesco
the crowd orgasms as vanity fair cover boy darwin mayflower works the aisle playfully mussing up the appreciative tiaraed princesss hair giddily high fiving the rock star and sloppily frenching
million dollars to mr
hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure
anna looks up from the phone to do the same
she swerves her attention to the back turned hawk
darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his wife minerva makes her entrance par excellahnce
she is outrageously dressed with a mammoth tiffany watch that extends from her wrist down to acting as a leash her obnoxious little dog bunny
francesco million and one
darwin to the crowds delight holds his struck heart
outbid by my own wench quelle bummere
fan taas tic the bid is at million and one dollars
commencing a slow motion sequence big stan comes out of the nearby office zipping up his fly
he immedi ately scopes hawk in the space before the stage
the mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with devoured canary smiles
big stan pulls out his gun untheatrically as not to cause a scene
anna sees this and follows big stans eyeline to hawk
hawk turns to re pursue but stops dead at the sight of the gloating big stan
big stan launches a gallop toward hawk who spins and veers back round up the aisle
the mayflowers zero their sights on the activity
the gavel comes down in super slow motion
annas leg pokes out of the aisle tripping the guard
hawk brakes at the end of the mayflowers row and smiles in relief casually turning to darwin and minerva
the gavel continues to come down in super slow motion
both darwin and minerva mayflower suddenly duck down
smile vanishing hawk spins toward the stage
the gavel hits
breaking out of slow motion into wide angle the entire podium explodes sending debris equestrian pieces and eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming battered crowd
knocked off his feet hawk gropes into a standing position
he sees the mayflowers make a smooth exit
he starts to give chase until he sees a battered anna rising from the ground
a hanging white tri star pegasus cracks from the damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards anna
hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying leap
he slams anna out of the pegasuss pulverizing path
they weary up off the ground and move down the aisle calm in a storm of packed art patrons
my god that was bold of you you didnt have to do that
forget about it it was nothing anybody would have done the same thing its an impulse
no i meant you didnt have to tackle me and rip my dress
a polite push perhaps
a clear shout of watch out anna would have done nicely
excuse me milady
i would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud but i left my cape at the cleaners
anna touches hawks lips and laughs
hey i was kidding thanks tough guy thanks a lot
why was the guard chasing you
na a h
because danger doc is my middle
before hawk can finish a hanging horse out of nowhere hammers him into the ground and the viewer into darkness
hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated gurney
saint pete hey i know the whole cat burglar thing it sounds bad but ill take the worst cloud you got
hawks eyes focus
the mario brothers hover over him
youre not in heaven
seconds and counting if you know what im saying
couldnt just play along could you
the ambulance careens onto the brooklyn bridge
antony raises up a mammoth gun
pretty class way of covering your tracks
i think that auctioneer landed at la guardia
subtlety was never one of our strong points
a confused antony touches his teeth with his gun hand
hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby trayful of syringes into antonys face where they ghoul ishly quiver
antony fires a wild shot shattering the partition
the scarfaced bodyguard driver now in paramedic white freaks at the starred windshield
the ambulance bumper pools off some innocent cars
hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a howling cesar side stepping his vibrating on the floor brother latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches it
the elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now unstrapped but terrified hawk whoa a ing atop it
the gurney wheels hit the road sparking
a sheet from the gurney caught on the door yanks taught hawk is water skiing on his stomach atop the elevated gurney
screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the road
battered by wind and fear hawk clutches to the gurney and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface
the sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing off to the side on its own crazed volition
hawk skis toward a toll booth with a large gate arm
life dont get much better than this
he then sees hes heading toward an exact change lane
whizzing wildly forward on the gurney hawk scrambles into his pocket and wiggles out some change
he fran tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally flings the change from twenty feet away
the change ker chunks into the basket and hawk and the gurney just barely streak underneath the rising gate arm
crashes through a gate arm of another lane
hawk and the still wildly whooshing gurney cut it off
cesar pops his head through the partition
make him into roadkill
antony seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in his skull pokes his head next to cesars
yeah run him down
cesar and the bodyguard driver turn to antony and scream then all three look out the windshield and scream
jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a fiery ball
in the foreground hawks gurney coasts down hawk with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle fear comes to a tranquil gurney wheels gently squeaking stop
lit by the flames of the ambulance crash a sneering young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness carrying a steel suitcase
he kneels before hawk and opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara tus
he begins mumbling into a cellular phone
a malevolent silent deadpan wraith passes him and approaches hawk
both men are dressed in outfits that seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute couture
on the fingers of one wraith hand is carved the word hate
on the other hand is the word frog
the frog hand hands a befuddled hawk a card
it reads my name is kit hawk looks up with a huh expression as kit kat chops his neck knocking him off the gurney
the sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus
this is the worst night
when it rains it pours
the plane leaves in
snickers zaps hawk in the leg with his device
hawk a a ghs into a kneeling position
snickers returns to his suitcase and is passed by a pleasant young black woman in the outfit
i know pretty silly
but its better than when we first started out our code names were diseases
you dont know what its like being called clymidia for a year
walking off whoops forgot
she deftly kicks hawk across the face
hawk angrily bounds back up until he sees the biggest member of the group fe fi fo fum his way toward them
suddenly the giant clumsily trips over snickers suitcase apparatus and ram collapses into hawk and the gurney
laying atop hawk butterfinger goofily speaks
my names butterfinger
the mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat that screams old time cia
his name will be george dont you just hate kids
george you promised
no old cia new cia jokes
i call them the mtv
punks think bay of pigs is an herbal tea
they think the cold war involves penguins and
dont i know you
you just might
im the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it
at the time i was bald with a beard no moustache and i had a different nose so if you dont recognize me i wont be offended
bastard youre going to need another nose
hawk explodes upward
everyone but cool kaplan draws a gun
but im not the type of guy to hold a grudge
i used you as a diversion
while you were getting captured upstairs i was shredding documents in the basement
deep down i guess i was just jealous
you were one incredible thief
to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion you centrally intelligent scumsicle
as kaplan converses snickers and butterfinger bring out a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind hawk
i want to make things up to you
thats why i got you this gig doll
hawk my names george kaplan and to quote the late great karen carpenter weve only just begun
three minutes twenty three seconds
if you think im doing another
my employer wants a meeting
no somebody powerful
whats that up there
im supposed to fall for that
kaplan savagely point blank punches hawk in the face knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase
snickers slams it shut revealing a kennedy international sticker
hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch
he has been put in an aggressively fashionable italian outfit
he eyes and touches his new duds with complete bafflement
he then stumbles into a standing position to mouth gaping take in a wondrous degree view of rome italy as o solo mio blares on the soundtrack
hawks spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of scary butler alfred elegantly reaching the top of the
welcome to rome sir
alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent mayflower logoed limousine
the car moves off as hawk slides in
facing darwin mayflower who is blustering into the cellular
while he talks darwin shakes hawks bewildered hand then holding up one finger in a be with you in a sec facial move
for those kind of wages i could have built the factory in america
theyre vietnamese cant we just give them more bart simpson shirts
i hear depressing news like this and i want to commit genocide
slamming phone alfred hold my calls
what do you think of the vehicle
you could host american bandstand in here
why did you duck at the auction asshole
because i didnt want to get hurt taterhead
a fax machine comes to life as darwin babbles
what can i tell you im the villain
initially it was a priority to keep a lot of buffers between you and me but since most of them are dead now i thought what the heck
hawk you come highly recommended
i would have done some things differently at the auction house but hey i want to be in business with you
darwin scans the fax message with annoyance and then shoves it into a violent paper shredder
shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door
a simmering hawk tries to explode but the phone rings
my life is not some deal
its boston mr
im sorry i have to take this
those are valid points though
darwin picks up the phone and goes mr
hyde while giving hawk can you believe this guy type gestures
you better have a good excuse
you better have a better excuse
you are so weak
im only thankful your ancestors didnt settle america or else my name would be running brave or vomiting antelope
well listen close babe
darwin holds the phone over a cent piece size siren in his armrest
darwin presses a button and a piercing noise fills the car as it comes to a stop
darwin bolts out
hawk hangs back waiting for rod serling to explain things then bolts out too
hawk and darwin head up the steps of an overpowering fascistly marble superstructure
alfred brings up the rear
so hawkasaurus i wont mince words
you own boardwalk you own park place you own the four railroads
you think youre god
for all i know youre probably right
i just wanted to have a damn cappuccino maybe play some nintendo after i find out what it is
man why didnt you just buy the horse
what am i saying you did buy it
there are organizations that think we wanted the sforza for reasons other than putting it in the da vinci museum were building in vinci
hopefully these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica
if i seem vague grand
we want a low profile on this thats why i got kaplan and the candy bars involved
i helped george help the mario brothers and gates help get you out
if youre pausing for a thank you give it up
so boss you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means
way to go alfie
how many people did you break that thing in front of
good helps hard to find
i guess thats a no
a mind blowingly pretentious painting of darwin minerva and bunny hangs above a mammoth m shaped conference table
lying atop the table in heels shades and a heart stopping dark outfit is minerva
nasty metal riffs semi audibly spew from a headset she wears
surrounding the table is a varied group of old money and new money board members ranging from a nine year old indian prince to a sweet elderly american woman
they converse to the person at their side in businesslike tones oblivious to minerva
ladies and gentlemen of the board
the board members go into tableau silence
minerva con tinues a brief sing a long before darwin scolds
and min er va
lets give it up for hudson hawk
the board applauds as alfred pushes hawk inside
bunny ball ball
minerva lobs a ball in the air
bunny the annoying dog scurries beside hawk to catch it
moving down toward the other end of the table hawk takes in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue
he sees one board member take a luxurious sip of cappuccino
minerva paces up upon the table
hawkmeister we got you clothes great hotel and a lira per diem
thats two hundred dollars a day
so he can get a hooker and some tequila
guess i know who wears the penis in this family
jumping off table for gods sake chain this convict
with a yawn alfred pulls out a pair of state of the art handcuffs
alfred youre a very polite psychopath but if you
hawk kicks out at alfred who nimbly moves slightly and gives a pummel to hawks body somersaulting him over the edge of the table into an empty seat
the board members politely applaud
alfred pulls hawks hands around his back and cuffs him
bunny intensely sniffs his crotch
we want da vincis sketchbook what do they call it the codex
listen hawk this might be hard to believe but im a regular joe
i just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals
its just when you make your first billion by the age of its hard to keep coming up with new ones
but now finally i got my new goal
with your help
bunny ball ball
think hes already got todays ball balls
five more minutes please its been so long
minerva yanks away the yelping dog
anybody have a cigarette
but seriously do me a favor and concorde me back to prison
i dont care anymore
i hope you have the receipts for the threads
you go back you wont be alone
youll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate
youre still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes but alex will go in knowing that the next time he gets out itll be
to attend his own funeral
you wouldnt risk the dime to call the police
you have no proof
ah the magic word
alfred plants a slide machine on the table and darwin starts clicking gorgeous images of hawk and alex robbing the auction house on a bare wall
the board members gush
the elderly woman gives a thumbs up
its veja du hawkhead
something you wish never happened
we shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind the hidden cameras
hired the guy who did the last sports illustrated swimsuit issue
whoops damn fotomat assholes
a slide hits the wall of himself and minerva kneeling in big baby clothes with alfred snarling over them decked out in leather
he clicks ahead
hawk looks away and sees that the board members have an annual report type booklet in front of them that reads minerva leans over in front of him
tomorrow youre going to hit a church
the vatican stands in its glory mobbed by hundreds of locals and sightseers
the viewers viewpoint zeroes in on the mayflower limousine circling around it
hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine in stylish italian sunglasses
im robbing the vatican
the nuns at st
agnes predicted that id end up doing this
two identical twin flunkies sit across from him grinning stupidly
hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle finger
mentally casing the joint hawk gets some distance between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room that has a glorious ancient map of the world mural
hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a vatican guard standing before a painting of a pope performing a coronation
half hearted excuse me im being blackmailed into robbing the vatican by a psychotic american corporation along with a cia
uh i dont uh
a jaded hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back
forget it man
go tackle a jaywalker
hawk comes out onto a circular open air hallway
he scans up to some rooftops and makes a note
until he sees a line of international phone boothettes
checking for flunkies he rips one up
operator i want to make a collect call to alex messina new york
the flunkies drift into view
hawk hangs up and seethes off
hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a room at the end bustling with excitement
coming to the mouth of the room he looks to two gold framed mirrors on either side of the opening rubs his head and scribbles
hawk takes in the majestic beauty and practical details of the room windows statues a massive ornate lighting fixture as he moves down one of the twin winding stair cases
leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and the object of their gaze
an old book enclosed in a glass case propped open to the familiar beautiful drawing of a man inside a circle
the case is located between two informational tablets enclosed in glass columns
enter holy da vinci theme
but it is his gift as an inventor who drew together science and art that is most incredible
hawk brightens to the return of anna carrying a portfolio bag striding down the stairs with a group of investors and families
she brightens back giving him a quick verbal breath and a hand squeeze
what are you hows your head
vegetable yes and my giraffe loves it too
she laughs going into her public voice
as you know the da vinci codex has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more
under his breath thats what you theenk
his untiring pen predicted the airplane the submarine the bicycle the helicopter and even the tank
a little brat trailing the group moves next to hawk bitching away to her stuffed elephant pokey
this is so bor ing
do you hate italy as much as i do pokey
bad ventriloquism si senor
italy sucks the big one
why cant we go to the epcot center
the little brat stops and lets pokey the elephant dangle from her side
hawk eyes the elephant strangely
these more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that
the stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over annas head
the alarm goes off
the massive ornate lighting fixture swoops down from the ceiling inverting in air and slams down over the codex transformed into a makeshift cage
strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents
needless to say everyone goes crazy
coughing gas hawk peeks to see that a line of light sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the alarm off
two gas masks drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the entranceway and two racing in guards wrangle them on
the little brat sees that pokey the stuffed elephant has been beheaded by the cage lamp
she is pulled away and spanked
pokey come back
anna yanks a notetaking hawk away as the gas blusters in around him
the two flunkies eyes on hawk are hap lessly making their way up the opposite staircase
come on this stuff will knock you out
have you ever had the feeling you were being followed mr
never why do you ask
reaching the top of the stairs just outside the door anna briskly pulls hawk into a piece of wall that is really a door
the wall closes as the flunkies come flying out baffled
hawk mucho impressed and anna move down a tight dark circular staircase
names hawkins eddie hawkins
my nicknames hudson hawk but dont call me hudson not even as a joke
the nuns at st
agnes called me that and theyre the ones who helped make me what i am today
not a compliment
are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo
could you believe that crazy elephant
anna shakes her head as she opens a door into
a four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a mini underground station
workers latch onto mail bags
hawk and anna emerge from a small door
does it go to times square
delivers up to ten at night
the pope has an obsession with his easter seals
its actually not that an unusual set up
the secret passageway on the other hand
the vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed not explained
but right out of our brochure
oh you read that
actually i wrote it
its a good sentence
it can apply to people
youre not an unmysterious thang yourself
i dont steal stuffed elephants from little girls
smoothing his jacket and i buy my own clothes
my lifes a little boring
god i wish i could say the same thing
what about having a nice dull dinner with me tonight
scrabble knock knock jokes anecdotes about famous dead italians
ill bring my entire repertoire
the two flunkies stumble into the station looking around
anna and hawk crouch down
and ill bring my entourage
secret passageways dont mean as much as they used to
theres a place two blocks east of here
hawk and anna peck each other with a smile
he crawls out an exit door
as he leaves annas smile disappears
she pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self scolding bang on the head
she then darts to a large crucifix and looks up
father its obvious
hes up to something
suddenly a speaker in jesuss mouth gently crackles
jesus italian report downstairs at once
a cardinal paces in an enigmatic vatican area
anna clacks up to him
did he mention the mayflowers
no your eminence
i think hes going to steal the codex as early as next week
attempt you mean
the vanity of this man hudson hawk
the vatican has foiled the advances of pirates and terrorists
we will not lie down for some schmuck from new jersey
must you flirt with him so realistically
thats the best kind
a wise woman once said polite conversation is rarely either
chuckling let me be the one to quote scripture
as an agent of our organization you are put in awkward situations
just remember hudson hawk is an evil evil man
the big e
the evil hawk clumsily strides around a fountain looking off in all directions soft shoes past some sedate painters and swings into
hawk grabs up the phone and dials
id like to make a collect call to new york number
the mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza behind an oblivious hawk
thank you operator thank you
hawk turns putting a finger in his ear
seeing the limo he freaks and balls himself into a corner
come on alex pick up you reindeer goat cheese eating motherfucker
it is late night in new york
a phone rings atop the bar of alexs restaurant with no one in sight
hawk pokes his head to see a darwin and minerva holding bunny emerge from the limousine
as he turns his con centration back to the phone alex himself flows out from a building to cheerfully speak with darwin and minerva and get licked by bunny before
they all pile into the limo
a lex a lex come on alex
hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine pull off
hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully clotheslined by agent butterfinger who is dressed as a mailman
crumpled on the ground hawk kicks out with his foot into butterfingers stomach doubling him
hawk then grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the booth
hawk rotates off for an escape
but the rest of the cia crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns snickers dressed as a maitre d almond joy as a bermuda tourist and kaplan in his
kit kat is dressed exactly like hawk right down to a bloody lip
hawk gives him a double take
hawk hawk hawk
i always had a soft spot for rome
did my first barehanded strangulation here
why george you big softie
god i miss communism
the red threat
people were scared the agency was respected and i got laid every night
a humiliated butterfinger comes waddling out holding the phone
kaplan rolls his eyes
shaking his head if his father wasnt the head of shit i hate this the governments got me farmed out working for the mayflower corporation now money beats politics
war isnt hell anymore its dull
dont slaughter their men and rape their women just steal their microchips
you know kaplan if you werent the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived id feel sorry for you
good news bud the mayflowers have moved up the time table
youre hitting the vatican to night
the timings off im underequipped damnit i have a date
almond joy smoothly extracts hawks notebook and reads
grapple bikers bottle hairspray black turtleneck pocket fisherman acid collapsible yardstick softball and stamps
gee stud this is going to be some date
no harveys bristol cream
snickers make the list happen
oh and its one thing to play hide and seek with the mayflowers pathetic staff but were sore losers
ive put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty
thanks for sharing
we blow up space shuttles for breakfast
you and your friend alex would be a late afternoon triscuit
if you do anything to my friend
by the way as long as im getting things off my chest im the one who killed your little monkey
made it look like a mafia hit
did it for fun
kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different directions as hawk howls in frustration
kit kat moves behind hawk and perfectly mimics him
what did you have against little eddie motherfucker
he was just a monkey who liked to laugh
come back without your yuppie army
ill triscuit you you space shuttle eating
without looking hawk elbows the mimic kit kat in the face
kit kat gives hawk a strange smile and hands him a card that reads beware the odd steps
hawk looks up from the card
kit kat is gone but butterfinger scampers in his place
hawk i got those stamps
sighing hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps
one of the small vatican mail trains bullets across an indoor track
the viewers viewpoint whooshes to catch up focusing on a very large package addressed to the pope that has hawks sheath of stamps slapped onto it
the train zips into a tunnel
the train rumbles into the vatican mini station
two harried workers heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting table
a bell rings as a clock hits
the workers do a sigh of relief
shucking off their uniforms they head out
a hand rips out of the huge package
hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to the mouth of the doorless codex room
he pauses to hand comb his hair in the two large framed mirrors at the sides
carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand hawk hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops
beware the odd steps
hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized alarm button
why kit kat arent you a gentleman
hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to where the codex is bathed in a holy light
he hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running across the top
the parallel mirrors now face out from each other
hawk sprays a blast of clairol to reveal the light sensor beams and then with a deep breath he thrusts the mirrors into the beams
the light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and hawk exhales
he balances the connected mirrors then crawls through his tent like passageway
hawk squirts acid from a bikers bottle on the cracks of the rectangular glass case that holds the codex
the acid sizzles
a burly guard thoughtfully stares at a painting fingers propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling on
rubbing his head hawk gives an excited smile as the glass cracks of the rectangular case loosen
hawk pulls out a pocket fisherman
the viewers viewpoint moves upward to reveal through the mouth of the room the burly guard is coming down the hall
burly guard approaches the outskirts of the codex room
he combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now empty mirror frame then realizes
muttering italian into his walkie talkie burly guard rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor deflecting mirrors
he passes a statue behind which hawk is revealed to be standing
burly guard approaches the codex and sees the dripping acid
he also notices a fishing hook attached to the binding of the codex
the fishing wire leads out of the glass case
the guard reaches to touch it when suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a moving out from behind the statue hawk
the codex flies off its perch setting off the alarm and sending the bizarre cage lamp crashing down and around the hapless burly guard
the green gas commences its noxious billowing as the codex swooshes into hawks hands
he then hurls a softball smashing a window on the other side of the room
the familiar vatican guard and a guard three barrel down into the mouth of the codex room
only one gas mask drops from the doorway
the vatican guard pulls it on and gives a thats life shrug of shoulders to the fainting guard three
hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple around the ceiling cord of the dropped ornate lighting fixture
hawk then tarzans from one staircase to another
he then ungrapples and heads toward the shattered window
the vatican guard waits a stunned moment before giving chase
hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical skipping across the rooftop jaunt
suddenly a brick on the slightly slanted roof gives way and hawk falls
his canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof landing against the antennae
speaking to wilbur in italian goes fuzzy
the pope wearing his famous hat and a notre dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it
hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof and slides down toward the dangling off the antennae bag
the vatican guard pops out of the window and fires a warning shot
hawk stretches to the bag
his fingers touch as the guard continues to bound forward
please god please god
let the guard shoot me
hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see vatican guard hovering over him on the roof
the worms on the other foot yankee noodle candy
hawk sees the vatican guards foot move toward the grapple
hawk ferociously tugs ripping the guard off balance and knocking down a side of the roof
hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple across a road around a tree branch
hawk ties the end of grapple line tosses on a friction belt takes a breath and jumps off the wall
the viewer follows him on his breathtaking ride
the brused vatican guard flops back atop the roof
he gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down
is alnost to the other side when the guards bullet hits the friction belt
hawk drops with a wild scream
and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost
his eyes bug out with the thought of a life without children
he slowly spins off the lamppost and sails down upon
and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it
hawk tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling baggage but the bus makes a quick turn and hawk goes flying off
panting and discombobulated hawk looks across the table to the female hands holding open a menu
the menu comes down
it is anna
hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag
oh hudson i was worried you werent going to drop by
i never break a date
hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand then quickly rips it off as a waiter comes to the table
fettucini con funghi porcini
oh and could i have some ketchup with that
anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while the waiters entire body sinks in disappointment
other table occupants sadly shake their heads
at a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp snickers is being an uglier american to an uncomprehending waiter while almond joy chuckles and butterfinger spreads butter over an entire
come on pierre steak bur ger fren n ch fries
this is france you gotta have french
actually were in italy snickers she said as if it made a difference
the waiter sneaks off
butterfinger devours his bread
italy france moscow
they all just wanna be nebraska
old man kaplan thinks since communism is dead we got nothing to do
man democracy isnt free elections
we gotta teach the world that democracy is big tits college football on saturdays eddie murphy saying the word fuck and kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on americas
funniest home videos
damn baby whens the last time you had a vacation
jesus i gotta get out of this job
if my mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti apartheid movement
quit bitching you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit
ah to be in pari is and in love
they look off to
physically sarcastic the waiter brings a tall wine basket with a bottle of ketchup in it
hawk nabs it
this is bueno
they had the worst ketchup in prison
i was the warden
how long were you in
lets just say i never saw e
wow you were in the joint
doing hard time
its funny but that excites me
i seem to have a thing for sinners
i seem to have a thing for sinning
ah anything for dessert
she shoots yes
something to go
she scores ill bring the ketchup
the viewers viewpoint pulls back past the black canvas bag on a table to reveal a barefoot anna is straddling a bare backed hawk demurely and tentatively studying his bruises
what have you been doing
old badminton injury
anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise
she stops herself and opts for tickling
tickles tickles tickles
not stopping oh im so sorry
roaring with laughter they capsize onto the floor
hawk slithers around to devour her toes
anna closes her eyes and arches her back
she opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her
with a gasp she rolls away from hawk and stands up trying to brush off her sins
softly approaching hey now outside of a very friendly dog this morning its been a slow decade
i dont make love every ten years i get a little cranky
its also been a long time for me
i their heads fuse for a semi classic screen kiss until catholic girls are scary
somebody robbed the vatican
anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat
she bumps into the canvas bag
the codex slides out
they both catch it in mid air
annas eyes pop
she wrenches the codex away and kicks
hawk pulls her into a compassionate back against his stomach hug
the codex falls to the floor unharmed
its not what you think
okay maybe it is
you really went and did it
with one day not even a day of planning you did it
nobody does it better hudson
you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex
wha what are your plans for the weekend
hoisting away the colosseum
tell me did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower
crammed together in the front seat snickers almond joy and butterfinger are watching the shadows of hawk and anna up in the window
snickers snaps a cartridge into a gun while butterfinger attacks a goo ey pastry
whats going on in there
do you want me to rape them
throwing pastry down dunkin does it better
just read butterfinger
butterfinger pulls up the book on da vinci that anna wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy
da vinci had fears about his more dangerous designs so he created a shorthand code in reverse script
what are they doing
in twenty seconds we go in
foam shoots out over the coffee
hawk smiles down at it as anna works a cappuccino machine
for two years ive been tracking the mayflowers peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces
their sforza replica was as fake as the gas leak that supposedly destroyed it
does everyone in the world know more than me
jesus im just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff
lifted a piece of licorice when i was one and a half
who knew it would lead
they even got the cia involved
raising his cup ooh i guess i do know something heres looking at you kid
the agents burst from the car guns raised
hawk sips the cappuccino
his face immediately contracts
this doesnt taste like cappuccino
oh i must have put too much ethyl chloride in it
anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her hand
his coffee cup lands perfectly in annas outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly on the pillow
the candy bars bash the door open guns raised
why didnt you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the vatican tonight
my people will not be happy
i want to see kaplan
thats not overly possible
but guys remember hes in the castle at vinci
snickers and almond joy grimace into fake smiles
a helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the opening da vinci sequence
anna pets the head of hawk on her lap
she is pondering
a sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing kaplan
snickers and butterfinger flop hawk onto the lit chair
kit kat is dressed exactly like anna
she reacts as she comes into the light
kaplan takes the codex from her
way to go anna
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex theyre going to want to make a deal
gung ho lying and then well arrest those greedy pigs
is that it
the viewer gets his woozy p
actually george its not it
what are we doing in this castle
i happen to know the mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out da vinci used to do
the lights in the room come on to the sound of holy da vinci theme revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop da vinci toiled in in
trying to be solemn its the site of their new museum and were taking it over
operation deflower mayflower is going full speed ahead
taking it in oh lord
the only reason i ask is that hudson uh mr
hawk hawkins had some neat things to say about darwin minerva and you
basically that youre part of the same car pool
if that were true almond joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the codex
now get some sleep
kit kat in drag spookily moves inches away from anna
cat got his tongue
actually he never told us what it was
kit kat smiles revealing the fact he has no tongue
i trust you will see hudson hawk is given to the proper authorities
i recommend leniency
holding in a laugh oh i think we all do
hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking kit kat
do you think she has any idea that operation deflower mayflower is as bogus as kit kats tits
i dont think so although bringing her to the castle gave her a big juicy hint
with all due respect to that great blouse why didnt i cut out her heart
close call but shes our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious vatican organization
hawk its time to go to the principals office
moving into the chopper anna glimpses bunny the obnoxious dog in a mayflower logo dog tag taking a leak on some bushes
she fakes a yawn to the like dressed kit kat who fakes one back
kaplan hawk and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene
in the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine
inside a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine
in tennis gear and goggles darwin mayflower thwacks it against the wall of now faded frescos
also in tennis threads minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand
minerva turns the gadget up to seven and presses a button
another tennis ball shoots out a little faster
darwin batters it
the ball ricochets into the forehead of an amused alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat pants
ooh its hudson hawk you cease to amaze me convict
you are a terrible cat burglar
havent you ever seen like david niven
you know tiptoe in tiptoe out
like a cat one could say
shucks ill just take it back
hawk reaches for the codex
kaplan pulls it over to darwin who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient binding
taking a knife from kaplan he begins to slit it open
bouncing up no let me
pout i dont care
hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange machine parts behind them
minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri cally perverted crystal
another piece of the puzzle for the da vinci alchemy project
kaplan darwin and minerva look up to hawk then to each other all start to speak then all stop
this quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin flunkies
theres nothing more i hate than failure
all you had to do was follow the hawk its not like i said teach our nations children how to read
hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets
i guess were just going to have to kill em
shockingly swift minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of flunky eyes splattering them to the ground
god minerva i was kidding quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet
he reveals the familiar gold machine demonhead
reverberate off each other with laughter
bloodstained kaplan and almond joy exchange an eye bulge
minervas smile disappears as she sees hawk by the sheets
get away from there convict
dont touch me
snickers touches him
hawk smashes him in the jaw
snickers rears back to reciprocate
dont hurt him
we need him for the final job
snickers stops himself snarling in frustration
hawk is suddenly the happiest man hes been in italy
oh weeeeelly dont hurt me
even if i do this
hawk pulls snickers glasses off and stamps them
hawk knees butterfinger in the stomach
surely this must offend
hawk body block dominoes butterfinger and snickers to the ground
kaplan and almond joy aim their guns
playfully lifting his shirt hawk grabs minerva and manually swivels her hips to the beat of his
things are getting a little loose at the da vinci workshop tonight
put your left leg in take your right foot out
may i call you minnie
hawk mambos to alfred who rifles his blade up to hawks crotch
hawk stops dancing
come to think of it there is a part of your body that you wont need for your next job
hey guys ive always wanted to sing like franki valli and the other seasons but come on
alfred moves the blade a little upward
hawk a a ghs
big girls dont cry i eye
two minutes seconds
damnit im involved in this thing so i just wanna know what this thing is
i wanna be treated as an adult
back in rome
now go to your room
alfred strategically vulcans hawk on the neck
the lips of anna come into light
forgive me father for i have sinned
its been hours since my last confession
the cardinal suppresses a yawn
hit me with your best shot
i betrayed a man
a good man
an innocent man
anna what are you trying to say
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure
but he knew right and wrong
oh and we kind of messed around
freaks and goes into some italian gibberish before
messed around messed around
i know i dont want to know
stop me when im getting warm
a little petting is not the issue
seventeen hail marys and five minutes outside
the cardinal emerges and stands by annas confessional curtains
so let me get this straight sister youre saying hudson hawk is not willingly working for the mayflowers but kaplan and the candy bars are anna moves out of the
confessional curtains wearing a full nun habit for she is a nun
the gaspingly beautiful church unfolds as they walk
you got it
operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and im the punchline
i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower
oh why couldnt i be the cardinal in charge of catering
if the mayflowers get the three sections of da vincis crystal and his instructions for the gold machine aie yi do we got anything
what of alex hawks friend where is his loyalty
im going to find out
im sorry for losing it back there but you must remember sister you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world
i know i know your eminence just say god go with me
god go with you sister
anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses deliciously contrasting with her habit
she moves off
beneath the wacky portrait darwin circles the board member filled conference table as minerva smooches bunny
everyone watches alfred place a bar of gold and of lead in the hands of a blindfolded hawk at the middle of the m
so captain hawk in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about thou
in the autre you got lead that wont get you gelato
surely a master thief like you can tell the difference
whats my line thats two down to kitty carlisle
hawk weighs the two bars in his hands digs with his fingernails
he rips off the blindfold in subdued frustration
as minerva speaks she unconsciously molests alfred
cool isnt it
weight feel mal eability theyre all but identical
on the periodic chart of elements theyre but one proton apart
great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless
casually goosing alfred alchemy
is the business term of the s my man
minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago
i dumped some lira into research
shazam we come across a diary by one of da vincis apprentices detailing la machine de oro the gold machine for those at home and the rest is about to
money isnt everything gold is
fuck blue chip stocks
fuck t bills
fuck junk bonds
i got the real deal
money will always be paper but gold will always be gold
greenhouse effect affects
well still be the richest most powerful people in the world
in europe is coming together to become one business superpower
its one party wed love to poop
well that said the last ingredient in the recipe is in get this youre gonna die the kremlin
listen this is all too indiana jones and the lost city of king tut for me man
throw me in jail and go ahead just try and throw alex
jail you asshole
our foot soldiers will blow your brains out
bunny ball ball
minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a tennis ball into its mouth
ill torture you so slowly youll think its a career
ill kill your family your friends and the bitch you took to the prom
you want an address on that last one
bunny barks up at hawk in anger
bunny not you too
youve got a dilemma tiger
i think i know whats going to help you solve it
alfred quickly latches on the state of the art handcuffs and the blindfold
the viewers viewpoint stays on a writhing hawk
ill kill all you
even the old lady
hawk kicks back on the table jump ropes the cuffs then picks the lock with his teeth
hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for alex standing at the other end in an incongruous italian leather coat
i hated cigarettes until i saw my first no smoking sign
keep off the grass
lets play soccer
only law i cared about was friendship
broke that one too didnt i
this gates mario brothers cia mayflower da vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal
visit foreign lands take their treasures
i dont know i thought youd get into it
its better than playing darts with m
s at the bar
i didnt know it was going to be like this
them using me to use you
im sorry theres only one way out of this and its gonna hurt me more than its gonna hurt you
alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in
the piazza from the fascist e
building are bustling with office workers laughing smoking and hustling
darwin minerva and kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps
the other agents stroll in the periphery
i just dont think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone
dont worry george this is the reason we put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with
to keep hawk in line
theyll talk about being buddies and chugging brewskis
raising glass you gotta love male bonding
as darwin slaps kaplan on the back behind them hawk and alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building
you were saying
moving to the edge of the stairs hawk and alex latter holding his gun sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling
the wigging out passers by give them space
you fucked my freedom for a lousy job
alex trembles going into a diabetic seizure
he shakily raises his gun
im so sorry
hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets alex
they roll together down the massive staircase past darwin minerva and the cia who react with this cant be happening catatonia
two shots go off as hawk and alex crash to the bottom of the staircase
hawk rises up in a daze to see alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes
wake up you cant go out like this
hawk falls to his knees as snickers hustles toward him
suddenly sirens are heard as a police van pulls up
four policemen blast from the back of the van
one holds back the crowd
one strenuously pulls hawk into the van
the other two drag in alex
the villains look to each other for non existent guidance as the van pulls away
plan b anyone
using initiative snickers hops on a vespa and roars off after them
the van can be seen swerving off
where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked vatican souvenirs
two seemingly innocent bystander priests break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps slam close the back of the truck lock it shut and continue on their solemn way
the truck bellows off as the vespa spins around the corner
snickers brakes and looks around for the police van
he hits his handle with frustration
out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses anna looks out to a lovely view of italy
the vatican truck pulls up behind her
a giddy blood stained alex and a not so giddy hawk bound out of the back
alex excitedly gives himself an insulin shot
oh thank god youre dead
it was so beautiful
when the blanks went off they
hawks fist whooshes into frame and blasts alexs jaw
you fucked my freedom for a lousy job
but i said i was sorry
no sweat alex you only made the biggest mistake of my life
what was your per diem
dont act like youve never committed a crime before hawkins
i know i made call when anna tracked me down i
hudson dont you understand
and you dr
cappucino youre lucky i dont hit women assuming you are a woman
im not taking anything for granted anymore
i work for a covert vatican humanitarian organization
the cia made a fool of me
i care for you
well whats this
hawk pulls out the demon head that was in the mayflower museum from out of his pocket
anna turns white
where did you get this
you know the place where you gave the bad guys the codex
the mayflower museum
its from the machine
all they need is the crystal to run it and they have of it already
we cant let that happen
youre saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray
something like that
pulling out plane tix well forget about it
hawk and i are going to rio
were hurt were tired and a hero aint nothing but a sandwich
hudson gods given you a gift for cat burglary you can t just
you better believe i can
im sick of people telling me what i have to do
its that kind of selfish attitude that
im just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up not too much foam
you re not some guy anymore hudson
right now youre the only guy
without your help i
anna looks to hawk with a choked up expression
the weight of the world on his shoulders hawk turns away to a lovely view his mind painfully raging and swirling toward peaceful clarity
the world is beautiful
every day in prison i made sure to remember that
its only when i actually got out that i forgot
if i was sane id be on that plane to rio
but being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporations perverted vision does something to your mental health
the world is beautiful and im tired of being fucked
turning around its darwin and minervas turn to bite the pillow
anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross
alex goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion
that was beautiful
i laughed i cried
shaking his head hawk swipes the plane tickets from alex
after all theyve done to
hey these tickets are for moscow
knowing smile damn travel agency
that kremlin thing is in moscow isnt it
a proud hawk slaps alex on the back as some passing italian locals stop to stare horrified at alexs bullet holes
anna sweetly intervenes
the locals give off a slightly dazed a a h and move off
wind blows through the shattered conference room window
snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the table with the mayflowers and the other agents
were all family now
my team has done a lot of rougher things than steal the model of a helicopter
were going to whack this place so fast well have time to shop for american imports
darwin and minerva politely smile and then turn away to each other with knowing looks
the computer screen shows the familiar image of the kremlin building that turns into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later see
lucky for us the da vinci is located in a wing of the kremlin that they used to throw the miss ukraine pageant and stuff
itll have the least number of guards
as for our plan of action anybodyd be insane to go in from the ground floor
a head rubbing hawk and a stomach rubbing alex kneel on the floor of a moving van over a barely legible drawing of what was so neatly delineated on the
both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum
were going in from the ground floor
geez this art treasures room looks like a burnt diaphragm
hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat
anna is revealed to be driving in her habit
hawk gives her a kiss
hey dont take your disguise so seriously
guess im a wee bit nervous
im sorry i could only score clergy passports
fits my new image
a thief for the masses
this is one job im not going to feel guilty about enjoying
hawk alex and anna all spit out their gum into a bag hawk holds
the securitys actually not that severe
it doesnt have to be
everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin youll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails
hawk takes in some views of moscow that remind one of budapest
shwoof that makes me feel better
i cant believe this is the iron curtain
all the guy at airport customs wanted to know was who shot j
you sound disappointed
yeah i mean come on going through the iron curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire its supposed to be strangling a guard
passes a textbook shot of the kremlin in the distance
its supposed to be parachuting in the moonlight
kaplan snickers almond joy and butterfinger slam down upon the roof of the kremlin and discard their parachutes
snickers opens up his computer screen upon which is the image map of the kremlin with a flashing blue light at the top of the building and a flashing green
we are the blue light
the green light is where the art treasures room is
lets go make a purple light
wheres kit kat
dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum hawk alex and anna crawl across the kremlin grounds
they scope out a shabby delivery entrance
all three spit out their gum into hawks bag
count of three
why not just go now
the trio rush for the door
soviet guard one comes out on the roof to light a cig arette
he looks in the distance to the motivating cia team
suddenly a card floats down into his hand
it reads william tell
the not getting it guard looks up from the card as a grinning kit kat parachutes behind him
the guard swerves around and kit kat savagely skewers him with a crossbow shot to his adams apple
hawk anna and alex race to the door the latter bashes it
open and sets off an annoying hammer against bell alarm
alex all fours beneath the alarm
hawk does a michael jordan vault off alexs back and slam dunks a massive ball of used gum pulled from his bag between the hammer and the bell cutting off
they rush ahead
the agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on snickers apparatus rings
kaplan answers it
everythings going fine minerva thanks for asking
minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway with darwin who is holding in his laughter as if this was a great crank
i say who needs this hudson hawk anyway
the good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic and gorgeous ballroom
two lush staircases lead up from the floor
from behind a pillar the gang checks out the activity below
a tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at the opposite end of the ballroom by servants
threaten ing soviet soldiers maneuver on the floor
wizard of oz oh eee oh a whoa oh
they then make a mad scuffle across their side of the second level hunkering down by the level railing
as they move into another wing hallway the viewers viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see a gloating darwin and minerva enter the latter still on the
everybody here in rome wishes you tinsel boxes of love
the servants move away from the tablecloth and the table revealing that it is shaped like an m
a group of serious soviet v
s come out to join the mayflowers at the table
kaplan hangs up the phone
lazy rich condescending bitch
the team moves up to the rooftop doorway where kit kat is
he holds up an about time card
the agents laugh and greet them
hawk alex and anna pass through a set of windowed double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a pitch darkness
a mural of a happy arm stretched lenin looms above the doors
they give it a a quick glance before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers
eighth room down babe
guards come exactly every three minutes
side by side
our trio charges down the hallway
oh we aint got a barrel of money
maybe were ragged and funny
they reach a massive spooky door with an odd ancient lock
they go to work on it
not losing the beat
but well travel along singing a song
side by side
with a gust of wind kaplan and the candy bars bluster through the rooftop door into another hallway where soviet guards two and three are taking it easy
create a diversion
snickers and butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini uzis
soviet guard four rushes out a door before the agents zipping up his fly
almond joy twists his neck with an agonizing snap
hawk anna and alex retreat beneath the lenin mural through the windowed double doors
behind the doors they poke up to see a bespectacled guard emerge from the darkness to check out the door
now thats a lock
dont worry well get it
can i sing this time too
hawk and alex are not thrilled about the idea but annas eye flutter does it
uh i guess so
the bespectacled guard moves back into the darkness
the soviet v
s open up presents of pink l
gear tennis shoes silly t shirts and nintendo joysticks as a standing darwin hypnotizes them
i look at you soviet people and i feel
most of your life your government has told you that capitalism turns people into robots whod rather eat microwave sushi naked in the back of a cadillac than hear the
laughter of children
smiling were here to say your government was right
so lets get busy
have some fun and make some deals
alex holds a lit match into the lock while hawk does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver
they are improvising
oh this lock is a pain in the bu utt howd we ever get such in a ru utt anna suddenly booms out the chorus in a way that hawk
and alex can barely concentrate
but well travel the road sharing the load
side by side
the cia team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one hawk and alex are working on
snickerss computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light
this is the room above the art treasures room
the lock is a natalya z z first created
snickers baby i love you like a brother but really who cares
butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle
he attaches to the front of it a glass encased suctioning time bomb from a waist satchel
he fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking
come hawk alex and anna panting
that was close
anna i think you better stay
you can be lookout
take alexs gun
alex hands anna his gun who glumly takes it like a little sister not allowed to play
hawk and alex go back through the doors
the cia bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer sound
kaplan and the candy bars giddily whoop as they rush through the smoking door
anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in italian and amusingly imitating hawks condescension
you can be the lookout
anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the mayflowers and the v
she gasps and hurls herself behind the second level railing
a very dignified soviet leader in a shit happens baseball cap addresses darwin
before we serve you the main course hee hee we need to know specifics about what you can do for us
how amusingly hungarian
listen up for reasons i dont want to get into i recently had to close down a petroleum factory but im going to re build it here and madonnas going
to cut the ribbon
frozen burritos in leningrad
hawk and alex more frantically toil on the lock
we all had our quarrels and parted
but well be the same as we started
the lock clunks open
they race through the doors into
hawk and alex weave through the room which is crammed with little nuance to the gills with great art treasures including an impressive array of faberge eggs
a solid gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall
just traveling along singing a song
side geez this place is a mess
they rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room covered by a small curtain that has the da vinci man in the circle drawing emblazoned across it
hawk reaches for the curtain
alex puts his arm around him and speaks not sings
side by side man
suddenly the roof above them explodes
kaplan and the candy bars drop down behind them
what the hell
youre supposed to be dead
im a ghost
i dont want to sound immature but we were here first
i wish i could think of those cute quips the way you can hawk but i cant so ill just shoot alex
kaplan point blank shoots alex in the chest
alex crumples backward moaning
butterfinger casually but with incredible strength holds hawks arms behind his back
that was pretty uncool george
sorry you know he kind of reminds me of little eddie
but i digress
ah victory is so sweet
kaplan pulls back the da vinci curtain
nothing is there
a soviet chef lifts up a silver domed serving tray revealing the da vinci helicopter model
this is the best meal i ever had
bulges her eyes at the revelation
she pulls out alexs gun and bangs herself in the head
what to do
kaplan is bugging out
damnit this isnt the plan
blue light green light shit
snickers kit kat a
scramble see if you can find out anything
they thunder out
hawk still in butterfingers oblivious clutches shouts
cant you see the mayflowers double crossed you
they may be scum but if i get the da vinci model back then well be roasting weenies on the beach
i dont think youll appreciate their choice of weenie
kaplan raises his gun
darwin holds the da vinci model in one hand and raises a glass of vodka in the other
youre helping us achieve a goal and in return im giving you a key to the worlds executive washroom
dont piss it away
stop or ill shoot
minerva and some various soviet vips spew their vodka to look up to anna pointing a gun down at them from the second level
she is shivering shaking the gun
you people are immoral and narcissitic and i wont let you
in unison the soviet soldiers surrounding the table begin machine gunning up at her
she dives behind the railing
kaplan lowers his gun
i cant believe this
im in fucking russia or do i have to say the fucking soviet union and im shooting a non bolshevick
raising back up his gun i never thought id say im just in this job for the money
any last immature quips
a beat but why do you let butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt
falling for the oldest trick in the book butterfinger looks down to his shirt
what blood stains
hawk bounces up to savagely head butt butterfinger
butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the gold sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the ground pinning his head to the floor
the gold hammer next trembles off the wall and crushes butterfingers skull
you want immature how bout an egg fight
hawk flings a faberge egg smashing the gun out of kaplans hand
hawk pelts a batch more at him
kaplan sloppily whips some eggs back
hawk finally smashes one in half and beans the jagged piece into kaplans eye
he squeals to the ground geysering blood
hawk swoops down to a wheezing breath controlling alex
alex are you
i cant believe you didnt notice
i lost ten pounds in rome youre a reed man
i gotta get anna
hang in there
bullets stop splintering around anna at the railing as the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload
snickers almond joy and kit kat race out of the hall way area into the ballroom area
they stop at the sight of anna
anna bannana fo fanna i guess i have to cut out your heart for real now
its not personal
anna feebly raises her gun
almond joy laughs and pulls out a knife
you wont shoot
i read your dossier
the soviet soldiers snap in new cartridges as almond joy moves out from behind the pillar towards anna
the soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure
almond joy ruptures and vibrates in a sonny corleone ballet
i gotta get a new job
snickers and kit kat militarily roll on either side of anna as their partner wilts to the ground
the men snickers with his mini uzi kit kat with his cross bow rifle briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers with some graphic success
anna watches darwin and minerva head up the stairs to her level
she bolts off
the last of the soviet vips flee as the soldiers tip over the m shaped table on its side using it for cover firing upward
breaks off and scurries around the second level to get a position behind the m
he fires down an arrow for a successful kill
another guard tries to fire up but kit kat impales him to the back of the table with a quality shot
kit kat grins and reloads as alfred the butler regally creeps behind him
comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where anna is bustling
the mayflowers got
hawk and anna turn to see the mayflowers hastening in their direction
noticing them back the model toting mayflowers halt
turns to alfred and fires his crossbow
alfred effort lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues to move forward
still smiling kit kat tries to reload
breaks the standstill
what a pleasant surprise
youre probably wondering
but youre going to tell us anyway
i hate a man with a sense of humor
while you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way a thoroughly corrupt business deal
if you think youre getting past me
grunting behind them snickers gun butts hawk to the ground
dont be stupid
if you were a true american
just shut up and hit me
snickers swings a punch
hawk blocks it then whomps him in the chest
as they battle darwin grabs annas hair slams her into a pillar and watches her crumple
gets in an arrow but its too late
alfred stabs him deep deep deeply and lifts him from the ground
a shower of cards reading ouch pain and this really hurts rain from out of kit kats coat
alfred discards him over the edge
kit kat sails down upon the m
the lone card of fuck plops from his open eyed corpse
and snickers trades fierce blows stumbling down a staircase
and minerva watch the fight with amusement
alfred the getaway car
slashes hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade
damnit i hate this
im a cat burglar
nobody said anything about this fight to the death shit
snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head
hawk turns to see alex barely standing at the top of the stairs holding the strange rifle
darwin and minerva turn to this dramatic entrance
they start to trot off
i knew it
i told you it was a fake
that new york italian father made twenty bucks a week son of a bitch
what was our bet
million five lover
boots snickers down the stairs
snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb
snickers wails to the soldiers who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the m to watch
help me you democratic reform lovers
get a screwdriver you stupid eskimoes
screw dri ver
oh god i always wanted to know how to play the harp there just was so little time
the soldiers high tail it out
snickers plugs his ears
maybe it was just a
snickers blows up gloriously before the m
hawk bounds up to alex who puffs down onto the steps
they went down the hallway
lets just forget it i mean
hawk rushes up the
stairs gives a what can i do
glance to the unconscious anna and then continues rushing past a pillar
minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward
hawk chugs beneath the lenin mural and down the hall way
he sees darwin breezing in front of him
darwin looks back to hawk then runs forward into the darkness
minera sits down next to the pained alex
hows it going
go go to hell to hell
minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open
wheres your insulin
well bon appetite
minerva savagely slams alexs head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth
hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one eyed and bleeding george kaplan dives out of the art treasures room and tackles him
hawk kicks him off
oh come on
alex gulps down the last of the candy bar shivering
very good alex but you re still alive
she pulls out another candy bar
alex with a last burst of strength punches her across the face
hawk and kaplan lock onto each others throats
why does this have to be so hard
tell me about it
suddenly of all things a car is heard rumbling in the darkness
hawk and kaplan stop fighting and turn to see the may flower limousine screeching out of the darkness with darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun
bullets fly around them
from his back pocket hawk slaps the nice picture of him and little eddie into kaplans hands
take this to hell with you
hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp
deranged with confusion kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine
the driving alfred smiles through the windshield
kaplans body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield
hawks hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp
passing beneath darwin raises up his gun
hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on darwin locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into
hawk and darwin grapple on the floor of the limo
the da vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat
darwins gun goes off
right through alfreds throat
he slumps over pressing down on the accelerator
blasts down the hallway sparking off the wall and bashing off paintings and mirrors
darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side of hawks hand into its teeth
a mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall
hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest
hawk turns on the piercing siren and darwins eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream
darwins entire body bucks wildly
darwin back elbows hawk and moves down for his gun
hawk pulls him back by his hair grabs him by the balls and pushes him upward through the sunroof
god damnit i only wanted to destroy the world in my own image
im a regular joe
darwin pounds his fists on hawks head as hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on darwin pinning his arms below the roof but leaving his torso twisting in
the mural of a happy lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet darwin
putting two and two together darwin loses it
not lenin anybody but lenin
god lets talk abut this
the limousine charges through the double doors and darwins body connects with the mural
hearing the crunch hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle
alfreds head bounces against the steering wheel
hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the da vinci model
he looks to alfred kaplan crunched in the windshield and darwins dangling legs
wow this is really gonna hurt the resale value
hawk runs up to a woozy anna and helps her up
she has a cross shaped blood stain on her forehead
hawk looks to alex sitting on the stairs the same way he left him
hawk rushes to him
we did it man we
hawk grabs alexs shoulder
alex falls back
written over his face in red lipstick is really dead
engaging a slow motion sequence minerva saunters behind anna putting on red lipstick
minerva slams her back to the ground
hawk howls then turns to see stiff upper lip alfred bleeding from the neck
hawk tries to throw a punch but alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face
the da vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene
a damaged hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters
o solo mio returns on the sound track as the shutters open to a postcard view of vinci
hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music
a slightly more composed anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly
they melt into a kiss
i told you not to call me hudson
the only people who called me that were the nuns at
oh hudson im a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent
cut off laugh this is too bad to be false
alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a bandage around his neck
his voice is strange but still polite
welcome back to vinci
last rites sister
please no nun jokes
theyre a bad habit to get into
hawk and anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause
she killed alex
alfred gives them a push
alfred leads them through the da vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed in tennis ball machine
alfred grandly opens double doors to reveal that da vincis gold machine has been majestically re created piece by piece
in the periphery the s rears its head in the form of three technicians wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals
hawk and anna turn to see minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral wear
sorry i couldnt resist
youre probably wondering why youre still alive
as minerva speaks technician one forcibly escorts anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it
i want you to monitor the da vincis directions from the apprentice diary
and hawk i didnt want you to go to hell without knowing that darwin and is dream came true
suddenly sheepish beside that none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together
alfie and i were up all night with the thing
technician two commences a forcible escort of hawk to the gold machine
hawk cold cocks him to the ground
you killed a friend
why should i help you go for the gold
itll take a couple of years of steady production but ill flood the market with so much gold that gold itself the foundation of all finance will lose its meaning
brokers economists and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns
markets will crash crash
financial empires will crumble crumble
except yours yours
the goal of world domination
well if you put it that way minnie
how can i resist
you cant convict
youre just a shmoe
every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them
it rains car crash stops traffic you say how could this happen to me
its a natural inclination
but for i this isnt a fantasy it is reality you are on my planet
you walk around the corner for coffee out of my sight you do not fucking exist
the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich to the powerful to me
anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her
she pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings
reading off the reflection her eyes widen
theres no reason to fight anymore
shes a force of nature
trying to get a grip on annas words hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird
if you pull this off i cant promise i wont kill you
i mean who we trying to kid
but i will spare the flying nun here
and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps
i killed some lovable working class italian diabetic but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind gentle lover
so dont play with me
minerva flicks a switch on the stand annas handcuffed to
anna vibrates being electrocuted
minerva switches it off
giving himself a head rub hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects
he tangles and bends and with a loud snap puts them together forming the crystal from the opening scene
minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head set
oh hawk dont ever change
go team go
minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as da vinci had it in his machine
using a long steel pole technician one adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the
technicians two black eyed and three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart ments on the machine beautifully decorated by the chemicals zodiac sign
alfred places a lead bar in its proper place
hawk glides to anna and undoes her handcuff
i hope you know what
anna puts her fingers on his lips
minerva throws a lever
steam begins to percolate from the furnace towards the machine
into the headset were for real
begins to rotate at first clunkily then faster
the crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment
the machine throws out its folding arms each with an element
the arms click higher
the goggled technicians stand before a time coded video monitor taking notes
the chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes
murmurs to hawk
da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded
the way the machine is running now the gold will produce too quickly clog and the machine will shut itself down
isnt it wonderful
yeah but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal
wha you dont want to know
hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket
i wanna know
holy sh h things are going to get very interesting very fast
da vinci would be proud of you
the chemicals snake down their individual paths to the lead bar spinning its trough
theres a flash and a controlled but jarring explosion
hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration technicians to the ground
oblivious to the violence behind her minerva pulling on goggles over her head set moves closer with a religious purr
triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster circling the room
hawk and anna squint blinded
flinging off her goggles a literally beaming minerva giggles forward
beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar
sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten
she moves closer shouting into her head set
the machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace
hawks voice suddenly comes on minervas head set
hawks voice head set minnie hate to interrupt your orgasm but
stand above the unconscious technicians
hawk is on head set
me anna and leonardo just wanna say you got the midas touch baby
minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion
the center of the machine blows
the pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer
mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls
minerva tumbles from the machine screaming that is to say trying to scream because molten gold covers her face
it bubbles and cascades turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of nefertiti
turn to retreat and see standing in the mouth of the open double doors in an open shirt wearing indian war paint on his face and the words rule britannia
painted on his chest alfred
youre unemployed alfie
boss is dead
her plan is over
strange voiced my plan is just beginning
ill forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers but im afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses
alfred rushes forward with a howl
hawk meets him halfway
they trade savage punches and then lock onto each others throats
anna pulls a gun from a technicians holster and prays for forgiveness
she aims steadily and fires
right into hawks arm
this allows alfred to knock him back with a strong punch
she fires again
the bullet pings off hawks belt buckle
stop helping me
thou shalt not kill
hawks turning to chastize anna allows alfred to kick hawk back against a wall
alfred lunges out with his blade hitting the wall off angle
hawk yanks the shaft
alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on hawks throat
gasping hawk looks to a rip in alfreds shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft
with an all or nothing jerk hawk flicks the lever
the shaft clicks on the hinge
alfreds greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from hawk and suddenly it is alfreds throat which is caught in the v shaped trap
the momentum of the sudden change makes alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the v hits it dont lose your head over this
hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a babe ruth swing right onto the v
the blades slam together and hawk and anna are seen waving up to the viewer alfies head
excuse my crass american humor
the machine thunders with another explosion
hawk and anna rush into the da vinci workshop
she guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm
he delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he sees
bunny the dog
standing in the open mouth of the workshop
anna turns to hawk
anna confidently moves toward the dog until bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground
hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun
bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing anna blood gently starts to emerge
hawk cant get off a shot
he throws down the gun in exasperation
it lands next to the gadget that is connected to the tennis ball machine
hawk rushes forward picks up the gadget turns the dial to ten and then smiles sweetly toward the dog
oh bunny ball ball
bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth
hawk slams down on the gadget
a tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine
bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him flying and crashing out a window
hawk pulls up anna as the machine completely explodes
a huge chunk of the roof thuds before the workshop door
hawk suddenly looks off camera and smiles
anna shakes her head vigorously
he pulls her out of the frame
a man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat
it is the he pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule
he begins a stoic juggle when another loud boom sends him to the ground
an explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows
debris frisbees toward the camera along with
anna hanging on hawks waist and hawk hanging from the bar on da vincis bat winged glider
the glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle through the glorious vista
the glider floats to a perfect landing before the unforgettable juggler
hawk and anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke billowing castle
they smile and gush in relief
they wrap arms around the confused but warming up juggler and laugh again
the mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush of dawn
hawk anna and the unforgettable juggler ride atop it
a woman with an unforgettably etched face moves to a cafe table with a luminous smile
she unfolds a table cloth atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos
hawk and anna dismount thank the juggler then cozy into the table
have i ever told you the world is beautiful
semi seductively id really like to play nintendo with you or something
hudson im afraid im sticking with god
smiling but youre a close second tough guy
what is that smile
broadly grinning i got my planet back
hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like the ones da vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup
the first ones for alex
the viewers viewpoint moves into hawks lips having a sip of that damn unmasculine european coffee
