written by quentin tarantino
the modest dairy farm in the countryside of nancy france what the french call cow country
we read a subtitle in the sky above the farm house this subtitle disappears and is replaced by another one one year into the german occupation of france
the farm consists of a house small barn and twelve cows spread about
the owner of the property a bull of a man french farmer brings a axe up and down on a tree stump blemishing his property
however simply by sight youd never know if hes been beating at this stump for the last year or just started today
one of his three pretty teenage daughters is hanging up laundry on the clothes line
as she hangs up a white bed sheet she hears a noise moving the sheet aside she sees a nazi town car convertible with two little nazi flags attached to
the hood a nazi soldier behind the wheel a nazi officer alone in the back seat following two other nazi soldiers on motorcycles coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm
the french farmer sinks his axe in the stump looks over his shoulder and sees the germans approaching
the farmers wife charlotte comes to the doorway of their home followed by her two other teenage daughters and see the germans approaching
the farmer yells to his family in french subtitled in english go back inside and shut the door
to julie julie get me some water from the pump to wash up with then get inside with your mother
the young lady runs to the water pump by the house
she picks up a basin and begins pumping after a few pumps water comes out splashing into the basin
the french farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at pulls a handkerchief from his pocket wipes sweat from off his face and waits for the
nazi convoy to arrive
after living for a year with the sword of damocles suspended over his head this may very well be the end
julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the window sill
thank you darling now go inside and take care of your mother
julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her
as her father stands up from his stump and moves over to the window sill with the water basin
the sound of the engines of the two motorcycles and car get louder
the farmer splashes water from the basin on his face and down his front
he takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from his face and chest as he watches the two motorcycles the one automobile and the four representatives
of the national socialist party come to a halt on his property
we dont move into them but keep observing them from a distance like the farmer
the two nazi motorcyclist are off their bikes and standing at attention next to them
the nazi driver has walked around the automobile and opened the door for his superior
the nazi officer says to the driver in unsubtitled german this is the property of perrier lapadite
yes heer colonel
the nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle carrying in his left hand n d herman until i summon you i am to be left alone
as you wish heer col
colonel yells to the farmer in french subtitled in english is this the property of perrier lapadite
i am perrier lapadite
colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides and says in french with a smile on his face it is a pleasure to meet you monsieur lapadite i am
colonel hans landa of the s
hans landa offers the french farmer perrier lapadite his hand
the frenchman takes the german hand in his and shakes it
how may i help you
i was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion
the door to the farm house swings open andtheafarmer gesturestfor the s
col to enter
removing his grey s
cap inside the frenchmans home
col landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmers wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen smiling in his direction
the farmer enters behind him closing the door
colonel landa this is my family
col clicks his heels together and takes the hand of the french farmers wife
col hans landa of the s
madame at your service
he kisses her hand then continues without letting go of his hostess hand
please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine
dont be ridiculous heer col
while still holding the french womans hand and looking into her eyes the s
colonel says monsieur lapadite the rumors i have heard in the village about your family are all true
your wife is a beautiful woman
his eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters
and each of your daughters is more lovely then the last
please have a seat
the farmer offers the s
colonel a seat at the families wooden dinner table
the nazi officer excepts the french farmers offer and lowers himself into the chair
placing his grey s
cap on the table and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his feet
the farmer perfect host turns to his wife and says charlotte would you be so good as to get the colonel some wine
merci be coupe monsieur lapadite but no wine
this being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk
then milk is what i prefer
the mother of three takes a craft of milk out of the ice box and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel
colonel takes a long drink from the glass then puts it down loudly on the wooden table
monsieur to both your family and your cows i say bravo
please join me at your table
the french farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from the nazi
the women remain standing
col landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of monsieur lapadite what we have to discuss would be better discussed in private
youll notice i left my men outdoors if it wouldnt offend them could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside
you are right
to his women charlotte would you take the girls outside
the colonel and i need to have a few words
the farmers wife follows her husbands orders and gathers her daughters taking them outside closing the door behind them
the two men are alone at the farmers dinner table in the farmers humble home
monsieur lapadite i regret to inform you ive exhausted the extent of my french
to continue to speak it so inadequately would only serve to embarrass me
however ive been lead to believe you speak english quite well
well it just so happens i do as well
this being your house i ask your permission to switch to english for the remainder of the conversation
by all means
they now speak english monsieur lapadite while im very familiar with you and your family
i have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who i am
are you aware of my existence
the farmer answers yes
this is good
are you aware of the job ive been ordered to carry out in france
the colonel drinks more milk
please tell me what youve heard
ive heard the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the jews left in france who are ether hiding or passing for gentile
the fuhrer couldnt of said it better himself
but the meaning of your visit pleasant though it is is mysterious to me
the germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding jews and found nothing
im aware of that i read the report on this area
but like any enterprise when under new management theres always a slight duplication of efforts
most of it being a complete waste of time but needs to be done nevertheless
i just have a few questions monsieur lapadite if you can assist me with answers my department can close the file on your family
taking his black leather attache case and placing it on the table he takes out a folder from inside
he also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform front pocket
opening the folder and referring to it now before the occupation there were four jewish families in this area all dairy farmers like yourself
the loveitts the doleracs the rollins and the dreyfuss is that correct
to my knowledge those were the jewish families among the dairy farmers
heer colonel would it disturb you if i smoked my pipe
looking up from his papers
please monsieur lapadite it is your house make yourself comfortable
the farmer gets up from the table goes to his shelf over the fireplace and removes from it a wooden box that contains all the fixins to his pipe
he sits back down at the table with his nazi guest
as the farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco sets a match to it and begins slowly puffing making it red hot the s
colonel studies the papers in front of him
now according to these papers all the jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the dreyfusis
somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished
which leads me to the conclusion that theyve ether made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them
looking up from his papers across the table at the what have you heard about the dreyfusis monsieur lapadite
only rumors i love rumors
facts can be so misleading where rumors true or false are often reveling
so monsieur lapadite what rumors have you heard regarding the dreyfusis
the farmerlooks at landa
speak freely monsieur lapadite i want to hear what the rumors are not who told them to you
the farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe
again this is just a rumor but we heard the dreyfusis had made there way into spain
so the rumors youve heard have been of escape
were the lapadites and the dreyfusis friendly
as the farmer answers this question the camera lowers behind his chair to the floor past the floor to a small area underneath the floorboards revealing lying vertically underneath the
these human beings are the dreyfusis who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year
but one couldnt call what the dreyfusis have done for the last year living
this family has done the only thing they could hidden from a occupying army that wishes to exterminate them
we were families in the same community in the same bussiness
i wouldnt say we were friends but members of the same community we had common interest
colonel takes in this answer seems to except it then moves to the next question
having never met the dreyfusis would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names
there were five of them
the father jacob
her brother bob
how old is bob
thirty thirty one
and the children
ages of the children
amos six i believe
and shosanna was fifteen or sixteen im not really sure
the mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothes line
they cant hear anything going on inside
e three nazi soldiers watch the three daughters
well i guess that should do it
be begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his ttache case
the farmer cool as a cucumber puffs on his pipe
however before i go could i have another glass of your delicious milk
but of course
farmer stands up goes over to the ice box and takes out the aft of milk
as he walks over and fills the nazi colonels glass german officer talks
monsieur lapadite are you aware of the nickname the people of france have given me
i have no interest in such things
but you are aware of what they call me
what are you aware of
that they call you the jew hunter
now i understand your trepidation in repeating it
before he was assassinated heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of prague bestowed on him
actually why he would hate the name the hangman is baffling to me it would appear he did everything in his power to earn it
but i on the other hand love my unofficial title precisely because ive earned it
as the jew hunter enjoys his fresh milk he continues to theorize with the french farmer
the feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the jews is as opposed to most german soldiers i can think like a jew
where they can only think like a german or more precisely a german soldier
now if one were to determine what attribute the german people share with a beast it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk
negros gorillas brain lips smell physical strength penis size
but if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast it would be that of the rat
now the fuhrer and gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
where our conclusions differ is i dont consider the comparison a insult
consider for a moment the world a rat lives in
its a hostile world indeed
if a rat were to scamper through your front door right now would you greet it with hostility
i suppose i would
has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them
rats spread disease they bite people unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one rats dont make it a practise of biting human beings
rats were the cause of the bubonic plague but that was some time ago
in all your born days has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life
i purpose to you any disease a rat could spread a squirrel could equally carry
yet i assume you dont share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats do you
yet they are both rodents are they not
and except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin they even rather look alike dont they
it is a interesting thought beer colonel
however interesting as the thought may be it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
if a rat were to scamper through your door this very minute would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk
i didnt think so
you dont like them
you dont really know why you dont like them
all you know is you find them repulsive
lets the sink in what a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure
yet not only does he survive he thrives
and the reason for this is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none
and that monsieur is what a jew shares with a rat
consequently a german soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews
where does the hawk look
he looks in the barn he looks in the attic he looks in the cellar he looks everywhere he would hide
but there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
however the reason the fuhrer brought me off my alps in austria and placed me in french cow country today is because it does occur to me
because im aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity
changing tone may i smoke my pipe as well
th e farmers cool facade is little by little eroding
please cononel make yourself at home
the jew hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings
the pipe strangely enough is a calabash made from a s shaped goard kith a yellow skin made famous by sherlock holmes
a the nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking life he ontinues to hold court at the frenchmans table
the other mistake the german soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the jews
these citizens are not enemies of the state
they are simply confused people trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates
these citizens do not need punishing
they simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time
lets use you as a example monsieur lapadite
in this war you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself your lovely ladies or your cows yet here you are
so monsieur lapadite let me purpose a question
in this time of war what is your number one duty
is it to fight the germans in the name of france to your last breath
or is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability
or is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs
or is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family
the colonel lets the last statement stand
that was a question monsieur lapadite
in this time of war what do you consider your number one duty
to protect my family
now my job dictates that i must have my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before i can officially cross your families name off my list
and if there are any irregularities to be found rest assured they will be
that is unless you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary
i might add also that any information that makes the preforming of my duty easier will not be met with punishment
actually quite the contrary it will be met with reward
and that reward will be your family will cease to be harassed in anyway by the german military during the rest of our occupation of your country
the farmer pipe in mouth stares across the table at his german opponent
you are sheltering enemies of the state are you not
your sheltering them underneath your floorboards arent you
point out to me the areas where their hiding
the farmer points out the areas on the floor with the dreyfusis are underneath
since i havent heard any disturbance i assume that while their listening they dont speak english
im going to switch back to french now and i want you to follow my masquerade is that clear
colonel landa stands up from the table and switching to french says monsieur lapadite i thank you for milk and your hospitably
i do believe our business here is done
the nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his son to approach the house
mademoiselle lapadite i thank you for your time we shant be bothering your family any longer
yet the lapadite women watch the nazi soldiers machine guns at ready approach the house
the soldiers enter the doorway col landa silently points out area of the floor the jews are hiding under
so monsieur and madame lapadite i bid you adieu
otions to the soldiers with his index finger
wy tear up the wood floor with machine gun fire
the little farm house is filled with smoke dust splinters screams ullet casings and even alittle blood
with a hand motion from the colonel the soldiers cut off their gunfire
the colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate silence
the entire dreyfus family lay dead
except for sixteen year old hosanna who miraculously escaped being struck by the nazis bullets
with her dead family surrounding her the young girl goes for freedom represented by wire mesh vent
ears movement underneath the floor looks down and sees a shape wing forward between the planks in the floor
its the girl
nobody moves kicked open the girl springs out
ae he crosses the floor he sees the young girl running towards the cover of the woods
he unlatches the window and opens it
shosanna to perfectly framed in the window sill
running towards woods
farm house and col in the window in b
lapping against wet grass
shosannma s face same as a animal being chased by a predator flight panic fear the safety of trees getting closer
pramed by the window takes his lugar and straight arm aims at the fleeing jew cocking back the hammer with his thumb
slow zoom into his eyes as he aims
sod dash for life
changes his mind
he yells to the rat fleeing the trap heading for the safety of the wood pile in french subtitled in english au revoir shosanna
till we meet again
maces it to the woods and is gone
t h e s
colonel closes the window
diihe ac seat of the convertible thatsa stsn tcolonel hans lan speeding away from the french farm house
landa speaks to his driver in german subtitled into english herman i sense a question on your lips
out with it
why did yoy allow a enemy of the state to escape
oh i dont think the state is in too much danger do you
i suppose not
im glad you see it my way
besides not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen year old girl and allowing her to escape our not nessessarlly the same thing
shes a young girl no food no shelter no shoes whos just witnessed the massacre of her entire family
she may not survive the night
and after word spreads about what happened today its highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid
if i had to guess her fate id say shell probably be turned in by some neighbour
or shell be spotted by some german soldier
or well find her body in the woods dead from starvation or exposure
or perhaps shell survive
she will elude capture
she will escape to america
she will move to new york city
where she will be elected president of the united states
colonel chuckles at his little funny
a bunch of soldiers are lined up at attention
raine a hillbilly from the mountains of tennessee walks down the line
he recruits the men the germans will later call the basterds
aldo has one defining physical characteristic a rope burn around his neck
as if once upon a time
he survived a lynching
the scar will never once be mentioned
my name is lt
aldo raine and im puttin together a special team
and i need me eight soldiers
eight jewish american soldiers
now yall might of heard rumors about the armada happening soon
well well be leavin a little earlier
were gonna be dropped into france dressed as civilians
and once were in enemy territory as a bushwackin guerrilla army were gonna be doin one thing and thing only killin nazis
the members of the national socialist party have conquered europe through murder torture intimidation and terror
and thats exactly what were gonna do to them
now i dont know bout yall
but i sure as hell didnt come down from the goddamn smoky mountains cross five thousand miles of water fight my way through half sicily and then jump out of
a fuckin air o plane to teach the nazis lessons in humanity
nazi aint got no humanity
there the foot soldiers of a jew hatin mass murderin manic and they need to be destroyed
thats why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin a nazi uniform there gonna die
we will be cruel to the germans and through our cruelty they will know who we are
they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disembowed dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us
and the german will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands and our boot heels and the edge of our knives
and the germans will be sickened by us
and the germans will talk about us
and the germans will fear us
and when the germans close their eyes at night and their sub conscious tortures them for the evil theyve done it will be with thoughts of us that it tortures
he stops pacing and looks at everybody
they all say yes sir
thats what i like to hear
but i got a word of warning to all would be warriors
when you join my command you take on debit
a debit you owe me personally
every man under my command owes me one hundred nazi scalps
and i want my scalps
and all yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of one hundred dead nazis
or you will die trying
a huge chalet on a misty mountain top in barvia
in a huge room adolph hitler pounds on a big table with his fist as he rants at two german generals
they speak german subtitled into english how much more of these jew swine must i endure
they butcher my men like they were fish bait
this pack of filthy degenerates are doing what the russian army didnt and pattons army couldnt
turning soldiers of the third reich into superstitious old women
just the cowards among them mine fuhrer
hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist
no no no no no no
i have heard the rumors myself
solders of the third reich who have brought the world to there knee s now pecking and clucking like chickens
do you know the latest rumor theyve conjured up in their fear induced delirium
the one that beats my boys with a bat
the one they call the bear jew
is a golem
a avenging jew angel conjured up by a vengeful rabbi to smite the aryans
mine fuhrer this is just soldiers gossip no one really believes the bear jew is a golem
they seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration
they seem to be able to appear and disappear at will
you want to prove their flesh and blood
then bring them to me
i will hang them naked by their heels from the eiffel tower
and then throw their bodies in the sewers for the rats of paris to feast
the fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself and wipe his greasy black hair out of his face
the bear jew
he hits the button on the intercom on his desk
kliest voice comes out of the intercom year mine fuhrer
i have a order i want relayed to all german soldiers stationed in france
the jew degenerate known as the bear jew hence forth is never to be referred to as the bear jew again
we will cease to aid the americans any longer in there attempt to undermine the german soldier psyche
did you get that kliest
yes mine fubrer
do you still wish to see private butz
who and what is a private butz
hes the soldier you wanted to see personally
his squad was ambushed by lt
he was its only survivor
indeed i do want to see him thank you for reminding me
send him in
his head lies on the ground horizontal
a hand reaches into frame knocks aside the dead german patriots helmet and grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair
a large knife enters frame and begins slicing along the hairline
this process is called scalping
after slicing is complete the scalp easily peels off like a banana
on their knees hands behind there heads
private butz narrates the scene in german subtitled into werner and i were the only ones left alive after the ambush
while one man guarded us the rest removed the hair
all the basterds wore german scalps tied to their belts
hanging from belts
they not only took valuables
rings weapons iron cross and somebody digging out a gold tooth with a knife being removed from dead germans
they also took their identification papers
taken from the inside pocket of a dead german uniform
flips through the i
papers till he gets to the page that contains the german soldiers name statistics and photo
and tore out the identification page
utivich rips the page out and sticks it in his pocket
tossing the torn book on the dead scalpless body
they then removed their boots
boot pulled off
removed reveling dead bare feet
tossing the boots off a hill
throwing them away from the bodies
scalps removed from their heads pink bare feet
the basterds took their lives their hair their valuables their identity and finally their dignity in death
the sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity that is normally felt in battlefield shots
the dogsl he fights his frustration then
aldo screams to the basterd whos guarding the two german prisoners
hey hirschberg send that kraut sarge over
rachtman in the back
rachtman is a little slow to respond
so hirschberg grabs him by the hair yanks him to his feet and kicks him in the ass sending him on his way
most of the bastreds sit in a circle indian style with aldo in the middle
rachtman walks towards this circle of basterds a off screen literary narrator not pvt
butz speaks over the soundtrack in english sgt
werner rachtman has seen many interrogations since germany decided it should rule europe
but this is the first time hes ever been on the wrong end of the exchange
its always been his belief only a weakling in mind body and spirt complies with the enemy under threat of consequence
as werner watched men cry like women pleadingly offer their knowledge in exchange for their worthless lives he made a vow to himself
if his role is to die in this conflict
when they put him under the earth his dignity would be buried with him
for in the other world the gods only respect the ones they test first
well sgt this is your test
and the gods are watching
the captured german sgt enters the circle of basterds stands straight before the sitting southern lieutenant and salutes his captor
aldo returns the salute looking up at him
aldo raine pleased to meet cha
you know what sit down means werner
then sit down
the german sgt does
hows your english werner
cause if need be we gotta a couple fellas can translate
aldo points at one of the basterds in the circle wicki there a austrian jew got the fuck outta saltzberg while the gettin was good
became american got drafted and came back to give yall what for
then aldo points to another basterd
a big scary looking basterd in a german sgts uniform named sgt
hugo stiglitz and another one over there you might be familiar with sgt
heard of em
the two german sgts look at each other
everybody in the german armys heard of hugo stiglitz
the basterds laugh a couple pat hugo on the back
the narrator comes back on the soundtrack
the reason for hugo stiglitzs celebrity among german soldiers is simple
we see a photo of hugo on the front page of the nazi version of stars and stripes the military newspaper
as a german enlisted man he killed thirteen gestapo officers mostly majors
instead of putting him up against a wall the high command decided to send him back to berlin to be made a example of
hugo in chains being put in a lone troop truck part of a prison convoy enroute to berlin
needless to say once the basterds heard about him he never got there
the basterds ambush the prison convoy killing everybody
they walk to the back of the troop truck inside hugo in chains stares back at them
aldo raine and these are the basterds
ever heard of us
hugo nods his head yes
we just wanna say were a big fan of your work
when it comes to killin nazis i think you show great talent and i pride myself on havin a eye for that kind of talent
but your status as a nazi killer is still amateur
we all came here to see if you wanna go pro
now werner im gonna assume you know who we are
aldo the apache
the circle of basterds giggle
well werner if you heard of us you probably heard we aint in the prisoner takin business
we in the killin nazi business
and cousin business is boomin
the basterds laugh
now that leaves two ways we can play this out
either kill ya or let ya go
now weather or not you gonna leave this circle alive depends entirely on you
aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front of his prisoner
up the road a piece theres a orchard
sides you we know theres another kraut patrol fuckin around here somewhere
now if that patrol were to have any crackshots that orchard would be a goddamn snipers delight
now if you ever wanna eat a sauerkraut sandwich again you gotta show me on this map where they are you gotta tell me how many they are and you
gotta tell me what kinda artillery they carrying with em
you cant expect me to divulge information that would put german lives in danger
well werner thats where your wrong
because thats exactly what i expect
i need to know about germans hidin in trees
and you need to tell me
and you need to tell me right now
now take your finger and point out on this map where this partys bein held how manys comin and what they brought to play with
werner site head held high back straight chin up every inch the german hero facing death
f i respectfully refuse sir
aldo jerks his thumb behind him
you see that ole boy battin rocks
we rack focus to a one of the basterds not in the circle
hes wearing a wife beater and power hitting stones with a baseball bat
werners eyes go to the ballplayer
but you might know him better by his nickname the bear jew
now if you heard of aldo the apache you gotta heard about the bear jew
what did you hear
he beats german soldiers with a club
he bashes their brains in with a baseball bat what he does
back to us still havent seen his face
he babe ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere
now werner im gonna ask you one last goddamn time and if you still respectfully refuse im callin the bear jew over here and hes gonna take that big bat
of his and hes gonna beat your ass to death with it
now take your wennersitnitzel lickin finger and point out on this map what i want to know
fuck you and your jew dogs
instead of getting mad the basterds burst out laughing
i k aldo says to werner with a giggle in his voice actually werner were all tickled ya said that
frankly watchin donny beat nazis to death is the closest we ever get to goin to the movies
he turns to camera and yells yeah

bat over his shoulder smiles
donny cutting heads in his pops barber shop in bostin

the proprietor answers the phone and gets into a conversation with his off screen mother
donny walks outside we stay in store but can see him clearly through the stores big picture window
goorowitz instinctively turns his back to donny to speak with his mother
donny starts swinging the bat
its pretty obvious hes pantomiming beating somebody to death with it

donny dressed nice in a apartment building in his jewish bastin neighbourhood
he knocks on a door

donny sits on a overstuffed sofa holding a tea cup and saucer in his hand
himmelstein sits on a overstuffed chair holding her tea looking across at her visitor
sipping tea very good

donny chuckles at her little joke
the old woman remains stone
she wasnt joking
he places his saucer on the coffee table and begins mrs

note this whole chapter will be filmed in french new wave black and white
were in the auditorium of a cinema in paris
however the camera is pointed in the direction of the audience not the screen
we start close on the projector beam emanating from the little glass window in the back of the theatre the camera continues to dolly back making the shot wider and
wider bringing in more and more the german occupied citizens of paris who stare at the off screen silver screen in the dark we can hear the off screen soundtrack of a goebbels produced german omm paw paw musical movie being projected
the shot continues to pull further and further back and the german dialogue continues to fill the auditorium
the dolly shot lands on a close up of shosanna
watching the movie
we hear the sound of the german musicals climax
the lights go up in the auditorium
shosanna dressed in a nurses uniform she swiped from somewhere remains seated as the rest of the patrons gather their coats and file out
patrons exit under the cinema marquee as someone from inside shuts off the marquees lights
the marquee reads in french german night bridget von hammersmark in madcap in mexico
a french black man who we will learn later is named marcel is the cinemas projectionist
we see him for a moment taking the film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds
still sitting in her seat
except for her the auditorium is empty
the owner of the cinema a attractive looking french woman who we will later know as madame mimieux appears in one of the cinemas opera box balconies
looking down from her perch at the young girl sitting in the empty cinema
the dialogue will be spoken in french and subtitled into so young woman since its beyond obvious were closed for the evening
i must assume you want something
what can i do for you
may i sleep here tonight
so i gather your not a nurse
but your a bright little thing thats clever disguise
where is your family
so your a war orphan
we were from nancy
the bosch found us is this a sad story
sad stories bore me
these days everyone in paris has one
i havent bore you with mine dont bore me with yours
you can run the machines
using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a projector she says the machines that show the film
yes i own a cinema of course i can operate them
i know i saw you
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth watching
expertly working the projectors
teach me to run the machines that show the film
its only you and the negro
i know you could use some help
i know at least six people whove been put up against a wall and machine gunned for sheltering enemies of the state
i have no intention of being unlucky number seven
how long have you been in paris
a week and a few days
how have you survived the curfew without capture
i sleep on rooftops
again im forced to admit clever girl
how is it
i can imagine
respectfully no you cant
so you cant operate a mm film projector you want me teach you in order to work here in order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in
is that correct
whats your name
im madame mimieux
you may call me madame
this is a cinema
not a home for wayward war orphans
having said that what you say is true
if you were truly exceptional i could find use for you
so shosanna are you truly exceptional
i will be the judge of that
which shows a lovely pencil sketch of the city of paris complete with eiffel tower
the camera pulls back and we see were not looking at a title card at all but a calender stuck on the wall of the little cinemas projection booth
before we leave it we see the month is june
the camera finds the three years older shosanna working as the projectionist
it would appear that shosanna passed madame mimieuxs exceptional test
a lyrical morriconie like tune plays on the soundtrack this will be shosannas theme
a little bell begins ringing on one of the projectors alerting shosanna its time for a reel change
shosanna stands at the projector watching the old german film shes projecting waiting for the st reel change mark
of the little cinema
on screen leni refenshtal lies horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old german film the white hell of piza palu the st reel change mark
pops on in the upper right hand corner of the frame
that tells the projectionist to get ready
as the film reel on the lst projector rolls out shosanna stands ready waiting by the nd projector
the nd reel change mark pops on in the same place thats the one
throws the lever on the nd projector switching the film from projector to projector executing a perfect reel change
as shosannas theme plays on the soundtrack we watch viva montage her go through her daily chores
carry heavy film cans up the stairs empty the rat traps ect ect
the marquee reads in french german night leni refenshtal in pabst white hell of piza palu shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of letters for the marquee and
a tall ladder
her chore here obviously is to change the show on the marquee
the literary narrator comes on the soundtrack in english to operate a cinema in paris during the occupation one had two choices
ether you could show new german propaganda films produced under the watchful eye of joseph goebbels
you could have a german night in your weekly schedule and show allowed german classic films
their german night was thursday
shosanna by herself perched up high on the ladder changing the letters on the marquee
a young german soldier about the same age as shosanna walks out of the cinema
he sees the ladder with the young french girl on top and walks over
they speak french subtitled into english what starts tomorrow
shosanna looks down seeing the young german solder smiling up at her from below
a max linder festival
ummmm i always preferred linder to chaplin
except linder never made a film as good as the rid
the chase climax of the kid superb
shosanna continues working not adding to the conversation
i suppose now you could use a m a a and a x
no need i can manage
dont be ridiculous its my pleasure
he hands the french damsel the letters spelling max
i adore your cinema very much
she busies herself with the marquee letters
how does a young girl such as yourself own a cinema
do to his uniform and shosannas situation all his efforts at trying to make small talk strikes the young jewess in hiding as a gestapo interrogation
my aunt left it to me
shosanna makes no reply back
merci for hoisting a german night
i dont have a choice but your welcome
do you chose the german films yourself
then my merci stands
i love the refensthal mountain films especially pizu palu
its nice to see a french girl whos a admirer of refensthal
admire would not be the adjective i would use to describe my feelings towards fraulein refensthal
but you do admire the director
pabst dont you
thats why you included his name on the marquee
she climbs down from the ladder and faces the german private
we respect directors in our country
apparently even germans
merci for assistance private
she turns to go back inside
your not finished
ill finish in the morning
she opens the door to go inside
may i ask your name
you wish to see my papers
she hands him her excellently forged papers
thats obviously not what he meant but he takes them anyway to read her name
thats a very pretty name
are you finished with my papers
he hands them back
my name is fredrick zoller
she gives no response
its been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover
sweet dreams mademoiselle
he gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfew imposed night
she looks after him
she didnt show it but he kinda got to her
after all for any true cinema lover its hard to hate anybody who cinema mon amour
shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema late at night lighting up a cigarette
as she takes her first big drag she remembers a voice
madame mimieux the younger shosanna and the black projectionist marcel in the projection booth
shosanna lights up a cigarette and madame mimieux slaps her face hard knocking the cigarette out of her mouth
marcel quickly stamps it out on the floor
if i ever see you light up a cigarette in my cinema again ill turn you into the nazis do you understand
shosanna is shocked by this statement
and for bringing a open flame in my cinema you deserve far worse then a nazi jewish boxcar
with your thick head what do you think the highest priority of a cinema manager is
keeping this fucking place from burning down to the ground thats what
in my collection i have over mm nitrate film prints which are not only immensely flammable but highly unstable
and should they catch fire they burn three times faster then paper
if that happens
all gone cinema no more every body burned alive
if i ever see you with a open flame in my cinema again i wont turn you into the nazis ill kill you myself
and the fucking germans will give me a curfew pass
do you understand me
do you believe me
you damn well better
shosanna exhales cigarette smoke
marcel comes onto the roof
are you well
even on the roof i cant smoke a cigarette without hearing madames voice yelling at me
thats why i do it
to hear madames voice again
we both miss her
im fine darling
ill be to bed soon
marcel goes back inside shosanna smokes
shosanna sits in the back of a french bistro reading a book the saint in new york by leslie charteris drinking wine
when the young german private from the other day fredrick zoller walks in
he gets a beer then notices the french girl sitting in the back
he smiles and heads over to her
oh no not this guy again she thinks
again they speak in french subtitled into english may i join you
look fredrick you remember my name
look you seem a pleasant enough fellow merci
regardless i want you to stop pestering me
i apologize mademoiselle i wasnt trying to be a pest
i was simply trying to be friendly
i dont wish to be your friend
dont act like a infant
you know why
im more then just a uniform
not to me
if you are so desperate for a french girlfriend i suggest you try vichy
just then two other german soldiers come over obviously very impressed with fredrick
they make a fuss over him in unsubtitled german which nether shosanna or the non german speaking members of the movies audience can understand
he signs autographs for them shakes their hands and they go on their way
shosannas eyes narrow
who are you
i thought i was just a uniform
your not just a german soldier are you somebodies son
most german soldiers are somebodies son
yeah but your not just somebody
what are you hitlers nephew
he leans in across the table she leans in too and he says yes
no not really im just teasing you
she leans back annoyed
then what is it
what are you a german movie star
pfuit what does that mean not exactly
i asked if you were a movie star the answer to that question is yes or no
fredrick laughs at that line
when you said that just now you reminded me of my sister
this catches young shosanna off guard
i come from a home of six sisters
we run a family operated cinema in munich
seeing you run around your cinema reminds me of them
especially my sister helga
she raised me when our father wasnt up to the job
i admire her very much
youd like her she doesnt wear a german uniform
you were raised by helga
all my sisters im the baby but helga was the bossiest
and your mother and father
my mother died
and my father was a loser
my fathers moto if at first you dont succeed quit
the day he left good riddance
my sisters are all i need
its why i like your cinema
it makes me feel both closer to them and a little homesick at the same time
is your cinema still operatiing
whats it called
the kino haus
how has it done durring the war
actually in germany cinema attendance is up
no doubt you dont have to operate under a curfew
how often do you fill your house
pfuit not since before the war
so if you had one big engagement that would help you out
of course but thats not likely to happen
two more german soldiers and their two french dates approach the table
they ask for fredricks autograph he signs it for them
one of the french girls says in french how exciting it is to meet a real live german war hero
shosanna hears it
so thats it she thinks
so your a war hero
why didnt you tell me
everybody knows that i liked you didnt
what did you do
he takes a sip of beer
ive shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two
you bet your sweet ass that got her attention
i was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in russia
it was myself and a thousand rounds of ammo in a birds nest against three hundred soviet soldiers
whats a birds nest
a birds nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower
its a high structure offering a three hundred and sixty degree view
very advantageous for marksmen
how many russians did you kill
the first day
a hundred and fifty the second day
thirty two the third day
on the forth day they exited the city
naturally my war story received alot of attention in germany thats why they all recognize me
they call me the german sgt
maybe theyll make a film about your exploits
well thats just what joseph goebbels thought
so he did
its called nations pride and guess what they wanted me to play myself so i did
they have posters for it in kiosks all over paris
thats another reason for all the attention
nations pride is about you
nations pride is starring you
i know comical huh
not so comical
so what are you doing in paris enjoying a rest
ive been doing publicity having my picture taken with different german luminaries visiting troops that sort of thing
goebbels wants the film to premier in paris so ive been helping them in the planning
joseph is very keen on this film
hes telling anybody who will listen when nations pride is released ill be the german van johnson
shosanna wasnt falling for the young german by any stretch
however his exploits as well as his charming manner cant help but impress
but his referring to goebbels as joseph like their friends is all she needed to get on the right side of things
this young man is trouble with a capital t and she needs to stay far fucking away from him
she abruptly rises and says well good luck with your premier private
i hope all goes well for joseph and yourself
and with that she disappears
leaving the perplexed private alone
its the next day
shosanna and marcel are changing the letters on the marquee
marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet
hosanna is alone outside the little cinema perched up on her ladder
a black nazi sedan pulls up in front of the little cinema
a german major in a black gestapo uniform steps out of the back of the sedan
the driver a german private steps out as well
yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder both german and french will be subtitled into english
telling his driver in german to ask her in french ask her if this is her cinema
in french the driver asks shosanna is this your cinema
tell her to come down
come down please
she climbs down the ladder
the driver opens the back door of the sedan indicating for her to get in
i dont understand what have i done
to major she wants to know what shes done
who says shes done anything
who says youve done anything
then in her best imitation of madame mimeuxs arrogantmanner
then i demand to know what this is about and where do you propose to take me
the driver begins to translate when the gestapo major holds up his hand telling him not to bother
the major looks at the young french girl and tells her in german
get your ass in that car
no translation necessary
she climbs into the back of the car followed by the germans
the sedan takes off
the nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon paris streets
the whole ride never showing her nazi oppressor sitting beside her
we just hold on her face trying not to revel anything
the sedan stops
the car door opens and the driver offers shosanna his hand
she steps out of the car and is lead into a paris cafe by the gestapo officer
it takes the young jewess a moment or two before she realizes shes not being led to a gestapo interrogation room a railroad car or a concentration camp but to
the best table at maxims
three people and two dogs sit at it
germanys minister of propaganda and the number two man in hitlers third reich joseph goebbels his female french translator and mistress francesca mondino and young private zoller are the people
two black french poodles belonging to mademoiselle mondino sit together in another chair at the table
we join them in mid conversation they all speak german subtitled into english its only the off spring of slaves that allows america to be competitive athletically
america olympic gold can measured in negro sweat
shosanna is lead through the french eatery by the gestapo major
private zoller sees her and stands up excuses himself and greets her before she reaches the table
fredrick says in french subtitled in english good you came
i wasnt sure weather or not youd except my invitation
goebbles voice says off screen is that the young lady in question fredrick
private zoller turns in his direction takes shosanna by the arm and leads her to him
yes it is beer goebbels
emmanuelle there is somebody i want you to meet
joseph goebbels remaining seated looks up at the young french girl scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth
the excited fredrick introduces shosanna to the propaganda minister formally
emmanuelle mimieux id like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda the leader of the entire german film industry and now im a actor my boss joseph goebbels
goebbels offers up his long spider like fingers for shosanna to shake
your reputation precedes you fraulein mimieux
he looks to francesca to translate but shes just taken a big bite of terri misu
they all laugh
fredrick jumps in
and normally this is beer goebbels french interpreter mademoiselle francesca mondino
looks up at shosanna
narrators voice comes on soundtrack francesca mondino is much more then goebbels french interpreter
shes also goebbels favorite french actress to appear in his films
from one of francescas b w goebbels produced productions
francesca dressed as a french peasant girl with a young she speaks in french subtitled in to english i love you i cant help it
my country or my heart which do i betray
a subtitle appears below naming the films title francesca and goebbels having sex in her boudoir on her red velvet bed
and goebbels favorite french mistress to act in his bed
we see just a super quick shot of goebbels fucking francesca do it
fuck me fill me
looking at shosanna
and youve met the major
the gestapo officer steps up and says to fredrick in german actually i didnt introduce myself
to shosanna major deiter helistrom of the gestapo at your service mademoiselle
he clicks his heels please allow me have a seat
the gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit down
shosanna takes the hot seat
seated to her right is private zoller
to her left are the two curly pampered poodles
major helistrom pours shosanna a glass of red wine from a small craft on the table
try the wine mademoiselle its quite good
goebbels looks across the table at her
well i must say youve made quite a impression on our boy
francesca interprets goebbels german for shosanna
i must say fraulein i should be rather annoyed with you
i arrive in france and i wish to have lunch with my star
little do i know bes become the toast of paris and now he must find time for me
c aaa people wait in line hours days to see me
for the fuhrer and private zoller i wait
so finally im granted a audience with the young private and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema
so fraulein mimieux lets get down to business
private zoller interrupts heer goebbels i havent informed her yet
unless the girls a simpleton im sure shes figured it out by now after all she does operate a cinema
francesca tell her
francesca tells shosanna in french what theyre trying to tell you emmanuelle is private zoller has spent the last hour at lunch trying to convince monsieur goebbels to abandon previous
plans for private zollers film premier and change the venue to your cinema
to zoller what
i wanted to inform her
i apologize private of course you did
to francesca whats the issue
the private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself
until i ask a few questions he has nothing to inform
let the record state i have not agreed to a venue change
goebbels speaks german to shosanna you have opera boxes
more would be better
how many seats in your auditorium
three hundred and fifty
thats almost four hundred less then the ritz
fredrick jumps in
but beer goebbels thats not such a terrible thing
you said yourself you didnt want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor
with less seats it makes the event more exclusive
your not trying to fill the house their fightin g for seats
besides to hell with the french
this is a german night a german event a german celebration
this night is for you me the german military the high command their family and friends
the only people who should be allowed in the room are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen
goebbels listens silently then after a bit of a pause i see your public speaking has improved
it appears ive created a monster
a strangely persuasive monster
when the wars over politics awaits
well private though it is true im inclined to indulge you anything
i must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before i can say yes or no
to shosanna so young lady you are to close your cinema tonight and have a private screening me
what german films do you have
my cinema on german night tends to show older german classics
why not my films
i draw a older german audience in my cinema that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time
thats nonsense fraulein
us germans are looking forward not backwards
that era of german cinema is dead
the german cinema i create will not only be thee cinema of europe
but the worlds only alternative to the degenerate jewish influence of hollywood
fredrick jumps in
along with being a cinema owner emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic
he chuckles but alone
wso it would appear
unfortunately for the fraulein ive outlawed film criticism
zoller thinking fast says why dont you screen lucky kids
im sure emmanuelle hasnt seen
and its so funny ive been meaning to recommend it to her for her german night
thats a great idea lets watch lucky kids tonight
ahhh lucky kids lucky kids lucky kids
when all is said and done my most purely enjoyable production
not only that i wouldnt be surprised if sixty years from now its lucky kids that im the most remembered for
i know it doesnt seem like it now but mark my words
very well ill have a print sent over to the fraulein
well screen lucky kids tonight
as francesca interprets this for shosanna
the empty chair next to the young jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a grey s
ah landa your here this is the young lady in question
officer sits down and its our old friend from the first scene col hans landa
shosanna this pol hans landa of the ss
hell be running security for the premier
a bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes
but if she gives any indication of this her war story ends here
officer that murdered her family takes her hand and kisses it saying in perfect french charmed mademoiselle
better known as the jew hunter
the table laughs
oh francesca what was that funny thing the fuhrer said about hans
you know you were there it was a funny thing the fuhrer said about hans
something about a pig
francescas memory is jogged
oh yes of course
she repeats it by whispering it in goebbels ear
oh yes of course thats it
so the fuhrer said he wouldnt be surprised if hans werent rooting out jews like a truffle pig from the play pen
thats what we need pigs that can root out jews
who needs pigs when you have me
big hearty laugh around the table
do you have a engagement tonight
well as a matter of fact i do break it
were all going to the frauleins cinema tonight to view lucky kids
then reich ministers companion mademoiselle mondino and now i must get reich minister goebbels to his next appointment
french slave driver
they all chuckle
everybody begins to stand up from the table
francesca gathers the stupid dogs
as col landa stands he says actually in my role as security chief of this joyous german occasion im afraid i must have a word with mademoiselle mimieux
mademoiselle mimieux eyes go to private zoller who responds
what sort of discussion
that sounded suspiciously like a private questioning the order of a colonel
or am i just being sensitive
nothing could be further from the truth colonel
your authority is beyond question
but your reputation does proceed you
should mademoiselle mimieux or myself be concerned
hans the boy means no harm hes simply smitten
and hes correct
your reputation does proceed you
laughter all around
the reich minister and his axis entourage make their way to front of the cafe with the two dumb dogs on a leash leading the way
no need for concern you two
as security chief i simply need to have a chat with the possible new venues property owner
i was just hoping to escort mademoiselle mimieux back to her cinema
you can eat ice cream and walk along the sienne another time
right now allow col landa to do his job
everybody saystheir farewells
col landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of maxims
the fluency and poetic proficiency of the s
jew hunters french revels to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at french with monsieur lapadite in the films first scene was simply a interrogation technique
they speak french subtitled into english have you tried the strudel here
its not so terrible
so how is it the young private and yourself came to be acquainted
shes about to answer when a waiter approaches
yes two strudels one for myself and one for the mademoiselle
a cup of espresso with a container of
steamed milk on the side
for the mademoiselle a glass of milk
grew up on a dairy farm and the last time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her entire family his ordering her milk is to say
the key to col landas power and or charm depending on the side ones on lies in his ability to convince you hes privy to your secrets
so mademoiselle you were beginning to explain
up untill a couple of days ago i had no knowledge of private zoller or his exploits
to me the private was simply just a patron of my cinema
we spoke a few times but mademoiselle let me interrupt you
this is a simple formality no reason for you to feel anxious
the colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter i apologize i forgot to order the cream fresh
refuring to the apple pie wait for the cream
back to so emmanuelle may i call you emmanuelle
so emmanuelle explain to me how does it happen that a young lady such as your self comes to own a cinema
the waiter returns applying cream fresh to the two strudels
colonel looks across the table at his companion picking up his fork he says after you
shosanna takes aaaa whip creamy bite of strudel landa follows her lead
of pie success
shosanna mouth full of pie indicates she approves
like i said not so terrible
back to so you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership
the cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle col landa removes alittle black book from his pocket
what is there names
jean pierre and ada mimieux
he records the names in his little book
where are they now
my uncle was killed during blitzkrieg
aunt ada passed away from fever last spring
its come to my attention you have a negro in your employ is that true
yes hes a frenchman
his name is marcel
he worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema
hes the only other one who works with me
is he any good
actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them
can you operate the projectors
of course i can
knowing the reich minister as i do im quite positive he wouldnt want the success or failure of his illustrious evening dependent on the prowess of a negro
so if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue talented no doubt as your negro may be you will operate the projectors
is that exceptable
as if she has any say
col landa takes another bite of strudel shosanna follows suit
so it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you
private zollers feelings for me arent of a romantic nature
colonel his feelings are not romantic
i remind him of his sister
that doesnt mean his feelings arent romantic
i remind him of his sister who raised him
its sounding more and more romantic by the minute
landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case with a s
logo on it
removing on of the fags he lights it up with a fancy s
he offers one to shosanna
no thank you
do you smoke
then i insist you must take one
there not french there german
i hope your not nationalist about your tobacco to me french cigarettes are a sin against nicotine
she takes one but makes no move to light it
he inhales deep and says i did have some thing else i wanted to ask you but right now for the life of me i cant remember what it is
oh well must not of been important
col landa stands up throws some french francs on the table puts on his grey s
cap touches his finger to his visor saluting shosanna and saying till tonight
and with that hes gone
shosanna breaths a sigh of relief
the camera begins to slowly lower from a medium cu to her feet ankles and floor
we see her shoes are in a puddle of urine
during her conversation and strudel with the man that exterminated her entire family shosanna pissed herself
she drops the german cigarette in to the piss puddle by her feet
the silver screen on screen is the german screwball comedy lucky kids
we hear off screen laughter at the on screen aryan antics
watching the screen basking in his own toxic genius
laughing at the comedy hand covering her mouth
pantingly watching the screen
smiling smoking a french cigarette
smoking his calabash amused
truly enjoying himself
watching the screen
the literary narrator comes on the soundtrack
while shosanna sits there pretending to be amused by the aryan antics of goebbels frank capra copy lucky kids a thought suddenly comes to her
we see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes
what if tonight accidently the cinema burned down
the third reich would lose its minister of propaganda its national hero and its top jew hunter all in one fell swoop
she chuckles at the thought though it looks like shes laughing at the german comedy
the end card for lucky kids is projected
the nazi rouges gallery and shosanna applaud the film
the lights go up
goebbels excepts congratulations as they stand and begin to file out into the lobby
the screening of lucky kids was a complete success
and heer goebbels conceded to have the venue changed to shosannas cinema
not only that in a moment of inspiration heer goebbels had a idea
goebbels speaks german and francesca translates i must say i appreciate the modesty of this auditorium
your cinema has real respect almost church like
not to say we couldnt spruce the place up a bit
in versailles theres a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary
were going to get it and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof
also i want to go to louvre pick up a few greek nudes and just scatter them about the lobby
we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening
the chandelier being removed from the ceiling of versailles
greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the louvre
a truck driving through the french countryside with the enormous crystal chandelier in the back
the lobby of shosannas cinema pimped out in nazi iconography
workers buzz around decorating
the greek statues are moved into place
we see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge heavy and twinkingly fragile chandelier in shosannas auditorium which now resembles something out of one of tinto brasss italian
b movie rip offs of viscontis the damned
watches all this from a opera box she shakes her head in disbelief
in the lobby post screening of lucky rids shes soundlessly escorting them to the door as they make their goodbyes
as they left the little french cinema that night all the germans were very happy
we see private zoller hanging back so he
can say goodbye
none more so then private zoller
she closes the door on him
watching the nazis walk into the paris night
their shadows for a moment onawall look like grotesque nazi charcthers
the nazis are gone
marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby looking down at shosanna
they speak in french subtitled into english what the fuck are we suppose to do
it looks like were suppose to have a nazi premier
like i said what the fuck are we suppose to do
well i need to speak with you about that
about these hun swine commandeering our cinema
what about it
she slowly walks up the stairs to marcel
she makes him part his legs and sits on the lower step between his legs
her back up against his chest his arms around her shoulders
shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with marcel
well when i was watching the bosch said in capra corn abomination back to i got a idea
im confused what are we talking about
filling the cinema with nazis and their whores and burning it down to the ground
im not talking about that your talking about that
no were talking about that right now
if we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves we can burn it down by ourselves
shosanna no marcel just for sake of argument if we wanted to burn down the cinema for any number of reasons you and i could physically accomplish that no
oui shosanna we could do that
and with madame mimieuxs nitrate film print collection we wouldnt even need explosives would we
you mean we wouldnt need any more explosives
oui thats exactly what i mean
she begins kissing his hands
i am going to burn down the cinema on nazi night
one of his fingers probes her mouth
and if im going to burn down the cinema which i am we both know your not going to let me do it by myself
the back of her head presses up hard against him as his hand both caresses and grips her lovely neck
because you love me
and i love you
and your the only person on this earth i can trust
she then twists around so shes straddling him
they are now face to face
but thats not all were going to do
does the filmmaking equipment it the attic still work
i know the film camera does
how about the sound recorder
quite well actually
i recorded a new guitarist i met in a cafe last week
it works superb
why do we need filmmaking equipment
because marcel my sweet were going to make a film
just for the nazis
a young military attache opens the sliding double doors that serve as a entrance to the room
right this way lieutenant
a snappy handsome british lieutenant in dress browns steps inside the room
this officer who has been mixing it up with the gerrys since the late thirties is named lt
a young george sanders type the saint and private affairs of bel ami years
upon entering the room lt
hicox is gobsmacked
standing before him is legendary military mastermind general ed fenech a older george sanders type village of the dammed
but in the back of the room sitting behind a piano smoking his ever present cigar is the unmistakable bulk of winston churchell
archie hicox reporting sir
salutes back general ed fenech at ease hicox
hicoxs eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano whos scrutinizing him behind his cigar
however the man behind the cigar makes no gesture and the general makes no acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room
hicox knows enough to mean if churchell isnt introduced he aint there
if you offered me a scotch and plane water i could drink a scotch and plain water
that a boy lieutenant
make it yourself like a good chap will you
bars in the globe
hicox heads over to the bar globe
something for yourself sir
no junk in it
the lieutenant moves over to the columbus style globe bar and busies himself mixing spirits playing bartender chappy
fenech eyeing the lieutenants file
it says here youve run three undercover commando operations in germany and german occupied territories
frankfaurt holland and norway to be exact
back to them mixing drinks he says extraordinary people the norwegians
it says here you speak german fluently
like a katzenjammer kid
and your occupation before the war
his back still to us as he bartends
im a film critic
list your accomplishments
well sir such as they are i write reviews and articles for a publication called films and filmmakers
as well as our sister publication
whats that called
flickers bi monthly
and ive had two books published
dont be modest lieutenant what are their titles
the first book was called art of the eyes the heart and the mind a study of german cinema in the twenties
and the second one was called
he turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the generals whiskey no junk
he finishes what he was saying as he walks toward the general handing him his drink
twenty four frame da vinci
its a subtexual film criticism study of the work of german director g
what should we drink to sir
thinking for a moment down with hitler
all the way down sir
are you familiar with german cinema under the third reich
obviously i havent seen any of the films made in the last three years but i am familiar with it
explain it to me
this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the german film industry under the third reich
explain to me ufa under goebbels
goebbels considers the films hes making to be the beginning of a new era in german cinema
a alternative to what he considers the jewish german intellectual cinema of the twenties
and the jewish controlled dogma of hollywood
bellowing from the back of the room hows he doing
frightfully sorry sir once again
you say he wants to take on the jews at their own game
compared to say louis b
hows he doing
quite well actually
since goebbels has taken over film attendance has steadily risen in germany over the last eight years
but louis b
mayer wouldnt be goebbels proper opposite number
i believe goebbels sees himself closer to david o
fenech looks to the prime minister
with a puff of cigar smoke churchell says brief him
bicox at this point in time id like to brief you on operation kino
three days from now joseph goebbels is throwing a gala premier of one of his new movies in paris
what film sir
the general has to resort to peeking at his file
the motion pictures called nations pride
oh you mean the film about private zoller
we dont have any intelligence on exactly what the film that night will be about
but its called nations pride
i can tell you what its about its about private fredrick zoller
hes the german sgt
fenech cant help suppress a smile they have the right man
in attendance at this joyous germatic occasion will be goebbels gerring boorman and most of the german high command including all high ranking officers of both the s
and the gestapo
as well as luminaries of the nazi propaganda film industry
the master race at play aye
basically we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
the objective of operation kino
blow up the basket
reciting a a poem
and like the snows of yesteryear gone from this earth
jolly good sir
an american secret service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist
the germans call them the basterds
the basterds never heard of them
whole point of the secret service old boy you not hearing of them
but the gerrys have heard of them because these yanks have been them the devil
their leader is a chap named lt
the germans call him aldo the apache
why do they call him that
best guess is because he removes the scalps of the nazi dead
he runs his finger along his hairline
like a red injun
rather gruesome sounding little dicky bird isnt he
no doubt the whole lot a bunch a nutters
but youve heard the expression it takes a thief
general fenech continues on with his exposition moving over to a military map
youll be dropped into france about twenty four kilometers outside of paris
the basterds will be waiting for you
first thing you go to a little village called nadine
he points it out on the map apparently the gerrys never go there
in nadine theres a tavern called la louisiane youll rendez vous with our double agent and shell take it from there
shes the one whos going to get you in the premiere
it will be you her and two german born members of the basterds
shes also made all the other arrangements your going to need
how will i know her
i suspect that wont be too much trouble for you
your contact is bridget von hammersmark
bridget von hammersmark
the german movie star is working for england
for the last two years now
one could even say operation kino was her brainchild
in the back of the room the bulldog barks extraordinary women
youll go to the premiere as her escort lucky devil
shell also have the premiere tickets for the other two
got the gist
i think so sir
paris when it sizzles
the three british bulldogs laugh
shosanna and marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema literally making a movie
marcel is behind a old even then bolex mm movie camera positioned low looking up
shosanna the camera subject stands on boxes looking down into it
a old timey microphone is positioned out of frame
as they always do and always will they speak french subtitled into you know what
we need a sync mark
what is a sync mark
a action and noise put together so we can sync up the picture and sound
how do we do that
clap your hands
in frame imbecile
she claps her hands in front of her face
shosanna takes a deep breath then ready
big diffrence this time its in color
but how do we get it developed
only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage
how do we get a mm print with a soundtrack
do you know one person who can do both things
of course gaspar very nice man took care of all the experimental filmmakers
but nobody in their right mind would strike a print of what your talking about
if the nazis found out their life wouldnt be worth this
he snaps his fingers
in a wolf fight you ether eat the wolf or the wolf eats you
if were going to obliterate the nazis we have to use their tactics
what does that mean
we find somebody who can develop and process a mm print
and we make them do it or we kill them
once we tell them what we want to do if they refuse we have to kill them anyway or theyll turn us in
would you do that
snaps her fingers
a old mom and pop film processing lab circa the thirties
late late at night
gaspar the fatherly figure of all the experimental french filmmakers in the decade before german rule takes a savage beating at the hands of his friend marcel
shosanna watches pitiless
bring that fucker over here
put his head down on that table
marcel holds his arm behind him as he forces his head flat against the table top
shosanna brings a hatchet down deep into the table just by his face
you ether do what the fuck we tell you to or ill bury this axe in your collaborating skull
im not a collaborator
then prove it
or does your manhood go no deeper then standing to piss
marcel does his wife and children know you
then after we kill this dog for germans well go and silence them
she lifts up the hatchet raises it high
prepare to die collaborator fucker
hands the couple a small silver can of mm film
outside the shop window its morning
we see the five heavy silver film cans of fredrick zollers life story nations pride clearly marked on the floor of the projection booth
the can for reel is open and empty
shosannas at the editing bench reel is up on the rewinds
shosanna splices her and marcels footage into reel of fredricks film
rewinds it puts it back in the can and puts a piece of red tape on reel can
she walks out of the booth turning off the lights behind her plunging the screen into darkness
we see a small basement tavern with a old rustic sign out front that reads la louisiane
the village of two shot lt
hicox and lt
aldo raine aldo is dressed like a french civilian
hicox is dressed in a german grey s
they look out of a window in a apartment in the village of nadine overlooking the tavern
you didnt say the goddamn rendez vous was in a fuckin basement
i didnt know
you said it was in a tavern
it is a tavern
yeah in a basement
you know fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties number one being your fighting in a basement
wilhelm wicki joins the shot dressed in a german s
what if we go in there and shes not even there
dont worry shes a british spy shell make the rendez vous
we see the other basterds dressed in french civilian clothes are in the room as well they are donowitz hirschberg and utivich
and in the back of the room dressed in the grey uniform of a s
lieutenant hugo stiglitz sits off by himself sharpening his s
dagger on his leather belt looped around his boot
anybody not in the scene from the basterds opening chapter is dead
hicox watches stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room sharpens his dagger menacingly
stiglitz is fucking werid
hicox approaches stiglitz
thats right sir
he continues bringing the blades edge up then down on the leather strap
i hear your pretty good with that
meaning the blade
stiglitz doesnt answer
you know were not looking for trouble right now
were simply making contact with our agent
should be uneventful
however on the off chance im wrong and things prove eventful
i need to know we can all remain calm
the renegade gerry sergeant stops his blades progress and looks up at the limy lieutenant
i dont look calm to you
well now you put it like that i guess you do
he turns his attention back to his blade
hicox moves over to aldo and asks him privately this gerry of yours stiglitz
not exactly the loquacious type is he
aldo just looks at him
is that the kinds man you need the loquacious type
fair point lieutenant
so yall git in trouble in there what are we suppose to do
make bets on how it all comes out
if we get into trouble we can handle it
but if trouble does happen we need you to make damn sure no germans or french for matter escape from that basement
if frau von hammersmarks cover is compromised the mission is kaput
speaking of frau von hammersmark whos idea was it for the death trap redez vous
she chose the spot
well isnt that just dandy
look shes not a military strategist
shes just a actress
ya dont got to be stonewall jackson to know you dont want to fight in a basement
she wasnt picking a place to fight
she was picking a place isolated and without germans
lieutenant i hate to be contrary but i got me a nazi pissin on louisianna two oclock
they move to the window and sure enough one lone nazi private relieves himself against the side wall
bicox this was definitely not the plan
donowitz chides him so what do you think your fraulein von hammer obviously i dont know sgt
the british officer watches the german soldier whos not suppose to be there
when hugo stiglitz joins him at the window
stiglitz looks down at the urinating nazi s
dagger in hand
if were going lets go
he sheaths the dagger
the german pissing private sloppily finishes his task
craming his noodle back in his pants he descends the stairs that lead him back into the basement tavern
we follow him
inside the basement tavern la louisiane
it has a very low hanging basement ceiling
a old looking wood bar off to the right
and the only other space in the little tavern is taken up by two large at least in here tables which take up both halfs of the room
and despite rumors to the contrary one of the two tables is completely filled with drunken celebrating nazi enlisted men of which our urinating friend is one of five
one german master sgt one female german sgt a powerfully built stocky type and three male german privates
the five nazis are sitting around the table drinking and playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of the hour ufa diva bridget von hammersmark
dressed to the nines in a chic forties style womens suit complete with fedora
the game their playing consists of each player having a card with the name of a famous person real or imaginary stuck to their forehead
the player doesnt know what name is on their forehead
so they ask the others questions to figure out who they are
the five germans five cards read master sgt pola negri winnetou
and bridget von hammersmark who wears her card in the brim of her fedora has genghis khan
its german winnetou turn to ask questions
the dialogue will be in german and subtitled into english
also while some dialogue will be written for the german soldiers it will be mostly made up from the exuberance of their game playing and celebrating
okay im not german
am i american
the whole table bursts out laughing
yes you arel well not really
what do you mean not really
of course he is
well if hes so american how come hes never been translated into english
hes not american
hes suppose to be american but hes not a american creation
in fact hes something very different
okay im a fictional literary character from the past im american and thats controversial
no its not controversial
the nationally of the author has nothing to do with the nationally of the character
the character is the character
hamlets not british hes danish
so yes this character was born in america
well im glad thats settled
if i had a wife would she be called a squaw
hes got it
the table laughs
the table is my bloodbrother old shatterhand
the table yes
did karl may write me
the table yes
in the background we see our three counterfeit german officers hicox wicki and stiglitz enter the basement tavern
see the five german soldiers but their too far away for us the audience to read their face
no doubt their less then happy
fraulein von hammersmark sees them as well
without getting up she waves to them
hello my lovelies i will join you in moments
im finishing up a game with my five new friends here
no hurry frau von hammersmark
take your time enjoy yourself
to winnetou so who are you
i am winnetou chief of the apaches
the table cheers and applaud the apache chief as he takes the card off his forehead
the other four german soldiers drink down there beer part of the game
bridget von hammersmark knock backs her champagne
frau von hammersmark when your friends came in did you realize you did a double take like in the movies
no i wasnt aware of that at all
they must be second nature to you now
did they teach you how to do a double take in the movies
well yes they did but its not really that difficult
do one for us
the tableheartily agrees
bridget looks directly at the master sgt and does a perfect and perfectly funny double take
the table loves it
my turn i want to try
mata hari looks directly at beethoven and does a double take
i want to try
soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes
watch the table do dueling double takes
obviously they dont understand
bridget von hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the table
she removes the card stuck in her fedora looking at the name gengus khaun for the first time
i would never of gotten that
she walks over and joins the masquerading germans table the gentlemen rise
she greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss as if she knows them well
they all take a seat
the two basterds and one brit drink whiskey
the taverns proprietor a older big bellyed frenchman named earl comes over to the table and pours more champagne into bridgets champagne glass
he leaves returning back behind the bar with the young french barmaid the only other person in the establishment
obviously they speak german subtitled into english i thought this place was suppose to have more french then germans
normally thats true
the sgt over theres wife just had a baby
his commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate
we should leave
f no we should stay
for one drink at least
ive been waiting for you in a bar it would look strange if we left before we had a drink
shes right just be calm and enjoy your booze
the french barmaid has taken bridgets place in the rousing rowdy game
she tells them her person must be french or she wont know them
winnetou thinks for a moment then writes a name on a card
the barmaid puts it on her forehead it says the germans all laugh
theres been some new developments
the cinema venue has changed
no one knows
but that in itself shouldnt be a problem
the cinema its been changed to is considerably smaller then the ritz
so whatever materials you brought for the ritz should be doubly effective here
now this next piece of information is colossal try not to over react
the fubrer will be attending tomorrow
hugo stiglitz does a spit take
bridgets eyes bore holes in him
they see hugo do the spit take and burst out laughing
keeping it up they begin to do dueling spit takes like they did dueling double takes earlier
needless to say they all get wet
to hicox youll be going as ernst schuller
youll say your a associate producer on riefenstahls tiefland
its the one german production not under goebbels control and leni wouldnt be caught dead at a goebbels film affair
pola negri drinks his beer as he looks over dreamily at bridget von hammersmark at the other table
we see in bridget continues to brief hicox on his identity
the german master sgt stand up from his table and head toward fraulein von bammersmark
the films gone through many delays and lenis heath is deteriorating so if you have to speak
hicox seeing the german master sgt approach signals for her to cool it
frau von hammersmark i was just thinking could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday
id love to wilhelm
to the table this handsome happy sgt just became a father today
the pretend officers offer congratulations to the sgt
the german master sgt clicks his heels and bows before his superior officers
thank you heil hitler
he raises his hand
as do the seated phony officers heil hitler
as she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch
so wilhelm do you know the name of this progeny yet
i most certainly do fraulein
his name is maximilian
even the slightly psychotic stiglitz likes this german sgt
wonderful name sgt
thank you lieutenant
when hes old enough to ride a bicycle i will buy him a blue one
and i will paint on the side the blue max
he thrusts out his beer stein for the officers to cheers
bridget finishes signing her autograph with a big flourish
there you go
but wait im not finished yet
she reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick
applies some ruby red color to her lips and then kisses the napkin leaving a big red lip print
then hands the treasured item to the young father
nothing but the best for little maximilian
thank you fraulein thank you
max may not know who you are now
but he will
i will show him all of your movies
he will grow up with your films and this napkin on his wall
then to the whole tavern
i purpose a toast to the greatest actress in germany
there is no dietrich there is no riefenstahl only von hammersmark
the whole room toasts
this would be a good time for the german sgt to go back to his table and his men
and he almost does
since he is drunk and star struck he out wears his welcome
so frau von hammersmark what brings you to france
feeling any good nazi officers patience would of been exhausted long ago lt
hicox butts in
none of your business sgt
you might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein with your drunken boorish behavior but you have wore out your welcome with me
the table of game playing soldiers hear this and get quiet
might i remind you sgt
your a enlisted man
this is a officers table
i suggest you stop pestering the fraulein and rejoin your table
the german master sgt
looks quizzically at the officer
excuse me capt but your accent is is very unusual
the whole room pauses for different reasons
where are you from
a silent moment passes between the two tables then the two german born impostors spring into action
you must be ether drunk or mad to speak to a superior officer with such impertinentness
stiglitz stands and yells to the other table im making you
pointing at and you
pointing at edgar wallace responsible for him
pointing at sgt
pola i suggest you take hold of your friend or hell spend maxs first birthday in jail for public drunkenness
the germans spring up and take hold of sgt
a german voice rings out then might i inquire
the five known germans move aside reveling the unknown german in the room unseen till now our old friend from before major deiter hellstrom of the gestapo
the major stands from the little table he was sitting at
like the young newly christened father i too have a acute ear for accents
and like him i too find yours odd
from where do you hail capt
wicki jumps in major this is highly inappr t wasnt speaking to you lt
saltzberg turning to or you ether lt
looking at i was speaking to capt i dont know what
the gestapo major is now standing beside sgt
pola before the impostors table
hicox calmly explains his origin
i was born in the village that rests in the shadow of piz palu
in that village we all speak like this
have you seen the riefenstahl film
f q s then you saw me
you remember the skiing torch scene
yes i do
in that scene was myself my father my sister and my two brothers
my brother is so handsome the director pabst gave him a close up
as bridget von hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory cigarette holder which hicox as if on cue lights for her she says major if my word means anything i
can vouch for everything the young capt has just said
he does hail from the bottom of piz palu he was in the film and his brother is far more handsome then he
the impostors laugh
so does the gestapo major
he turns to the sgt
you should rejoin your friends
which the young sgt is more then happy to do
that table begins playing there game again
major hellstrom the highest ranking officer in the room bows graciously to the female german celebrity
may i join you
by all means major
the gestapo major sits at the table opposite lt
hicox and wicki
the french barmaid brings over the majors beer stein
so thats the source of your bazaar accent
so what are you doing here capt
aside from having a drink with the lovely fraulein
well that pleasure requires no explanation
chuckle i mean in country
your obviously not stationed in france or id know who you are
lt aaa i
i cox you know every german in france
well there in lies the problem
we never claimed to be worth knowing
chuckling as he asks all levity aside what are you doing in france
attending goebbels film premiere as the frauleins escort
your the frauleins escort
somebody has to carry the lighter
the captain is my date but all three are my guests
were old friends major who go back along time
longer then a actress would care to admit
well in that case let me raise a glass to the three luckiest men in the room
ill drink to that
they continue to have alot of fun playing their game
i must say that game their playing looks like a good bit of fun
i didnt join them because your quite right capt officers and enlisted men shouldnt fraternize
but seeing as were all officers here bowing to and sophisticated lady friends of officers
what say we play the game
hicox begins to refuse when bridget feeling she knows better interrupts him okay one game
the major borrows five cards from the other table and lays them out in front of bridget and the officers
so the object of the game is to write the name of a famous person on your card
real or fictitious doesnt matter
for instance you could write confucius or fu manchu
he snaps his eric more pens
back to players and they must be famous
no aunt ingas
when you finish writing put the card face down on the table and move it to the person to your left
the person to your right will move their card in front of you
you pick up the card without looking at it lick the back and stick it on your forehead like so
and in ten yes or no questions you must guess who you are
as major hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game the camera pans off him and begins slowly zooming into stiglitz
the majors dialogue begins to fade away
untill were in a spaghetti western flashback
which is red filtered footage of hugo being savagely whipped by somebody wearing a gestapo uniform superimposed over his close up
the flashback disappears
its driving stiglitz crazy being this close to a gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into it
the majors voice comes back on the soundtrack
so lets give it a try shall we
everybody write your names
the five players write their names
then move their cards to the right
everybody sticks their cards on their forehead
is is is is is ill start give you the idea
am i german
am i a american
they laugh but then wicki says wait a minute he goes to
dont be ridiculous obviously he wasnt born in america
i visited america aye
the table says yes
was this vist
not for you
my native land is it what one would call exotic
the table confers and decides yes it is exotic
that could be ether a reference to the jungle or the orient
im going to let my first instinct take over and ask am i from the jungle
the tablesays yes you are
now gentlemen around this time you could ask weather your real or fictitious
i however think thats too easy so i wont ask that yet
okay my native land is the jungle
i visited america but my visit was not fortuitous to me but the implication is that it was to somebody else
when i went from the jungle to america
did i go by boat
did i go against my will
on this boat ride
was i in chains
when i arrived in america
was i displayed in chains
am i the story of the negro in america
the table says no
well then i must be king kong
be throws the card on the table
they applaud him
nov since i answered correctly you all need to finnish your drinks
the three counterfeit nazis knock back their whiskey
now whos next
major i dont mean to be rude
but the four of us are very good friends
and the four of us havent seen each other in quite a while
major im afraid you are intruding
i beg to differ capt
its only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion that i become a intruder
how about it fraulein
am i intruding
of course not major
i didnt think so
its simply the young capt is immune to my charms
the tables not sure what to do is this a confrontation
then the major laughs
im just joking of course im intruding
allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen and i will bid you and the fraulein adieu
leaning in eric has a bottle of thirty three year old single malt scotch whisky from the scottish highlands
what do you say gentlemen
your most gracious sir
eric the thirty three and new glasses
you dont want to contaminate the thirty three with the swill you were drinking
how many glasses
i like scotch scotch doesnt like me
ill stay with bubbly
bicox hold up three fingers pinky to index to eric the owner
eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle pouring for the three soldiers
major helistrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts to a thousand year reich
they all mutter a thousand year reich and toast glasses
the gestapo major puts down his beer stein and then we hear a click under the table
did you hear that
thats the sound of my luger pointed right at your testicles
q aaa why do you have a luger pointed at my testicles
because youve just given yourself away capt
your no more german then that scotch
well major major shut up slut
to hicox you were saying
i was saying that makes two of us
ive had a gun pointed at your balls since you sat down
that makes three of us
we see all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches
as well as bridgets legs right besides the nazi majors
her pretty gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire
and at this range im a real fredrick zoller
hugo alsobrings out his dagger and sitcks it in the table top
looks like we have a bit of a sticky situation here
whats going to happen major is your going to stand up and walk out that door with us
no no no no no no i dont think so

oh bridget your concern for german troops gets me pointing at his heart right here

hicox picks up his thirty three year old single malt scotch and says well if this is it old boy i hope you dont mind if i go out speaking
by all means capt
the english film critic commando picks up the thirty three the nazi major bought him and says theres a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good scotch
and seeing as i might be rapping on the door momentarily
he downs the stuff
to the nazi i must say damn good stuff sir
he puts the glass down
now about this pickle we find ourselfs in
it would appear theres only thing left for you to do
and what would that be
say auf wiedersehen to your balls
fires into hellstroms balls
as does hicox hitting not only hellstrom but bridget as well
fires into hicoxs balls and knee caps
then jumps over the table and begins stabbing hellstrom with the hicox falls to the floor
bridget falls to the floor
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and begins firing across at the germans at the table who unaware were still playing the game
is shot in the back before he even knew what was happening
edgar wallace and the french barmaid are both shot by wicki
falls to the floor in the confusion
beethoven and stiglitz bring their guns toward each other and fire
they both take and give each other so many bullets its almost romantic when they collapse dead on the floor
wicki and hata hari both on there atmata aari is hit three tim atally g comes the a chine gunn whole thehroom bwipi ngeric
the shooting stops
the smoke caused by the gunfire
starts to dissipate
the only one in the room left alive is the young german sgt with the machine gunn
we hear the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement entrance
the door opens
the german sgt sends fifty bullets in the doors direction
no one goes through it
what we have here is a rabbit hole like situation
no one inside is getting out no one outside is getting in
the young german sgt yells in english to the outside you outside

aldos voice yells down the hole were americans what are you

wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice
on the floor with a bullet in her bloody leg lies the alive bridget von hammersmark
the german sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at the german celebrity with hate in his eyes

hirschberg carrying fraulein von hammersmark and aldo emerge from the bowels of the basement
bridget points at a fancy black sedan telling them its hers
aldo hirschberg bridget donowitz and utivich pile in and take off
note in this entire scene no french spoken will be subtitled
a old man lies asleep under the covers of his blankets in his bed in his bedroom
off screen the sound of a door being kicked open
the sound of what sounds like eight dogs barking
and the sound of feet running towards us
his bedroom door is thrown open and sgt
donowitz rushes in grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a automatic to his head
head shocking donny slams the
hard against the old mans scarring and bringing the old gent to attention
are you a fucking doctor
he nods his head yes
donny yanks drags the old man out of bed in his almost comical nightshirt which makes him cuter thus the brutality against him hurts more towards the door
into a doctors examining room built into a french country house with a examining table and medical instruments
however its obviously the medical examining room of a veterinarian
along the walls are different cages with eight excited barking dogs in it
the soldiers are putting the shot in the leg bleeding and in excruciating pain bridget on the examining table
donny still holding on to the old man points in the girls direction
shes been shot
pointing at his leg in leg
no no no i dont speak english
donny jams the barrel of his
into the thigh of the old man
bang bang in the leg understand
the old man nods his head yes
but im a veterinarian
i take care of animals
bridget screams from the table
hes a fucking veterinarian you imbecile
its still a doctor
if he can get a bullet out of a cow he can get a bullet outta you
right now we just need morphine
donny yells at the old man morphine
we need morphine
the old man tries to explain in french that hes not a human doctor
donny takes the
and shoots one of the dogs in the cages
donny screams at the old man he shoots another dog
the old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine
the body of gestapo major deiter hellstrom dead on the floor
were back in the basement tavern
colonel hans landa stands over the corpse
he moves over to the next corpse a smile breaks out on his face
he says in german subtitled into english ahhh hugo youve moved up in the world i see
and with your record of insubordination
a nazi soldier named herrman joins the s
and that ones
pointing at name is weiheim wicki
bets austrian born jew who immigrated to the united states when things began turning sour for the israelites
they are the two german born members of the basterds
theyve been known to don german uniforms to ambush squads
three nazi soldiers walking towards a company of other german soldiers
the three soldiers backs are to us
dried bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms
the sgt of the german company yells to the trio what brings you all the way out here
the trio mow down the german company with their machine gunns
but that doesnt look like this
this is odd
looking down he sees something
bending down he examines fraulein von hammersmarks two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor
one shoe is covered in blood
the other while blood speckled is fairly clean
picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand
it would appear somebodies missing
a off screen soldiers voice cries out col this ones still alive
we follow hans to the spot on the floor where sgt
hes shot in the chest but it looks like maxs daddy is still alive
bridget on the examining table post morphine shot
the other basterds in the room watch aldo interrogate the german lady
now fore we yank that slug outta ya you need to answer a few questions few questions about what
about i got three men dead back there and why dont you try tellin us what the fuck happened
the british officer blew his german act and a gestapo major saw it
fore we get into who shot john why did you invite my men to a rendez vous in a basement with a bunch of nazis
i can see since you didnt see what happened inside the nazis being there must look odd
yeah we gotta word for that kinda odd in english its called suspicious
dont let your imagination get the better of you lieutenant
you met the sergeant willi
he had a baby tonight
his commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to celebrate
the germans being there was just a tragic coincidence
aldo thinks for a moment
okay ill buy that
he was ether there with his men waiting for us or he was there celebrating his sons birthday he wasnt doin both
how did the shootin start
the english man gave himself away
how did he do that
he ordered three glasses
she holds up three fingers index to pinky
we order three glasses
she holds up three fingers thumb to index
thats the german three
the other is odd
germans would and did notice it
okay lets pretend there were no germans and everything went exactly the way it was suppose to
what would of been the next step
to get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would of been suicide
but going as members of the german film industry they wear tuxedos and blend in with everybody else
i arranged a tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
how did you intend to get them into the premiere
hand me my purse
and she opens it and takes out three tickets to the film premiere
hicox was going as my escort
the other two were going as a german cameraman and his assistant
can you still get us in that premiere
can you speak german better then your friends no
have i been shot yes
i dont see me tripping the light fantastique up the red carpet any time soon
least of all by tomorrow night
however theres something you dont know
theres been two recent developments regarding operation kino
one the venue has been changed from the ritz to a much smaller venue
enormous changes at the last minute
thats not very germatic
why the hell is goebbels doin stuff so damn peculiar
it probably has something to do with the second development
in a private dinning room in germany the fuhrer aka adolph hitler aka adolph shicklegroover aka the bohemian corporal having dinner with goebbels only a few short days ago
the fuhrer ive been rethinking my position in regards to your paris premiere of nations pride
as the weeks have gone on and the americans are on the beach i do find myself thinking more and more about this private zoller
this boy has done something tremendous for us
and im beginning to think my participation in this event could be meaningful
the fuhrers attending the premiere
donny breaks the teams silence what
when the hell did this happen
the venue change two weeks ago
the fuhrers attendance four days ago
and how come london dont know nothing about that
we need to get something straight once and for all
everything london knows it learned from me
if i dont know london doesnt know
so now this is me informing you hitlers coming to paris
aldo stands up from the chair pacing as he takes in this new information
what are you thinking
im thinking getting a wack at plantin ole uncle adolph makes this a horse of a different color
whats that suppose to mean
it means your gettin us in that premiere
im going to probably end up losing this leg bye bye acting career fun while it lasted
how do you expect me to walk up a red carpet
the doggie docs gonna dig that slug outta your gam
then hes gonna wrap it up in a cast and you gotta good how i broke my leg mountain climbing story
thats german aint it
yall like climbin mountains dontch
i like smoking drinking and ordering in restaurants but i see your point
we fill ya up with morphine till its comin out ya ears
then just limp your little ass up that rouge car pet
when the nazis put me up against a wall it wont hurt so much
changing tone i know this is a silly question before i ask it but can you americans speak any other language then english
other then yiddish
donny referring to aldo and himself
we both speak alittle italian
with a atrocious accent no doubt
but that doesnt exactly kill us in the crib
germans dont have a good ear for italian
so you mumble italian and brazen through it is that the plan
thats about it
that sounds good
it sounds like shit but what else we gonna do go home
no its good
if you dont blow it with that i can get you in the building
change tone so who does what
well i speak the most italian so ill be your escort
donowitz speaks the second most so hell be your italian cameraman
and hirschberg third most so hell be donnys assistant
i dont speak italian
like i said third best
just keep your fuckin mouth shut
in fact why dont you start practising right now
meaning utivich what about the little one
do you mean me
i didnt mean any offence
none taken you german cunt
utivich is the chauffeur
i cant drive
bridget screams in frustration you americans are fucking useless
ivgimmie a break im from manhattan
no worries son
we got over fourteen hours before the movie tomorrow
more then enough time for you to learn to drive
no no no no lieutenant its not
oh yes yes yes yes private it is
and yes yes yes yes you will
changes tone look utivich you and i both know if we went to grade school together you damn sure aint copyin off of my test
well i lernt to drive in four hours on a tennessee mountain road
and im a shit for brains coal miner bootlegger
hirschberg you know how to drive right
but there is a problem
im a movie star
this is a movie premiere
i cant show up looking like i was just in a nazi gun fight
now i have a dress for the premiere at my hotel
but sometime tomorrow i have to get my hair done
all the basterds except donny burst out laughing
sister you must got wunderbar luck
guess who went to beauty school
the camera whip pans to sgt
bridget rolls her eyes
were in shosannas and marcels living quarters above the cinema
weve never been in here before
shes standing before a full length mirror in a real attractive forties style dress for the premiere
this is the first time in her life shes had the opportunity or the occasion to wear something like this
since she knows this is the last night of her life no time like the present
sounds of the hub bub of the premiere not to mention the german brass band thats blaring third reich marches can be heard coming from below
shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the germatic miasma below
shosannas pov we see all the pageantry below
tons of spectators
tons of guests dressed in nazi uniforms tuxedos and female finery walking up the long red carpet with a big swastika in the middle naturally leading into shosannas cinema
the german brass band omm pa pa ing away
german radio and film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home
and of course many german soldiers providing security for this joyous germatic occasion
shosanna coughs up a lugi and hocks it
a german s
general being interviewed by a radio commentator the lugi hits him right on his bald head
shosanna goes back to the full length mirror places a very fashionable forties style hat on her head then lowers the period style black fish net veil over her face
she takes out a small gun and puts it in the pocket of her dress
and its on
she exits the apartment door to join the premiere
from this point on theres no turning back its all the way baby all the fucking way
the stairwell in the building that connects the living quarters with the cinema
she walks down the stairs goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door
she takes out a key and opens it
marcels prepping the film reels for tonight
the five silver metal film cans that carry one mm reel of film each are laid out
the cans for reels one and two are empty
cans for reel three our specially marked can for reel four and can for reel five which should never see the light of a projector lie in wait
shosanna looking like a forties movie star enters the projection booth
the scene in french subtitled in english ooh lala danielle darrieux this is so exciting
pleased to meet you
shut up fool
marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips meet
cheeky black bugger
i have to go down and socialize with these hun pigs
lets go over it again
reel one is on the first projector
reel two is on the second
three and four are ready to go
okay the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel
our film comes on in the forth reel so somewhere towards the end of the third reel go down and lock the doors of the auditorium
then take your place behind the screen and wait for my cue when i give it to you burn it down
the pageantry of the evening is in full swing as all the german beautiful people enter the cinema
they mingle in the swastika covered greek nude statue peppered lobby
nazi military commanders high ranking party officials and german celebrities emil tannings veit harlin hob knob and drink champagne from passing waiters who carry glasses on silver trays
we see shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance
she descends the staircase and busies herself with theatre stuff
at the top of the staircase looking down at the master race in all there finery is colonel hans landa dressed in his finest ss uniform smoking on his calabash
directly behind him
on the right side we see the figure of col
landa from behind watching the guests entering the cinema
on the left side of frame is the cinema entrance from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the building
a think bubble like in a comic book appears on the left side of frame obscuring the cinema entrance
inside of landas think bubble a little scene plays out
inside a hospital room filled with doctors nurses and a patient in a hospital bed
landa enters the room and screams at everybody i want everybody out of this room
they start to leave
that means now goddamnit
they rush out
he walks over to the patient in the hospital bed its none other then sgt
willi and yes hes still alive
landa pulls up a chair next to the bed sits down
can you speak sgt
tell me everything that happened in there
the think bubble dissolves away reveling the entrance again and as if on perfect cue in walks bridget von hammersmark dressed lovely leg in a big white cast
the three basterds in their tuxedos flank her
he descends the stairs towards the four saboteurs
they speak in german subtitled in english fraulein von hammersmark what has befallen germanys most elegant swan
colonel landa its been years
dashing as ever i see
flattery will get you everywhere fraulein
they chuckle and air kiss
so whats happened to your lovely leg a by product of kicking ass in the german cinema no doubt
save your flattery you old dog
i know too many of your former conquests to fall into that honey pot
seriously what happened
well i tried my hand foolishly i might add at mountain climbing
and this was the result
thats how you injured your leg mountain climbing
believe it or not yes it is
a brief moment passes between the two
the colonel bursts out with uproarious laughter
so uproarious in fact that its quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs
the colonel begins to regain his composure
forgive me fraulein
i dont mean laugh at your misfortune
its just mountain climbing
im curious fraulein what could of ever compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy endeavor
the double meaning is not lost on the german actress
well i chant be doing it again i can tell you that
that cast looks as fresh as my old uncle gustave when were you climbing this mountain last night
very good eye colonel
it happened yesterday morning
and where exactly in paris is this mountain
this stops her for a seconded
then landa laughs it off taking them off the hook
im just teasing you fraulein
you know me i tease rough
so who are your three handsome escorts
im afraid neither three speak a word of german
their friends of mine from italy
this is a wonderful italian stuntman antonio margheriti
meaning aldo a very talented cameraman enzo gorlomi
meaning donny and enzos camera assistant dominick decocco
the german fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing basterds
gentlemen this is a old friend col
sans landa of the s
the basterds know only too well who landa the jew hunter is but they cant show it
am i saying it correctly
say it for me once please
zaaa im sorry again
it means daisies i believe
turning his gaze to donny
whats your name again
one more time but let me really hear the music in it
now to hirschberg
then hischberg breaks out the best italian accent of the
well my two cameraman friends need to find there seats
landa stops a waiter with a tray of champagne glasses
not so fast lets enjoy some champagne
everyone gets a glass
oh mademoiselle mimieux please join us i have some friends id like you to meet
shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass
this is the first moment the basterds are aware of shosanna
may i say mademoiselle you look divine
this lovely young lady is mademoiselle emmanuelle mimieux this is her cinema and she is our hostess for the evening
and mademoiselle this battered broken and none worse for the wear german goddess is bridget von hammersmark
im afraid my companions dont speak any french there italian
this is antonino enzo and dominick
all three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles
actually fraulein von hammersmarks italian associates need help finding there seats
perhaps mademoiselle mimieux would be so kind to escort them
it would be my pleasure
let me see your tickets
donny hands her two tickets
she indicates for them to follow her
donny and hirschberg both exchange one last look with aldo then follow the young french girl into the auditorium
the cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black uniforms
shosanna finds the two counterfeit italians their seats
after she points out their seats she turns to leave
reaches out and grabs her wrist
he looks her in the face and filled with tremendous guilt because if hes successful tonight hes going to blow this cute french girl to smithereens he says grazie
the cute french girl looks back at the goofy looking italian boy with slicked back hair that makes him look kind of jewish with tremendous guilt knowing if she is
successful tonight shes going to burn him alive and says prego
they begin flicking the lights on and off
a german soldier yells in german in the lobby take your seats
the show is about to begin
everybody take your seatsl col
aldo and bridget are still together
i must call the fuhrer
he doesnt want to make his entrance untill everybody seated
come with me frau von hammersmark
the fuhrer has heard your here and he wishes to commend you personally
dont be modest
everybody is quite taken with your resolve
a accident like youve just experienced and yet you still show up to to a important party event
the fuhrer was quite adamant in his gratitude
well use mademoiselle mimieuxs office
to aldo in italian im afraid i must rob you of your companion but only for a moment
yes apparently the fuhrer wishes to commend me
wait here a moment
i promise i wont detain her long
what are ether of them suppose to do argue
landa goes over to one of the nazi gaurd usher and whispers in his ear gesturing toward aldo
like hes saying leave the boy alone till we come back
or is he
landa limps bridget away towards shosannas office
as aldo stands in the lobby more and more people enter the auditorium till its only aldo and the six nazi gaurd ushers in the now vacant lobby
shosannas cinema manager office
its small cluttered and dominated by a desk
they both enter
landa closes the door behind him and locks it
bridget notices but says nothing
now the two germans are alone
have a seat fraulein
pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk
she lowers herself in the chair
instead of moving around to the other side of the desk opposite her
the ss colonel pulls another little chair over and places it in front of the fraulein
their knees almost touching
the colonel points to the foot not in the cast
let me see your foot
i beg your pardon
patting his lap
put your foot in my lap
colonel you embarrass me
i assure you fraulein my intention is not to flirt
patting his lap more with more aggression
the nervous fraulein lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed foot and places it in the colonels lap
the colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that hold the frauleins shoe on her foot
he removes the shoe
leaving only the frauleins bare foot
he removes from his heavy ss coat pocket the pretty dress shoe the fraulein left behind at la louisiane
he slips it on her foot
it fits like a glove
bridget knows shes busted
landa smiles and says in english whats that american expression
if the shoe fits
you must wear it
he removes her foot from his lap
what now colonel
do you admit you treachery
she stares defiant daggers into him
the only thing i will admit to is resisting you
sons a bitches
to my last breath
resist to your last breath
hans lunges forward putting his strong mitts around bridget von hammersmarks lily white delicate neck and with all the violence of a lion in mid pounce squeezes with all his
bridgets face turns tomato red as the veins in her face bulge and her esophagus is crushed in his grip
with a violent yank he jerks her to the floor
she tumbles out of the chair landa never releasing his grip around her throat
nov fully on top of her he bears down squeezing the very life out of her
every thing he has he brings to bear on the elegant ladies neck
then to finally finish her off he begins banging the back of shes dead
he releases the grip around her throat
his hands are he rises
strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands is the most violent act a human being can commit
also only humans strangle the opposable thumbs being quite important part of the endeavor
as hans landa stands the sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task still surges through him
he tries to gain control of the trembling that is rippling through his body
he takes out a silver ss flask filled with peach schnapps and knocks back a couple of swigs
he holds his hand out in front of him
the trembling is beginning to subside
he picks up the telephone
into the phone in german he says inform the fuhrer the audience has taken there seats and were ready to begin
step one in hans master plan done
he then dials another number
aldo in the lobby
hes jumped by the six nazi ushers
hes thrown roughly to the ground face first
like the modern day secret service within seconds his wrists are handcuffed behind his back hes searched they find the bomb attached to his ankle its removed a black cloth
bag is pulled over his head then hes hoisted up and rushed out of the building
this happens in mere seconds and quietly too no one in the auditorium is none the wiser
including donowitz and hirschberg sitting amongst the master race waiting for showtime
the six nazi soldiers hustle the hooded aldo down the red carpet then into the alley besides the cinema
aldos put up against a wall
inside the black hood hes screaming every insulting thing about germany germans german food german shepherd
the faceless black hood does
landa now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner says in english as stanley said to livingston lt
aldo raine i presume
youve had a nice long run aldo
alas your now in the hands of the ss
my hands to be exact
and theyve been waiting along time to touch you
he reaches out with his finger and lightly touches aldos face right in the middle of the hood
aldos head violently flinches
caught ya flinching
in german he orders the men put aldo in the back of a truck
aldo bound and bagged is put in the truck
also in the truck is utivich wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform bound and bagged like the lieutenant
the truck drives off
landa turns around and sees from a distance hitlers motorcade pull up to the cinema
then the fuhrer goebbels francesca and the rest of the entourage make there way down the red carpet into the cinema
we see the truck leaving the city of paris under the veil of night
we also seem to be leaving the drama of operation kino
the two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the truck
utivich is crying inside his hood
is that you lieutenant
do you know what happened to donny
no i do not
lieutenant sorry im crying
nothin to be sorry about son
this bag get to anyone
not exactly john wayne am i
john waynes a pampered movie star
he burst into tears if his cook busts his yoke at breakfast
just try puttin a bag over his head and hear what kinda sounds he makes
utivich giggles through the tears
i just want you to know son i was real proud of you tonight
learnin how to drive overnight
driving in that limo line
you was in the hot seat son and you stood up real good
utivich cries louder
aldo takes his foot finds utivichs foot and places his foot on top
the touch has a slight calming effect on utivich
in the darkness utivich has reclaimed his dignity
the truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of paris not la louisaiane the two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment
the hooded men are lead into the closed for business but open for something else rustic tavern
the nazi guards unlock the handcuff then sit them down inchairs
then simultaneously the hoods are yanked off
the two prisoners are seated at a table in what they can now see is a rustic tavern
on the table is one telephone one bottle of chianti and three glasses
and on the opposite end of the table sits colonel hans landa
a nazi soldier sits posted at a impressive looking two way radio set up in the tavern
colonel lands starts in right away at the two baffled discombobulated american soldiers
they will only speak english in the scene
what could you have possibly been thinking
well i speak alittle italian i speak a little tagalog but i wouldnt begin to presume i could pass for filipino
dont get me wrong i understand you were in a pickle what with you losing your germans
and i have nothing but admiration for improvisation
chico marx is more convincing
if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire it would have been more convincing
landas eyes go to the two nazi guards behind the prisoners
you may leave us
but stay alert outside
they exit leaving the colonel the lieutenant the private and a german radio man in the corner
so your aldo the apache
so your the jew hunter
jew hunter pfuit im a detective
a damn good detective
finding people is my specialty
so naturally i worked for the nazis finding people
and yes some of them were jews
but jew hunter
just the name that stuck
well you do hafts admit it is catchy
do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you
aldo the apache and the little man
what do you mean the little man
the germans nickname for you
the germans nickname for me is the little man
or the little one ether one means you
and as if to make my point im a little surprised how tall you were in real life
i mean your a little fellow
but not circus midget little as your reputation would suggest
where is my men
where is bridget von hammersmark
bridget von hammersmark
oh im sure shes in whatever big bubbling cesspool in hell the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk
well lets just say she got what she deserved
and when you purchase friends like bridget von hammersmark you get what you pay for
now as far as your pisanos sgt
donowitz and pt
hirschberg how do you know our names
aldo if you dont think i wouldnt interrogate every single one of your swastika marked survivors
we simply arent operating on the level of mutual respect i assumed
now back to the whereabouts of your two italian saboteurs
at this moment both hirschberg and donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
seats and if my memory serves
explosives still around there ankle still ready to explode
and your mission some would call a terrorist plot as of this moment is still a go
the two basterds dont believe this
it cant be true
thats a pretty exciting story
whats next eliza on the ice
however all i have to do is pick pick up that phone right there
inform the cinema and your plans kupet
if their still there and if their still alive and thats one big if there aint no way you gonna take them boys without settin off them bombs
i have no doubt and yes some germans will die
and yes it will ruin the evening and yes goebbels will be very very very mad at you for what youve done to his big night
but you wont get hitler you wont get goebbels you wont get gering and you wont get boorman
and you need all four to end the war
but if i dont pick up that phone right there you may very well get all four
and if you get all four you end the war
the nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of chianti and fills three glasses
as he pours he says so gentlemen lets discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight
all three have their chianti filled glasses
so the way i see it since hitlers death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction
if i do nothing
its as if im causing his death even more then yourselves
would you agree
i guess so
how about you uitivich
i guess so too
good we more or less all agree
gentlemen i have no intention of killing hitler and killing goebbels and killing gerring and killing boorman not to mention winning the war single handedly for the allies only later
to find myself standing before a jewish tribunal
i q now they get it
if you want to win the war tonight we have to make a deal
what kinda deal
the kind you wouldnt have the authority to make
however im sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer
a general im betting
would be my guess
aldos eyebrows reveal that was a good guess
oooh thats a bingo
is that the way you say it thats a bingo
you just say bingo
but i digress where were we
oh yes make a deal
over there is a very capable two way radio
and sitting behind it is a more then capable radio operator named herrman
get me somebody on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my lets call it the terms of my conditional surrender if that
taste better going down
shosanna in the booth she brings down the lights
in the packed excited auditorium the house lights go down
cu curtain switch she flips it
in the auditorium the red velvet curtains part
shosanna throws the lever on the first projector
the projector bulb goes hot white projecting a beam
film reels rotate
mm film moves through the projectors film gate
the opening seal of a film by the third reich flickers on the goebbels and francesca watch
donowitz and hirschberg watch
shosanna in the booth watches through the little window
the camera pans off of shosanna to the clearly marked film can reel four
the surprise reel
landa with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone in his hand talks to the unseen unheard american brass on the other end
so when the military history of this night is written it will be recorded that i was part of operation rino from the very beginning as a double agent
anything ive done in my guise as a ss colonel was sanctioned by the o
as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the germans
and it was my placement of lt
raines dynamite in hitler and goebbels opera box that assured there demise
by the way that last part is actually true
landa placing bomb in goebbels and francescas opera box
i want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
i want to receive the congregational medal of honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the third reich
he looks over and sees aldo and uitvich watching the one sided conversation
in fact i want all the members of operation kino to receive the congregational medal of honor
full citizenship for myself but that goes without saying
and i would like the united states of america to purchase property for me on nantuckett island as a reward for all the countless lives ive saved by bringing the
tyranny of the national socialist party to a swifter then imanged end
do you have all that sir
i look forward to seeing you face to face as well sir
hes right here
the colonel hands the headphones and microphone to aldo
we hear the voice on the other end of the radio give aldo his colonel landa will put you and private uitivich in a truck as prisoners
then he and his radio operator will get in the truck drive to our lines
upon crossing our lines colonel landa and his man will surrender to you
you will then take over driving of the truck a bring them straight to me for debriefing
is that clear lieutenant
the conversation is over he puts the radio down
the three men look at one another
landa picks up his wine
so i suppose the only thing left to do is lift a glass and toast to donowitz and hirschbergs success
you too herrman come over here
the four men col
hans landa lt
aldo raine pvt
smithson uitivich and herrman lift up four glasses of wine
gentlemen to history and its witnesses
fredrick zoller playing himself is in a ornamental tower in a russian village picking off russian soldiers below
peering at the german private through binoculars
he lowers the long range glasses and confers with one of his officers
whats the death toll
general i implore you we must destroy that tower
that tower is one of the oldest and most beautiful structures in russia
i wont be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust
a brave russian soldier tries to run between two buildings
zoller gets him
then proceeds to pick him apart one single bullet at a time
she removes reel the special shosanna reel and prepares it on the nd projector
reel on the first projector playing now is halfway through
in a few short minutes its going to be show time
marcel says to shosanna in french subtitled in english its time
i should go lock the auditorium and take my place behind the screen
this is the last time they will ever see each other too much to say
he holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before i die wet one on her
sit in their seats watching the movie surrounded by dress uniform nazis
theyve developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostel environment
basically speaking english like it were gibberish italian
they say english words only adding a i or a a or a o to the end of it
and saying it in a exaggerated italian accent complete with pantomimes
donowitz leans into hirschberg and says in a wispier they speak in italia ish subtitled into english i a go a toilet a set ta boom a
i go to the toilet and set the bomb when a i a go a you a set ta boom a
when i go you set your bomb hirschberg indicates pantomimes he cant set his bomb surrounded by all these nazis
donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs setting bomb on ankle in his seat
then getting up and dropping it in the back of the auditorium in the dark
hirschberg doesnt get it
donny pantomimes again more exaggerated and with less patience
affirm ato affirm ato
affirmative affirmative they o look o screen a not o you a

donowitz stands from his seat and walks out of the dark auditorium into the lobby
the nazi guards ushers are gone the lobby is completely empty
seeing the stairs leading down to the water closet bathroom he descends them to plant the boom a i mean the bomb
leading to the water closet
like a lot of old cinemas not only was the water closet located under the auditorium you had to pass through a rather large smoking lounge to get to it
in the smoking lounge are ten nazi enlisted men the guards ushers for the event smoking and indulging in soldiers gossip
theyre all in dress uniforms and all are armed
donowitz in his tuxedo acts cool and walks right through them
they look up but dont disturb there time off vibe
donny enters the big water closet
except for one lone nazi enlisted man at the urinal it would appear as if donny has the whole wash room to himself
he enters the privacy of a toilet stall locks the door
he descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into the empty lobby
he goes to one of the auditorium doors and peers inside
in the back of the room
the audience seems riveted to fredricks exploits on screen
marcel closes the door and with a key deadbolts it shut
we pan off the screen to marcel who locks the two doors on ether side of the screen
due to curtains placed there no one notices marcels actions
marcel then goes behind the screen we see the image backward of fredricks sniper battle huge covering entire side room
a pile of over nitrate film prints lay like a junk pile right behind the screen
sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and pile o film he lights up a cigarette a absolute no no in a cinema of this era but tonight
what does it matter
he smokes and waits for his cue to
burn it down
along side hitler goebbels francesca and boorman
on screen the battle rages
he leans over and whispers something in goebbels ear we cant hear
goebbels makes a very sympathetic face at least sympathetic for goebbels and says in german perfectly understandable dear boy
you go now and well see you after the show
he exits the opera box
and walks to the projection booth door
he raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way
the door opens just a little bit shosanna not friendly stares at him
be as per usual is all smiles and charm
they speak in french subtitled into english are you the manager of this cinema
i want my money back
that actor in the movie stinks
she doesnt even smile
she says in all serious business what are you doing here
i came to visit you
cant you see how busy i am
then allow me to lend a assist
fredrick its not funny you cant be here
this is your premiere you need to be out there with them
as fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the charm at his command shosanna listens knowing the third reel is just about over and her big reel change
is coming up
normally you would be
and for all the other films i do i intend to endure evenings like tonight in the proper sprit
however the fact remains this film is based on my military exploits
and in this case my exploits consisted of me killing many men
consequently the part of the film thats playing now
i dont like watching this part
fredrick i am sorry but so i thought id come up here and do what i do best annoy you
and from the look on your face it would appear i havent lost my touch
donowitz with bomb in his lap sets the timer six minutes from now
he then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank
we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us
we see donnys feet in the closed toilet stall
we hear the off screen nazi enlisted man finish his piss
then his shoes walk through frame
we follow them to
we stay on the shoes
as we hear the soldier wash his hands
the camera rises up his pant leg
we re eye level with the german soldier with a army cap on his head whos done washing his hands
the soldier removes his cap brushes some bangs out of his face and we can see of the bastards
he splashes some water on his face puts his cap back on his head and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge
as he exits frame he says to somebody off screen hey fritz you owe me three cigarettes now pay up
fredrick still outside the doorway and shosanna still baring the way
i have to get prepared for the reel change
let me do it
oh please its been two years since ive done a reel change
i said no
cute whine come on its my premiere
are you so use to the nazis kissing your ass youve forgotten what the word aaaano means
no fredrick you cant come in here now go away
no subtitles for fredrick needed this time he gets it
he does a one armed pile drive push on the door knocking both it open and shosanna back into the room
fredrick a different cat then weve seen up till now enters the booth closing the door behind him and locking it
the quite startled shosanna says to fredrick fredrick you hurt me
well its nice to know you can feel something
even if its just physical pain
fredrick steps forward
shosanna steps backwards
im not a man you say go away to
theres over three hundred dead bodies in russia that if they could would testify to that
after what ive done for you you disrespect me at your peril
the swastika forehead soldier get a light for his cigarette
he takes a big drag
he faces the washroom and down that long throw he sees donny emerge from the toilet stall
his tuxedo jacket is off and draped over his right hand
sporting the white dress shirt and black tuxedo vest
hes quite far away so now he just looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit
donny walks toward us
seeing him get closer
donny gets closer
seeing him closer still
donny gets closer
begins to notice
donny getting closer begins to notice german soldier notice him
now donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize
his face screams the bear jew
the soldiers gun is out of its holster and rising toward donnys chest
donny raises his right arm with the tuxedo jacket on it and fires a gun concealed under it
hitting swastika forehead in the chest
who finishes raising his gun firing hitting donny in the chest
the two soldiers fire into each other
till there weapons are empty and the two men lie dead on the floor
the nine other nazis in the room stand shocked at what just happened in front of them
fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns towards the door
what the hell was that
while fredricks back is turned shosanna takes a gun out of her pocket and shoots fredrick three times in the back
be crashes hard into the door then falling face first to the floor
shosanna gun in hand looks out projection booth window into the audience
the on screen battle rages so loudly with gunfire that her weapon didnt stand a chance of being heard
her eyes go from the audience
up to the big screen
which holds fredrick zoller in a tight handsome close up
the face on the silver screen breaks the young girls heart
she looks to his body lying face down on the floor blood flowing from the holes she put in his back
his body moves a little and he lets out a painful moan
dieing though he is at this moment fredrick is still shosanna moves to him
she touches him and he lets out another moan
she turns his body over on its back
hes holding a luger in his hand
he fires twice
two bullets hit her point blank in the chest
throwing her against the wall then falling forward on her knees to the floor
fredrick luger still in hand takes aim from the floor
hitting the bloody girl on the floor in the thigh
spinning her body around in agony
like he did to the russian on screen he picks her apart one bullet at a time
luger drops to floor fredrick dies
our young french jewish heroine lies on the projection booth floor in a pool of her own blood her body riddled with bullets her nerve endings wracked with pain crippled
and the little bell on the st projector starts to ring informing the projectionist its time for the reel change
dieing or not if shosanna intends to get her revenge shes going to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel change
the battle on screen continues waging
the audience is riveted
the fuhrer watches completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle
he says to goebbels in german extraordinary joseph simply extraordinary
this is your finest film yet
goebbels is beyond proud he smiles to francesca who proudly pats his hand
shosanna bloody crippled and fucked with great painful effort pulls herself off the floor
hirschberg sitting in his seat sets the bomb on his ankle
then stands up and begins scooting past everybody in his rows knees
like the german heroine in one of riefenstahls mountain films shosanna climbs up the mm film projector like it was piz palu
private zoller firing away from his perch
in the top far right corner of the frame
we see the st reel change mark
shosanna hanging on to projector waiting for nd reel change mark its a agonizing effort
marcel smoking waiting for his cue
get out of his xow and begins walking up the aisle in the middle of the cinema towards the exit
sergio leone cu fredrick he screams to russians below who wants to send a message to germany
in the top right of frame the nd reel change mark pops on
shosanna tosses herself to the floor as she throws the change over switch on the nd projector
blasting white in our face
hits the dusty ground hard not in slow motion
on floor eyes close last breath blown into dusty projection booth floor
like her family befor her dead from nazi bullets
camera in the exact same placement same background b w sky slight low angle looking up so on screen shosanna is looking down on the nazis the way fredrick was
looking down on the russians
the way this huge image of shosannas giant face stares down the auditorium of nazis brings to mind orwells big brother
hitler and goebbels react
standing in the middle of the aisle turns towards the screen
when he sees shosannas giant face hes gobsmacked
marcel sitting in the chair with his cigarette before the she stares down the packed house of nazis and says in french i have a message for germany
im interrupting your nazi propaganda horse shit to inform you despicable german swine that your all going to die
hitler and goebbels react
and i want you to look deep in the face of the jew whos going to do it
while the shocked german audience is transfixed to thescreen behind the heads of most of them
the bomb landa set in hitlers and goebbels opera box
blowing to smithereens hitler francesca boorman and propelling goebbels still in his theatre seat across the auditorium into the opposite wall and taking out a portion of the ceiling as
the crowd reacts
the explosion causes the huge chandelier from versailles to topple from its jerry rigged placement and crash on to the audience below
on screen the giant face of shosanna finishes her war cry
my name is shosanna dreyfus and this is the face of jewish vengeance
marcel marcel takes his cigarette and flicks it into the pile of nitrate film
on screen shosannas giant face laughs maniacally at the scrambling little nazis running in a panic as flames like and climb up the walls of the cinema
the audience stampedes towards the exits
with bomb set on ankle is caught in a massive day of the locust swarm of bodies
people frantically pound on locked doors trapping them to there grizzly fate
the flames and fire spread through thr auditorium
hirschberg caught in people crunch knows this is it
right underneath everybody in the room
the effect this has on the people in the room is very similar to that of the effect a m blowing up in a ant hill would have on the
the auditorium is a literal red rain of legs arms heads torsos and asses
blows up underneath the auditorium
as madam mimeuxs cinema burns
theses subtitles appear on screen as if on a military its a misty early morning in the woodsy area
the german truck with aldo and uitvich in the back and landa and herrman in the front comes to stop
landa and herrman in truck cab herrman behind the wheel tells landa in german these are the american lines sir
in the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members of the basterds lt
aldo raine and prvt
smithson uitivich both with their hands cuffed behind there back
landa and herrman appear at truck rear says in english okay gentlemen you can climb down
aldo and uitivich climb down from the truck
landa indicates for herrman to remove the handcuffs from the two prisoners
herrman hand them your weapon
landa hands over his luger and his very cool looking ss i am officially surrendering myself over to you lt
we are your prisoners
thank you very much colonel
uitivich cuff the colonels hands behind his back
is that really necessary
as uitivich cuffs the
colonels hands behind his back aldo im a slave to appearances
then aldo takes the luger and shoots herrman dead
the bound col
landa is appalled

so im gonna give you a little somethin you cant take off
the dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his forehead
on the ground looking up at aldo bloody knife in hand who straddles him
and uitivich whos next to him
the two basterds admire aldos handiwork
you know somethin uitivich i think this just might be my masterpiece
