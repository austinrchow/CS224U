by gregory widen garish purple light spills out of side street porno houses illuminating a silhouette and little else of a man leaning against an alley wall
he is waiting
another silhouetted figure appears and approaches the first
they size each other up as best they can
the second nods
the first without hesitation raises a sword the intended thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash of metal severs the agressors head
a th century scottish home
a haggard woman her small child clinging to a tattered apron stands hunched over a glowing hearth
her veined hands drag a wooden spoon around and around through a soot covered pot of grey soup
from an adjoining room conor macleod a young man dressed up in his best traditional celtic tartan enters
my but are you the picture
surveying himself its a bit tight
his father enters with a pail of milk
ah conor how you look a man
have you time for some thing to eat
theyll be here shortly
conors father looks him over with pride
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king and i to fight for the duke
must he go
it is his duty
all of ours
but ian hes still but a boy
hes a macleod
ill be fine mother
several horsemen gallop up through the early morning fog to the cottage door
conors father steps out to meet them
a massive knight sits astride his horse moorish dew cling ing to his helmet and breastplate
a clansman hikes up the heather carpeted slope to him
is the boy among them
the second kneels to examine the headless body of the first
with a clack a window high on the alley wall closes
the duke is leading a brigade of clansmen out onto the plain
mounted vassals ride back and forth inspecting the line
the low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards
there is an erie smothering silence
is a bad day for this
the duke has been compro mised
he will have his due
by days end he will have our heads
we ride against the suther lands
that is all that matters
this makes no sense to me
and a friend are marching through the moist heather
the fog is bad
we cannot even see the sides of our own ranks
conors nervousness is showing
is this your first
shouting is heard on the plain
the knight above the fog hears the battle commence below
he spurs his horse and starts down into the mist
the two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan and clashing swords
the air is charged with shouts of ex citement agony and the shrill of bag pipes
the fog has made each mans battle his own each isolated with his opponent
rides calmly through the fracas
he strikes and kills those that assault him but appears disinterested in battle
he is looking
is standing above the twitching body of his friend
alone and confused conor has become seperated from the clan
he stumbles through the fog seeking help
suddenly he is alone with the knight
the face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy
his fear turned to panic conor turns and flees
the knight his resolve steeled in a raised sword kicks his horse into persuit
conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the knight brings his blade down hard into conors shoulder slicing open most of the boys back and knocking him face
first into the heather
as conor watches his own blood spew forth he rolls over in time to see the knight dismount and start for him
leans down next to conor his metal face nearly against the boys
his voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper
there can be but one
charges out of the fog and attacks the knight who cuts him nearly in half
another wanders in and meets the same fate
the battle is shifting to where they are
not finished yet with conor the knight is finding himself forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail ants
sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now mounted knight
the clansmen obey
with the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed the knight disappears into the fog
the vassal surveys the carnage before him
his eyes fall a moment on the moaning gurgling conor
the vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead
a patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley
the figure considers his situation then quickly shoves his sword into a near by drain
he straightens up and waits
steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward
his partner switches on the patrol cars side lamps bathing the alley in a harsh glare
for the first time we can see his face
richard taupin clad in a well cut business suit looks exactly like conor
the police officer upon seeing the body grabs instinctively for his pistol
he yells to his partner now coming into the alley
get is a backup
i was merely walking by when dont move
the officer has his pistol out and leveled
his partner runs up shotgun in hand
theyre on their way
his voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe
conor lies moaning on a cot
makeshift bandages wrap his body stained and pasted by thick dried blood
the family surrounds their dying son
a priest is delivering the last rites
libera domine animan servi tui sicut libertasi david de manu regis saul
his sobbing mother holds a compress to conors forehead
in mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum
a vassal rides up to the hutch dismounts and approaches a clansman standing in the open doorway
has the boy died
he is having the last rites now
it should be over by morning
never seen anybody cut as bad live so long
he should have died on the field
tonight or tomorrow its all the same
the vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments
auditorium nostrum in nomine domini
this has been a dark day
requiescant in pace
there is a bustle of activity
setting up barricades uni formed officers are trying to keep new crews and curious onlookers at a distance
lean fortyish and comfortable with the gore in front of him is inspecting the corpse with a medical examiner
studying body real clean
no sawing action at all
whatever it was did it in one swipe
looks up at moran like the other one
moran gestures to a sword wrapped in plastic lying nearby
what about that
hasnt any blood on it
looking around about the only thing that doesnt
ill give it a closer look when i get back
pretty but not beautiful thirtyish she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence
an officer sees her duck under a police barricade
come on brenna you know better than that
she walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment
the examiner turns and smiles
hope this isnt past your bedtime
brenna looks to the now sheeted corpse blood flowing from where the head should be
doesnt have a head does he
this one came unassembled
moran is standing near
no warmth just show her what she came for tom
stands taps brennas arm come on this is more your line of work
brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse to the sword
hows your uncle
i hardly ever see him anymore
the examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in forensic plastic
there you go
brennas expression changes to interest as she kneels down beside it
didnt look like it came from toys are us thats why i called you
looks up in morans direction didnt think it was my buddy over there
figured you knew more about swords than i did
take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and youve got a claymore
youre the expert
runs hand along hilt slightly confused its in good condition
is being put in the rear of a patrol car
brenna studies his face in the half gloom
theres something different about him
richard taupin is seated at a graffitti scrawled table in a room otherwise bare of furnishings
he seems unphased by his surroundings
the door opens and moran enters with bag and notebook
he picks up taupins wallet on the table top and checks the drivers license
this your present address
looks at license taupin what were you doing in that alley
i was walking by when i heard a shout
your men came right after
did you know the victim
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory
he was carrying a syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week
taupins face is stoic and controlled
two days ago a bulgarian national was murdered the same way
hed also been in the country less than a week
beat what is your citizenship
moran paces to a corner of the room
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh borhood at night
what are you getting at
lets just say that in my years with this department ive seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on th street
moran places both hands on the table and leans across it
what were you looking for
thats none of your business
moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large broad sword old but in mint condition
do you know what this is
i presume its a sword
a claymore to be exact
you wouldnt know anything about it would you
your murder weapon
it was covered with mr
fasils fingerprints but none of his blood
for the moment
moran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down
he rises and opens the door
all right mr
taupin well be in touch
taupin passes through the doorway without comment
taupin out into the crisp night air
his eyes search out the darkness
a medieval sun beats down on an old traveler making his way up the macleod home
conors mother scrubbing clothes in a bucket smiles in recognition
ah steven it is good to see you
i only just heard of conor
i came up from catroch as soon as i could
youre a kind man to be sure
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family
steven conor didnt die
but i had heard his wounds were mortal
they were steven they were
its been a miracle it has
he lasted right through and healed
no one in the village has ever seen anything like it
perched on a heather carpeted rise above the village a young woman mara sits contemplating the intricaces of a daffodil
balancing on a shepards staff conor limps over and puts his lips to her ear
youre pretty today
mara is silent
im your future husband remember
i have no future husband
i dont understand
not a week ago your father gave us his blessing
this is difficult for her
tears well in her eyes
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands
what are you saying
im standing here as real as you
you cannot be real conor
you had the last rites
no man has been cut half as bad and lived
but i did live
in less than a week youre prancing about the country like a squirrel
so why the crazy talk
its a miracle it is
saint andrew has smiled on me
some think not
theres rumor in the village
some call it magic
surely you dont take their word
i dont know conor
its not natural
maybe something has touched you
youre sounding like that mad woman widow baggins
me father has taken back my hand
he puts a hand to her cheek
she steps back
please not be touching me conor
ill not take that kind of talk from you
from those others below maybe
but not from you
leave me alone conor
youre not talking sense mara
anger tumbles into exasperation
he steps for her
she moves away
conors face hardens with resentment
if you send me away now mara ill not come looking for you
crying do what you must
resigned conor turns and limps away
clocks tables chests
small and personal
richard taupin enters and sheds his overcoat
thompson agreed to settle for fifteen melvins wants to make a pick up at three oclock the coffee machines broken and theres a miss cartwright from the smithsonian in your
taupin is hardly in the mood
brenna cartwright stands in taupins cluttered surroundings admiring a bagpipe set neatly on a shelf
do you play
taupin sits down and begins sorting through a stack of papers on his desk
impatient miss cartwright what is it i can do for you
id like to ask you about the claymore
its not mine
its quite rare you know some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years
miss cartwright unless you have come here to sell the sword theres very little i can help you with
now if you will excuse me i have a great deal of work to do
brenna has taken a carving from the shelf
basil the ii
charming guy basil
once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but all but one out of a hundred i know
all left to be led like donkeys back home
now if you will please brenna suddenly tosses the carving at him
taupin snatches it out of the air with lightning precision
good day miss cartwright
a lonely ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables
the department supervisor sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff researchers brenna included
a faded stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet cold coffee and half eaten sack lunches
i dont believe him
hes too cool
i think hes got something to do with it
oh has your penetrating research on th century lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality
screw off larry
the men laugh
they delight in baiting her
researcher opens a budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug hes borrowed from the collection
the cops bought it
they let him go
what could they hold him for
i think theyre just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real
we should look into it
he had to have gotten that sword from somewhere
hang on a sec you did your little favor for the boys downtown im sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here
ive seen nobleman swords that werent as well preserved
its just a hunk of peasant iron
why would he be carrying it around in an alley
here we go
everytime theres a murder in town we have to put up with junior d
must be genetic
someone should check him out
maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over
he has one he might have two
you see that desk
you see the crap piled up on it
give it a rest ned huh
might be interesting to see what his family connections are
thats a hell of a piece to be just chuck ing around in an alley
sighs i swear to god brenna between you and thompsons novels im going to get a bloody ulcer
researcher lifts the mug of beer to his mouth
an empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking establishment
clansmen their faces and clothes smudged with a days work in the fields relax and enjoy the company of their fellow villagers
no longer requiring the use of a cane conor enters
to owner evening douglas
the tavern goes silent
the attention is on conor
ale suits me
the owner unenthusiastically fills conor a mug
conor takes it and walks to where four other villagers sit
we rather you not be sitting with us conor
conor looks to the next table
we be drinking alone as well
the entire tavern spells the same sentiments
whats wrong with you all
angered conor approaches the second man
as he looms above his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts it forward
requiem acernam donaei what are you doing man
et lux perpetua youll not be bringing the church into this
luceat ei the weird display frightens conor
auditorium nostrum stop
in nomine sanctus esperitu stop
conor hurles his mug against the wall
his nerves shattered he rushes out
conor packs a satchel with his few clothes and belongings
he walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait
his mother tears on her cheek hugs him tightly
please take care of yourself
conor turns to his father
i wish there was some other way
they clasp hands
without looking back he passes through the doorway and down the empty path his figure quickly fading in the moorish fog
the noisy business as usual confusion at the washington p
amongst the dinge of clanging phones and clacking typewriters a uniformed officer enters something into a computer terminal
brenna sits perched on a desk nearby
this is against the rules
sos playing choo choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of okay okay
you owe me
besides im cute
the computer returns a reply onto a printer
tears off sheet taupin richard marshall
born march in church hill maryland
received first driver permit in philadelphia
church hill thats pretty close isnt it
anything in maryland is close
taupin steps out of a metro station and walks the few blocks to his brick townhouse
climbing the front stairs he fishes his keys out of a coat pocket
about to insert the key he stops sensing something
backing down the steps taupin slips around to the rear of the building
like a spider taupin pries open a window and slips silently inside
the home is dark and still
taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway
there a man dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible in the dim light is crouched at the front door
he is holding a sword
taupin removes a knife from his pocket and jumps the intruder
the two struggle fiercely
taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his knife firmly against the mans throat
where is he
bulging eyes stare at him
i dont know
what name is he using
taupin presses the blade
a trickle of blood rolls down the throat
how many came
the last four
and the bulgarian
he got him
hoarse chuckle he always does
he knows im here
none of this would be happening if you hadnt run
the knife is pressed deeper
gasping we learned hed found the immigration notaries in liverpool and traced them to new york
then he figured out the birth records in church hill
a city limit sign announcing the small community of church hill is overtaken by brennas sedan
brenna looks through a telephone book
she closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover
an s stone columned affair far more impressive than the low lying town that surrounds it
brenna sits sifting through a large cloth bound book entitled certificates of birth
taupin richard marshall
born to william and karen taupin no address
attend ing physician dr
kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder
that strains the memory
after a fashion here we are richard taupin
he carries the binder to the table where brenna sits
would you like more tea
no thank you im fine
kidell sips his own and looks over the binder page
he was unsual
well this is a small town and it was even smaller then
most all the babies i delivered were from local families
richards parents were just passing through when his mothers time came
i did it right here at the house
then you didnt know richard later on
ive been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies
dont know about any of that
suppose nobody does
i dont follow you
poor little tyke didnt have a chance
he died a few days after he was born
the boy died
sad case it was
the young lady just couldnt make it through labor
never even saw her son
kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping
my brother worked for the town paper at the time
he took this picture of the funeral
something in the clipping sparks brennas interest
have you spoken to anyone else about this
there was this one fella
asked a lot of questions
i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office
would you remember his name
thinks carl smith
a police line up
seven men all dressed in santa claus outfits with bare legs are paraded for a small old lady
just tell us when you see the one
several rows back in the dark sits brennas uncle joe the district attorney and another man his assistant
im just curious
youre never just curious
to assistant youve met my neice brenna
to line up number lift your coat up more
arent you getting a little old for this
you flunked out of law school
rolls her eyes now theres a new topic
dont they have enough for you to do at the castle
brenna puts on her best little girl angelic smile a smile her uncle can never refuse
sighs forgers do it all the time
they take the birth certificate of some one who died young and use it to get legit i
usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it
call your mother
you never call her
to old lady well
i dont know
id have to see his thing
a swath of moonlight shines in across a carafe turned vase a new england college diploma and a police uniform hanging from the bedpost where brenna lies with another man
i cant figure out why hes doing it
hes been richard taupin at least since
and the guys rich
you should see the stuff he has in that shop
maybe hes hiding from something
some guy named smith was asking about him in church hill
i passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank
so he isnt a cop
dennis gets out of bed and begins putting on his uniform
probably just some exec ducking an ex wife
kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral
the father looked just like richard
even had a mark on his cheek
how old is richard
says but he barely looks
find the father
that should clear things up
he buttons his shirt
something occurs to him
taupin isnt that the guy moran picked up the other night
hed want to know about all this
let him find his own clues
theres a journal article in this somewhere
shakes head uncle joeys little girl
cant get the taste out of her mouth
dennis puts on his police cap
well the cream of society awaits
cocks hat to one side if youre ever in the neighborhood
police officers their flashlights cutting the darkness search the mud shores of a potomac tidal basin
the glowing jefferson memorial can be seen in the distance
an officer climbs up the embankment to him
they found it
the officer leads him down to the river where a headless body wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag
it was about fifty yards down stream from the head
moran looks down at the body bag its dark plastic reflecting the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons
both were cut real clean
like the other ones
a steeple chase course lies shrouded in an arlington fog
across the damp grass a lone horse heaving clouds of warm breath leaps gracefully over a hurdle
driving the steed hard through the course taupin pulls firm on the reins bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where detective moran waits
theres been another murder
taupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline
where were you tuesday night
a neighbor saw your car leave
taupin climbs down from his horse
moran moves close
look i dont know what the hell youre up to but i think ive got a pretty good idea
all i need is time
ive got all the time in the world
looks at watch except right now
if you will excuse me lieutenant
in no hurry taupin leads his horse away
brenna sits surrounded by books of old english law colorful family banner plates and a medieval caltrap sitting on her desk corner
boring quickly she shuts the book and sighs
from another folder she pulls out a computer sheet
the police sheet has taupins name and motor vehicle record
below are listed four william taupins their hometowns and driving records
richard taupins first driver permit was in
brenna looks down the list to a william taupin of felton delaware who stopped filling for driver permits in the year richard started
dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine brenna removes and opens up a map of the state of delaware
brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary
holding a slip of paper she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants
on a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave
richard taupin stands at the mouth of the pit
a coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads william the casket is empty
someone beat you
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries miss cartwright
people like that rarely leave business cards
does carl smith
a flash of interest quickly suppressed
i dont know what youre talking about
i think you do
better yet i dont think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place
and i think mr
smith whoever he is now knows that
you have an active imagination
ive been to church hill
miss cartwright you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you
i strongly suggest you return to washington and stay out of small town cemetaries
he starts for the gate
i could find him
i have friends
i doubt that
beat good day miss cartwright
he walks on
after only a few paces taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt stop
he holds up an open palm to silence her
your help may be unneccessary
the air is still
taupins face is expressionless
he listens intently
an unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind
good afternoon mr
taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad sword in hand
we have never seen the knight out of his armor before but this man certainly seems to fit the bill
wearing levis and leather jacket in contrast to taupins expensive business suit he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone
taupin naked without his own sword is trapped against a marble wall
not so long
the knight is closing in on him sword gripped in both hands
youve been here from the start
my quarry grows clever with age
and the others incompetent
the knight throws brenna a glance
friend of yours
i do hope she enjoys a good show
the knight leans his whole body into a two fisted swing clanging out a chunk of marble as taupin ducks
a second swipe also imbeds itself in stone
so now it ends
a thrust cuts only air
generation upon generation
tens of thousands of miles
taupin leaps behind a tree
the knight cuts it nearly in half
youre the last macleod
romirez lacroux neuvich those fools that followed me their heads all line my shelf
all but yours
taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe
can you feel it macleod
can you feel it
taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the knight on the knee knocking him over
the knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from taupin
there can be but one
he raises his blade
an elderly watchman shotgun cradled in his arms stands in the clearing
whats going on here
the knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear style firmly into the watchmans chest
taupin pushes past him to brenna
brenna is frozen in shock
taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate
the knight retrieves his sword from the watchmans body and lumbers after them
taupin and brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround ing residential area
taupin leads an exhausted brenna in a gallop down the side walk
they have apparently lost the knight
taupin pauses at a corner
he sees a church across the street
brenna enters and collapses into a pew her labored breathing echoing off the high ceiling
taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone
satisfied he leans against a banister and considers his sit uation
trying to recover her wind brenna has her eyes closed and head against the back of the pew
youll be safe here
he wont kill in a church
what the hell is going on
taupin stares out the window stained glass shining orange on his face
he looks at brenna briefly then passes through the churchs doorway without a word
a glowing horseshoe hisses wildly as it slips into a wooden cooling bucket
pulling it out with iron tongs conor lays it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet
sweaty and streaked with dirt he tosses the mallet aside and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine
conor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms cleaning off a days worth of sweat and grime
stirring up dust with his travelling boots this spanish acc ented man stops at conors shop
he wears a large broad sword strapped to his waist
your name is conor
bows slightly juan cid romirez
chief surveyor and alchemist
notices accent youre not from these parts
i am from spain
and i would like a moment of your time
romirez is seated at a table
his back to the spaniard conor is preparing some food
i havent much to offer mr
romirez from spain but youre welcome to whats here
please go to no trouble
romirez is looking at the faint pale hint of a scar that runs from conors shoulder blade to his waist
your back it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member
your marks would suggest great injury
i was nearly killed
but you lived
conor looks up from his work in pained memory
i did at that
and but for a mark you are well as any man no
i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation
and a solution
something isnt right
conor turns and faces him
i was driven out
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew
how can you know this
tone lightens first food no
a good meal makes conversation so much easier
stunned with the implications of what romirez has said like a robot conor serves the meal
his eyes never leave romirez who digs hungrily into the food
hmm que rico
what is it you call this
you scots have a way with game
it still has life in it
back home the food is so
why are you here
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal
youre a long way from inverness
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth
you know me home
it was time for our paths to cross
romirez pulls back the sleeve on his cloak
you see this
he traces some discoloration on his arm
when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me
all thought i would die or be maimed for life
but i healed quickly
and like you i paid the price for being different
you are the same
do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you
does it change with me in the room
it is less
you feel you know me
i dont know why
we are brothers
romirez and conor walk alone amongst torch lit hutches
he told me there could be only one
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad ition their lives have known the game
conor confused you and i conor we are different from all others around us
you know this you can feel it
we are flesh and bone like any man but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure looks away permanently
i dont understand
you are still so very young
im twenty two
shakes head not even a single lifetime
romirez chooses his words very carefully
conor you and i we cannot be killed
we are immortal
stunned conor backs away from romirez
no that cant be
romirez grasps conors shoulder
it is as you are
pushes away no
this is all too much for conor
listen to me
hear the words
this is madness
it is the truth
romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into conors heart
the boys mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head
a shudder then conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground
brenna stops her car in front of the washington police depart ment
getting out of her car she climbs the stairs but stops
after a moment of indecision she changes her mind and returns to her car
brenna lowers herself wearily into a chair rubs her eyes and stares absently out the window
reaching across to an end table she plays back her answering machine
this is dr
wickland at gwu
your test came back today
you can call me here at the med center if you have any questions
brenna where the hell are you
the place is full of cops asking weird questions
whats going on
ive got work stacking up
get in here right away
brenna stands and goes to the kitchen returning with a glass of wine
she freezes in her tracks
my quarrel is not with you
brennas eyes are glued on the machine
we have much to talk of you and i
answers for the young historian
ive grown to like taverns
singing happy birthday to you happy birth day to you happy birthday dear brenna happy birthday to you
brenna is still upset from the last call
hi brenna its mom
me and your neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday
crissy made a real cute card for you be sure to call her
will you be home for easter
call when you can
this hiss of brennas answering machine becomes the hiss of cooking
bandaged about the chest conor asleep on his cot
suddenly he sits up
he looks about the room in confusion as romirez enters with a plate of food
three days youve laid there
its time you ate
dazed this cant be
you are not dead boy
this is monstrous
ill burn in hell for all eternity
youd have to die first
extends forkful of food aqui
conor starts crying
what is to become of me
am i to wander the earth forever like a ghost
you will live
then they were right
i am evil
this is gods punishment
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod
oh my god
oh my god im lost
two days later
nearly healed conor and romirez stand near a quietly moving stream
why does he want to kill me
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less
it is always less with my living
far or near
but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before
there is power in this
and as long as you and i live the knight can never have it all
but we cannot be killed
there is an imperfection
for all your healing if your head ever leaves your neck you are dead
you can survive anything but steel against your threat
then it is over
how can i stop such a man
run to the ends of the earth till you learn
you must learn to defend yourself
in this i can help
we are brothers
and you are a defense beat of sorts
an old man mr
north leads taupin up the drive of a rural farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of pennsylvania
when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up
the money in the estate was enough to cover your costs
oh yes more than enough
furniture clad in white sheets
most of the furniture was put into protective storage
ill have some boys come up and clean the place out for you
taupin drags a finger across a dusty window pane
fascinated youre one of williams kids huh
his only kid
sure take after him
never seen a father and son look more alike
we were very close
the resemblance is amazing
when may i expect the cleaners
ill send them right up
coupled strangers gyrate under colored lights and recorded music
brenna sits alone
whatever nervousness she brought through the door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by the three empty glasses in front of her
with something less than perfect coordination sits down beside her
that stuffll put you away if youre not careful
there was a count
he would invite the local peasants to his chateau fill them full of wine then slice their bellies so he could reuse it
smiles the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me
youre very macabre
its my birthday
brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh
buy a birthday girl a drink
a small neighborhood tavern
regulars chat amicably with the sits alone at a corner table
a waitress hovers over him
lager and lime
taupins lager is drained
lost in thought he drags a finger around and around the lip of the mug
he hand stops
taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly out of control
he whirls around suddenly to see ling kahn asian standing over him
taupin is anxious poised for attack
kahn breaks into a broad smile
spare a chair
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night
kahn takes his place across the table
unsure how are you
head still secure to the neck
how did you find me
how many places this side of the atlantic serve lager and lime
taupin looks to his own glass
old habits die hard
to waitress waitress
a round of nitzhic
beat peasant drool i know
but its the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence
what are you doing here
it is the gathering my friend
the settling of old scores
and have you something to settle with me
smiles not tonight
tonight i have a drink with an old friend
its good to see you kahn
the waitress sets down two glasses
come toast with me the past
raises glass to old conquests old loves and to a time when we cared about either
kahn drains his glass
kahn and taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed government building
ill never forget the look on that papal commanders face when his heretic stronghold turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over neuvich
neuvich the clown of the crusades
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross climbs off his papal horse draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell
is going on
and what did neuvich dear dear drunken neuvich do
offered the pope one of his whores
a jogger stops on the gravel and listens to the strange conversation
had a great swing with his blade
for a pope
sighs good times then
a man could stretch his legs without bring ing half the world down around his ears
not like now
the jogger shakes his head and runs on
serious he found us even there
he always did
a clinking of chain link as taupin and kahn climb a fence and tumble into the washington zoo
i havent drunk this much since since you last saw me
kahn chucks an empty wine bottle
an unspecified animal growls sleepily somewhere in the darkness
taupin and kahn stumble through an open air display of asian animals
their voices seem to echo everywhere
i love zoos
ever since i was a kid
you were never a kid
kahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen
points at one i knew his great grandfather
we used to shoot pool together in rangoon
how do you do it kahn
how do you live so full of life for so long
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have
all else is just marking time
beat youre marking time
ive had a few more concerns
kahn jams his hands into his overcoat and starts down the footpath
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth
you dont run as hard macleod
you just dont run as hard anymore
the bar is nearly empty
no sign of the knight
brenna looks at her watch sighs and drops a bill onto the counter
brenna has left the bar and is now walking down a dimly lit street
she hears something and turns
a breeze rustles the trees above
after only a few more paces she hears something again
brenna abruptly turns
right into the face of the knight
the knight reaches into his leather carrying bag
exit a facing townhouse
the knight removes his hand from the bag as they spill onto the sidewalk laughing and yelling
brenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner
the knight follows at a measured distance
at the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off
brenna bolts into the intersection
weaving through screeching brakes she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors
well dressed patrons numbered cards pinned to their lapels sit in velvetly plush surroundings
at the front of the room stands a thin moustached art auctioneer
brenna bustles in from outside
i apoligize for the lateness of the hour but im sure you will all agree the quality of this years collection is well worth the time
the knight bursts in with his leather carrying bag
brenna slides along the draped back wall to avoid him
holding statuette for this fine example of medieval religious art let us open the bid at dollars
the knight closes in on brenna casually without hurry
brenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a security points at brenna
a bid at
no i the guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her very officially
being closed in on from both sides brenna suddenly runs across the room to a fire exit setting off an alarm as she flies open the door
the knight leaps after her knocking over an old woman in the front row
brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a metro station
brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car just as the doors shut
is also now on the platform but can only watch brenna through a window as the train pulls away
brenna knocks at the front door
she knocks harder
the unlatched door pushes open
brenna stands in the doorway
before her is a disaster
furniture has been smashed like matchsticks
a desk drawers contents lie strewn in piles on the floor
brenna enters slowly
i have to talk to you
nothing has been left unturned or unbroken
brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers
she comes across an old black and white photograph
badly streaked and faded it shows taupin standing beside a farm house
written in the corner is worstick
brenna slips the photo into her pocket
standing she turns smack into taupin
he looks past her to the destruction of his living room
it doesnt seem to surprise him
he tried to kill me last night
taupin sifts through the debris selecting articles from it
who is he
at the moment
he ignores the question
what will you do now
you neednt worry miss cartwright
ive been at this a very long time
he called you macleod
not your concern
i left a man dead in felton
but you dont really care do you
that bothers you
he was innocent
whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now
what about me
im a witness to a murder
that seems to put me pretty high on your friends chop list
have you gone to the police
im sure theyd love to hear your story
id rather hear yours
beat you are being foolish
im a historian mr
only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face
he walks to the doorway
why does he want to kill you
taupin stops his back to her
he sees me as a threat
taupin walks out the door
on a clear rise above the village romirez and conor spar with swords covered in heavy cloth
conor is having difficulty
me arm hurts
romirez easily blocks
you swing like an impotent cow
go to hell
oh the boy has a mouth now if only he had an arm
ticked off conor leans himself into a two fisted swing
romirez knocks it aside but conor recovers faster than he knocking romirez flat on his back
conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face
romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled from his belt
he offers it to conor
here my boy from vineyards as sweet and smooth as a young girls thigh
conor accepts the cup
romirez pulls himself to his feet
it will take less effort as you learn
its like to kill me first
romirez puts his arm around conor and refills his cup
you have a gift
one you must protect
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt
the fabric of life
the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another
shakes head if that was meant to be an ex planation mr
romirez from spain im afraid youve failed
romirez put his arm around conor and leads him away
enough sword play for an afternoon
a friendly horse race
their reflections bouncing off a clear glen conor and romirez dodge moss laiden ruts and leap fallen tree trunks
beaming conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait for romirez several lengths behind
as romirez rides up youre no match for scot mr
were raised as riders
point conceeded mr
both their eyes turn to the beauty in view
romirez pulls a leaf from a tree and studies it closely
what is the fascinatioon
it is only a leaf
all living things pay dues conor
they must be respected for that
he pulls the leafs points from the stalk one by one
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes
to feel it to know it is to be in touch with the will of every living thing
i do not think i like the sound of that
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds
but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening
for it gives you great strength
the strength of knowledge
the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be
i feel hardly nothing
you have not been fully trained
but you will learn
and you will be good i can feel that
you have apt itude
this is why our friend is so concerned
but why be so concerned about me
this power is divided amongst you me and others like cuts in a pie
but the cuts are not equal
some like you and he have more
i am a small player
but if by helping you i can keep that monster from being the last then perhaps my life has meant something
i am not ready for this
you must be
you have responsibilities
you must learn the rules
you can never attract attention to yourself never show the side that will draw others to you
you will always know when you are in the presence of another
but more importantly conor macleod will be your battle against time
in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat
people will become a transitory pathetic lot
the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent
but life without morality without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love is no life at all
that is how the others exist
nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last
keep your soul sewed to the earth
do not become one of them
you are young inexperienced
you do not know what time can do
how it can sap all pity all love
that is not me
with the proper tools conor a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one
a villager approaches from across the pasture
hate to be bothering you like this but me mare threw a shoe
conor looks to romirez
go ahead senor
gestures to wine i have my friend to keep me company
ill be back when i can
conor sets off across the pasture
romirez enters and flops onto a cot
settling down for a nap he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of children playing
the room is still
romirez begins to drowse
suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness
his hand moves under the cot
with an explosion the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments
passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the knight
without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine romirez
what a surprise
romirez is struggling under the debris
the knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg
the limb is severed
the knight begins casting aside the shelving
with lightning speed romirez pulls the sword from beneath the bed and hammers it deep into the knights side
he crashes back against the wall
romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword as a crutch
the knight has regained a meager balance on his knees
blood pours from the slice in his stomach romirez pushes himself across the bed plants his sword into the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing
oh santa maria
the knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees beside romirez
the knights trembling hands raise his shaking sword high
to hell with you
conor pounds at a horseshoe
the hammer slips from his grasp as he slumps forward as if pushed
badly wounded the knight staggers through the shattered doorway and tumbles into the street
pulling himself up the knight hobbles away
conor is running through the village
conor rushes in and shudders to a stop
an entire wall is showered with blood
conor walks slowly forward
as he looks down something takes his attention
it is romirezs severed head
conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood stained floor
his head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing
somewhere in the bowels of the museum the research librarian a wiry young man sits at his cluttered desk
brenna looms above him
come on brenna your ass is already in a sling dont drag me into it
all i need is for you to check the name
you talked to your supervisor lately
hes burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight
that on top of the cops bugging him
ill take care of that corey but i need this now
the librarian looks her over skeptically
corey you owe me
its that important
the librarian reluctantly reaches for his keys
holding brennas photograph the research librarian is comb ing through stained binders
the room is old disorganized and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must be in it somewhere
wilson know about this
im doing it on my own
good way to lose your job
card filing and cabinet dusting
four years in this dump and i havent written anything for wilson that a wounded yak couldnt do
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts
too bad no one else did
my job the people i get involved with im up to here with it
you always were hard to impress
the librarian pulls a binder and opens it
who is it
worsticks a town in pennsylvania
brenna enters and sits at her desk
she is looking for something
confused chris have you seen my notebook
chris is seated at the desk next to her
he points at the supervisors door
why that son of a bitch
the high backed office chair is spun away from an angry entering brenna
whats wrong wilson huh
not enough excitement in your own desk
what the hell were you looking for in mine
the chair turns
detective moran not her supervisor leafs through her notebook
you better have a warrant
thats my notebook youve got no right to be sticking your fingers into it
ive got a morgue filling up with bodies
thats my right
what do you want from me
well the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town
looks at notebook and all of a sudden the smithsonians ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons
brenna lifts the telephone receiver
im calling an attorney
you and i should talk first
weve got nothing to say
moran presses the post on the phone
what are you going to tell them
that youre protecting a man whos killed four people
all fashionably without heads
spare me the details
but theres more
wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton delaware
some locals spotted two cars with d
plates and surprise surprise they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin
what are you getting at moran
youve been a busy little beaver
especially with that records mess up in church hill
looks at notebook your notes are very complete
naturally my feelings were crushed when you didnt rush right over and tell us what you knew
looks up in fact were considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder
itll never stick
but we might just give it the ole college try
what with the court back ups it could be days before you got an arraignment
but then im sure the flunk out neice of the d
knows all about that
youre an asshole moran
i want taupin
what makes you so sure hes the one
just for laughs we raided wonder boys house
there was a gallon of one of the corpses blood in his carpet
i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year
whats all of this got to do with me
what were you doing in felton
if your pal was there i never saw him
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together
knows hes bluffing never take up poker detective
dont be stupid lady
your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone elses
brenna reaches across and lifts her notebook
why dont you wait until it comes out in paperback
moran watches her leave
he lifts the telephone receiver
striding out into the corridor brenna passes dennis the cop from her bedroom leaning against the doorway
i warned you
go to hell
a priest celebrates mass in a present day cathedral
in the rear of the church apart from the other parishioners sits the knight
as the priest leads the parishioners through the procession of faith the knight alone repeats it quietly to himself in latin the ancient language of the church
crooked tombstones strewn across the bleached ground of a place not beloning to reality
in full medieval tartan conor stands against a forceful wind
run the length plain spewing forth steam and staggering skeletons
there are dozens of them all carrying their skulls under one arm
the skeletons press forward and trap conor against the trunk of a dead oak
the heads break into harsh demonic laughter
conor puts his hands over his ears in pain as the bodies push forward
screaming he disappears under a mass of gleaming bones
taupin wakes from the dream with a shout
he has fallen asleep in a desk chair
taupin walks to a window and looks out to the green hills
to the distance
brennas sedan shoots down a country highway
checking her rear view mirror brenna notices two suspicious figures in a car behind her
brenna pulls to the side
the car from behind passes without incident
brenna is driving again
listening now to the radio she casts a glance in the mirror
the same car is behind her
passing over a rise in the highway brenna turns abruptly onto a service road and behind a group of trees
pauses a moment at the intersection then drives on
brenna shows the proprietor the photograph
he explains something to her
brenna steps outside the store onto the main street of the very small community of worstick
brenna passes a small monument settled in a flower bed
it has a plaque memorializing five locals murdered in
a mile out of town brenna stops at a farmhouse
she checks it against the photo she found at taupins townhouse
you shouldnt have come
brenna whirls around and sees taupin behind her
were you followed
he looks to the road
no one knows youre here
i had to talk to you
you had to do nothing
youre a fool
taupin strides through the doorway
brenna and taupin enter
a heavy broad sword sits on the coffee table
is this what you killed them with
youve been listening to rumors
our cars were seen together in felton
theyre calling me an accessory to murder
theyre stuck with each other
theres several bedrooms down the hall
take your pick
the room is a strange decor
th century paintings hang beside grotesque medieval carvings
brennas face softens with worry
what is she doing
a plain clothed police officer is in mid conversation
no thats the last place we saw her
okay will do
he hangs up
shrugs we keep looking
taupin sits at his desk
before him is spread out blank birth certificates driver licenses and title deeds
his eyes lift to the corridor where brenna is
an idea has come to him
whats all that
richard taupin has become cumbersome
it would be best if he just disappeared
brenna walks to the window
you did kill those men
not all of them
when you finish what then
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr
you make it all sound so simple
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property ive aquired
that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg
but thats where you come in
you want me to front for you
the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better
you as mrs
taupin will attract considerably less attention than i
brenna is unsure
not such a bad trade
the story of a lifetime for a few days work
detective moran looks through the broken remains of the living room
an inspector enters
they lost her outside of thurmont
moran sighs and tosses a piece of wood on the pile of debris
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff
figure shes with him
we ran down that church hill info
there is no richard taupin
any other i
s come up
called fbi yesterday
thompsons going to try cia this afternoon
shrugs ynever know
moran rises and dons his coat
should have seen him the first night
son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didnt even blink
youd think hed had practice
moran walks to the door
i think he has
conor now major dupont of the french infantry pours over battle plans
an aide dressed as conor dupont in th century european military garb enters the command area
the men are assembled major
a general stands beside the major
see that they are indeed ready dupont
a regiment of infantrymen pale blue coat tails tossing in the light breeze stand at attention
a staff sargeant presents the men to dupont
regiment ready for review sir
dupont walks past the sargeant to the line
to soldier stand straight you are a soldier of the king
dupont continues down the line
another soldiers infantry jacket is almost hilariously mis buttoned one collar sticking up four inches higher than the other
dupont with both hands rips open the soldiers coat spraying brass buttons onto the ground
he moves on
to soldier where is your bayonet
lost it sir
the soldier hedges
you heard the major
duponts face softens in exasperation then toughens
hand it to me
the soldier obeys
dupont inspects the firing mechanism
the flint is cracked
no spark will reach your powder
you will die tomorrow
he throws the rifle roughly back into the soldiers hands
tomorrow you go to battle
and you look like children
beat the general has charged me with seeing that you are prepared and prepared you will be
if necessary you stand here all night
the sargeant leaps to attention
see to it
dupont turns briskly then stops abruptly as if alerted by some thing
he whirls around and faces the young infantrymen
his expression is quizzical as he walks the line checking each face carefully
one private seizes his attention
the private is cautious
it is as if dupont knows him
the two stare at each other
dupont turns and leaves
inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officers quarters dupont conor and several others eat their evening meal
a captain finishes his story
amused and what a sight
that old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her
the officers laugh
all but dupont
beside dupont complete your inspection
theyre nothing but boys
it will be a slaughter tomorrow
laughs i doubt much can change that
the enemy has five brigades waiting for us
we need more time
wont get it
shrugs we are a sacrifice
dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate
eat up dupont
it will probably be your last
rises not likely
dupont goes to the window
dusk shines orange on his face
in the foreground the man dupont encountered at the line up mulet is chopping firewood
several hours later
most are asleep
mulet continues his wood splitting
from out of the dark cottage steps dupont
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking
what is your position
i understand you joined up in bremen
you seem to understand a great deal
i am a major private
you would do well remembering that when addressing me
excuse me sir
i thought we spoke as equals
shrugs if you wish to play games major
mulet returns to his chore
i think we understand each other
we have no understanding
then it is time two of us did
you are very young
i was once young
i can help
ive seen others help
somehow a head always ended up on the counter
it can be different
it must be
it never changes major
mulet turns to his chore
dupont grabs his arm
we must talk
shakes him off stay out of it
angry dont threaten me private
disgust who do you think i am
one of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow
you and i just living will always be a threat
look at your life major
look at mine
nothing there but threat
threats and nothingness
its what we live for
mulet turns his back on dupont
dupont draws his cutlass
do not turn your back on me
you are really going to force this arent you
either you are with me or against me
mulet turns slowly axe in hand
have i a choice
the two stare into eyes empty of emotion
mulets hand flinches
dupont cuts quickly slicing open both of mulets arms
the axe drops to the ground
mulet seems strangely calm
you see major
you are not so different
dupont cuts off mulets head where he stands
dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into a swamp
it is very late
only a few officers are seated in the pews
dupont tries to concentrate on prayer but is distracted
voice flashback you see major
you are not so different
i had no choice
dupont sighs and looks to the altar
who am i deceiving
certainly not me
dupont whirls around to see the knight dressed as he in uniform sitting one row behind
dupont leaps to his feet
you neednt look so flushed major
you are quite safe in church
dupont eases his breathing
state of grace and all that
its all we have
dupont has backed up a few paces
all this time and still a scared little boy
dupont sits down
not so scared
smiles you seem to have misplaced a private
no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck
you surprise me
eliminating a rival like that
such are the actions of a man of conquest
i was mistaken
years have turned the boys fear into ambit ion
i know you very well conor macleod
and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you
mulet romirez they were fools without vision
it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players
the knight almost seems proud of dupont
romirez is dust
the knight looks to the altar
finish your prayers
smiles our common heritage
beat i am your only real friend you know
the only one who truly understands you
rises i look forward to the day we meet again
and i kill you
the knight leans forward and puts his face very near
you cant stay in church forever
the knight moves into the aisle
good night major
conor sits in the dim church alone
richard taupin sits against the stone of an old catholic church
a long weary sigh
taupin and brenna sit at a table working on forms
taupin looks up from his work and studies brennas face without malice
brenna and taupin are taking a walk along the townships outskirts
crossing a small bridge over a smaller creek they encounter the elderly caretaker mr
north and his eight year old grandson
both with fishing poles
such a pretty day
if i live to be ill never tire of mornings like this
mind you im now
when you get older your priorities change
its the simple things that count
without them growing old can be a very lonely thing
im sure thats true
the grandson is having difficulty baiting his line
taupin bends down beside the young fisherman
takes worm here
the hook should go just below the head where the meat is toughest
taupins show of affection surprises brenna
show you a trick
taupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them around the hook
fish are creatures of habit
they like their food where theyre used to it
at the top hiding in old leaves
where did you learn that
my father taught me
your father must be smart
yes he was
brenna is touched
brenna lies on her bed thinking
she puts on a robe and walks into the living room
taupin sits before the fireplace its flames reflecting on his brandy glass
brenna moves quietly to a seat beside him
eyes on the fireplace there was a man once
just a simple woodcarver
but he understood
more than anyone he could see to the heart of it
beat it never ends
today is the same as the first
tomorrow will be the same as today
so much time
and all of it wasted
beat you love history
i wish i could
brenna looks through a property zoning book
walking past small town stores brenna allows herself a moment to window shop
is a small poster advertising a community get together
brenna peels it off the glass and slips it into her notebook
brenna and taupin go over various forms and documents
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward
just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg
brenna is silent
beat so what now
we just wait
well as long as were stuck here
she hands him the poster from earlier
its some sort of party the town is throwing
they do it each year
i thought it might be a nice break from all of this
taupin stacks the documents into a folder
maybe it would do us both good
theres a catch
youre supposed to wear th century clothing
taupin is going through an old trunk
my father was something of a junk collector
he comes across a long period dress and offers it to brenna
here try this
i suppose theyre still making women the same as back then
a little dusty
taupin fishes through the trunk and comes up with an old top hat
he turns it over in his hand with stoic memory
conor and a beautiful young woman katherine sit on the porch steps in s period dress
other young couples relax nearby enjoying the warm summers twilight
katherines mother shuffles between the couples offering lemonade cakes and the like
do it again
she is thoroughly charmed by conor
conor wraps a length of yarn about his fingers
by turning his hand over and bending his knuckles just so the web becomes the outline of a lion
growls katherine is delighted
conor starts to remove the yarn
katherine touches his arm
what would you like
conor cups his hands bends his fingers and comes up with a four leaf clover
where did you ever learn it
conor shoots a glance for the mother then kisses katherine softly
youll be leaving the girl alone
a young man stands a few yards from the stairs
do you have cause to bothering us
thats my girl
david weve already spoken of this
hes not what he pretends to be
conor climbs to his feet
you best leave son
you think youre so high and mighty coming into town and taking a mans woman
well i know about you
i know about the things you do
moving closer i said you best leave
youd like that wouldnt you
to katherine ask him about his friends
the ones he meets in the town square
ask him about the blade he keeps beneath his bed
conor grabs the youths collar and pulls him close
like ice leave
while you still can
the youth pushes away from the grasp
you dont frighten me
the young man throws a fist at conor
it is easily blocked
conor returns with a savage blow to the chest that knocks the young man gasping onto the ground
katherine runs up behind and grabs conors outstretched arm
please dont hurt him
coughing painfully the youth climbs to his feet and staggers away
hes not what you think
he turns and runs down the road
hes not what you think
katherine turns to conor his face still locked in ice
i dont care who you are or where you come from
she hugs him tightly
i love you
conors face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her
an auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and strung paper into a small town party
teenagers in period dress control the floor dancing to a decidedly un period rock band
the older guests are gathered around the punch bowl talking crops or pennsylvania politics
fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress enters with taupin himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape
his clothes fit perfectly
north comically dressed as a pirate greets them
glad you could make it
best get some punch before its gone
near the whole valley showed up
they go to the table
taupin pours a glass of punch
an elderly woman approaches him
if i didnt know better id say william taupin
taupin is up from washington to look over his fathers estate
your father died some years ago
this is your first visit
the tone is snide
i suppose a taupin had to show up eventually
walks away good evening mrs
she turns in surprise at his knowing her name then walks on
what was all that about
thats not meant for you
just some didnt take much to your father
my father was never one for social whirls
kept to himself for sure
then with all that business in
family down the road from the taupin place was murdered
all cut up they were
two strangers were also found with the bodies
no one ever accused william but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town folks just never forgot
most were relieved when they heard hed died
nothing to be sorry about
just your pappy scared some
the rock band finished as a portly man in a union soldiers uniform takes the microphone
all right the kids have had their fun
now its time for a little more traditional dancing
the rock band gives ground to a group of older musicians
with a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles and hammer dulcimer
the costumed guests take to the floor
i dont know any of these
ill make a fool of myself
taupin starts into it with perfect grace
a faltering brenna tries to keep up
william taupin seems to have left his mark
and you are william taupin arent you
they do a final turn and finish
the other dancers applaud
youre using your sons name
just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to
when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it
twenty years later i became the son
brenna is staring at him
he leads her to a table
then you must be at least years old
several of the elderly women are watching taupin from across the room
a bus with gettysburg across the front pulls to a stop at a dark terminal
a lone passenger steps off into the mist
it is the knight bound up in a leather jacket and carrying only a long narrow case
brenna and taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall
its frightening sometimes the way you talk about other peoples lives
a factor of age
i hope i never get that old
brenna pulls away
i must be insane
leaving work ditching cops
all to follow a murderer
a very old murderer but a murderer just the same
why are you here
ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article im going to write
but its not
looks at him squarely its you
im not even sure why
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses
i cant stand it
but youre different
its in your hands
you are a very perceptive young woman
just a little crazy
a thoughtful pause
miss cartwright its time i showed you something
taupin and brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall
taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something
a press from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway
gestures to interior miss cartwright
brenna steps uneasily into the darkness
taupin follows and switches on the light
brennas expression changes to awe
the room is massive a cross between a museum and an old attic
suits of armor italian statuettes czech ironworks persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space
the room has the look of ownership as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook
the sight is overwhelming
i had this room built some time ago
brenna picks up a carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along its intricate weaving
who are you
that would be difficult to explain
id like you to try
taupin picks up a byzantine icon brushing the dust from its shoulders
i was born conor macleod in the village of ardvrek on the high land plain of strathnaver in the clan of macleod under the king of scotland
on the eleventh of december
he replaces the icon
i have served in the armies of twelve nations married nine women fathered thirty eight children and buried them all
taupin walks along the cases
i carried that rifle in world war i
this book is a th century policy report for the king of austria
the diploma is my con ference of degree in latin from trinity college
beat it goes on
thats why smith called you macleod
he knows about you
he is older than i
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction
sometimes i think its just for something to do
a conquest to be the last
something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away
some thing to replace the love that can never work
there is something more
i didnt kill the watchman
you killed those other two
not the same
what about that family in
sometimes innocents become involved
you and your buddy make a real team dont you
exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between
there are differences
you kill with your left hand
i havent killed you
is that a threat
taupin moves very close
brennas face softens
she turns away
come here brenna
he kisses her
relatives in period dress watch as a family member is lowered into the ground
a very old woman stands stoically supported on both sides by her middle aged sons
may god commend into his kingdom the soul of our dear departed jason son of katherine the old woman
and brother to howard and james the two middle aged sons
watches the funeral quietly at a distance
as the minister continues allows her gaze to wander
she sees conor standing at the treeline
her eyes crinkle in disbelief
releasing herself from her sons she hobbles toward conor
confused the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony
watches the woman approach but decides against moving
she stops a few paces away and looks over him
what are you doing here
i owe him this
he never knew you
the two sons come up behind
the three stand there an old woman who could be years conors senior and her two sons old enough to be his father
is something wrong mother
this is your father
taupin and brenna lie together
running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds
taupin strokes her softly
in celtic is means woman with raven hair
only chieftans daughters were allowed it
brenna is lost in taupins scars
what is it like
fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you
it can never last and in the end you always end up destroying both
but youre known so much
history ill only read about
its all the same
half lives that never go away
what is it you want
all of it finished
taupin and brenna stand beside her car
she has an armload of documents
gettysburgs an hours drive at most
you should be back by nightfall
will i see you again
dont stay any longer than you have to
brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly into the car
detective moran and his inspector walk among parked squad cars
are you sure
wont know till the records department comes back with it this after noon
looks good though
they found the receipt in his townhouse
it was pretty smeared but had taupins father listed as a signatory
round up who you can and put them on standby
think we should call the local p
out there first
i want this to be all ours
brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack
taupin thats all i need
the clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her
just take this down the hall to the regis trar
hurry up though its near closing time
most everyones gone home already
a pair of levis follow brenna at a distance down the corridor
sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors two clerks sit in an office mostly cleared of employees
brenna hands the slip to a clerk
ill be right back
she disappears into the rear area
to other clerk do you have a drinking fountain
around the corner
brenna steps around and takes a drink
she looks into her reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling with her hair
still hasnt returned
brenna drums her fingers on the counter top and looks around the office
the second clerk is also gone
brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerks desk
she steps over to it
it is a large blood stain
brenna shoots a glance to the double doors
brenna rushes to the doors
someones locked them
she struggles with the handles then turns to see the knight walking to her with his stained sword
with a scream she kicks a rolling office chair into him and runs down an opposite corridor
flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a slam of his palm
has run out of corridor
she looks back at the knight closing the distance
crying in fear she frantically searches for a way out
the knight is nearly upon her
in desperation she runs into a janitorial closet closing its heavy door
is dark and full of old paint cans and mops
her breathing is at a panic
tries the door handle
stepping back he lifts his sword and hammers it deep into the wood
crying oh god
he strikes again
splinters smack against surround ing walls
oh god go away
crying hysterically brenna presses herself against the far wall sliding to the floor in a crouch
steps back and gives the door a last two fisted swing
the door collapses
a group of unmarked police cars race by with the last light of day
at the wheel is morans assistant the inspector
taupin stands at his fireplace the only light in the room poking at it with a tong
his gaze goes to a mantle clock
it is pm
the phone rings
he looks to it
it rings again
he picks up the receiver slowly and places it against his ear
we have some unfinished business
are you here
i want you to come to me
and if i refuse
give me an address where i can forward miss cart wrights head
this affects him
yes laddie i have her
should i care
you have three hours
the unmarked cars shoot by
taupin hangs up the phone
he looks to the sword on the table reflecting the firelight
police officers placed around taupins house are cocking shotguns and chambering pistols
two officers take positions on either side of the door
a third after getting the signal kicks the door open
the officers drop to firing positions in the doorway
the room is empty
an officer bursts in
the inspector is on the phone
hes not here
spotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding blackness
taupins face moves into frame
sword firmly in one hand taupin climbs the monuments steps
a twenty five foot bronze of thomas jefferson flanked by his quotations
a sword in one hand and brenna in the other the knight stands at the statues base
taupin stands at the entrance
kahn sends his best
in a corner the asians head lies on its side the horror of death still pressed into the face
taupins eyes return slowly to the knight and brenna
let her go
the knight throws brenna roughly against a wall
you disappoint me
looks at brenna i thought youd finally gotten over that sort of thing
leave her out of this
as you wish
the knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle
taupin does the same
the weapons are clanked together twice then pulled back into battle position
the two begin walking a circle poised swords waiting for an opening
the knight leaps first his clash of steel ringing off the high walls
another attack without result
you can do better than that
the knight jumps back
sweat gleams from their brows
two lovers enjoy a late night walk along the tidal basin
there is a distant clanking of metal
its from over near the memorial
he jumps up on a rock
several yards away can be seen two figures attacking each other
standing at a map of the city moran nurses a cup of coffee
the phone rings
all right get a patrol unit out there right away
ill meet them
the knight and taupin are panting heavily
the knight goes low
the knight comes overhead quickly
taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his shoulder and chest
the impact knocks him flat on his back
the knight looks down on his wounded prey
a screech of brakes from outside the monument
two officers are coming up the steps
the officers reach the top and enter
one of the officers is dennis who sees only a crying brenna and taupin lying wounded on the floor
the knight rushes up from behind his sword in full swing
morans car blows through a cross street
moran is at the wheel
the knight walks from the two officers spread out like rag dolls on the floor
to taupin get up
taupin looks at brenna and the dead policemen
a resignation sweeps over him
whats the point
this isnt done
whats the point
you have me finish it
i have waited forever for this
you will not cheapen it little boy
its all we have
go to hell
the knight looks to brenna
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play
leave her alone
taupin struggles to his feet
blood pouring from his shirt he stands uneasily with his sword at ready
the knight swings
moran drives up
there is an empty police car the door still ajar
taupin is badly outclassed
he feebly fends off an attack but the knight returns quickly with a savage slice that rips open taupins stomach and throws him again to the floor
leave him alone
you will be silent
the voice is thundering
taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor
his teeth grind in pain
the knight smiles
i do hope youre enjoying this as much as me
stands in the entryway
the knight sees him
moran draws his pistol
the knight walks toward him this is nothing that concerns you
moran levels his gun
the knight raises his sword
you will leave
two explosions as moran fires
the slugs slam into the knight blowing him off his feet
he lies still
moran looks to brenna
then he walks closer to the knight
taupin curls in a spasm of pain
moran moves closer
the knight lies face down blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart
he isnt breathing
moran bends over slowly to see the knights face
you dont understand
the knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into morans chest
the pistol discharges against a far wall
taupin crawls for the knight
morans mouth opens but no sound escapes
the knight blood pouring from his mouth and nose thrusts deeper then retracts quickly
moran slides off the sword dead
taupin cuts hard against the knights chest
the knight gags in surprise and crumples
taupin cuts again then puts the blade against the knights gurgling throat
in mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum
auditorium nostrum in nomine domine
he raises the sword
requiescant in pace
and cuts the knights head off
taupin drops his sword
his breathing quickens
a sensation sweeps over him
taupin drops to the floor whimpering
he sucks in painful gulps of air
taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing
taupin is looking past her
a blood stained hand suddenly grabs brennas shoulder
the headless body of the knight stands beside her
lies on the floor
the eyes open
the face pulls into a smile
and now you know
the eyes roll up into the skull
the face slackens
the hulking mass standing beside brenna sways the collapses to the ground
not from wounds he no longer feels but from something else
i cant stand it
oh god i cant stand it
brenna kneels beside him
the scream of your blood
the shriek of trees
what is it
im the last
oh christ im the last one
taupin doubles over in pain
the pain of the whole world trying to force itself into him
brenna tries to hold him
he pushes her savagely away
ill destroy you
ive destroyed everything ive ever touched
he doubles over in pain
he grabs his sword and threatens her
sobbing brenna runs from the memorial
taupin is alone
brenna at work in the research area
something is missing from her
brenna stands in the street before taupins townhouse
a boarded up window
a for sale sign
taupin is gone forever
as if he never was
a single light
a cup of coffee
brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface
it is at last her journal article
she types a line then rips it from the carriage and tears it to pieces
the thoughts wont come
brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group of wild park cats
a shadow covers her face
she looks up
it is taupin
something has changed him
his face is less cynical
he sits down on the grass beside her
after a moment what are we supposed to say
the cats eyes are all fixed in taupin
they cautiously shrink away frightened
the years and years of void
bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness
who would have guessed
taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him
it is the gift and the under standing of life
you have lived forever
life is only life when it is bounded by death
the inheritance is death
the gift is the finality of life
to be part of the fabric
turns to brenna i love you brenna
brennas chin quivers
it will be horrible
i may die tomorrow or tomorrows
i can promise you nothing
nothing but a moment
but a moment of love is that not worth a lifetime
he holds her
they hold each other
its taken me so long
so very long
a jogger runs by unaware of any life but his own
