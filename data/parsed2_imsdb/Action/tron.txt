gordon special thanks to bryan duarte for the physical copy of the script based on the screenplay by steven lisberger and bonnie macbird prod
fourth draft screenplay by charlie haas april on one side of the screen computer programming language is being printed and we hear the sound of an electronic keyboard
in the center of the screen glowing lines inscribe a rough computer simulation of a figure in response to the programming
gradually the figure is completed and refined as we hear a resonant voice speaking
as astonishing advances in computer science are made artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life
we see that the completed form is man like heroic and muscular wearing a form of flexible armor
the face is calm handsome and intelligent
as the voice continues the form becomes rounded by the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate
in a world wide network of electronics they travel through miles of circuitry at the speed of light
we created them to calculate and research to help us design and heal and think
with all that they can do are they only electrical impulses
or are they a new form of life
the figure is rotated completely around and as it comes back to face us a glowing disk appears beside it again in response to the programming printed out at the
side of the screen
the disk moves towards the man like figure and is rotated into position above it
as the voice reaches the final word the disk is slammed into place on the back of the figure
there is an explosion of colored light a resounding crash of music and the title appears across the top of the screen in huge letters
the music continues as the glow fades and we see that the figure has become real a living being although filled with glowing light as if it had an inner
core of electricity
the following is a series of quick cuts in montage style as the opening titles roll
the montage takes place in two worlds the electronic world and the real world
the electronic world is a mirror of our own consisting of the electronic information in our computers television sets and telecommunications network
it is peopled by computer programs data and the characters from countless video games
for the first time we are seeing their world as it really is rather than through the window of television screens
two other electronic figures standing on a glowing grid against a dark background
each holds a bar between his fists and as a buzzer sounds a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them completely encasing them
as the cycles take off
we see that each leaves a solidifying laser trail behind it
one turns abruptly creating a wall in front of the other
screen of a video game the real world version of light cycles as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear
we see teenagers strangely lit from below with bluish light their hands on electronic controls levers knobs
we hear electronic beeping and popping
futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid like landscape
one fires and the other disappears when it is hit to reappear spinning wildly in the distance
we hear a sound like a crack of lightning
a video game in an arcade
on the screen is a typical version of tank wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a d maze
two other game warriors on the grid this time throwing glowing disks at one another like frisbees
we see the one colored blue throw his disk smashes into the second warrior and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines
a video game called berserk in which a human character throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze we see a quick glimpse of the screen then cut to
a group of people staring down laughing
another game in progress from a long shot
a version of jai alai in which the two players stand suspended in space on glowing colored rings and throw a pellet of solid energy at each other
he is huge evil looking
his body is enormous his head mechanical
this is sark
he glows ominously blue
he is catching the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller glowing yellow
fearful nervous poised on one ring
sneering as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet back with violent force
desperately trying to catch the pellet but it smashes into the ring which explodes into a million pieces
one last glimpse of the yellow warriors tortured desperate face as he falls to instant death
high above him etched in enormous glowing computer printed d block letters are the words distant echoing aagh
god lisa i almost had you that time
we see two teenagers playing a table model video game where we can see the words winner blue printed
the game console is prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer icom
lemme play you again
holds out a hand yeah if youve got another quarter
sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough looking blue warriors are lounging around leaning against the walls sitting on the floor against the wall
they look up as sark comes in and one of them calls out sark my man
you are hot
that knuckleball gets em every time boy
sark and the other blue warriors laugh raucously and sark moves on
overlooking the video game grid
we see sark walking onto the bridge removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly
a buzzer is sounding
sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a sigh of satisfaction
the buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a cylinder forming around sark at first translucent and then solidifying so that we cant see through it and sark
is hidden from view
of this happening
we can see the inside surface of the cylinder a wavering image of a stretched out face just features appears superimposed on the cylinder
the face speaks
youre getting brutal sark
brutal and needlessly sadistic
the feet sockets glow and we see sark absorbing the energy like a drug addict eyes glazed
you master control
we might be capturing some military programs soon
that interest you
sure id love to go up against some of these guys
be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me
which branch of the service
strategic air command
sark impressed nice
the sockets glow more intensely as the hologram disappears and we cut from a close shot of sarks satiated face to long darkened sinister
a dejected and disheveled character crom is being escorted by a guard
look this is all a mistake
im just a compound interest program i work at a savings and loan
i cant play in these video games
sure you can pal
youre a natural athlete i ever saw one
are you kidding
i run out to check an the t bill rates i get out of breath
youre gonna make my user mr
henderson really mad
hes a full branch manager
rolls his eyes great another religious nut
they stop in front of a cell the guard opens the door and shoves the protesting captive inside
the door slams shut locked
as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guards shove
the cell is small one man and in each wall next to the door an opening gives a view of the next cell
through one of the windows we can see the back of another captive program and through the other a face looking over at the newcomer
the character speaks welcome to luxury living
the new captive looks up nervous
uh thanks but
i dont even know what im doing here
you believe in the users
sure if i dont have a user then who wrote me
thats what youre doing here
master control programs been snapping up all us programs who believe
if he thinks youre useful he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger
an if he cant use you he sends you down here to the game grid to get the bits blasted outta you
whats your name
theyll train you for the games but
well i hope you make it okay
hey whats going on in the other sectors
ive been stuck in this grid for microcycles
he points to several hash marks on his cell wall
its murder out there
you cant even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that master control creep
hauling me down here to play games
who does he calculate he is
holds his head in his hands if only tron was still around
he looks up as ram makes a noise under his breath
ram has a strange still expression on his face
you ever see that guy in action
hundred percent independent
mcp couldnt tell him what to he stops
ram is looking over his shoulder
continuing whats wrong
what did i say
theres a slight noise from cell beyond rams
it turns slowly silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor
he gasps and stares
oh my user
tron theyve got you in here
with ram to one side smiling slightly and crom staring
not for long friend
here in a maze of complex pathways we see a lone tank moving along one of the paths
a lone program sits at the controls
his armor is worn and beaten and his glow subdued
this is clu
with his thermos of glowing coffee and his suicide jockey manner he reminds us of a truck driver on an all night run
think we can merge into this memry okay good buddy
a spot of glowing light zips around the tank stops and expands into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as it speaks
as soon as it is finished speaking it goes back to being pure light
now ol flynn said to look over in here
the tank makes a quick run through a maze like path with rounded corners a computer memory microcircuit
but i dont see what hes looking for
id better get over to that input output tower and let him know
at the instrument panel
a shot over the shoulder of a figure typing on a computer terminal keyboard talking to himself in a low voice
he stop typing waits for some information to read out
beyond him we see a couple of large video parlor game consoles
come on you scuzzy little data be in there
hes a young blonde guy in his mid twenties
very attractive charming innocent looking but with a devilish gleam in his eye
ive got such nice blue paper to print you out on if youll just sit still
we zoom in on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of the crt screen reflected there
the tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall glowing tower an input output component
a red light flashes on the control panel
clu comes alert and sits up
he stares at the warning
spot of light that is bit zips up next to his head
we got company
coming into shape again but red this time no
you said it
one of those recognizers comes after me gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream
we see flynn sit up abruptly and his fingers start flying over the keys
we see the turret of the tank swivel around
in the distance is an immense block like robotic bluish black form u shaped with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes a recognizer
it hovers above the ground
a second reco is coming up behind the first
in dismay oh my
the long arm o the law
fires a volley at the first reco
that one falls heavily to the ground and the tank speeds up swiveling around to try to fire at the second reco but it moves too fast and cant avoid
the tank goes in and is stuck no traction
clu standing on it
the bit zips by him and they both head away from the tank fast
a glowing static field appears between the two legs of the recognizer and it sweeps over the tank de rezzing it
we can see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape
running looking up as the reco closes in
we see the dead reco up ahead and the streak of the bit making for it
reacting in fear looking up as the screen goes to black
shot of the screen
a complex set of programming figures ends abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen over and over gradually filling it completely
he tries clearing the monitor but the repeating line just comes right back monotonously moving across the screen
shot of the screen hold as we clu is in electronic energy ring chains his feet in sockets like sarks but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly
hovering in front of him is the hologram of the mcp
beside clu stands one of the memory guards
got a pirate program here
says his names clu
the mpc responds in the manner of a b movie police sergeant grilling a suspect
whatd he pull
came into the system with a stolen password
an we caught him tryin to raid a high clearance memory
looks up his face wracked with pain no
i mustve gotten in there by mistake i the pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets momentarily becomes unbearable
who programmed you
the guard gives clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness
youre in trouble pal
but if you tell us who put you up to it you could make it easy on yourself
come on whos your user
forget it mister high n mighty master control
youre not makin me talk
the feet sockets really let loose and clu screams in agony but doesnt speak
suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into electric static
get me dillinger
we seem at first to be in the electronic world still flying over a vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light
while this is our impression and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding scene we hear the sound o
of a phone ringing as heard by the party placing the call
then the click of the receiver being picked up and a male voice dillingers answering hello
hello please hold a moment for the master control program as we fly over the grid descending the image comes into clearer focus and we realize that this is not
a circuit board but rather an actual landscape a suburban grid at twilight
we are approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish accurately
as we descend a thumping rhythmic noise gradually increases in volume until it is very loud and we realize it is the sound of a helicopter and we are in
the cockpit looking down at the landscape
we just become aware of this fact when the sound of a conversation begins obviously between the pilot of the copter and a passenger
will you be around for a while or are you going right back out
oh ill stick around a few days
got some things to take care of
the camera pulls around for a view of the helicopter from behind and off to the side
it is a beautiful gleaming jet black machine
in spotless reflective silver paint the letters icom are written across one entire side
it is obviously state of the art technology
we see dillingers face looking out of the window as the helicopter approaches the icom building an enormous tower
on top of the building
several technicians are at hand and as the helicopter touches down they rush out to secure it
a huge wall sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid like suburban landscape
dillinger stands behind a table
we see that the entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal
his fingers punch out a code on the touch sensitive keyboard and we see printed out on the screen request access to master control program user code dillinger
the computers screen clears and the master control program addresses dillinger simultaneously speaking in a human sound voice through a pair of studio quality stereo speakers and printing out its
words on the computer screen the mcps voice is the same as that of the bad cop who grilled clu but its tone is now that of a compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient
thanks for coming back early
dillinger settles into a chair
no problem master c
if youve seen one consumer electronics show
shrugs whats up
its our friend the boy detective
hes nosing around again
it felt like flynn
hes still looking for that old file
cant you just appropriate it
i would if i could find it
its stashed somewhere off in the system
out of my range
meanwhile he might find it
im afraid so
i spotted him this time and kicked him out but hes getting trickier all the time
i think wed better shut off all access till we can find that file
just to be safe
percent chance youre right
end of line
dillinger watches as the computer screen wipes blank
close shot of a very messy desk with a coffee cup and half an egg salad sandwich lying on top of the computer console with fingers visible typing on the
of alan bailey blearily looking at the screen hes a serious looking man in his early thirties wearing wire rimmed glasses and he looks like he hasnt slept for a
on top of the terminal is a small tonka toy shogun warrior and to one side is an ancient popcorn maker and a bottle of crisco oil
pinned to one wall is a small sign reading gort klaatu barada nikto
alan types into the touch keyboard request access to the tron program user code bailey
he starts to type again but the screen clears and surprised huh
he pushes his chair back leaves his office
dillinger opens the door welcoming alan
come on in
the algorithms on cloud seeding
great piece of work
hows it going
he waves alan to a chair they sit
well i dont know
i just tried to run this program ive been working on and i was denied access all of a sudden
i thought maybe id been laid off and nobody told me
oh you have group access dont you
we have to close that down just briefly
someone with that access has been tampering
i hope you dont think its me
i dont even balance my checkbook on downtime
ive got a honeywell at home for that
no no im sure but you understand
it should only be a couple of days
whats the thing youre working on
its called tron
its a security program itself actually
monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems
if it finds anything going on thats not scheduled it shuts it down
i sent you a memo on it
part of the master control program
no itll run independently
it can watchdog the mcp as well
well we should have you running again in a couple of days i hope
ok alan rises goes to the door
as soon as he leaves trouble oh boy
the master control program comes back to life on the screen and through the speakers
ed i am so very disappointed in you
im sorry sharply i cant afford to have an independent program monitoring me
do you have any idea how many outside systems ive gone into
how many programs ive appropriated
nods its my fault
i programmed you to want so much
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week
it shouldnt be any harder than general motors was
this is what i get for using humans
now wait a minute i wrote you
ive gotten times smarter since then
what do you want with the pentagon
the same thing i want with the kremlin
im bored with corporations
with the information i can access i can run things to times better than any human
if you think you wouldnt want me to dig up flynns file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times would you
you wouldnt dare
so do as i tell you
keep that tron program out of the system
and get me those chinese language program i asked for
end of line
we see alan push open the door under a sign reading laser research
alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass window through which the laser laboratory is visible
a sign over the window marked experiment in progress is illuminated by a red warning bulb
of two white suited figures visible through a network of two white suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that encloses the giant laser structure
they are standing on a cherry picker crane at the second story level of the laser with a box of tools at their feet
we truck down the side of the laser along the tubes which house the amplifying lenses and move up gradually getting close enough to hear what they are saying and
get a look at them
we see that the figures are a young dark haired beautiful woman with her hair tied back under a hard hat and an older man who is using a tool
on a section of the laser and is also wearing a hard hat
the woman is lora and the man is dr
hes wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch calculator and has an intense almost insane look to his dark eyes with their bristling white eyebrows
in contrast lora seems more serious and conservative but she defers to gibbs as a senior and more accomplished scientist
both have protective eye goggles worn loosely around their necks at the moment
as the crane lowers them to the floor sighs well here goes nothing
you hear what you said
here goes nothing
well i meant whereas actually what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again
so you might just as well have said here goes something and here comes nothing
they step off the crane and walk to a short lead shielded cylindrical platform on which rests a solid sphere of clear plastic polymer about inches in diameter
the firing end of the giant laser is aimed straight at the sphere
five feet away is an identical plat form empty
let me make sure were running she crosses to a computer console nearby
the console is connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables
pulling her goggles into place over her eyes she sits at the console
gibbs adjusting his goggles takes a position near the platform bearing the sphere safe from the laser but close enough to watch
she types a series of commands on the computer keyboard
let er rip
the laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright light at the polymer sphere
for a moment the sphere has the look of a wavering poorly received television picture wobbling lines of dots and then it disappears entirely
as gibbs watches a lora works feverishly the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away
a second discharge of light hits the surface of this platform and like a film in reverse of the balls disappearance it is reconstructed five feet from its original position
when the beam shuts off lora rushes to join gibbs in examining the born again ball of plastic
at the sound o
of an appreciative pair of hands clapping lora and a gibbs turn to see alan in hard hat goggles and paper shoe covers walking toward them
boy i sit up there grindin away all day and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun
he gives lora an embrace and a quick kiss
not disintegrating alan digitizing
while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object the computer maps out a holographic model of it
the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam
then the computer reads the model back out the molecules go back into place and
indicates ball voila
can it send me to hawaii
but you have to go roundtrip and you must purchase your program at least days in advance
the three start walking out of the laser lab alan and lora with their arms around each others shoulders
hows it going upstairs
i had tron almost ready to run and dillinger cut everybody with group access out of the system
gibbs looks alarmed but doesnt say anything
continuing ever since he got that master control program set up systems got more bugs than a bait store
well you have to expect some static
computers are just machines after all they cant think
theyll start to soon enough
wryly yes wont that be grand the computers will start thinking and people will stop
lora im going to stay and run some data through
see you tomorrow
ad lib goodnights
outside laser lab where all technicians etc
have to put on the protective suits or at least dirt free shoes
lora is pulling off her white suit and alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes
did you say group access
pain in the neck you know i was all set did he say why
shrugs something about tampering
some bodys probly trying to siphon the r d budget into his checking account i dont know
why are you so interested
flynn had group access
flynn had access to you too
im not interested in talking about him
oh i wish youd forget about that
it was all so long ago
ive totally gotten over it
i want to go to his place
you call that getting over it
i mean i want both of us to go
she closes her locker
he follows her into the corridor
alan and lora walking to the elevator
to warn him
that dillingers on to him
they get into the elevator
for being on to dillinger
completely confused what
the elevator doors close
as van pulls up in front of it a long establishing shot with the name flynns high and blazing above the entrance
video arcade same arcade as in title sequence night camera pans around
its bright and jazzy las vegas style decorated with huge murals of computer chips and electronic circuitry
we see dozens of individual machines where scores of guys and girls teenagers mostly but older and younger kids too are playing the games watching milling around chattering
as the kids play colored glows from the video games light up their faces eerily
of kid playing one of the games tailgunner
of two girls playing berzerk with d computer images of human figures running through the maze
of battle zone screen
of lunar lander
of star castle
of space invaders
camera trucks through the aisle past the absorbed kids who crowd around each machine oblivious to anyone passing them
walking through the aisle of games from behind
they are slightly bewildered and confused by the weird noises
lora approaches a junior high school girl whos watching a hot game of battle zone
hey wheres flynn tonight
the kid looks at lora then turns towards the center of the room and points
alan and lora look
playing a game called space paranoids camera tilting up into his face catching the orange glow from the console
the game has a prominent icom logo under the screen
flynn is a cocky kid in his mid s unshaven wearing a t shirt jeans jogging shoes
hes racked up a terrific score
kids are grouped around him tensely watching the game fans
as we watch the machines nine digit scoreboard goes to then flashes the word record as lights blink and a siren sounds
the kids cheer wildly
its all in the wrist friends
he grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find lora approaching him with alan in tow
good to see you guys
nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple
we have to talk
you cant even think in here
he leads them toward the back of the arcade
a dark panelled room with a few comfortable chairs a business desk with a typewriter and terminal where we saw flynn working in scenes etc
and a couple of video games flynns favorites
as flynn lora and alan enter they find the arcade noise considerably muffled
flynn settles into a chair alan leans against a game nervous lora paces
stretching his arms relaxing so
hows the world of serious science
have you been sneaking into the icom system
you never were much for small talk
to alan she still leave her clothes all over the floor
alan looks profoundly uncomfortable
i mean not that often flynn laughs
to alan indicating arcade you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old
yeah ive been doing a little hacking here
which ive got every reason as you well know
you did break in
nods toward terminal cant quite make the connection with that sucker though
if i had a direct terminal
are you embezzling
sydney greenstreet embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey
normal voice no actually im trying to get a legal brief together
i dont get it
to lora you havent told him
she shakes her head
sighs sherman set the wayback machine for
kevin flynn points to himself is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom
hes so bright that he starts going in there at night and sets up a private memory file and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing
waves at one of the games in the room space paranoids
you invented space paranoids
and vice squad and meltdown
whole slew of em
i was this close gestures to starting my own little enterprise
but enter ed dillinger
another software engineer not so young not so bright but very very sneaky
one night our boy flynn goes to his terminal tries to read up his file and
a big blank
we now take you to three months later
ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has invented the slime didnt even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion
thus begins his meteoric rise to
what is he now executive v
meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and im not seeing one dime
i still dont get why youre trying to break into the system
in one of those memories
is the evidence
if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it
dillingers instruction to divert the data
im afraid its a little late for that
dillingers shut off group access
he must know what youre up to
boy i bet i know whos workin late tonight
tryin to find the file and erase it
once thats gone aint nothin can stop him
just eddie and his master control program runnin things from on high
dont even say that
youve got to find that file before he does
not much chance of that now
the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it
not if my tron program was running
that would seal the system off
if your files in there
boy if we were inside i know how to forge us a group access
they all look at each other
after a beat lora holds the keys to her van aloft
shall we dance
dillinger is seated at his computer console desk
gibbs standing faces him
ed all im saying is if our own people cant get access to their programs
you know how frustrating it is when youre working on a piece of research walter i sympathize but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there
is something screwy that mcp you know thats half the problem right the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do
i cant sit and worry about every little user request that user requests are what computers are for
doing our business is what computers are for
look walter with all respect icom isnt the business you started in your garage anymore as he speaks he types a quick command into the console key board and a
series of images appear on the computers screens vast computer banks
rows of magnetic disks
icoms globe logo spinning in space covered with a glowing circuit pattern then a shot of millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically then d computer representations of vessels aircraft
carrier and solar sailer
on another screen we see statements of icoms wealth adding up accounts receivable and assets
were billing accounts in countries weve got one of the largest systems in existence
gibbs turns wearily away from the display
oh i know all that
sometimes i wish i was back in that garage
it can be arranged
gibbs turns to face dillinger again
that was uncalled for
im sorry walt
so much pressure lately
you feel like going for a drink
thank you no
i have some work to do
assuming i can still log on
loras van pulls up on a side street around the corner from icoms main gate
the icom building looms high above them an ominous box
van a a digital clock on the dashboard reads
lora is at the wheel alan next to her
you better get in back with flynn
and keep down
she jerks her thumb over her shoulder
do i gotta
but he climbs over the seat and lora starts to drive slowly forward
resigned hi flynn
flynn pulls a bag of doughnuts from his pocket
explaining my dinner
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health
got any cinnamon
flynn smiles hands alan a doughnut
keep it down you guys
loras van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the icom building and the three get out
lora inserts her i
card into a magnetic reader beside the door
i dont think im cleared for this
im certainly not
let the kid have some room
he gestures alan and lora out of the way takes out a small black box with several buttons a digital counter with led numerals and a small calculator keyboard
he leans over the security lock his back to the camera and plays a couple of notes
theres a distinct click an the door starts to swing open
we see that this door is about twenty feet thick
flynn starts laughing
the three of them walk along a semi darkened corridor trying to nonchalantly avoid the security monitor camera mounted on the wall
but as they go past it it swivels and aims right at them
flynn im gonna put you at my terminal down in the laser lab
well be up in alans office
ill log us both on and you can get your tron thing running
as long as we stay off the top floor dillingerll never know weve been in here
a shot of the three backs retreating down the corridor
from the rotating security camera outside the elevator on the floor of the laser lab
we see flynns face peek out and see the camera
his head pulls back in
as the security camera aims away from the elevator flynn and lora make a mad dash down the hall and we see alans face watching
from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab
we see flynn approaching the camera stuffing the last donut from his bag into his mouth
he takes the empty bag raises it up mugging to the camera and pushes the bag over the lens
the screen goes black alan comes into his office and sits at his terminal
lora watches as flynn sits down at her terminal
this lasers my lifes work
dont spill anything
flynn laughs as lora goes out
settling in loosening his fingers like a concert pianist or a safecracker
he types in a code number presses the enter key
we see a camera emerging from a sliding panel
from this camera
we watch as flynn starts typing
password series ps
reindeer flotilla it clears abruptly and the following appears as we hear the voice of the mcp
you shouldnt have come back flynn
hey hey its that big master control program everybodys talking about
you dont look a thing like your pictures
tell me have you really been thinking about world domination like they say
code series lsu
code series ess
code series hhh
that isnt going to do you any good flynn
im afraid you
the voice lurches goes into high speed and then back to normal
continuing slightly shaken stop flynn
you realize i cant allow this
activating lighting up
we see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising silently so that flynn doesnt notice
we can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment and it is this section that is being activated
terminate control mode
activate matrix storage
now how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that
cmon big boy lets see what
youre entering a big error flynn
im going to have to put you on the game grid
ill give you suddenly before flynn can go on the gigantic laser mechanism behind him sends a brilliant beam of light directly at him
we see his body beginning to break into scan lines like a video image the same thing that happened to gibbs polymer ball
we can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light being scanned by the laser
the colors change become monochromatic with flynns body glowing orange and the image of his figure blurs and becomes indistinct
zoom in on flynn and the camera rushing over a circuit pattern like the one we saw at the opening of the film
the pattern changes dissolving into another image and we are rushing forward at great speed
we see the circuits rushing by and getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a glowing spinning globe beneath us like the globe from aics logo covered
we are rushing at it circling it diving closer and closer so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer with every second and we realize that the circuits are
structures angular towers and buildings huge mechanical looking mountains and deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern
everything glows with an internal energy
we continue diving down down faster and faster and we see the structures of one city like area across electronic mesas and cliffs and then were right over this area
and diving straight down everything blurring with the speed
made up of rings of energy and we are diving straight down it
we see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the outside and suddenly were at the bottom and the figure stops staggering from the force of the
fall but upright
we see flynn or what looks like flynn same face etc but now covered with a strange costume made of electronic circuitry glowing with energy
flynn shakes his head dazedly
this isnt happening
it only thinks its happening
he looks up and sees something
a horrendous towering character carrying a long glowing staff is right in front of him
this character reaches out an arm and grabs flynn
being dragged off the entry tube platform
take it easy
look if this is about those parking tickets i can explain everything
hovering over the game grid
we see sark in his feet sockets his hands spread out flat on the table in front of him
a buzzing noise fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form shimmering into awful shape
we see the stretched out face dissolving into the cylinder of the mcp
sark suddenly snaps to awareness directing all his attention to the mcp
hoarsely yes mcp
ive got a little challenge for you sark a new recruit
hes a tough case but i want him treated in the usual manner
train him for the games
let him hope for a while
and blow him away
youve got it
ive been hopin youd send me somebody with a little moxie
what kind of program is he
hes not any kind of program sark
hes a user
sark looks up shocked
he pushed me
in the other world
somebody pushes me i push back
so i brought him down here
whats the matter sark
you look nervous
well i its just i dont know a user i mean
users wrote us
a user even wrote you
now get this straight pal no one user wrote me
im worth a couple million of their man years
im bigger than all those little wimps put together
disgust humans they cant even keen their social order in one piece but what if i cant
you rather take your chances with me
want me to slow down your power cycles for you
the circuits going into the energy sockets fade we see sark weaken
i need that
then pull yourself together
get this clown trained
i want him in the games until he dies playing
acknowledge master control
end of line
the hologram disappears and sarks power returns
two guards leading flynn down it echoing footsteps
they turn a corner and continue finally stopping in front of a cell
the door opens automatically
flynn holds back
video game unit
in here program
trying to grab the guards arm who you callin program program
the guard shoves flynn inside and slams the door cutting off his voice
the same type of cell crom was thrown into in the title sequence
flynn is leaning against the door staring at his hands
flynns hands are glowing electrified
of his face
his head comes up and we see an expression of terrible understanding on his face
voices are coming through the opening of the neighboring cell
ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from trons
looking over his shoulder new guy
shakes his head another free program off line
whats his user sposed to do
sighs the users
you really think theyre still there
theyd better be
i dont want to bust outta this dump an find nothin but a lot of cold circuits waitin for me
he can hear the voices but cant see anything except rams back so he goes to the window and tries to reach through
who are you guys
whats the story around here
but as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells it hits an invisible barrier and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence stopping his
hand and then disappearing
flynn pulls back in shock
turning towards flynn as he hears this noise
you want to watch those force fields
he goes to the window opening
youll be having plenty of chances to get hurt dont worry about that
just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay
where am i
guest of the master control program
theyre going to make you play video games
relieved well great thats no sweat i play video games better than anybody
ram gives flynn an astonished look but before he can say anything theres a tremendous pounding noise and the door of flynns cell opens
we see guards pulling out other captives from their cells and as flynn is led off down the corridor tron and ram are taken in the opposite direction
a large area which opens onto the game grids from above with balconies overlooking the action
overhead the aircraft carrier hovers menacingly casting a shadow on the programs below
the new captives are led out onto the ledges herded by the guards
they pass some of the blue video warriors who laugh and make fun of them
flynn is in the front of the line
look operative you guys
command program sark will explain the training procedures
sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier and his voice is amplified over the grid
reciting a routine statement greetings
the master control program has chosen you to serve your system on the came grid
sark looking out over the grid
those of you who continue to profess a belief in the users will receive the standard substandard training
this will result in your eventual elimination
looking down into the game arenas at his feet and over at one of the conscripts next to him
those of you who renounce this superstitious and hysterical belief will be eligible to join the warrior elite of the mcp
of the two blue warriors behind the group of new conscripts
you will each receive an identity disk
everything you do or learn will be imprinted on this disk
on the bridge of the carrier and leaning forward
the master control program regrets that it cannot be responsible for identity disks lost or stolen
if you lose your disk or fail to follow commands you will be subject to immediate de resolution
that is all
shot of flynn held immobile while a laser scans his mouth
a line of recruits files past a checkpoint
each is handed a disk
the recruits file out into a training area
we see an arm being fitted with a cesta
one of the more experienced conscripts ram demonstrates the throw with the cesta
flynn tries an awkward throw
in the b
other recruits are practicing
ram instructs flynn
flynn is getting better
he spins and catches a pellet
a demonstration of the disk game by two other warriors
flynn practices a ricochet shot at a target hits perfectly
for a rest period
he is pacing back and forth and we can see ram seated in the next cell
flynn goes to the bars
what were you
you know before
nostalgic brightens oh i was an actuarial program
worked at a big insurance company
it really gives you a great feeling helping folks plan for their future needs and of course if you look at the payments as an annuity over the years the
cost is really about to get bored yeah yeah thats great
how bout yourself
i dont remember too much
nods sure a little disorientation
thats normal when they transport you
itll come back to you
youre doing real well in training
the pounding on flynns cell begins again
we see flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind sarks console
sark is staring up at the screen frowning nervous frightened of this new user warrior
over his shoulder wait a minute
put this guy against one of the other recruits
we see they are entering an open part of the game grid with two bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate circular platforms made up of concentric
crom marches across one of these and flynn follows suit on the other
when they each reach the circular platforms the bridges disappear
we see flynn turn and stare back across the empty space then turn and face his opponent
above them a third floating disk hovers
he looks over at crom whos anxious
looks like were in the same boat here jumpy you think youre gonna wipe me right out dont you
no i a buzzer sounds
the game begins
crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards
it strikes the upper platform ricochets off and heads straight for flynn
flynn lunges but misses
the pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform and that ring dissolves
flynns lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge
down down between the rings into an infinite pit
theres a sound and he looks up
another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him
reacting judging where this one will fall racing to the farther edge of his platform leaping over the empty ring on the way and catching the pellet before it can
he throws it back
flynns pellet hits the mirror flashes down on him
crom strains but misses
one of his rings disappears
flynn reacting happy hes scored okay
high above the game we see sark watching
racing for another catch
he makes it and hurls the pellet again
we see that croms platform is disappearing fast
heres an easy one
flynn throws again
the pellet hits the mirror platform and heads straight at crom who misses it
the pellet destroys the ring he was standing on and crom has to grab frantically at the edge of the next ring to keep from falling
he is sent another pellet from above and catches it holding it ready waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring
his face lit from below by the glow of the game grid
angry he puts down his cesta
suddenly a voice rings out from above
flynn looks up
there appearing in the mirror disk above is sarks face furious huge
finish the game
staring at this apparition
he grits his teeth
shouts up no
in a greyhound station waiting area two kids are playing a video game which appears to have broken down
whats wrong with it
i dont know
on the blink or something
flynn holds up the pellet
and drops it down into the abyss below
he stares back up at sarks immense image
in the mirror platform towering above flynn
youll regret this
pressing a button
the ring he is holding on to dissolves and with a scream he falls
with flynn visible staring down and the huge face of sark above him
on the bridge
his finger wavers over another button almost presses it
we see him straining trying to overcome his conditioning
then he snatches his hand away
looking up no
you said he could die in the games staring up
the image on the mirror wavers and dissolves
he slams his palm down on a panel on the console and a buzzer as the bridge to his platform reappears and we see guards starting to run across to
the sound of guards running feet approaching their cells
they look up
flynn is being escorted down it
a couple of big blue warriors go by and deliberately brush into flynn
turning on flynn snarling outta my way rookie
flynn stares at him then in one smooth motion reaches to his back and pulls out his disk
out of my way zero bit
he moves as if to throw the disk
backing away sure sure
the other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as flynn and his guards continue on
ram and tron are escorted in as flynn is brought in from another corridor
three blue warriors are lined up waiting
look tron he survived
under his breath tron
he leans over to get a better look at tron and gasps in surprise
frowning where did you hear that name
well isnt it
the name of my user yeah
thinking fast i uh
im a program from a user that
he was disoriented in transport tron
yeah but im remembering all kinds of stuff
my user wants me to go after the mcp before they can go on the buzzer sounds
floating over the game grid with a view of the light cycle arena
zoom in on the section of the grid where the game is about to start
the three blue warriors are lined up facing our friends on opposite sides of the large arena about a half mile square surrounded by high bulwarks and surveyed by recognizers
we can see the carrier hovering high overhead
thats what my user wants too
holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them
we see tron and ram looking at flynn in the center
with a sizzling electrical discharge the light cycle is inscribed around him
ready to go
his finger presses a button and the buzzer sounds again
we see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles
as we watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side leaving tron and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other of the other cycle heading straight at him
we see these two cycles come together and almost crash
but both turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing forward
the other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the arena
into mike nice one
they start making turns passing walls they have already created each trying to box the other in
into mike ram stay all the way over
into mike ive got control
they rush past a wall headed directly for a bulwark at the end of the arena
tron is on one side but the blue warrior is on the inside
tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall
there is an explosion as the cycle de rezzes and a crack forms in the bulwark
we see that the walls created by the de rezzed warrior dissolve as he does
rushing alongside his opponent
they make a turn
they make another turn right at the camera
of the maze of walls
he gets clear for a moment and spots the crack in the bulwark
reacting getting an idea
into mike you guys
racing together approaching the bulwark
at the last second the blue warrior turns but flynn races right at the crack
now he will be rid of the user
he races straight at the crack
and through it
his face suffused with anger
he slams a fist down on the console in front of him
the remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena
reacting to flynns escape hope in his eyes
smashing another one of the blue warriors against a wall
he turns and races up next to tron
side by side
they look at each other
into mike what do you think
into mike do it
we see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack
we hear a loud siren and a mechanical voice starts up through loudspeaker we continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape gradually diminishing as the three friends get
farther away until it dies out altogether
moving towards the dividing bulwark passing over it
racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark barely enough room to get by
they emerge into an open corridor with the recognizers appearing overhead
we watch the cycles rush past the camera
he is pacing across the bridge of the carrier smashing guards out of his way
send out every game tank in the grid
as he looks up and spots the recognizers hovering over them about to come down for the kill
into mike watch it
into mike recognizers
heading for a smaller opening in one wall labeled game storage
as the three cycles race into the opening
the recos are blocked way too big to fit through the opening
from flynns pov as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with rows of tanks and missiles
as they speed past the rows of tanks rev up turn in formation one after the other like the rockettes and follow
outside the game area an electronic desert reminiscent of the grand canyon with giant pillars rising high into the air lined with narrow ridges and ledges
the cycles rush around corners of the ledges pursued by the tanks high above the flat surface
they come around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the face of the cliff
they stop for a moment
into mike game tanks
come on as the three cycles rev up and race off headed for one of the narrow openings in the cliff face and plunge into it disappearing from view
we see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the darkness down down into the dry rot section
the cycles come to a stop and de rez
leaving each man standing with just the handlebars between his fists
they all let out a long sigh and relax
when youre on the other side of the screen
it all looks so easy
ram and tron look at flynn as if hes crazy then start smiling and grinning until all three are laughing
as the force of tanks rumbles through the terrain the aircraft carrier hovering overhead
sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape
to one of the bridge personnel get the pursuit force back into a
theres no place else they could be
sarks lieutenant is watching the wall sized screen behind sark where we can see a diagram of the area with the tanks visible moving through it
he turns to sark
confidently well have them in no time sir
long before the interrupt interface
whirls on him we better null unit
ill be lucky if the mcp doesnt blast me into a dead zone
i want those programs
ram tron and flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the cave
beyond them we can see a cluster of structures like a cityscape and one enormous tower with a golden beam of light rising from it farther up than the eye
no tanks are visible
looking out its all circuits
points at tower must be an input output component
the tower yes flynn have you remembered anything else about yourself like what sector youre from
sitting down against a rock well
my home sector was called paramus
sits also paramus
wonder what those initials stand for
starts counting them off on his fingers
probably program assist routine well it sounds like a lovely place
shrugs it grows on you
he notices that tron is not listening to them any longer but is gazing upwards
murmuring i can feel it
flynn and ram turn
hes got something to tell me
ram and tron look out at the distant tall tower
you think we can make it there
we have to
pointing to a corner of the cave hey whats that
they all look back into the darkness behind them
a glowing stream can just be seen
ram gets up
its just what we need
ram and tron are drinking kneeling at the stream of flowing brilliant light
oh thats nice
you always forget how good fresh energy feels till you get to a pure source
to flynn have some
youll need it
flynn goes to the stream dips his hands in takes a drink
wiping his mouth well
when do we pay a call on the ol master control
tron and ram are taken aback
what just the three of us
shrugs you know anybody thats got an army for rent thats fine
but my uh user said to go take that sucker out
an lets face it the big ox isnt gonna get any weaker
i feel like hittin him now while im good an mad
what does he care whether you guys get killed long as he keeps rakin in quarters
to tron do you know what hes talking about
to flynn i have to find out what alan wants
that comes first
okay thats first
maybe he knows what to suddenly we hear a rumbling sound
flynn looks up sharply
with that theres an explosion from outside the cave
each of the men holds up his cycle handlebars and the three cycles sizzle back into shape and race up the ramp and on out
the three cyclists pause at the cave opening sizing up possible avenues of escape in the terrain below
points how about over there
that empty memory
shakes head no good
they might block off the old chip
points this way
the cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down away from the approaching tanks through the electronic canyons shells exploding around them
we see the tanks close behind
from inside of the tanks of the three bikes heading into a narrow arroyo
they just make it around the corner when an explosion boasts the entrance to the arroyo entering what appears to be a maze of very narrow canyons with short walls
they turn another corner and come to the edge of a gaping ravine
several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their ledge with another canyon wall and a wider ledge which leads down to the floor of the entire area
and on to freedom
the tanks are following through the maze smooth gray automatons lifeless inexorable nemesis
trons cycle is in the lead as all three race for the bridge but behind them we see the first tank turning the corner
as the turret swings around and focuses on the bridge
tron races out on it ram and flynn behind
just as tron reaches the other side and ram has just started to cross theres a tremendous explosion of electronic flak blasting ram and tossing him back on top of
both cycles de rez
the bridge disappears and a mass of rubble falls partially obscuring ram and flynn
tron screeches to a halt and swings his bike back around
he looks around ram and flynn are nowhere in sight
in the ravine below he sees a pile of motionless rubble
the tank fires again narrowly missing tron and he revs up again speeds off down the ramp and is gone
ram is badly injured unconscious
flynn struggles to his feet sees the tank turret swiveling towards him grabs ram and picks him up
struggling with rams limp body wedging himself into a narrow crack
in the carrier above
he is watching the action on the wall screen behind his console back to the camera
the picture is coming from the lead tank
to him it appears as though ram and flynn had been blown up since no sign of them is visible
we can see his lieutenant nearby operating the communications
to lieutenant make contact with master control
smiles hell be pleased to hear were all finished with that user he sent us
speeding through the flat desert like terrain heading straight for the cityscape tower in the distance
far behind him we see the image of sarks carrier ponderously moving in his direction
flynn is supporting ram half carrying him and it is getting darker
you gonna make it
ram weakly nods but doesnt look very convincing
flynn bites his lip and struggles on
they are down on the floor of the desert leaving the towering canyons behind
a large dim shape can be made out
flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it
arriving in front of a block like shape with a narrow opening
exhausted flynn lets ram down to the ground goes to the opening and looks in
looks okay so he comes back
sitting down inside the hiding place collapsing
ram is unconscious anyway and flynns eyes soon closed
some light comes in the opening and we see flynn lying on a platform across from ram
rams glow appears to be almost gone
flynns eyes open
for a second he doesnt know where he is but then he spots ram and comes fully awake
ram is watching him
flynn looks around
he gets up and stretches his hand reaching up towards the ceiling
it brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel leaving it with a glow of its own
the entire chamber starts to shake and holding onto the wall whats goin on
looking around weak were inside a recognizer
to flynn you are crazy stealing a recognizer stumbling trying to keep his balance are you kidding
i think its stealing us flynn tentatively places his hands on separate parts of the instruments
an energy flow starts and with a mighty heave and shudder the chamber theyre in turns over knocking both flynn and ram to one side
the recognizer is now in its standard upright position
as it stands up covered with a static overlay partially de rezzed
through the head of the reco we can look out at the landscape below
flynn sits stunned for a moment then stumbles over to ram whos going fast
you dont look so good
ram nods weakly
well get you outta here
flynn touches panels trying to get the recognizer going but with no result
minute the warranty runs out
flynn goes over to him and kneels
ram grabs his hands
suddenly rams fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into flynn
horrified flynn tries to pull away but ram holds him fast
little more juices all it needs
rams last bit of energy flows into flynn and rams body de rezzes
flynn watches in horror frantically trying to reverse the flow but its too late
ram disappears before his eyes
stunned he gazes at the empty space for a moment then stands up
tron arrives at the city gazing around an empty surreal burnt out landscape
buildings seem two dimensional barely there at a low rate of power so drained by the mcp
the cycle de rezzes
theres a noise from above and tron looks up
a recognizer floats over the city moving towards him
he hides behind a building as the reco passes
a strange zombie like figure comes down one of the streets and the recognizer swoops over it the static field flashing between the legs passing through the figure dissolving it
he looks out onto the street and sees two more of the figures standing together staring at each other barely moving
dead lifeless but animate
tron comes out on the street staring at these figures
he locks around the city in confusion shaking his head sadly but walks on
up ahead we see a large multi storied factory like building
this is what he was looking for
he looks from side to side figuring the best way to get to the building
in front of the building stand a small group of the memory guards
of the city and the tower and beam rising high into the air with sarks carrier far away nearing the city
over the complex landscape of the distant city and tower with sarks carrier far away nearing the city
this was his pov out of the window of the recognizer
his face is sad he is still mourning ram
this is a very low point
he sighs then looks around putting his palm on one panel after another
one of them glows brilliantly as he touches it and the recognizer gives a violent shake then stops
never gonna figure out how to work this thing
theres a noise from above
he looks up
we see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment
his eyes widen then narrow
he non chalantly turns away pretending to be still examining things
appearing again peeking around the corner
it comes forward trying to get a look at flynn
flynn whirls around fingers poised like a gunfighter
the bit gives a violent start and leaps back out of the way but immediately comes back peering at flynn
flynn is moving closer
okay hold it right there
the bit is still in its pure energy form but then it suddenly recognizes flynn thinks he is clu expands in a smooth green sphere the yes mode and shouts
the bit subsides into energy form again
still suspicious what do you mean yes
from now on whenever the bit speaks it is a ball shaped character red or green with a hint of a face but as soon as it stops speaking it
reverts to a brilliant spark of light
that all you can say
of course not you know better no nyet negatory not on your tintype no way
oui da yessiree sure nuff you betcha
only yes and no
it dawns youre a bit
hippie for sure
wheres your program
wont it miss you
flynn eyes the bit cautiously
im your program
emphatic right on the money
sighs another mouth to feed
you dont by any chance know how to drive this crate
in answer the bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a platform supports a four foot tube with a crossbar
flynn follows stares at the setup for a moment then steps onto the platform and grabs the cross bar
before the bit can answer flynns power flows into the recognizer and it takes off like a bat out of hell heading for the city
it lurches forward unevenly crashing drunkenly into a wall and bouncing off another one
way to go
yes okay exactement
this is the building tron was eyeing when we left him
we see him inside now in a corridor passing a large opening which gives views of partially completed structures an aircraft carrier a strange elongated craft that resembles a sailboat
on its side
all composed partially of glowing lines and partially of flat smooth surfaces
we see several female programs working in these rooms
this building only has female workers but they are all pale and listless no interest in anything staring at their feet as they shuffle along
tron looks farther down the corridor
we see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards tron
as he moves back against the wall into a niche
as the first girl passes his vantage point his hand flashes out and grabs her around the mouth yanking her back into the niche with him
the line of workers mechanically files on past
we watch from the rear of the niche as tron holds the girl against his chest until all the workers are gone
she struggles feebly half heartedly
im not gonna hurt you
she stops struggling
im going to let you go now
dont scream or ill be very sorry
his hands loosen and he releases her
we see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first time
she looks tired and uninterested
is loras face still beautiful in its pallor
put your hand behind your back
slowly she obeys
a slow smile appears on his face
he extends his own hand to touch hers palm to palm
as contact is made a rich glow appears between the two hands strengthening as we watch
a look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into her
she turns entwining her fingers in trons
she throws her arms around him
smiling hugging her tightly yori
i knew youd escape
theyve never built circuit that could hold you
she looks around nervously
pulling him by his hand this way
they walk quickly toward a flight of stairs
tron and yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk
we can see the glowing beam of the tower over the tops of all the buildings and several half gone programs standing around
as they pass they hear snatches of conversation
artillery for video game sector
all mathematical functions transferred to
i cant believe how bad its gotten around here since the mcp started taking over
all the good functions have shut down
everybody looks so dead
im afraid to even go out during down time
thats all going to change yori
dont know yet
i have to get in touch with alan
he was going to tell me how to suddenly yori looks up sees something grabs trons hand and pulls him back into a nearby alley
she points up in the air
as she looks up
she shivers and holds trons hand tighter
tron and yori arrive at the ground level entrance
tron and yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door
she whistles and the door disappears
they step through
as tron and yori enter
the apartment appears to be a box with one window overlooking the cityscape and the i tower
at first it looks empty with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the walls and floors
why is everything
its a flat
but wait a micro
she lays her palm on the wall near the door
the door reappears and a glow starts to fill the room softly slowly
tron looks around the flat paintings of furniture are expanding filling out becoming three dimensional
the room glows a soft rose color becomes charming soothing
it is still small and limited but the light in the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving seductive aura
tron turns back to yori smiling and stops
with her hand still on the wall panel she is glowing absorbing extra energy changing
the severe work clothes metamorphosize into shimmering diaphanous drapery twinkling with thousands of diamond like points of light
a silvery tinkling sound comes from her robes as she moves forward her beautiful face now surrounded by a soft mane of hair glows with pleasure at the expression in
she smiles lovingly and reaches out her hand
his face tells the story
the fugitive returned from long exile is being fully rewarded for his efforts
youre beautiful yori
as their hands touch and the glow springs out between their flattened palms
tron pulls her close to him sliding his hand up her arm leaving a glowing trace and her hands move up over his chest
youve grown big program
i had to
in the games
they move together into an embrace but their lips never touch
all the energy is transmitted through their hands
they sink down onto what looks like cushions made of stars their glow increasing
the room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each other and we hear their sighs as the music comes up
each of them moves their hands over the other moving slowly as if they were trying to touch the others entire body at once
they roll over and are enveloped in the cloud of stars
hovering in the air above the factory city moving slowly forward
zoom out past the carrier towards the landscape beyond
a slightly out of control recognizer arrives in the city wobbling careening glancing off a building or two
flynn is having trouble controlling the reco
this honey doesnt handle so good in town
agreeing no nuh uh never in a million years
he lays his hands from panel to panel causing one after another to light up in a random pattern almost with a beat but the recognizer only slams into another
building and keeps going
the bit starts shouting ix nay
under no conditions flynn looks frantically around spies a large panel to one side that he hasnt tried yet and slaps his palm down on it
thats more like it right confirmed i couldnt have put it as the reco screeches to a screaming stop
but the head of it with flynn and the bit breaks loose and flies through the air landing in what looks like a garbage dump
as flynn shakily pulls himself out of the debris the bit nervously hovering over him
to bit catch me listening to you again
a group of low resolution programs are walking by
flynn emerges from the broken off head stunned but unhurt the bit flying by his side
he blearily sees the passing programs but doesnt realize they are at such a low state of consciousness that they cant see him
hey everythings okay
little trouble but were okay
thanks for your concern
they move on
to the bit this towns full o live ones
not a chance
tron and yori are crossing an open plaza like area on their way to the i tower
they pass by more zombie like programs and overhear bits of conversation all in dead sounding monotones
i have to re route the insurance information bits
next cycle we start the war game simulation for the mcp
did you make that accounts receivable adjustment for sark
the mcp wants only minimal functions left in sector q
it looms high overhead
on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the tower approaching a wide door in the wall
we see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform which is now rising upwards at a steep angle carrying tron and yori smoothly and silently towards an opening in
a floor a hundred feet overhead
looking upwards as they move
as the elevator platform arrives and they step off
we get the sense of massive over size ceilings floors windows and machinery dwarfing the programs who come to the tower to communicate preparing them for the experience as a
vaulting cathedral prepared the sinner for confession
but here everything is composed of clean sharp angular surfaces
on this second story there is floor and ceiling but no outer wall so we can still see the city grid below and beyond
tron and yori cautiously move forward across the floor heading for a door into the inner parts of the tower
of the i tower
a large raised circular altar stands against one wall with a darkened opening behind it
a square secondary altar supports the first about fifty feet up a side
in the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked diminishing steps the final one forming the shoulders of an armless padded suit with a puffed headdress revealing
the face of the i tower priest dumont
his eyes are shut
his face is lined with age but still holds a sprightly sensitivity
it is the face of dr
gibbs from the laser lab in the real world
there is a large v shaped opening behind the altar and the circular steps glow a hot neon each a different color
the stripes of color thus formed bleed upwards onto the wall lining either side of the v opening
there is only blackness beyond
tron and yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide room their footsteps echoing
tron and yori stop at the foot of dumonts altar
the priests eyes flicker open
he looks at tron and yori doesnt recognize either one
have come to communicate with my user
a difficult proposition
difficult proposition at best
indicates empty chamber perhaps youve noticed
were not exactly packing them in these days
you know not so long ago you couldve come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors waiting for communion with their users
the building fund was doing well too
sighs this so called master control program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters
and shoot things at each other and weiner knows what all oh its enough to give you a crisis of faith
well i want to communicate oh you want to hah
i could get myself de rezzed just for letting you in here
they hate this tower
theyd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while
and you should hear the way they commune
sounds like they were routing a payroll for all the heart they put in it
no i dont think you tron steps closer speaks quietly to dumont
my user has information that could could make this a free system again
youd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no mcp looking over your shoulder
sighs when youve been in the system as long as i have you hear many promises
many brave plans
he pauses sizing tron up considering it
finally falling into ritual who is your user program
he calls me
may i pass
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible
dumont nods and the neon glow fades a little
you may pass my friend
tron runs lightly up the steps past dumont into the darkness beyond
we see flynn and the bit walking towards the tower staring curiously at the zombie like characters on the streets
we see a face peer around it
this is where tron said he was going
below him at waist level also peeking around the corner we see the glow of the bit
flynn moves out from the wall and starts going down the hall bit following
looks like his kind of place too
camera swivels and watches him walking quickly away from us
we hear the sound of many feet marching as flynn reaches the end of the corridor
he stops and glances over his shoulder
as he stares down at the far corner
the sound of marching feet coming closer
pull back and truck in front as we get a view of these characters
and a force of guards and six blue warriors
sark is in front enjoyment on his face
as far as hes concerned hes just going in for a final easy kill of one renegade program who is trapped
as sark and his men come around the corner
flynn is nowhere to be seen
sark marches towards the camera right into it
at sark and his men from the back as they continue on down the hall
the file of men is moving away
we can see that there is a wide ledge about ten feet up the wall containing the lighting source
looking down at the file of men going by
the last one passes
flynn suddenly drops down to the floor
the warrior turns snarling lifting his staff
his hand in a fist falling
flynn is standing over the fallen warrior
flynn looks up at the camera finger to his lips
we can see sarks men marching on away from us and flynn leaning over the warrior with the bit hovering over him
as we watch flynn places both his hands on the blue warriors chest
quickly the blue static pattern covering the guard flows into flynns hands up his arms and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes
a the bit upset buzzes around flynn nervously
a sshhh im still me
just a different color
marching fast down the corridor after sark
surrounded by his guards
is looking up eyes narrowed
we see that he is standing in front of the huge closed door to the i tower central chamber
the guards have formed two long rows and sarks lieutenant is standing by his side
that old fruitcake dumont
hell pay for this
bring in the logic probe
we see tron approaching a bell shaped structure with the brilliant golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell
it is surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter
tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell
tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish shaped room the floor of which rises to a cone in the center
the top of the cone is a flat sliced off surface
tron walks down into the dish a soft padded surface and then climbs up to the flat central podium
we see that this surface is round about four feet in diameter and glowing from within with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it
tron looks down and then up
the curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening
we see trons upturned face
he steps up on the podium hands gripped into fists at his sides
his face is gradually filling with a deep inner excitement and anticipation his eyes searching the space above
his expression remains still his mouth closed and even
only his eyes project the emotion he is feeling burning with the knowledge of the experience to come
he takes out his disk grips it in both hands and slowly raises it high above his head
he stands stiffly willing the response to happen
at first nothing stirs
then a splendid radiant beam of light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell illuminating tron and the disk
his hands start to shake with the force of the communication beam and suddenly the disk is ripped from his hands to rise glowing brilliantly upwards to the source of
filled with a quiet awe eyes narrowed against the strong light
his hands drop to his sides
the disk rises out of sight and we intensifying with every second
the glow is visible illuminating yori and dumont
a machine floating above the floor with a pointed cone facing the door is switched on and a blast of pure electricity leaps from it to the surface of the
door with the sound of sizzling lightning yori turns to look at the door hearing this muffled sound
one section of it is glowing starting to de rez
tron is looking upwards
suddenly a voice booms out echoing and distorted alans voice
confirmed alan one
sigh of relief there you are
look before we get cut off again
in the air above tron images begin to materialize shifting transparent forms
first we see a network with pinpoints of light at each intersection it rotates and becomes a globe with a bright light at the center
we see one of the intersection lights become very bright and the others dim
im going to put some new coding on your disk so you can get into the memory core of the master control
when you get there
as alans voice continues we a shot of the de rezzing door
the dissolving section has expanded and we can start to see the guards inside
the light increases in brilliance as we hear alans voice fading out consumed by static
search all password code series wait
i cant hear
the voice is gone
the beam continues to bathe tron in its glow and gradually we see an object emerging from the glow
it slowly descends tron raises his hands to catch it gripping it pulls it down and stares at it
it is glowing with a new power
superimposed on its surface is a complex mandala pattern changing kaleidoscopically as we watch shifting swirling liquid color
we can hear the voices of sarks men outside
turning back to dumont
behind dumont stands tron framed in the entry to the communication chamber
he is rising from the altar the rest of his body emerging from the neon steps until he is standing in front of tron
we see that he has on a floor length robe with huge shoulder pads forming winglike supports for the fabric
i have waited for this moment many thousands of cycles
it is time for the new order to begin
the users are waiting
as we watch tron comes forward and grips dumonts shoulder briefly
then he holds out his hand to yori
long shot as yori steps forward up the steps
we see it is almost transparent and as we watch there is a burst of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots of light
it dissolves completely
framed in the center of the opening stands sark
the blue warriors race by him pouring into the chamber
we see dumont standing on the top of the steps no sign of tron and yori
the guards spread out through the room sark strides towards dumont
wheres the program
dotty old man act program
im sure youre mistaken
as we see tron and yori racing through the streets headed for it
tron and yori enter
solar sailer simulation hovers
as tron and yori race across the floor
theres a simulation we can use
and we see them race towards it
we see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft designed for travel in the real world using solar energy with an enormous metallic sail to catch the
rays of sunlight like wind and move with the speed of light
the sail is at the bow of the craft and a long slender walkway connects it with the deck area which is made up of several connected flattened box shapes
giving it the look of a dragonfly
in this world the sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight and is propelled along the information paths to the central processing unit
can it carry us
the design is good
we dont know why the user abandoned the project
the elevator platform brings tron and yori through the center forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position locked into place
we see yori bending over a console of touch panels
it can take us across the sea of simulation
all the way out of the game grid
to the mcp
looking out of hangar as long as it gets us out of here the crowd of sarks men are racing towards it
bending over the console from the pov of the sail
as we watch a head leans into the frame from the right
a memory guard
then we see a hand gripping a staff and the legs of another guard on the left
on the console as yori leans over it
we see that she is looking at a map of the system a flat grid and on it in miniature are the beam transfer points and transmission location
we can see trons back as he hears a noise
his head snaps up he sees the guards
abandoning any attempt at silence leap forward shouting thrusting their staffs at tron
and slashes the second across the face knocking him out
as sarks men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that ring the hangar walls
they start swarming up
reacting holding his disk ready
as guards start swarming on board
we see tron move forward and then stop letting them come
looking down at the walkway
beyond it we can see the great door starting to rise
throwing his disk
it smashes into the guards in front tossing them backwards
the great door is almost all the way up
we can see the sail with its tip ready to emerge
below on the ground more guards are racing towards the hangar
beating back the guards tossing them over the side of the walkway
we see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the connection of the craft to the sail
tron advances on him
the guard stares at him then looks down
then jumps off intimidated
theres a sudden lurch forward and tron is thrown back losing his balance
the transmission beam is flowing passing directly through the craft from behind hitting the sail bunker and passing through so that it looks like a headlight
the sailer starts moving fast accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of seconds
back on the bridge of the carrier sark is in the mcp hologram
in front of him we see a view of the city below and the hangar and the solar sailer racing away
i hope youve enjoyed being a command program sark
i wonder how youll like working in a pocket calculator
maybe one of those watches that plays happy birthday to its user once a year
we did take care of that user you sent us yes and now youve got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation
well get them sir
these things take time
i dont have time sark
and neither do you
end of line
from the stern
tron picks himself up from the floor where he was thrown when the sailer took off and heads for yori at the camera
he stops seeing something
tron are you all right
tron waves at her
he looks over at the guard rail
fingers gripping the rail
zoom in on the fingers
several yards away from it
we see one of the blue warriors hanging on trying to get a leg up on the rail and we see tron race to the edge look over and see
by the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot
tron raises his disk to slam into the intruder when suddenly a spherical glowing shape comes into the frame from bottom right
buzzing around trons head like a fly no way not on your life no siree
nothing doing forget it
who looks down really seeing the face below for the first time
dumbfounded youre alive
he loses his grip and starts to fall
but tron just in time grabs flynns wrist and starts to pull him up
we see the blue static guard disguise fade off flynn
leaning over the control console anxiously watching tron come up the steps towards her with flynn and the bit
as they reach her
nervously who is this
we see flynn look at yori and silently mouth lora in surprise
but then realize his mistake
he turns to flynn eagerly wheres ram
im sorry tron
he didnt make it
tron shakes his head sadly
to yori this is flynn
the one who busted me out
to flynn then i owe you some thanks
no big deal
i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine
i mean i did write the program for it
mystified wrote the
its time i levelled with you tron
im a well im what you guys call a user
tron and yori are stunned and awed
a user in our world
nods guess i took a wrong turn somewhere
but if youre a user then everything youve done has been part of a plan
laughs you wish
man i havent had a second to think since i got down here
i mean in here
look you guys know how it is
you just keep doin what it looks like youre supposed to even if it seems crazy and you hope to hell your user knows whats goin on
well thats how it is for programs yes but i hate to disappoint you pal most the time thats how it is for users too
stranger and stranger
you said it
pats tron on back so
nice ship you got here
whats our next move
smiles remember you wanted to pay a call on the mcp
were on our way
indicates disk alan one gave me the coding we need to go up against master all right
alan stayed awake at least
the aircraft carrier rolls past the camera
looking out the observation window as his lieutenant approaches from behind
sir what do you want done with the tower guardian dumont
put him with the others
no bit brain
sark turns to face him
prepare him for inquisition
i need a little relaxation
but first rez up the carrier for pursuit
and one other thing
lie stares at the lieutenant paranoid continuing dontthink anymore
i do the thinkingaround here
speeding through the system right on target
we see flynn looking back the way they came
yori is at the controls with tron beside her his arm around her shoulders looking at flynn
what about our friend sark
probably decided not to pursue us the sea of simulation is tricky
lot of illusions
programs have a way of just
not us i hope
shakes his head indicates disk not with this disk
im going to check on the beam connection yori
you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs
he moves off down the walkway the bit following
flynn turns and leans out over the side
boy the view from up here
you know the territory
points out sights over there the mountains of data
and i think thats the silicon valley
pointing whats wrong with that area
we see an area of darkened gloomy two dimensional shapes
sadly the mcp blasted it
there are very few domains left with any power at all
lousy utility companies
theyre the same wherever you go
where we see dumont plugged into energy foot sockets
two memory guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest
dumonts face is wracked with pain his robe torn but his expression is full of determination
as we watch another blast of torturous energy comes from the boots and his face contorts
camera pulls back and angles up to the second level where we see sark looking down into the pit that is dumonts cell
he looks up
what do you want
snarling busy dying you worn out excuse for an old program
yes im old
from the front
continuing old enough to remember the mcp when he was just a chess program
he started small and hell end small
throws back his head and laughs thats very funny dumont
maybe i should keep you around just to make me laugh
bring this antique to the bridge so he can watch his friends be obliterated
we see tron at the bow
flynn and yori are up on the deck near the controls with the bit hovering over them
yori is pointing something out to flynn
reacting to the sight of something ahead of the solar sailer
we see the transmission beam which carries the solar sailer increasing in brightness throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing energy coming towards the ship
it hits the sail and the ship shivers
the whole beam is now tripled in brightness
as tron runs up to yoris side
he grabs her shoulder pulling her against him
they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the increasing beam
shouting what is it
the transmission beams too strong
we have to get off this beam
frantic i cant
theres no junction due for at least or nanoseconds
the ship is throbbing and jerking bits of it de rezzing
flynn looks around points to one side
theres another beam
its too far
flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship makes a decision and races forward
we see flynn race to the bow where the horrendous power of the beam is blasting away at the sails
he slows down but keeps going
watching wheres he going
the beam connection
but hell be de rezzed
we see flynn emerge leaning out into the beam his face brilliantly illuminated by the beam
he reaches forward with one arm
entering the beam
he is lying spread eagled at the bow with one arm in the light
he raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close but too far to reach
suddenly his whole body glows with the same intensity as the beam
shielding their eyes from the light
his body glowing arm outstretched
suddenly another beam blasts out from his arm
we see the new beam from flynns arm flash over to the neighboring transmission beam and connect
we see the ship pulsing and then breaking free of the old beam following the new path and connecting to the safe beam
the craft starts to travel safely on its way
tron races down the walkway toward flynn closely followed by yori and the bit
carrying flynn towards the stern carefully gingerly with yori watching
as they reach the deck in front of tron as he holds flynn
we can see yoris anxious face to one side
flynns head comes up for a moment dazed
weakly did we make it
flynn smiles weakly
hooray for our side
her face upside down peering downward
yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with flynn stretched out beside her his head in her lap
her hands are on either side of his face
tron is seated across from them and the bit is quietly floating beside him
we see that the solar sailer is passing through a series of narrow canyons
you guys ok
nods how about you
aah im fine
little hung over is all
how did you do that flynn
sitting up elementary physics
a beam of energy can always be diverted
ooh my head looks around to yori are we there yet mommy
i just have to adjust our course at the next junction
id better go check the instruments
she heads o
toward the bow
the sailer is about to pass the mouth of another canyon
tron looks away from flynn for a moment to check the sailers progress
as the new canyon comes into sight
camera looks up and up
to the immense bulk of the aircraft carrier moving fast toward the sailer
the carrier lurches forward and rams the sailer splitting it in half
falling on top of one another flynn trying to pull yori out of the way as the bulk of the carrier appears to slam into tron and hes gone
falling through space
as the carrier keeps moving forward
flynn holding yori and the bit hovers beside them
a second level of the carrier with an open hold comes rushing at them
the gaping hold rushes forward and the screen goes black
their half of the sailer is scooped up into the carrier
catching hold of something
he is swinging freely
hanging onto a wall he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold
dumont standing facing the camera
hear door slamming
yori rushes forward to dumont
we see flynn standing just inside the door shoulders slumped and we can see that his disk has been removed
dumont holds yori as she sobs
he looks up
flynn looks down at his hands and turns away leaning against the wall
sighs looks at flynn and who is this
hes a user dumont
he came to our world
trying to help us
her voice breaks she turns away
despairing if the users can no longer help us
his voice trails off
suddenly a stronger light flashes on in the cell the door opens and we see sark standing there framed in the cell door
we have erased the program that as he catches sight of flynn his voice falters
flynn looks up curiously
i saw you
not me boss
we can take care of that soon enough
he points to dumont
the guards grab him
take this program to the holding pit
the guards start to drag dumont out
rushing after him dumont
a guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell
indicates dumont im taking our friend here and some other religious fanatics to master control
the mcp has expressed an interest in assimilating them probably for archival purposes
im not going back to the game grid on this ship though ill take the transport beam
smiles less traffic
but when i disembark this ship
and everything that remains on board
will automatically de rez
this means you
enjoy your trip
laughing sark leaves
the guards with dumont in custody follow
into the cell that holds a dozen dejected defeated aging programs the i tower guardians
we see the door to the cell open and guards beginning to herd them out
where we can see sark walking towards an open portal
he looks down into the cells at his feet and laughs again
staring up as sark moves past their cell and out of view
of the carrier approaching a flat topped mountain with the communication beam of the mcp visible at the very center
of the mcps mesa moving closer the only structure visible in a vast plain covered with a glowing grid
we can see the observation port and below that a section of the ships structure is moving forward
docking module prepared to disengage sir
sarks hand touching a control panel
as the landing pod disengages completely floating away from the carrier and then starting its final journey to the mcp picking up speed on a straight and even course
we can see a small speck clinging to one side of the pod
tron holding himself braced into a narrow crack
yori is sitting with her head in her hands
flynn is at the door testing it running his finger along the edges
of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the mcps mesa
from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance
steep cliff face of the mcps mesa is coming closer and closer more and more detail visible
tiny against the massive bulk of the mcps mesa descending for landing
the top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes fitting itself neatly in between so that it
becomes a part of the structure
there is a minor jolt and sark lays his palm on another panel
from the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly
sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door and we gradually are given a view of the mcp two or three miles away at the center of
the plain ahead
the structure is a series of gleaming black blades forming a great cylinder and the communication beam rises out of the center of this cylinder
floating upwards and forward
flynn still at the door
suddenly his hand goes right through the door
the door is disappearing dissolving
continuing turning look the doors almost
he stops in horror
yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands
she is de rezzing too
her whole body becoming transparent
she looks up dimly at flynn with no expression
flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly hugging her close his energy flowing into her
their faces are very close as he stares down terrified that he is too late to save her
her eyes are half closed
just their two faces
flynn bends closer their lips almost touch
suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity and color floods back into her
her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at flynn
he pulls a little away from her still holding her
in awe you
you brought me back
flynn lets go of her
im gonna need your help
he looks around spots a small glow in one corner of the cell runs to it and stoops down cupping the glow in his hands
flynn wills his energy back into it frowning with concentration
suddenly the bit pops into life
lets get outta here
they head for the door
the prisoners file forward on the path to the mcp
sark is leading them
we can see the structure of the mcp closer now looming bigger
the four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the path
he hears a noise and turns
and in a flash of light a speeding disk smashes into him knocking him over
the camera watches over his de rezzing body
we see a figure approaching closer
its arm is raised and
the disk slams back into the hand
it is tron
he steps over the body of the lieutenant
from right outside
we see the prisoners beginning to file inside up the final slope leading to the base of the mcp
to the mcp
as the guardian programs enter
sark stands waiting watching them his back to the camera
as the first one gets through the opening
the light from the mcps beam pours out
moving forward through the entrance the mcp is finally revealed
a giant cylinder a hundred feet high with a network of circuit lines and stretched across all the visible surface
is a face
flattened stretched bizarrely distorted the face is capable of moving to any section of the cylinder
the impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat persons face but more so
beneath the floating cylinder face two inverted cones of light meeting at their apex support it
we continue moving forward the mcp looming over us
then the camera stops and the doomed programs file past us separating and going to the inner walls
the mcp speaks we see his enormous lips moving
echoing booming i am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give your power over to me
lining the wall
they are sucked back pinned immobile and we see them starting to de rez
youre very lucky all of you
you are participating in the creation of the single most powerful program in the history of the system
of all systems
the programs begin to disappear one by one
continuing a program with a will
a superior form of life
sark stands in front of dumont
dumonts face is devoid of hope
he starts into the mcps inner chamber
seeing the mcp reacting
over dumonts shoulder with a view of the mcp
zoom in on mcps face
flynn and yori race into view
we can see two of the memory guards in a de rezzed two dimensional state disappearing completely in the course of this scene
flynn runs to sarks position looking out the window
check out the controls
as yori looks over the control conso e
continuing were getting closer
down the length of the carrier
it is de rezzing parts of it gone already
we see the cpu approaching as the carrier rises
the carrier drifts over the edge of the mesa high above it whole sections only visible as outlines
camera moving forward towards the mcps beam
he is slowly disappearing
dumont im so pleased that weve finally come to terms with one another
sark is standing looking in the opening waiting for the signal to depart
his back is to the camera
sark turns curious eyes widen incredulously
we see tron standing legs spread arms poised by his sides disk in one hand
it gives off a pure white light
i dont know how you survived slave
it doesnt matter
prepare to terminate
sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist
as the disk races at tron
he dodges drops to one knee and ducks under it
sarks disk circles like a homing missile and attacks again
tron deflects the second attack with his own disk and the two meet with an explosion of light
sarks disk ricochets off and races away back to sark
we see tron throw his own weapon
i can rev this baby up a little he looks out sees something does a double take looks again continuing wait a minute yori
as yori runs to flynns side and peers down
tears of joy streaming down her face
the fight continuing
flynn weve got to help him
lets get some power here
his hands laying on the control console begin to send forth great pulses of glowing energy into the carrier
you are very persistent tron
trons disk circles sark attacking twice
sark deflects it and immediately throws his own disk
racing almost side by side through the air
as the two disks come at him
im also better than you
he leaps into the air grabs his own disk pulling his legs up as sarks disk passes under him
making a sharp turn in the air
he looks over his shoulder sees the disk coming at him
as he slams his own disk into sarks using his as a shield
very clever tron
you know you should have joined me
tron hurls again
flynn is at the controls transferring power
its starting she looks down at the battle
her hand reaches over and grips flynns tightly
he catches his own disk spots trons coming at him right behind and holds up his own disk as a shield
we would have made a great team
turning sideways in its flight edge on
with a crash and explosion of light trons disk cuts right through sarks disk and on through sarks head
the disk shatters and we see sarks surprised face hands still in position to hold the disk
a jagged open slash right through his forehead
we can see energy pouring out of this wound like blood
sark falls dead face first
wailing past sarks body
as he goes in the mcps inner chamber
before he sees tron it is very good that you
framed in the doorway
i dont think it is good for you mcp
how have you allowed this program to sarks out
would you like to leave a message
i am the message
the only message
tron throws his disk
its deflected off the base of the mcp and returns to him
continuing as tron is preparing to throw again he notices dumont and races over to him
dumont is transparent
tron runs up to him
trying to pull dumont away from wall dumont
very weak they may be
on the carrier
he turns murder in his eyes draws back his arm for the throw
this is not allowed
the disk smashes into him
i will not allow this sark
thundering the voice reverberates shaking the chamber
tron continues to throw
sarks dead hand
we see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin to glow around the hand throbbing with energy
the hand moves
throwing again at the mcp hitting catching his disk again
thundering his body is glowing expanding
he starts to rise his face looks up
it is vacant staring with white eyes
his head still has the gaping hole in the forehead
hes a zombie the living dead
carrier floating over the cpu near the mcps beam
flynn looks out from side to side quickly assessing the possibilities
he spots the beam
yori steer us over the beam right next to it
going to controls why
what are you going to do
staring down jump
yori looks up
wont you be de rezzed
turns to her probably
about to fire again
theres a sudden roar and tron turns
who rips open the doorway into the mcp and advances
yori has steered them right next to the beam
she turns to flynn goes up to him
i lays finger on her lips shhhhh
he takes her in his arms
whispering im sure tron wouldnt mind if
his head bends down and their lips meet
yoris body begins to glow change metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the love scene with tron sparkling and gorgeous
her eyes are closed
finally flynn pulls away from her
her eyes stay shut for a second then open
he releases her steps to the edge of the observation port poises on the brink and then leaps off directly in the beam
we see yori shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out
flynn is diving through space in the beam falling in slow motion directly into the center of mcp itself
sark is much bigger than before advancing on tron
he speaks but his voice is that of the mcp
end of line program
we can see the mcp in the b
suddenly there is an explosion of static as flynn falls into the mcp
we see a weird d image of flynns face circling in the cylinder with the mcp as they battle
sark falters stumbles distracted by this and tron ducks under him and hurls the code disk for the last time
it circles the mcp once and then hurtles straight for the target the apex of the energy cones
a brilliant explosion of lights bursts out
dead face wracked with the pain of a second death
he begins to melt into a column of pure energy dissipating completely
we see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones
it is dressed like dumont was at the i tower an old man in the padded altar costume spinning slowly finally stopping
we see the wizened wrinkled face of the true mcp for just a few seconds and see that he is furiosly typing on an old remington portable
then he too dissolves into liquid energy and disappears
the cylinder of the mcp glows brighter and brighter
on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this
a fountain of energy explodes upwards like a supernova right at the camera
shielding her face from the power of the blast
the nova of energy bursting upwards
we start to see the glow returning to the surrounding domains as the nova dissipates leaving the sky full of sparkling stars
still shielding her eyes but looking out in wonder at the domains regaining their life
one domain after another scattered around the horizon glows brightly increasing
the carrier starts to descend
leading dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian programs that were saved
he looks up spots the carrier descending
basically all that is left of it is the bridge with only a very faint image of the rest of the body
it lands on the mesa
tron catches yori as she jumps down
he hugs her close and looks at her about to speak
but she reaches up and presses her lips to his in a quick intense kiss
then pulls back
its something users do
he looks up at the bridge
he went into the beam
he saved you
he saved all of us
tron stares at her holding onto her shoulders
then he looks up at the sky thoughtfully
she also looks up
he really was a user
quietly sadly yes
of the landscape glowing again with new life every i o tower a shining beacon a symbol of the new found freedom of communication
and returning to the real world
close on the business end of the huge laser in icoms lab
a bright blast of light shoots out of the mechanism
widen to reveal the laser pouring its light onto the floor near the chair where flynn was sitting when he was digitized
slowly in a reverse of his disappearance flynns body takes shape on the floor
as the laser shuts off he is revealed intact back in his real world body and clothes
and as bewildered to find himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world
he studies his hands and sees that theyre now nonluminescent flesh and blood
he looks out the window and sees that its shortly past dawn with weak sunlight coming in
and at the sound of light machinery at work he turns to look at loras computer terminal where a hard copy computer printer is coughing out a long document on
wide blue paper
flynn gets up off the floor goes over to the printer and reads the document
as he does so his eyes widen and a smile appears on his face
the printer finishes its run clicks patiently
flynn exuberant tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it
bleary but excited they gaze happily at the information on alans crt screen as flynn bursts into the room waving his printout
hey you guys before he can say anything more alan turns to greet him holding up a seven inch computer software floppy disk in its cardboard sleeve
i made it
i worked out some new codes for tron put em on a disk and its running
i know i met him
alan and lora look at him the same sort of mystified look he got from tron and yori in the other world
he checks himself
i mean i saw it read up hey look at this
he shows them the printout
it takes alan and lora a few seconds of reading it to figure out its significance
your old files
and dillingers instructions to divert them its all there look even his home phone number when he logged on
oh that is beautiful
youve got the goods
flynn folds up the printout puts it in his pocket
alan and lora get up stretch start wandering slowly toward the door with him
youre telling me
as they talk camera pans over to alans color crt screen and holds on it
the lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off and are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a typical video game
a blue cylinder poised on a blue mesa resembling the mcp in the electronic world
and three yellow rockets
they move randomly at first then converge on the blue figure from three different directions
you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for
well just dont forget your old friends when youre rich and famous
are you kidding
you guysll he running this joint by then
your friend dillinger sure wont
the yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time
it explodes in typical video game fashion radiating lines of blue sparks
the yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical formation heading together toward the side of the crt screen as we hear flynn lora and alan heading for
hey you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games
youre getting out of the business
shouldnt you wait till your lawsuits settled
ive had enough of video games to last me a good long time
i feel like gettin into some real life
at the sound of the door to alans office closing o
the three yellow rockets leave the crt screen sailing off its left hand edge
