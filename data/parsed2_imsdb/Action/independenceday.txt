one small step for man one large pile of garbage for moon kind
untouched for years the flag stands next to the castoff remains of the apollo mission
slowly the discarded equipment begins to rattle and shake
an enormous shadow creeps towards us blotting out the horizon a loud rumble is heard
suddenly we are covered in darkness as the shadow engulfs us
only the lonely image of our earth hangs in the air until a huge silhouetted object suddenly blocks our view
a field of large satellite dishes scan the skies
super up a lone technician works on his putting skills
behind him wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data
a red light begins to flash
the technician turns and slowly walks towards the source
one by one a series of lights turn on
the technician tech one grabs a pair of headphones
his eyes widen
sleepily a supervisor picks up the phone
if this isnt an insanely beautiful woman im hanging up
shut up and listen
he holds the phone up to a speaker increases the volume
a strange fluctuating tone plays out in sequential patterns
hearing it the supervisor bolts up banging his head on the bunk above him
a pajama party on acid
five other technicians in various states of undress hover anxiously around the main console
the supervisor enters tying his robe
god i hope its not just another damned russian spy job
computer affirms the signal is unidentified
hanging up the phone the boy from air res traffic say the skies are clear
no terrestrial launches
its the real thing
a radio signal from another world
the room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of searching the heavens they might have finally found something
lets not jump the gun
run a trajectory source computation
tech three slides over to another computer
supervisor contd i want to know exactly where its coming from
this cant be right
tech three just stares at his screen in disbelief
calculated distance from source is at three hundred and eight five thousand kilometers
turning to supervisor its coming from the moon
the supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the speaker
as they listen to the strange tones we
elevator doors opens revealing four star general grey commander in chief u
understandably nervous the commanding officer escorts him down the hall
who else knows about this
in new mexico identified a signal but theyre even more confused than we are
the general shoots him a disapproving glance
excuse me sir
he slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly open
banks of computers technicians and assistants working feverishly through the night
the officers cross the room
super satellite reception has been impaired but we were able to get these
they arrive at a glass table
the surrounding officers snap to attention as a second officer quickly brings over a large transparency
we see a grainy image of a large vague object
looks like a big turd
the two officers exchange a glance
we estimate it has a diameter of over five hundred and fifty kilometers and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon
the general turns to the second officer concerned
how do you know
its slowing down
its doing what
slowing down sir
the general walks over to a phone picks it up
get me the secretary of defense
pause then wake him up
laying in bed thomas j
whitmore reads a stack of papers
the phone rings
filtering through phone hi
the warm look on whitmores face tells us everything about how he feels about the woman on the other end
what time is it there
dressed in a night gown mrs
margaret whitmore unpacks her briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks
through the window we see los angeles at night
two in the morning
i know didnt wake you
filtered as a matter of fact you did
whitmore sits up
i have a confession to make
theres a beautiful young blonde sleeping next to me
sleeping next to him his six year old daughter patricia
filtered you didnt let her stay up watching t
of course not
the little girl stirs awake looks up
youre flying back right after the luncheon
okay here she is
whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed
habitably he turns on the television
several pundits sit around a malaughlin type news discussion program
the picture quality is snowy static ridden
the inexperience in public office was inevitably going to catch up with him
hes scarified his ideals for politics as usual
whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality
i said this during the campaign
leadership as a pilot in the gulf war has no relationship to political leadership
its a different animal
suddenly the channel changes
a cartoon comes on
whitmore turns to his daughter who holds he remote
into phone daddy let me watch letterman
whitmore exits the room
as whitmore steps out of his bedroom a security guard snaps to attention
someone hidden behind a newspaper sits on a bench
good morning mr
good morning george
the paper is dropped revealing constance halbrook mid thirties aggressive sharp the presidents communications director
quickly she gathers her things and follows whitmore
two servants are preparing breakfast as whitmore and constance enter
whitmore sits down grabs a coffee
youre up early this morning connie
she tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands
theyre not attacking your policies theyre attacking your age
another paper reading
addressing congress whitmore seems less like the president and more like the orphan child oliver asking please sir id like some more
age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun
you were thought of as young and idealistic
but the message has gotten lost
theres too much compromise too much politics
pointedly isnt it amazing how fast everyone can turn against you
realizing she may be pushing him too far she hands him another paper
well the orange county register has named you one of the ten sexiest men of the year
you see substance at last
an aide appears at the doorway
excuse me mr
its the secretary of defense
whitmore goes to the phone picks it up
say that again
drifting away from us the old russian satellite becomes smaller and smaller
we pan with it as we see its on a collision course with something huge
suddenly the satellite explodes on impact with the much larger object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware
as huge as it is we get the feeling weve only seen a portion of the total
a slow crane down from the manhattan skyline revealing
with the new york skyline across the hudson behind them old men sit in this small park playing chess
unlike the others david martin is in his early thirties sixties hippie meets nineties yuppie nerd
he concentrates intensely on his next move
smokes a cigar impatiently
what are you waiting
my social security will expire youll still be sitting there
so think already
david makes a move
instantly moishe counters his move
david furls his brow in thought
again hes thinking
moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a styrofoam cup
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose
you dont move soon
ill begin to decompose
just as david finally makes his move moishe counters again
david shoots him a look and stares back down to the board
moishe contd david ive been meaning to talk with you
its nice youve been spending so much time with me but
dad dont start
im only saying its been what
four years you still havent signed your divorce papers
its not healthy
moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs
look whos talking healthy
suddenly davids beeper goes off
how many times is that now
you trying to get fired
david moves his queen
see you tomorrow dad
he gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away
thats not checkmate i can still
yelling after him you could let an old man win once in a while it wouldnt kill you
david pedals his bike through mid town manhattan
he arrives at compact cable systems
his bike hoisted on his shoulder david squeezes through the revolving doors
marty gilbert short nervous and harried comes rushing over
what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you dont turn it on
it was turned on
i was ignoring you
whats the big emergency
started this morning
every channel is making like its nineteen fifty
snow static all kinds of distortions
no one knows what the hell is going on
david deposits his bike in the kitchenette as marty tosses his coke bottle in the trash
david retrieves it
damn it marty
theres a reason we have bins labeled recycle
finding more bottles in the trash david turns to marty accusingly
what the hell is this
so sue me
before david can say anything marty ushers him out of the room
technicians are working feverishly
clearly every monitor is experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption
david moves over to the main console
did you try to switch to transponder channels
please would i be this panicked if it was that simple
david examines the readouts puzzled
lets retrofit the dish to another satellite
its not working
its almost as though they werent even there
david looks up puzzled
a hand smocks the side of it
eleven year old troy brennon tries to fix the television
his older brother miguel seventeen cooks breakfast
its all fuzzy
youre gonna break it
just leave it alone
here take your medicine
miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in front of troy
troy pushes the bottle away
i dont need it
pushing it back just take it dick head
turning to his sister alicia
make sure he takes his medicine
his sister alicia fourteen hormones kicking in testing boundaries listens to her walkman while putting on too much makeup
miguel throws a dish towel to get her as troy hits the television again
a beat up pick up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a halt on the gravel next to the brennon mobile home at this small shabby countryside
an angry farmer jumps out slamming his door
alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the angry farmers lucas who marches over
miguel edges her out of the doorway wanting to handle this himself
lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables
you like these
ive got a whole goddamned crop full
unceremoniously he dumps them at miguels feet
lucas contd where the hell is your father
you know what time it is
he had to re fuel
there musta been a problem
we both know what the problem is
hes a damned nut case is what he is
i musta been out of my mind
troy smacks the television again
troy stop it
i swear to god
miguel if hes not in the air in twenty minutes thats it
im getting someone else
lucas storms away
again troy whacks at the television
stop it troy
i swear to god
determined troy hits the television again
this time the picture goes out completely
rolling over us the immense under belly of this enormous craft obliterates our view
a loud screech
suddenly the bottom begins to segment
dozens of large sections begins to disengage extracting themselves twisting away from the larger bilge
the separated segments themselves are enormous
slowly they twist downwards on a collision course to the blue planet below
under a barrage of questions from her own staff constance hurries down the corridor
cnn is running a story that were covering up some kind of nuclear testing experiments
tell them to run with it if they want to embarrass themselves
nasa has been up my butt all morning
they want to know our position
our official position is we dont have an official position
connie what the hell is going on
constance escapes into the elevator turns around
smiles confidently come on people
would i keep you guys out of the loop
in a second
before she can retort the elevator doors close
the president general grey the secretary of defense and white house chief of staff albert nimziki are gathered around the couch
at the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable
isnt it possible that thing may just pass us by
what if it doesnt pass us by
lets retarget some icbms to blow it out of the sky
forgive me but with the little information we do have the only thing that would accomplish is turn one dangerous falling object into many
just then the door opens and constance enters
whats the damage
the press is making up their own stories at this point
to general grey get on the horn with atlantic command
lets upgrade the situation to defcon
thats not your call to make mr
isnt that a little premature
i dont think so
were two days away from the fourth of july
we have over fifty percent of our armed forces on weekend leave not to mention the troops and commanders we have in town for the fourth of july parade
we call them back now were sending up a major red flag
they go quiet as commanding officer from space command dashes into the room
our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit
well thats good news
he lays out the diagrams and photos on the table
everyone gathers around
part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen other pieces
smaller than the whole yet over fifteen miles in width themselves
where are they heading
they should be entering our atmosphere within the next twenty five minutes
the room is silenced
all eyes turn to the president who says nothing
nimziki leans in close to him
like it or not were at defcon
recall the troops and put them on yellow alert
as an alarm quickly buzzes
david leans into frame and opens the door to the microwave
we widen to reveal
david retrieves his home make cup a soup
we see this cubicle clearly has the david touch ecology posters plants tons of computers and electronic gizmos
please tell me youre getting something
marty enters looking over davids shoulder as he eats
theres good news and bad news
whats the bad news
youre in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch
and the good news is you wont charge me
the good news is i found the problem and its not our equipment
theres some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed
thats the good news
david slides over to another computer and turns on an intricate computation program
yes because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it
when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas we should be able to block
out the overlay completely
and well be the only guys in town with a clear picture
thats my man
racing over back roads behind a long open field miguel rides his beat up motor bike searching
looking up he sees something in the air
converted into a crop duster buzzes overhead
spraying insecticide wildly the plane zigzags over the field
god damn it russell
looking down from the cockpit russell brennon waves stupidly
shaggy blonde hair and two days growth russell is the image of a fifty one year old little boy
miguel follows him below screaming at him
russell flying recklessly looks down at miguel not understanding
by the time he looks back he sees
at the edge of the field nearly on top of him
in a trick move russell turns the plane on its side and slices through the narrow gap between the trees
miguel screams with delight at his prowess
miguel looks pissed
miguel races over skidding to a halt next to the landed bi with plane
just what the hell do you think youre doing
climbing down im bringing home the bacon
earning my keep
and doing a fine job if i do say so myself
its the wrong field you idiot
lucas farm is on the other side of town
damn it he was doing you a favor
you know how hard it is to find someone who doesnt think youre completely crazy
what are we supposed to do now
where are we supposed to go now
pissed miguel peels away kicking gravel back at russell
pathetically he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a bottle of jack daniels
he takes a healthy swig

suddenly a group of shouting screaming tribes people come rushing past him
the bedouin watches them with confusion
overcome with curiosity he goes against the tide of people up the hillside

creeping from across the horizon above the rocky mountain terrain a wide high in the sky flaring and exploding
a terrifying sight

the lieutenant moves over to the main radar screen
the entire upper portion of the screen is blank

excuse me sir radar may be malfunctioning but infrared is off the map
he diverts the lieutenants attention to another screen a bright sea of red light bleeds off the map
get the cinc atlantic command on the line
a technical officer rips off a data sheet as it shoots out of the printer and rushes over to the commanding officer
sir we now have visual range with incoming over iraqi airspace
a second sighting
yes sir this just came in from the eisenhower
the commanding officer grabs a phone laying off the hook
correction we have two confirmed visual contacts
one over iraq one over the pacific
the room is packed
the president and his chief advisors are there along with the joint chief of staff
representatives from the atlantic command and u
space command have formed small clusters around telephones
where in the pacific
turning to the president theyve spotted one off the california coast line
surrounded by the secret service the president is speechless
constance halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to the president
put it on
constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the t
the reception is still fuzzy picture rolling
the cnn news broadcast shows the phenomenon over novosibirsk russia
there is mass hysteria behind the reporter
filtered sightings of this atmospheric phenomenon have been reported here in novosibirsk russia and other parts of siberia
moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor astronomers are baffled as to its origin
everyone is locked onto the television mesmerized
newscasters contd filtered widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets and clogged the highways
hundreds have been injured
general grey confers with the atlantic command cinc
he nods turns to the president and whispers
president we have an awac on the west coast
with contact point three minutes
wall to wall computer radar and intelligence gathering equipment
technicians frantically try to adjust as the system goes hay wire
reporting into radio its no use
side radar doesnt see a thing
reporting thats correct
were imc blind sir
we track across them over to the pilots and into the cockpit
the pilot squints out the window as he speaks
we still have zero visibility
zooming overhead as we see the awac sailing through a thick cloudy sky
super pacific coastline california the awac disappears from view into the clouds
the president and his top advisors are gathered around a speaker phone listening to the pilot of the awac
filtered instrumentation is malfunctioning
we cant get any kind of reading on whats in front of us
the pilot squints as he tries to see through the clouds
wait a minute it may be clearing
suddenly the clouds part before us and were face to face with the speaker phone cracks and distorts
filtered jesus god
the skys on fire
the awac attempts to climb sharply as we get our first real look at the atmospheric phenomenon
majestic and monstrous
the awac is not going to be able to make it
quickly it is engulfed in the flames
the phone line goes dead
general grey spins to an aide
get them back on line
on other phone lines gone sir
the atlantic command cinc turns from a different phone
two more have been spotted over the atlantic
one is moving toward new york the other is headed this direction
how much time do we have
less than ten minutes
turning to aid organize a military escort to crystal mountain
to president sir i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately
the president hesitates he turns to constance
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia
more than likely
president you can discuss this on the way
torn the president grapples with a decision
im not leaving
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis
i want the vice president secretary of defense the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location
im staying here
i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives
so far these things have not become hostile
for the moment lets assume they wont
to constance connie lets issue statements advising people not to panic to stay home and take cover
constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly exit along with most people in the room
general grey goes over to the president
with your permission mr
president id like to remain my your side
i had a feeling you would
sir what happens if they do become hostile
then god help us
on the t
behind david news footage of the phenomenon in russia plays silently
oblivious david works his computers
stopping in doorway david are you watching this
david waves her away deep in concentration
suddenly a computer beeps
excitedly david prints out his finding
he grabs it and exits
engrossed in his printout david walks past his co workers who are glued to the distorted picture on the television watching the phenomenon
marty stares at his television watching general grey addressing the press
david enters staring at his reading
ive got a lock on the signal pattern
we can filter it out
oh good hood
strange thing is if my calculations are right itll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway
the signal reduces itself every time it recycles
eventually it will disappear
are you listening
still glued to t
can you believe this
what re you talking about
havent you been watching
david turns for the first time to the television and sees the phenomenon
constance comes on addressing the press
filtered so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage
in all likelihood it wont
more reporters rush in from the back quickly setting up as this hastily called press conference continues
everyone should remain calm
take cover where you can but the important thing is not to panic
miguel alicia and troy watch the static riddled t
filtered we have a fix on three different occurrences about to appear over american cities
one is headed toward los angeles

suddenly hectic co worker appear at the door
jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter

dry to david feel no shame in hiding
a crowd of people head down the hall for the shelter while others stay glued to the set
there is a mix of fascination and panic
david watches the commotion dumb struck
oh shit i better call my wife
depressed russell nurses a beer at the counter
three flight mechanics walk in having a good laugh
one of them spots russell and moves over to him
hey russ heard you had a little trouble this morning
dusted the wrong field
the mechanics laugh
russell tries to ignore them
i know youre probably still a little confused from your hostage experience
something happen to you russ
he aint never told you

russell gets up and heads for the door
you just gotta get a couple more beers in him hell tell you all about it
wont you russ
the mechanic follows russell outside his buddies in tow
hey russ when they took you up in their space ship they do any sexual things to you
the mechanics crack up laughing
suddenly the things around them begin to rumble
the shadow engulfs them silencing the mechanics
panicked they turn and run away
russell just looks up at the sky grabs his jack daniels and takes another swig
dogs bark and people stumble out of their trailers as an enormous shadow creeps over them
the windows grow dark and the room begins to rumble
miguel rushes to the door ushering his siblings out
alicia and troy step out the door stopping dead in their tracks
miguel follows them only to look up and see
the flames are burning out replaced by huge plumes of dark smoke billowing around the edges of the phenomena
only small traces of extinguishing flames illuminate it
david pushes past the people making their way down fighting against the tide
another co worker stops halfway
arent you coming david
no way ive got to see this
frightened tourists run for cover as the colossal shadow approaches
reflected in the water below we see the fiery apparition transfigure into the dark foreboding clouds
the shadow writhes up the detailed statue of lincoln devouring him completely until we are left in total darkness
people are being evacuated from their offices
patricia the presidents daughter breaks away from her nanny
the president talks on the phone
constance waits nearby
into phone of course russia and the united states are in this together
president you have my word
yes das vedanya
the president hangs up
what is their position
i think he was drunk
patricia bursts through the door and runs into her fathers arms terrified
a secret service man appears
president we have to go
abruptly the room darkens as it begins to rumble
the long dark shadow moves across the entire white house engulfing it in darkness
in the distance we see the mutated phenomenons dark gray clouds nearing miss
as it approaches we see the new york skyline begin to darken
kids playing basket ball
a young boy stops playing staring skyward
one by one they all look upwards stunned as a long dark shadow creeps over them
with a loud crash several new york cabs slam into one another in the street
two more cars crash into them
a pile up ensues
foot traffic stops as the long shadow crawls over the entire area
large satellite dishes beset a doorway to the roof which flies open
david steps out just as a long dark shadow covers over him sending the city into darkness
david looks up to see
protruding through the dark clouds we get a glimpse of the underbelly of a colossal alien craft its outer veneer of smoke and clouds beginning to fade away
below we see panic cabs slamming into one another people staring people screaming
no one knows how to react
david runs to the other side of the rooftop overlooking central park to get a better look
the entire park is plunged into darkness as the craft above blots out of the sun
amazing as it may seem the hovering craft blankets the entire park and beyond
we still have not seen an entire craft realizing my god
a panoramic view of the los angeles basin
slowly filling the screen we see a portion of the enormous space craft as it creeps towards the city obliterating our view
a station wagon filled with kids and a harried housewife comes to a stop
the passenger door opens and a young six year old boy dylan steps out
dylan tell your mom you can stay overnight again thursday
suddenly a car sails over a nearby hill in front of them hitting the ground with a bang
two more cars follows air bound
as the housewife turns she sees
rising over the mountain we see the space ship as it nears the city blocking out the sunshine
panicked the housewife hits the gas and peels out leaving a confused dylan staring skyward
two people sleep as dylan runs into the room
mommy look at
he rushes away
the shadow moves past the window darkening the room
his mother jasmine dubrow stirs
re darkness its too early baby
she turns back over
suddenly the room briefly rumbles
not even a four pointer
go back to sleep
shrugging the man does
in los angeles
the shadow slowly covers the sign
the president and his daughter cautiously approach the window staring in awe at the amazing sight above them
several others approach from behind
cautiously some people begin to walk outside staring up at the leviathan mouths agape
slowly staff members approach gazing out the window
constance steps up behind the president
what do we do now
address the nation
there are a lot of very frightened people out there right now
im one of them
all of washington is under the shadow of this gargantuan alien craft
a stunning tableau
the man sleeping next to jasmines beagle boomer drops stevens tennis shoes on top of him waking him
hes trying to impress you
hes doing a good job
he pats the dog on the head and takes the shoes
steven gets up and makes his way to the bathroom
as steve takes a pee he sees out the window a family packing up their car others standing around staring at something in the distance
a helicopter flies overhead
neighbors are moving
i think theyre tired of earthquakes
he finished and flushes
steve enters the living room
the television is playing a news broadcast
with little damage reported to the southland area
people are advised not to panic
hon somethings on the table bout the quake
jasmine sits up in bed yelling out to steve
dylan out there
steve turns looking for dylan when the doggie door pops open and dylan crawls through
what have you been up to sport
holding his gun shooting aliens
steve musses up the boys hair smiling
steve mumbles an affirmative as he exits
steve picks up the morning paper and opens it
he doesnt notice the dozens of neighbors quickly packing up and rushing to get away as he reads the paper oblivious
you want milk with your coffee
jasmine appears behind him her view too obscured by the open newspaper
suddenly another helicopter room overhead
annoyed steve lowers his paper
as the paper is lowered we see the helicopter swoop down
as it flies away we see
covering all of los angeles
this is the first time we see the entire craft
it is stupendous
steves jaw hits the floor
the milk goes crashing as jasmine screams
running for all hes worth david sprints down the stairs
dashing off the stairs david stops seeing that the room is now completely empty
the wall of monitors play for no one
david walks up to one adjusting the volume
a space ship logo spins next to the words visitors contact or crisis
wolf blitzer comes on screen live from the pentagon
pentagon officials are reporting more ships have just arrived over the capitals of india england and germany
as he speaks we get quick glimpses of the other ships
i know babycakes
david spins around at the sound of the voice but the room is still empty
david leans down and looks under a desk where he finds marty still on the phone with his wife
tell her to get the kids and leave town
yells just do it
marty realizes david is dead serious
babycakes pack the kids up and take them to your mothers
mary hangs up crawls out from under the table
marty contd okay why did i just send my family to atlanta
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction
its a countdown confused a countdown to what
its like in chess
first you strategically position your pieces
then when the timings right
david motions to the television
there are additional unconfirmed sightings over japan the mediterranean and china
they are positioning themselves all over the world and using this one signal to synchronize their efforts
in approximately six hours the signal will disappear and the countdown will be over
marty takes a beat to digest
then grabbing the phone
i gotta call my brother my bookie my lawyer
fuck my lawyer
david also grabs a phone
suddenly the bank of monitors synchronize into one enormous image across the entire video wall the president addressing the nation
the president stands at the podium giving his address
my fellow americans a historic and unprecedented event has taken place
the question as to whether or not we are alone in the universe has been answered
as constance watches the president she unconsciously mouths the words of his speech after all she did write them
a press aide tugs on her sleeve
she tries to wave her off
he says hes your husband
her expression drops
she takes the phone from her
what do you want
filtered you have to leave the white house
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion
you dont understand
you have to leave washington impatient constance tries to get off the phone
in case you havent noticed were in a little bit of a crisis here
filtered ive worked with embedded loading
theyre communicating with a hidden signal
theyre going to attack
youre being paranoid
filtered its not paranoia
the embedding is very subtle
its probably been overlooked
constance hangs up
her face betrays mixed emotions
david stares at the phone pissed
something on t
catches his attention
through the snowy image he sees
filtered my staff and i are remaining here at the white house while we attempt to establish communication
hanging up the phone david sprints for the exit
president whitmore contd so remain calm
if you are compelled to leave these cities please do so in a safe and orderly fashion
the rush to get away creeps slowly as cars jam the streets in total grid lock
david pedals his bike furiously through traffic
the mass exodus has reached the bridge
david fights his way through
the new york skyline behind him across the hudson david jumps off his bike and races towards a row of tract houses
david bangs on the door
it flies open
moishe is holding a hunting rifle pointing it at david
the television said theyve started with the looting already vultures
you still got the olds
you want to borrow the car

steve wearing his marine flight officer uniform shoves the last of his things into his duffel bag
we notice there are small figurines of dolphins everywhere
jasmine hovers nervously behind him
you cant go
call them back
baby you know how it is
i have to report to el toro right away
you said you were on leave for the fourth
they cancelled it
why are you acting like this
jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away
we see the alien craft through the window
that thing scares the piss out of me
dylan sits behind the wheel pretending to drive
steve grabs him pulling him out
he reaches into his duffel grabs a small brown paper bag
i got these for you

dylan opens the bag fireworks
jasmine walks over
steve tosses his gear into the back opens his door
i have to tell you something

steve hops into his car and peels out
jasmine takes the bag from dylan
ill take these
a perfectly preserved olds drives cautiously down the highway
around him we see other cars packed to the gills as they make their escape from new york
not the most confident driver moishe holds the steering wheel close to his chest
its the white house for crying out loud
you cant just drive up and ring the bell
cant this thing go any faster
you think they dont know what you know

more ships keep arriving fifteen in total so far
this is crazy
were loosing our first strike capabilities

what the hell are they up to
a long crowded highway of people trying to escape from los angeles can be seen in the distance
the huge space craft hovering behind them
miguel is on the roof of the trailer adjusting the t
antenna trying to get a picture
suddenly the image clears and we see a group of people in a crowded hallway
filtered a local crop duster was arrested today attempting to land at edwards air force base
on the t
we see russell being escorted to a police car
mortified miguel cant believe what hes seeing
theyve got to do something
i was abducted by space aliens ten years ago
they did all kinds of experiments on me
theyve been studying us for years learning our weakness
weve go to do something before they kill us all
just as troy starts to climb up miguel changes the channel to mrs
troy sits down next to miguel
filtered we need to remain calm
as more people decide to leave the cities safety is key
troy you remember uncle hector from tucson

miguel grabs her by the wrist and pulls her away
we see the long highway leading to washington the space ship hovering above it
one side of the freeway is packed solid the other completely empty save for one car
moishe looks to the other side of the freeway jam packed
on his side they are the only car for miles
the whole world is trying to get out of washington and were the only schmucks trying to get in
as moishe drives david distracts him as he unpacks his backpack unloading his laptop
he grabs a cd
moishe contd what the hell is that
this pops is every phone book in america
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed
she always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies
sometimes its just her first initial sometime her nickname
david starts to look it up
in the attempt to get out hundreds of cars have been re directed by the military to use the opposite side of the highway
oh my god
moishe swerves violently to avoid collision barely missing the oncoming traffic
dodging right to left moishe hangs on for dear life
a military office assisting in diverting the cars turns just in time to see the olds whiz by
david and moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as moishe tries to veer through traffic
suddenly a truck blocks off their only escape route
moishe turns hard and drives up onto the right shoulder
the olds is the only car in headed that direction
using the shoulder swerving to miss barricades they drives off an exit ramp
nice driving pops
dangerously close to a heart attack moishe is for once at a loss for words
over their adrenaline pumped faces
put your hands together for sabrina
a bikini clad sabrina twirls gracefully on the stage
as she comes to a stop we reveal sabrina is actually jasmine
she looks out into the audience and her expression drops
five strippers and eight customers
all crowded near the television watching the news
helicopter footage of people gathered on the rooftops of downtown los angeles holding up drawings of space aliens
filtered from the it could only happen in california file hundreds of ufo fanatics have gathered on the rooftops of downtown los angeles welcoming the new arrivals
jasmine storms into the dressing room
wiping off her makeup she sits down next to tiffany who watches the same report on a small b w
i cant believe i even came in tonight
what was i thinking

and you thought i was nuts
oh look i brought mine with me
tiffany holds up a drawing of a space alien
youre not thinking of joining those idiots

jasmine turns to tiffany dead serious
tiffany i dont want you to go up there

her boss mario enters and walks over to his private office in back
he opens the door and finds dylan playing with his dog boomer
what the hells your kid doing here
jasmine rushes past picking up dylan and carrying him away as she heads for the exit
you try to find a sitter today
where do you think youre going
you leave youre fired
out the door nice working with you mario
the streets are nearly deserted
millions of small lights on the underbelly of the craft cast strange reflections on the streets below
the olds drives on its way towards the capitol building
david types frustratedly on his laptop

i just havent found it yet
i tried c
halbrook connie halbrook spunky halbrook

she didnt take my name when we were married
david gives it a shot
the machine sarcastic so what do i know
a crowded locker room
where the hellve you been
ah were you guys waiting for me
several marines throws towels at steve as he makes his way to his locker
his best friend jimmy sits next to him
can you believe it
this is serious shit stevie
theyve recalled everyone as steve sits he sees some envelops stuck into the side of his locker
well the mails still working
he flips through the envelops and freezes when he sees one with the nasa insignia on it
jimmy snatches it away from him
you dont want this
steve quickly snatches it back right it open and reads
from the disappointment on his face we can tell its bad news
realizing jimmy puts a hand on steves shoulder
i dont believe it
they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down
what else do they want you to learn
how to kiss ass
steve crumples at the letter and tosses it
angrily he opens his locker
pasted on the locker door we see photos of jasmine next to the photos of the space shuttle apollo missions and a nasa insignia bumper sticker
as steve stuffs his jacket into the locker something falls out
before steve can grab it jimmy snatches it up first
embarrassed jasmine has this thing for dolphins
i had them make it
i thought you said you were doing to break it off
steve snatches it back embarrassed
jimmy contd steve listen to me youre never gonna get to fly the space shuttle if you marry a stripper
steve knows hes right
the olds stops near the white house
from here we can see tanks and armed patrols
a small group of protesters have gathered upset about the military hardware
signs dont provoke violence begets violence
david adjusts a small portable satellite connecting it to his phon and laptop computer
so you want to ring the bell or should i
david flips open the phone dials the number on the screen
perfect shes using it
its perfect the line is busy
i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house
you can do that
shooting his father a look
sarcastic all cable repairmen can
constance is just finishing a call on her cellular phone
sally take my cat with when you leave
no im staying here at the white house
the moment she hangs up it rings
surprised she answers

constance looks up to the large glass windows
she walks over to it looking out
what am i looking for
between two of the tanks outside constance can see david standing on top of the olds across the street
moishe steps out waves
constance is stunned
to herself how does he do that
sulking alicia sits in back with he walkman on
troy sleeps while miguel drives
suddenly miguel his the brakes as something comes sailing down from the sky
we realize its the b wing plane landing on the stretch of roadway directly in front of them
the plane lands skids into a turn
russell jumps out walks over to the trailer
we can tell hes drunk again
they let you out
just what the hell do you think youre doing
miguel moves to meet russell away from the trailer not wanting the others to hear
were leaving dont try and stop us
youre not going anywhere
you hear me
im still your father
miguel explodes this has been building up for some time
no youre not
youre just the man who married my mother
youre nothing to me
russell is momentarily silent stunned
troys still my son no matter how you feel about me
for once in your life think about whats best for troy
who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up
suddenly we hear glass crashing
both men spin to find troy standing behind them
im not a baby
i dont need your stupid medicine
i dont need anyone to take care of me
miguel leans down to see the broken medicine bottle on the floor
miguel rushes over to him furious
you know what this stuff costs
do you want to get sick again
frustrated miguel shoves troy aside and heads back into the trailer
wobbly from the drinking russell stands there pathetically watching
a large group of press rush over toward four apache helicopters each refitted with a large light boards as they slowly lift off the ground
cameras flash reporters yell questions to the officers assigned to keep them at bay
several news organizations do stand up remotes
we track past them to the cnn crew
what you see behind me are four apache helicopters
on the television plays the cnn broadcast
the reception is intermittently disrupted
filtered through t
each has been refitted with what pentagon officially hope will be our first step in communicating with the alien craft
we widen to reveal a large contingent of military personnel along with the presidents chief advisors gathered around several monitors the center monitors are momentarily blank
suddenly everyone snaps to attention as the president enters
where are we
theyre in the air
moishe inspects a photo of constance with the president impressed he nods with approval
to himself very nice
constance is looking at davids laptop displaying the breakdown of the alien signal
and when is the countdown supposed to expire
checking fifty six minutes forty five seconds
constance runs her fingers through her hair exasperated
moishe turns listens
what do you want me to do
i want you to leave with us
i cant leave
we have to tell this to the president
hes not going to listen to me
surprised at his son moishe steps forward
sure hell listen
why wouldnt he
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face
you punched the president in the face
he wasnt the president then
david thought i was having an affair which i wasnt punched the president
oh my god
zoom by overhead
in the distance we see they are headed for the enormous alien craft
the pilot adjusts his radio
echo one we are closing in
the choppers alter their formation aligning themselves alongside one another
as the helicopters near the craft we see how tiny they appear against the gargantuan space ship
the elevator doors open and moishe steps out overwhelmed and impressed
constance leads them down the hall
moishe turns to david whispers
if i had known i was going to meet the president id a worn a tie
look at me i look like a schlemiel
the office is empty as the trio walks in
moishe cant believe hes in there
he straightens himself up combs his hair
ill be right back
david sets up his laptop
not on his desk
the middle monitors are now on
they show the night vision p
of the helicopters as they approach
on the side monitors we see the various news broadcast of this event
filtered the helicopters are making their final approach
on the middle monitor through the night vision camera on the lead helicopter we see the side of the craft as the helicopters near
everyone in the room watches tense
constance enters and kneels down next to the president whispering in his ear
the president gets up and follows constance
chief of staff nimziki objects
youre leaving now the president silences him with a look
as they exit
i dont know how you put up with him
he used to run the nasa
he knows where all the bones are buried
comes in handy
the door flies open and constance and the president enter
the moment president whitmore sees david he freezes
what the hells he doing here
moishe bursting steps forward
moishe martinsburg mr
my ex husband works in satellite communications
i dont have time for this
with a bang david suddenly knocks everything off the presidents desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter
its about line o sight mr
david draws a circle representing earth and a smaller circle just away from it
the president reluctantly nears
if you wanted t coordinate with ships all over the world you couldnt send one signal to every place at the same time
thats called line of sight
drawing a line from the ship of either side of the earth we see that you could not send a signal to the other side
david contd youd need to relay your signal using satellites
david draws small satellites surrounding earth
david contd to reach each ship
i have found a signal hidden inside our own satellite network
suddenly an aide alex appears in the doorway
excuse me mr
the president turns to the monitor in his office
we see the helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front of their cockpits
he turns back to david
president they are using our own satellites against us and the clock is ticking
the large light panels turn on multi colored lights slowly begins to flash in a repeating sequential patterns
the helicopters are puny little specs next to this goliath
the light boards continues to flash but there is no reaction from the ship
everyone is glued to the monitors as the president storms in
general grey co ordinate with atlantic command
tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can
and get those helicopters away from the ship
call them back immediately
general grey obeys turning to an assistant who quickly grabs a phone
nimziki steps up to the president
what the hells going on
an aide motions to the monitors
the room goes silent everyone turns to the monitors
on all screens we see the space ship as a long thin line of white light suddenly emits from the side of the craft illuminating the four apache helicopters
the light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming from the space craft
suddenly with a loud screeching noise the white light spills out as the huge opening unfolds at the side of the craft
the four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions as something powerful emits from the schism in the ship
then like a gigantic bug zapper the four pesky little apache helicopters are blown out of the sky one by one
they leave no time to retreat
whitmore packs her bag as the horrifying image of the destruction of the helicopter replays on the t
the president has ordered the evacuation
we have to leave now
she slams her valise shut and quickly exits
soars over us headed directly for downtown los angeles
the ufo true believers are still there holding up their signs
making her way through several of them we see tiffany she looks up to the spacecraft above
awed its beautiful
she digs her drawing of an alien out of her purse as she excitedly rushes up to the others
she holds it up to the sky proudly
from out of nowhere the helicopter lifts up over the side of the building shining its spotlight down the believers below
we are evacuating the city
please leave the building at once
the sign holders begin to boo the police ignoring them
the freeway is packed on both sides every car headed out of town
there is no opposing traffic
dylan holds boomers as jasmine drives
the news plays over her car radio
authorities have called for a complete evacuation of los angeles county
people are advised to avoid the highways whenever possible
now he tells me
the president stops on his way to the presidential helicopter as an aide brings his daughter outside
the president ushers her into the helicopter
he turns back and see a military guard holding back moishe and david
let them on
the president steps inside turns to general grey
is my wife in the air
she should be shortly
david flips open his laptop which reads
the presidential helicopter lifts off as several other helicopters wait behind people filing into them
the police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the ufo believers who refuse to budge
suddenly the entire rooftop is bathed in white light
they all grow silent staring up at the craft
above them another schism has opened at the bottom of the craft the white light spilling out
as though the heavens had opened the ufo believers lift their arms waiting to be taken
no take me
slowly this beam of light from the base of the ship intensifies directly on the top of this building
standing on this rooftop heliport directly across from the ufo believers the first lady watches them concerned
yelling over helicopter mrs
reluctantly the first lady turns and runs for the helicopter
the door is shut and the helicopter takes off
with a roar the presidential helicopter zooms past behind it we see an enormous schism opening beneath the space craft
alex is helping people get onto the remaining helicopters
suddenly he is bathed in white light
he looks up and sees the schism its white beam coming directly down upon the white house
the pinnacle of this landmark is abruptly illuminated in white light
we pan up to the space craft above the beam intensifying from the schism below the ship
the presidential helicopter lands
the president and his group are ushered over to air force one which stands only hundred yard away
the door opens and the president and his advisors rush in
david flops down into a seat quickly flips open his laptop which reads
as the light amplifies the believers chant louder and louder
suddenly the white light disappears
the believers are stunned
in a brief moment it is replaced with a blast
a destruction beam blasts down onto the rooftop splintering everything there police helicopter included into a billion tiny particles
tiffany is he epicenter from here the wall of destruction grows outwardly destroying everything in its path
just as the blast hits the historic building is decimated
alex shuts the door on a helicopter
as he steps back the white light vanishes
he looks up as the blast replaces the beam
just as one of the helicopters pass us the white house air force one quickly taxis down the runway toward us
behind them in the distance we can see the destructive beam growing outwardly from the epicenter
the wall of destruction reaches the capitol building fragmenting into a trillion particles
washed under the wall of destruction the pentagon too is blown to smithereens
thick with tension
everyone is white knuckled anxious for take off as they taxi quicky down the runway
air force one full throttle
it lifts off just in time to miss the wall of destruction as it rips apart the airport behind them dangerously close
we see the wave of destruction growing outwardly from the epicenter engulfing all of washington
air force one is just barely making it out in time
jasmines car is caught in traffic just outside the tunneled underpass at the griffith park mountains
filtered my god
its destroying everything in its path
suddenly the radio cuts out
jasmine turns around and sees
far off the devastation of downtown can be seen
the wall of destruction growing towards us
reacting jasmine grabs dylan and dashes out of the car
every drivers who can jumps out of their cars running in all directions
jasmine heads for the tunnel
the grid locked cars have nowhere to run as the wall of destruction grows out from downtown
all the cars are wiped out in a row sitting ducks
packed with cars
theyre quickly demolished as the wall of destruction blasts by
jasmine turns back from the tunnel entrance
ever nearing only moments away
jasmine spots an open maintenance alcove deep within the tunnel
she runs to it puts dylan inside and climbs in after him
leaning back out jasmine looks for boomer who stares at her wagging his tail
boomer leaps inside and jasmine ducks to the side of the wall of destruction hits the tunnel entrance cars are jammed together smashing into one another
suddenly the car are blown clear through the tunnel like so many toy hot wheel cars
inside the maintenance alcove jasmine shields dylan and boomer with her body
from a distance we watch as all of manhattan is consumed from its center outwardly by the growing wall of destruction
within seconds all of manhattan is gone
the wall of destruction reaches its outer most edges and fades away
the schism under the craft slowly closes
the ship now hovers over a completely wiped out manhattan
a hand adjusts the trailer radio
filtered reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation but from all accounts los angeles washington and new york have been left in ruins
russell shoots a worried look over to miguel
suddenly troy moves up to the front on wobbly legs
guys i dont feel so good
when was the last time you had your medicine
troy looks really sick
miguel is shocked
but i gave you some this morning
i didnt take it
i thought i didnt need it anymore
the trailer with russells bi wing in tow pulls over
troy rushes out vomiting on the side of the road
miguel comes to his aide
russell steps out and walks to the curve in the highway
come take a look at this
reluctantly miguel leaves his brothers side
below an entire valley filled with campers trailers and busses
an instant refugee city if you will for as far as the eye can see
thirty five pilots are being briefed by their commanding office captain watson who points to a fuzzy photograph of the craft over los angeles
you will be the first wave in our counter attack
though surveillance satellite reconnaissance has been impaired we have a fix on our primary target
steve and jimmy sit next to each other near the back of the room whispered you wont exactly need radar to find it
watson is annoyed
you want to add something to this briefing lt
steve smiles confidently
just real anxious to kick some alien ass
everyone chuckles including captain watson
huge hangar doors open revealing an f a hornet one of the u
thirty f a s await take off on the tarmac as technicians and flight crews race for position
the heat waves momentarily obscure our view as the f a s take to the air
the president is deeply contemplative
constance sits down next to him
she knows what hes thinking
you saved a lot of lives
i could have evacuated the cities hours ago
beat you know when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple
we knew what we had to do
its not simple anymore connie
a lot of people died today
how many didnt have to
constance realizes theres no comforting him
she supports him silently by being there
general grey comes over
any news on my wife
the helicopter never arrived at nellis and theres been no radio contact
the news rocks the president
they both know what that means
general grey contd the fighters are in the air
whitmore nods and follows the general to the back of the plane
military command has been set up on air force one a kind of flying norad
military and technical crew are seated at the controls
nimziki is already there
all satellites microwave and ground communications with the cities are gone
we believe were looking at a total loss
maintaining his composure the president looks up at the many tracking screens
where are they
pointing eta with target four minutes
five f a fighters move into frame
as we widen we reveal a total of f a s in attack formation destination los angeles
steve pulls a long cigar out of his breast pocket
into radio jimmy crack corn do you have victory dance
jimmy pulls his cigar out
into radio that is an affirmative
i have victory dance
filtered dont get premature on me jimmy
we dont light up til the fat lady sings
i hear you
air sick david holds a barf bag as moishe talks
its air force one for crying out loud
still he gets sick
moishe please dont talk
moishe pats his belly
look at me like a rock
good weather bad doesnt matter
motions with his hands we can go up and down back and forth side to side
david cant take any more of this story and takes off running for the bathroom
what i say
constance comes over sits next to moishe
he still gets air sick huh
in all of this i didnt get the chance to thank you two
think nothing of it spanky
constance smiles corrects him
he told you about that
nods all he could think about was getting to you
theres still love there i think
sadly love was never our problem
all you need is love
shot in the back very sad
in the distance we can see the devastated los angeles the space craft still hovering above it
the fighters zoom into frame
steve looks down becomes worried
i shouldnt have left her
filtered dont worry big guy
im sure she got out of here before it happened
steve nods absently
lets lock and load
the center f a on the radar map begins to flash yellow just under its image
we see a video display of its flir forward looking infrared targeting system locked on
los angeles attack squadron has amraam missiles locked on target
washington and new york squadrons reporting lock on
fire at will
an advanced medium range air to air missile amraam drops down from the underbelly of the fighter darting off
radar targeted the missile banks hard adjusting
we see it is joined by fourteen other missiles all rocketing towards their target
the missiles are headed straight for the alien ship
suddenly about a quarter mile before they reach it they explode as though blown out of the sky
when the smoke clears we see there has been zero damage
filtered i didnt even see them fire
command eagle one
switching to sidewinders
were moving in
in unison these amazing birds dive together realigning themselves into six groups of five spreading out to attack different areas of the ship
the first attack group steves are the first to near the colossal alien craft
simultaneously they drop their aim sidewinder missiles
they reach the same quarter mile proximity and explode
they must have some kind of protective shield surrounding their hull
most of the fighters do but one is too late and smashes into the ships protective shield
steves squadron banks hard skirting the edge of the ships protective shield
as the fighters approach the alien ships enormous attack bay doors open
suddenly dozens of alien attackers dart out towards our fighters
filtered evasive maneuvers
just moving away in time our fighters barely dodge the oncoming enemy attackers as they fire a hailstorm of firepower tracker bullet like lasers showering the sky
as steves plane dives an attacker follows
jimmys plane pulls up behind the attacker
jimmys hud has the alien attacker in his sights
filtered got you covered stevie
jimmy fires another aim sidewinder takes off
the sidewinder overtakes the attacker as steve rolls away out of position
five yards before the sidewinder can get to the attacker it explodes
theyve got shield too
banks back around to get a shot
just as he turns three american fighters are blown to ribbons from attacker tracer fire
the attackers are in hot pursuit of jimmys fighter
the fighter flying next to jimmy is demolished
jimmy roll right
jimmys fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as steve fires another sidewinder momentarily distracting the attacker
jimmy falls in line with steve as the attackers turn on them
both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at mach one
narrowly missing the ground they bank away
the attackers cant follow
fighter after fighter begin to disappear from the display screens
were losing them
then get them out of there
suddenly one of the large radar display maps fizzles out
weve lost the satellite
before he can adjust another monitor fizzles away
one by one we see the fighters getting taken out
fireballs litter the laser tracer fire covered skies
maybe we can out run them
follow my lead
jimmy and steve bank away from the craft hit the supercruise bolting away at mach
both jimmy and steve are held tight against their seats straining against the g force
two attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit
steve and jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds the attackers slowly gaining on them
jimmy kick it
were already over mach
so push it
readouts show the planes flying beyond measurement
as the planes accelerate jimmy fights to remain conscious
jimmy stay with me
jimmy slowly loses consciousness
his fighter slows drifting off to the right
gain on them
one catches up with jimmys fighter and fires
laser tracers shower the fighter
job done his attacker banks away returning to los angeles
steves attacker stays right with him slowly gaining
steve kicks his harder keeping the distance
a radar operator spots something on his screens
he turns to captain watson
we have incoming
i dont think so
watson hits an alarm which roars
a dozen pilots race out onto the field running for their planes
before anyone can reach them the sky darkens with alien attackers who strafe the runway
through the front glass of the tower we see the attackers firing
one fires directly at the tower
watson dives for cover as everything around him erupts into a gigantic the entire base goes up in flames
steve looks down over the side of his fighter
steve hits the brakes
surprised the attacker sails past
taking the moment steve dives down into the grand canyon
to himself okay jerk off
lets have some fun
the attacker recovers dives after steve who flies dangerously close to the canyon walls
the attacker has trouble keeping up with him but does
steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics banking diving swerving
the attacker seems to be improving following closer and closer
steve ducks into smaller canyons twisting sideways
still the attacker follows close
frustrated steve gets pissed
steve turns down a dead and side canyon
the attacker is right on his tail
lets see if youre fully equipped
the fighter is on a collision course with the end of the canyon wall
suddenly steve yanks his aces ii ejection stave sails upwards into the air
the fighter crashes into the canyon wall
the attacker cant turn in time
he tries to pull up over it just misses the top of the canyon wall
as the nose of the attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall the attacker is flipped over rolling end over end over the top of the canyon
the parachute on steves ejection seat pops open
rolling end over end the attacker is banged up badly as it finally comes to a stop
not far away steve has a quick hard landing
rolling over steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself
he stands and looks around
spotting the beat up and incapacitated alien attacker steve gets an angry resolved look
he marches over to the fallen alien attacker
he scans it quickly spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar
with all his might steve yanks the door open
for the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens an odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure
the reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it turns woozily towards us steve rears back and slugs him in the face knocking the alien totally
his anger finally subsiding exhaustion taking over steve stands over the craft slowly withdrawing the prized victory dance cigar
he lights it and takes a long angry puff
now thats a close encounter
the hole jasmine had entered is now blocked
she pushes but it wont budge
exhausted she ignites her lighter to get a better look around
as it lights we see that we are inside a maintenance garage
jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead
taking dylan by the hand she moves to the large garage doors but she cant open them
she turns around and see a large maintenance truck a huge land mover shovel attached to the front
with a roar the large door blast apart as the maintenance truck smashes through
once out jasmine hits the brakes
remnants of cars and buildings smoldering
three scattered survivors crawl from the wreckage
a nightmare of destruction
the space craft above slowly leaving
mommy what happened
astonished i dont know badly
we see dozens of trailers packing up their gear some already on the road
miguel talks with one of the drivers then hurries away running
russell wipes down troys forehead hes burning up
alicia brings over a cold compress
you know youre just like your mother
she was stubborn too
i had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine
im sorry dad
beat scared im not goin to die like mom am youre going to be fine
miguel comes rushing in pulls russell aside
i couldnt find anything
everyone is packing up theyre leaving
word is a space ship is heading this way
we should leave too
theres a group heading south they said theres a hospital just a couple hours away
i think we should follow them
russell nods in agreement
a knock on the door
alicia turns to find a handsome young boy philip in the doorway holding a bottle of pills
at least it will help keep his fever down
its really nice of you to help us
i wish i could do more but were moving out
too eager were going with you
i mean were going too
alicia nods smitten
philip smiles charmingly and leaves
back in the passenger section the president sits with general grey and chief of staff nimziki
the technician from the command module is briefing them
they must be targeting our satellites
weve lost all satellite communication tracking and mapping
have norad relay intelligence to our on board computers
the technician nods and exits
defeated the president slumps sullenly
weve moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but weve already sustained heavy losses
the president nods his approval absently
coming out of the bathroom david overhears
i spoke with the joint chief when they arrived at norad
they agree we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike
hit em with everything weve got
above american soil
if we dont strike soon there may not be much of an america left to defend
the technician returns his face is white with fear
whats the latest from norad
its gone sir
theyve taken out thats impossible
my god the vice president and the joint chiefs
president we must launch
a delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities
that stings the president
he considers the option
david is shocked
you cant be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons
david pushes past her
if you fire nukes so will the rest of the world
do you know what that kind of fall out will do
how many innocent people
the general gets up running interference
constance tries to pull david back
stern sir i remind you that you are just a guest here
overlapping david please
this is insanity
youll kill us and them at the same time
therell be nothing left
interrupting sit down and shut up
suddenly moishe is on his feet interrupting
dont tell him to shut up
youd all be dead were it not for my david
you didnt do anything to prevent this
as everyone is about to besiege moishe the president tries to calm him down
sir there wasnt much more we could have done
we were totally unprepared for this
dont give me unprepared
since nineteen fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship the thing you found in new mexico
embarrassed dad please
what was it roswell
you had the space ship the bodies everything locked up in a bunker the what is it area fifty one thats it
area fifty one
you knew and you didnt do nothing
for the first time in along time president whitmore smiles
regardless of what the tabloids have said there were never any space crafts recovered by the government
take my word for it there is no area and no recovered space ship
chief of staff nimziki suddenly clears his throat
uh excuse me mr
president but thats not entirely accurate
the president and general grey turn to nimziki shocked
laying across the roadway
suddenly smash jasmines maintenance truck blasts through
with the massive devastation in the b
jasmine drives the maintenance truck down the highway
in the back the few survivors shes found
in the back four injured passengers lay across the flatbed as a thin older man teddy tends to them
jasmine spots a tall man his closes in tatters running down the highway his arms in the air
the end has come
he speaketh his word and the end hast come
jasmine pulls up along side him
were heading out to el toro
you cannot defy what has come it is the end
the tall man moves off screaming to the heavens
as jasmine watches him drift away she sees
still smoldering from the crash
a woman can be seen inside still alive
jasmine jumps out
give me a hand
teddy joins jasmine as they pry open the door
inside the pilots have been killed but mrs
whitmore lays there in great pain blood across her blouse
lets get her out of here
they erase her from the wreckage laying her on the ground
dylan comes over standing next to his mother
shes bleeding pretty bad
suddenly we the clicking of a rifle cocking
whos got the key
jasmine turns and see a redneck leveling his rifle at her
behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up packed to the gills with stolen looted appliances
yelling to pals looks like ive solved our transportation problem
hey youre welcome to come with us
were leaving here anyway
give me the key
yelling back get em off
two guys rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance truck pulling the injured off the tailback
the end hast come
running up from behind the tall man comes over screaming
the redneck turns his gun on him
this aint your business
as the redneck is distracted jasmine spots the bag of fireworks protruding out of dylans back pocket
you cannot go against the word brother
sure i can
the redneck shoots the tall man
his buddies laugh
redneck contd now give me that key bitch
as he turns back to jasmine boomer starts barking wildly
just as he turns to shoot the dog jasmine lights a key rocket from the fireworks bag
the rocket blasts into the redneck his shirt igniting on fire
the redneck drops the rifle attempting to put out the flames his cronies rush to his aid
jasmine picks up the gun moves in on them
this bitch was born in alabama with a daddy who loved to hunt
cocking the weapon so dont think for one second that i dont know how to use this
she fires the rifle
quickly the rednecks scamper away
dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute steve marches across the desert floor
the alien arm tentacle dangles out of the parachute
exhausted steve stops to wipe his brow
he hears something turns around
several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are headed en mass towards him
smiling steve signals them
the trailers pull up on either side surrounding him
miguel leans out of his trailer
sarcastic need a lift
when i flew overhead i saw some kind of base not far
confused miguel checks his map
its not on the map
trust me its there
flying over the desert air force one sails over an immense valley area below hangars a few buildings a small air strip not much
base area nevada air force one lands
wheels touch down skid
the large hangar doors open and air force one is rolled inside
the president and his entourage are met by a contingent of base personnel led by field operative lt
he escorts them to a side hallway
mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the president and his entourage wait in the center of the hall
with a loud hydraulic hum the entire hallway begins to sink down an enormous elevator
why the hell wasnt i told about this place
two words mr
general grey shoots nimziki a pissed off look
when the elevator stops a door slides open
stepping out of the elevator they walk into a large state of the art sterile clean research facility
it is amazingly well staffed and organized
i dont understand
where did all this come from
how did this get funded
you didnt think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat did you
the president shoots him a look
they are greeted by a group of scientists in whit coats led by dr
president id like to introduce you to dr
hes been heading up our research here for the last fifteen years
okun is an odd hyper energetic man whos spent too much time in isolation
president a real pleasure
they dont let us out much you you
well i guess youd like to see the big tamale
they walk up a ramp at the end of the room
large heavily enforced doors slide open
the group steps inside and nearly gasps at
just like the one that chased steve
the entourage stares in horror and wonder
we can see the patch work repairs theyve made on the ship over the years
shes a beaut aint she
moishe leans close to david and constance
smug never any space ships recovered by the government huh
weve had this for forty years and you dont know anything about them
hell no we know tons about them
the nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days
the president slowly walks around the ship as okun talks
david mouth agape just stares at it
okun contd see we cant duplicate their type of power so weve never been able to experiment
but since these guys started showing up all the gizmos inside turned on
the last twenty four hours have been really exciting
exploding people are dying out there
i dont think exciting is the word id choose to describe it
the room goes silent letting the president blow off steam
calming what can you tell us about the enemy were facing
not all too dissimilar to us
breathes oxygen comparable tolerances to heat cold
probably why theyre interested in our planet
suddenly excited hey you wanna see them
the lights slowly turn on illuminated the vault
okun leads the group to a sealed partition
this is vault or as some of us have come to call it the freak show
okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing
three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks
the murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view
what we do see is not pretty
when we found them they were wearing bio mechanical suits
once we got them off we were able to learn a great deal about their anatomy eyes ears bipolar digestive system
no vocal cords though
were assuming they communicate with each other through other means
david cannot contain his fascination
he steps forward
what kind of other means
hand signals body language
some kind of extra sensory perception
can they be killed
these three died in the crash
their bodies are as frail as our own
you just have to get past their technology which is im sorry to say far more advanced
the president turns to david
you unlocked a part of that technology
you cracked their code
all i did was stumble onto their signal
i dont know how helpful i can be
show them what youve discovered
weve got to find a way to beat them
four armed guards watch the gate
an armada of trucks and trailers heads right for them
they move into position to block their entrance as a blue pick up skids to a halt before them
steve stands up from the back of the pick up
colonel i cant open the gates without clearance
you want to see my clearance
impatiently steve grabs the guard by the collar pulling him over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the bundled parachute in the flatbed
steve rips the fabric aside revealing
still unconscious the alien stirs
the guard jumps back shitting in his pants
quickly he signals for the other to open the gate
the armada quickly drives past
suddenly light pours in as a door is open
we see the faces of okun david and three technicians all peering at us with inquisitive expressions
see the gizmos flashing
sure enough tons of gizmos with lights flashing
high tech meets organic organisms
this alien ship looks familiar to our own technology and completely different at the same time
okun contd weve been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap
some stuff we figured out right away
david climbs in fascinated
he touches everything
okun points to everything as he describes it
okun contd this thing were pretty sure is the life support for the cabin this do hickey over here is connected with the engines this crap
we have no idea what that stuff is for
david is transfixed by it
he stares at the small screens with flashing light patterns on them
okun contd but this over here is clearly what they use to navigate and guide the craft
but david still stares at the small screens
someone grab my laptop for me
one of the technicians rushes off as okun leans close
find something interesting
the technician hands david his retrieved laptop which he quickly flips open and turns on
these patterns here theyre repeating sequentially just like
david turns his laptop around for okun to see
the pattern on davids laptop flashes identically as the alien screen
david contd their countdown signal
their using this frequency for computer communications
its how they co ordinate their ships
you know youre really starting to make us look bad
the two men exchange a smile
another techy pops his head inside
out of breath they got one
they got one alive
the bundled alien lays on a stretcher thats wheeled quickly into the hall
okun and his staff surround it
trailing behind them is steve russell and miguel
how long has it been unconscious
excuse me doctor
get him into containment stat
my boy is very sick he needs immediate attention
okun ignores russell hitting the elevator switch on the wall the room begins its hydraulic hum
hes dying out
i want him sprayed down with saline
russell slams his fist against the switch the room stops
he grabs a doctor nearby gets in his face
my boys is slipping into a diabetic coma
if you dont do something about it right now he will die
miguel is surprised and proud of russell as he holds doctor isaacs meaning business
ohaver miller come with me
to russell take us to him
headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls to a stop
jasmine climbs down out of the truck her face ashen
she walks past a sign reading el toro marine corps air station
tears begin to roll from her eyes
we follow her gaze to see
the entire facility is smoldering the last remnants of the fire burning itself to extinction
jasmine is devastated
general grey and nimziki are in a heated argument
you were the head of the national intelligence agency
you knew all about this
when were you planning on informing the rest of us
it had been deemed classified
christ why didnt you say anything about this when they first arrived
you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots
just then the president enters along with constance and some other advisors
he examines a paper map of the united states tacked to the wall each major city circled in black
atlanta chicago and philadelphia destroyed
composing himself and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami ft
worth and memphis
the president and his team take seats at the large conference table
general grey contd weve learned that nato and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out
we were next
they knew exactly where and how to hit us
grey sneaks an accusatory glare at nimziki
and our forces
were down to approximately fifteen percent sir
beat if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on were looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty
were being exterminated
the room is quiet
constance runs her fingers through her hair
the door to the room opens and lt
mitchell enters with steve
president this is lt
colonel steven hill
the president quickly gets to his feet anxiously shaking steves hand
thank you sir
where is the prisoner now
we have him in isolation
the doctors are very hopeful he will survive
id like to see him
the general is concerned but the president is determined
they head for the door
to general grey general im anxious to get back to el toro
didnt anyone tell you
el toro was destroyed in the attack
steve is shattered he had no idea
the injured are gathered around a small camp fire
jasmine walks up dumping a box full of charred can goods
these should last us a while
as margaret tries to move she winces in pain
jasmine rushes to her aid
the color from her face drained margaret looks like shes taking a turn for the worse
jasmine adjusts the bandages as margaret turns and see dylan curled up next to boomer too adorable
slowly he starts to wake up
hes my angel
was his father stationed here
he wasnt his father
i was kinda hoping hed want the job though
jasmine becomes sad remembering
margaret changes the subject
so what do yo do for a living
im a dancer
its good money
re dylan side hes worth it
the bandages changed jasmine sits down next to margaret
and when the dancings over
what about your future
funny it used to scare me when i thought about the future
looking around guess it doesnt really matter anymore
dylan comes walking over
dylan come here
i want you to meet the first lady
surprised i thought you didnt recognize me
didnt want to say anything
i voted for the other guy
okun and two medical assistants examine the alien creature
his arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining table
for the first time we get a good look at the head of this creature long tentacled type cords interlocked covering the face
the doctors attach clamps to each of the cords
the doctors exchange nervous glances nod to each other
at the same moment all they pull on the clamps unraveling the interlocked cords
as the cords unravel we see that this is in fact a bio mechanical suit as we reveal
beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien his skin translucent his body fluids capillaries muscle tissue aliens skin
do we have life support monitors recording
if we fuck up itll all be on tape
can we get some ventilation in here
i cant take this smell
theyve conquered space travel but not b
as okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly grabs his forehead
you all right
its just that stink gives me a headache
instantly everyones attention is riveted to the arm of the alien as it moves beneath the sheet
unseen by the others the alien creatures another sharp pain hits okun who screams stumbling backwards grabbing his head
the others turn in surprise
suddenly springs up the restraining straps snapping
before med can react one of the aliens tentacles smashes her across the face
she is sent sprawling backwards
standing before her
in a wink of an eye he attacks leaping on her
together they tumble back into a formaldehyde tank
hoses are ripped from their sides and steam pours out
we get quick glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them
mitchell leads the presidential party down the hall
they turn and enter the medical lab
the group slows as they enter the room
they see the containment room through the glass is covered with white steam
nothing can be seen
its eerily quiet
cautiously they approach
suddenly okun is slammed against the glass partition the creatures tentacles wrapped around him
pressed firmly to the glass his eyes are shut his expression pained but when he speaks the voice is angry
open the door
get him out of there
suspicious general grey stops him
to okun can you hear me
they follow the tentacles with their eyes up to the ceiling of the containment tank
suddenly the alien leaps down startling them landing before them behind the glass
we see hes holding okun against the glass speaking through him
this is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre creature
everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by it at the same time
through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac
a transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area
steve runs up to it and climbs inside
steve quickly starts it engines preparing to take off
a soldier rushes over to the cockpit
yelling what the hell are you doing
get out of there
im just going to borrow it
the soldier pulls out his pistol taking aim
no youre not sir
you really want to shoot me
steve stares the soldier down
reluctantly he lowers his gun
im gonna catch the hell for this
steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then takes off
quickly the bird rises up and darts off into the night
the president has moved closer to the glass and is talking with the alien
the alien uses okun like a ventriloquists dummy
why did you people come here
where do your people come from
no answer where is your home
and before here
can we negotiate a truce
is there room for co existance
no answer can there be peace between us
what do you want us to do
the alien moves closer to the glass staring at the president
suddenly the president clutches his head in pain
we kill you
the pain becomes more severe and the president scream out
there is general panic as people rush to the presidents side
to mitchell is that glass bullet proof
the general draws his pistol
mitchell and the other military officers follow his lead
simultaneously they all begin to the glass shatters into a billion pieces
the alien is cut to ribbons falling backwards
the president collapses
so does okun
a staffer rushes over to okun checks his pulse
general grey moves to the president who slowly recovers
president are you okay
woozily the president sits up a strange look in his eye
he wanted me to understand
he communicated with me
turning to grey theyre like locusts
they travel from planet to planet their whole civilization
after theyve consumed every natural resource they move on
and were next
the president stands with a new resolve
he stares at the dead alien on the floor
cold prepare a nuclear strike
the research staff are working near the recovered alien attacker
constance comes rushing in
she looks around for david
through the glass of one of the offices she sees him
holding a bottle of jack daniels david fishes through a small refrigerator as constance enters
just my luck no ice
i take it youve heard
a toast to the end of the world
david toasts her with the bottle takes a swig
he didnt come to this decision lightly
david nods he doesnt want to argue
he smiles cynically
you still believe in him
hes a good man
you left me for him
i wanted a career
didnt you ever want to be part of something special
david stares daggers at her
was part of something special
constance realizes he means their marriage
shes hurt him and can see it
she turns and leaves
a black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night
as we pass some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is in fact a b as we widen we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of eight
these mighty winged giants fly together in attack formation
a tracking screen comes to life eight blips flashing
weve got the awac on line
signals coming in low
the presidents group takes their position behind the technicians
the eight b stealth bombers break formation each heading off to their different target destinations
on a large map we see the eight target destinations and the planes heading for them
who will we reach first
intercept eta six minutes and counting down
oh my god houston
the major cities have been deserted
civilian casualties should be at a minimum sir
one map screen enlarges tracking the bomber on route to houston
looters take all they can carry through the broken glass store front
a large heavily armored tank rolls up front
nervous military technicians work equipment as their tank commander pulls down a periscope
through the periscopes cross hairs we see downtown houston the city destroyer space ships settling in above it
silhouetted against the shimmering waters on the bay they stealth bomber can be seen as it approaches houston
the flight crew works their computers similar readouts are seen at command center
the multi function display mfd flashing before each crew member
we have laser targeting locked
target is locked sir
do you wish to deploy
everyone turns to the president who does not answer
president do you wish to deploy
still there is no answer
the bay doors open and a large tactical nuclear cruise missile drops down flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its radar and laser tracking
suddenly it shoots off
the bomber banks away
we see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target
on the big map we see one flashing target line tracking the missile as it approaches houston
to himself may our children forgive us
the tank commander readjusts the periscope
we follow the cruise missile as it guides itself on a direct collision course with the space craft
the targeting map shows how close the missile is nearly on top of the target
everyone in the room holds their breath
the nuke speeds closer
it hits the protective shield and with the b stealth bomber in the foreground the city behind it vanishes in a flash of light blinding us
we can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map tracking it an expanding ring around houston
excited its a hit
the others are still waiting
the monitor shows the night vision picture of the growing mushroom cloud rising above the city
the mushroom cloud engulfs the horizon
rocked by the massive explosion the shock wave rocks the armored tank but doesnt destroy it
the men inside are knocked around hard from the explosion
we got the bastards
general grey shoots nimziki a look
the president holds up a hand silencing the room
can they see it
did it destroy the target
as the cloud begins to dissipate we see the space craft is still there completely unharmed
on the monitors as well we can see the target remain
the air is let out of the room everyone deflated
call them back
the other bombers might have more luck
we shouldnt just give up
i said call them back
as the technicians call the bombers away the president sinks into a depression
his last hope of survival gone
jasmine keeps margaret company as the rest sleep around the last flames of their campfire
from the worried expression on jasmines face we can tell that margaret has gotten worse her wounds bleeding badly
a wind kicks up the sound of an engine approaching
jasmine squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a bright light engulfs her
bright lights in the sky growing nearer
slowly the others begin to wake up frightened as the lights intensify
the others slowly begin to retreat but jasmine stands staring defiantly
a smile creeps across her face as she sees that the lights belong to
the transport helicopter touches down and steve leaps out racing towards jasmine
overwhelmed jasmine jumps into his arms
you know how i like to make a big entrance
the double doors burst open as the president carrying his young daughter marches through
doctor isaacs comes over to them
how is she
im sorry mr
if only we could have gotten to her sooner
the president puts his daughter down as he sees
margaret lays in bed doctors and nurses surrounding her
patricia rushes over
shes bleeding internally
theres nothing else we can do
stunned the president watches as patricia hugs her mother
mommy we were worried
we didnt know where you were
im right here baby
recovering the president nods for the doctors to leave the room
as they begin to march out he makes his way over to his wife and daughter
honey why dont you wait outside so mommy can get some rest
patricia kisses her mother says goodbye and leaves
out of sight margaret winces fading away
the president grabs her hand for support
she squeezes tightly
through tears im scared tom
the doctors said youre going to be just fine
margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well
the look between them says more than any words
the president exits the room overcome with emotion
constance the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort him
he holds them off with a gesture
he looks up and sees jasmine steve and dylan down the hall
he pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them
im so sorry
i just wanted to thank you
youre a very brave woman
across the hall patricia sits in a chair waiting
whitmore walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child
is mommy sleeping now
topples over with a bang
a foot steps in and starts kicking trash all over
david is drunkenly knocking everything over making a gigantic mess
moishe comes up behind restraining him
what the hell are you doing
im making a mess
this i can see
weve gotta burn the rain forest pops
dump toxic waste pollute the air rip up the ozone
maybe if we screw this planet up enough they wont want it anymore
david youre drunk
david slips falls on his ass hard
moishe helps him back up on his feet
i think you better sleep this off
go back inside before you catch a cold
slowly david looks up towards moishe an idea
pops youre a genius
whatd i say
sobered david jumps kisses his father and bolts inside
a large crowd has been gathered here at the lab
general grey and nimziki walk up to constance
all right connie were here
whats this all about
i really have no idea
he just said to bring everyone down here
steve shows dylan the alien space craft
does that thing fly in outer space
steve loos up at the craft admiringly
it certainly does
when the president enters a technician rushes over and knocks on the hatch door on the alien attacker
the door swings open and david climbs down
grabbing a coke can from the recycle trash bin david places the empty can on top of the alien attacker
david turns and faces the gathering
could anyone please step back away from the craft
they do and david nods to a technician inside the craft
the technician disappears inside closing the door behind him
a loud hum emits from the craft
david has to yell over it
mitchell would you mind drawing your pistol
from where youre standing do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft
mitchell shrugs affirmatively
david gestures for him to try
taking aim mitchell shoots
the bullet ricochets off the attackers protective shield
several people in the crowd dock afraid of being hit by the errant bullet
sorry bout that
you see its protected by the crafts shields
we cant penetrate their defenses
we know that already
whats your point
david walks over to his laptop now connected directly to the craft by cables and starts typing furiously
my point is if we cant beat their defenses then we must get around them
david stops typing and stares at his wrist watch silently counting down
mitchell would you please try to shoot it again
reluctantly mitchell obliges
this time the can is blown off the craft
everyone in the room is shocked
the technician re opens the crafts door and the loud hum disappears
how did you do that
i gave it a cold
the president is fascinated he steps closer
moishe beams proudly at his smart son
constance is amazed
david contd more accurately i gave it a virus
a computer virus
david turns his laptop around for the president to see
are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields
just as they used our satellites against us we can use their own signal against them
david walks over to a diagram hes made showing the relationship between the mother ship the space crafts and the smaller alien attackers
david contd if we plant the virus directly into the mother ship it would then filter down into all the corresponding ships below
and just how do we infect the mother ship with a virus
david gestures to the alien attacker behind him
well have to fly their craft out of our atmosphere and dock with the mother ship
intrigued steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker sizing it up
david points to a satellite photo of the underbelly of the mother ship
david contd we can enter here upload the virus and set off an explosion that could disable it
this would disorient the smaller ship below and buy you some time to take them out
constance reacts realizing davids participation in the plan
this is ridiculous
how long would their shields be down
once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes
you want us to co ordinate a massive world wide counter strike with a window of only a few minutes
with their shields down it might be possible
please youre not buying into any of this nonsense are you
we dont have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign
gesturing to the alien ship not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate
i wouldnt say that sir
everyone turns to steve who steps through the crowd
ive seen them in action
ive watched their maneuvers
with your permission sir id like the opportunity to try
that things a wreck
it crash landed back in the fifties
we dont even know if its capable of flying
david turns to the technicians
remove the clamps
technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of the craft
with a loud clank the clamps are pulled away
for a moment the hulking craft teeters unevenly but quickly stabilizes floating above them
any other questions
everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder
lets do it
constance general grey and the president are walking down the hall
nimziki rushes to catch up
i understand that youre upset over the death of your wife but thats no excuse for making another fatal mistake
the president whirls grabs nimziki and slams him against the wall
holding him tight the president gets in his face
the only mistake i made was appointing a sniveling little weasel like you chief of staff
constance is about to intervene when general grey stops her
president contd but this is a mistake i am thankful to say i do not have to live with
nimziki youre fired
the president releases him and turns to general grey
president contd organize every plane you can find and get some goddamned pilots to fly them
he storms off leaving everyone stunned
he cant do that
amazed he just did
four british air pilots are gathered around a table going over a map
one pilot reginald is in charge
weve been told that there may be additional re enforcement in hiding near the golan straights
suddenly the flap to the tent opens
all the pilots draw their pistols frightening the arab pilot who stands in the doorway
the arab pilot speaks quickly in arabic
what the hells he saying
explaining seems theyre getting a signal
one morse code
as they step out of the tent we see more than a hundred fighters planes from different nations parked around them
theyve all gone into hiding out here in the desert divided into many smaller camps
reginald and thomson follow their arab cohort walking through the many other campsites
thomson gets some stares from the i still get believe this
the iraqis dont appear altogether too pleased with this arrangement
how do you think the israelis feel
sure enough a campsite of israeli pilots sits very near by
dozens of arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the morse code comes through
thomson quickly kneels down taking notes
its from the americans
they want to organize a counter offensive
its about bloody time
what do they plan to do
several russian pilots are gathered around a radio their dozen mig fighters standing behind them
subtitled they claims to be able to bring down their shields
when do they want to attack
at the base of a large volcano in fuji several japanese attack helicopters stand near their pilots gathered around a radio
subtitled the attack begins in thirteen hours
a large world map has been constructed
several sites are marked with stickers reading combat ready
another sticker is put onto mr
striding in the president surveys the war room
general grey rushes over to meet him
howre we doing
better than we thought
general grey leads the president over to the wall map
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world
most of europe the middle east and asia are battle ready
and our troops here
weve been collecting planes from all over but
but what general
we dont have enough people to get them in the air
then find them
troy is sleeping peacefully in his bed
russell sits at the kitchen table as miguel enters
how he doing
just fell asleep
hes gonna be just fine
join me in a little celebration
russell holds up his bottle of jack daniels
clearly hes been drinking again
miguel is crestfallen
pissed he turns and storms out
dont be mad
drunkenly russell chases after him
making his way through the campers russell sees a group of refugees around some military officers who addresses them
through megaphone were planning to launch a counter offensive
russell wanders over towards them
officer contd with our depleted manpower we must ask that anyone with any flight experience come forward
military training is preferable but anyone who can fly a plane could be useful
russell pushes his way through the crowd
slurred i can fly i mean im a pilot
the officer just stares at the bottle of jack daniels still in his hand
russell gets into his face desperate
you dont understand
ive gotta be part of this
this is important to me
they ruined my life
why dont you go somewhere and sleep it off
the officers move on taking a few volunteers with them
russell watches them go dejected
angrily he throws the bottle of jack smashing it
a large missile slides back into a launcher that has been attached to the top of the alien attacker
some workers paint over the patch work repairs
below mitchell briefs steve and david
weve hid the launcher in the ships manifold
mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by
mitchell contd this will be attached to the ships main console
its just like an amraam launch pad on the stealths
use it the same way
only the nuke wont detonate on impact
youll have another thirty seconds to get as far away as you can
ill see how theyre doing with the radio transmitter
checking his watch oh shit were late
well meet you there
steve dashes off as david moves toward the attacker
constance has been eavesdropping
she walks to david
isnt that cutting it a little too close
well be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off
david leans under the attacker where a technician is attaching another device
its the strongest shf transmitter we could get
itll tell us when youve uploaded the virus
then cross your fingers the shields go down
david turns and walks away constance following
i dont understand why you cant just show someone how to plant the virus somebody trained for this kind of mission
if anything goes wrong ill have to think quickly adjust the signal who knows
david stops picking up a small trash can labelled recycle
smiling you know how im always trying to save the planet
this is my chance
david rushes off
constance watches him leave
to herself now he gets ambitious
jasmine is kneeling as dylan tries to zip up the back of her dress
its too tight
i had to borrow it
i guess thats good enough
jasmine stands turns to dylan
how do i look
she looks great
but dylan only gives her the so so hand gesture
youre a lot of help
the door behind her flies open and steve marches in
you know me
i know you like to make a big entrance
steve moves next to jasmine takes her hand
before we do this i want you to know im sorry
sorry for what
serious i should have done this a long long time ago
do you have the ring
as we reverse angle we see that we are in a military chapel a large crucifix on the wall
a chaplain stands by the altar
steve pulls out the famous dolphin ring
just then the doors open and david and constance enter taking seats on opposing sides of the aisle
then lets get this show on the road
steve and jasmine take their places at the altar
jasmine is radiant
dylan rushes up and joins them
as the ceremony begins david and constance share a pregnant glance
slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as steve and jasmine exchange their vows
slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes that have been gathered
pilots flights crews and refugees prepare for the battle
walking out the president scans the motley collection of planes old new high tech low tech
beggars cant be choosers sir
nodding in agreement the president walks among the rank and file
slowly they turn their attention to the president
in less than one hour planes from here and all around the world will launch the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind
the word has new meaning for all of us now
we are reminded not of our petty differences but of our common interests
constance david and moishe join the group listening
even david is moved
president contd perhaps its fate that today july the fourth we will once again fight for our freedom
not from tyranny persecution or oppression
but from annihilation
were fighting for our right to live to exit
from this day on the fourth day of july will no longer be remembered as an american holiday but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not
go quietly into the night
we will not vanish without a fight
we will live on
we will survive
the crowd erupts into applause and cheers
the president turns and walks over to an officer holding a bundle of clothes
general grey confronts the president as he begins to disrobe
president just what do you think youre doing
im a pilot will
this is where i belong
general grey wants to argue but cant
constance and david embrace as steve turns to dylan
when im back well light those fireworks
jasmine hugs them both as moishe walks over to david
david take these
david looks down at the barf bags in moishes hand
i want you should know im very proud of you son
that means more to david than moishe could have known
constance hugs david as steve suddenly freaks out
we cant go yet
i gotta find some cigars
steve is about to bolt when moishe grabs him retrieving two cigars from his coat pocket
my last two
with my blessings
youre a lifesaver
steve grabs them and climbs inside
david smiles awkwardly then follows steve
the hatch shuts and david takes a seat next to steve who hands him one of the cigars
hang on to this
for our victory dance
but not til we hear the fat lady sing
reluctantly david takes it
as he does steve notices the barf bag on davids lap
off steves look
i have a confession to make
im not real big on flying
constance and jasmine join the others behind the observation glass outside the room as the attacker prepares for lift off
part of the ceiling suddenly peels away revealing an enormous shaft leading topside
strapping in and securing their equipment steve grabs hold of the throttle
let rock and roll
steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings the alien attacker smashes backward into the rear of the lab
moishe winces as the others react fearfully
embarrassed steve adjusts the throttle
like a stick shift diagram of a car a small hand written post it card is pasted onto the dash
steve reaches over and turns it upside down righting the problem
lets try that again
this time he pushes the throttle forward and the attacker jerks ahead
shooting up into the ceiling shaft above the attacker zooms out of the underground laboratory
with a whoosh the alien attacker zooms out of the underground shaft and soars into the sky
once high enough it goes into a wild barrel roll
just as it comes out of the roll
what the hell are you doing
just getting a feel for her
the attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds
the president watches the attacker flying away
his canopy locks down as he adjusts his helmet
grey you read me
filtered roger eagle one our primary target has shifted course
general grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien ships over the united states
filtered wheres it headed
i think our secret is out
theyre headed right for us
filtered eta thirty six minutes
the president gets a determined look in his eye
he fires up his engine
following his lead engines ignite canopies lock down and planes taxi to position
the captured alien attacker soars higher and higher
slowly getting sick david holds onto his barf bag
you still with me
david nods sheepishly
steves eyes go wide with wonder as the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere
to himself ive waited a long time for this
the ship begins to shake rattling harshly as it climbs
through the window we see the blue sky evaporate
slowly a field of stars take its place
this is the moment steve had wished for all his life
hes not disappointed
david however is not so thrilled
heading further into space zooming overhead
through the windshield we see a huge object floating in the distance the moon behind it
head straight for it
but steve gets distracted something wrong with the controls
its not responding
david looks over at his laptop connected to the ships on board computers
th signal is adjusting
thrilled i was counting on that
theyre bringing us in
the presidents plane leads thirty fighters in attack formation
we have visual
the fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range headed straight for us
filtered do not engage until weve confirmed the package has been delivered
constance is standing by lt
mitchell behind the military cadre coordinating the battle
what if that thing gets here before we can plant the virus
the entire compound is buried deep within the mountain
it should give us some protection
but what about all the people outside
mitchell shoots her a worried look
quickly they both dash outside
steve and davids attacker flies towards the gigantic mother ship
hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the mother ship through the many triangular portals
steve and davids attackers drawn into one of them
caught in a stream of attackers they flow through the portal shaft leading into this planet sized space craft
they pass by enormous windows revealing the hundreds of aliens working within the mother ship
we spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity stretching out beyond visibility
enormous towers are scattered throughout
neither can believe their eyes
staring out the front window they sees
below them thousands of aliens can be seen as they are marched into dozens of enormous troop containers docked at the edges of the parade grounds
must be thousands of them
what are they doing
looks like theyre preparing the invasion
they pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this huge cavernous sphere closing in on the many landings
hundreds of attackers are docked at each one
in the center of the landing are large bay windows inside is a kind of control tower
we can see several alien workers through the glass
steve and davids attacker is heading straight towards them
this wont work
theyll see before we can do anything
lifting up another hand written card labeled window david pushes the button underneath
these things are fully equipped
reclining bucket seats power windows
a blast shield lowers covering the window
slowly steve and davids attacker lowers onto large docking clamps which lock on holding it in place
david starts typing frantically
mitchell turns from one of the consoles to general grey
hes uploading the virus
into mic eagle one
the presidential attack squadron zeroing in on target
filtered the package is being delivered
stand by to engage
alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag
philip the boy who brought the penicillin earlier rushes over
let me get that
he grabs the bag for her
miguel helps troy down from the trailer
as they rush away miguel turns to philip
constance jasmine and mitchell are helping to usher the refugees into the compound
hurry weve got to get everyone inside
constance looks up and sees off in the distance
piercing the horizon coming over the top of a distant mountain
headed this way
david finishes typing
the screen on his laptop flashes the virus is in
all we can do now is pray
filtered delivery complete
the fighter jets gun it and overtake the smaller planes in front of them
below the presidents plane the weapons bay door opens and a long range amraam missile drops down computes its target and mitchell and general grey move over to a monitor
showing visual from the presents plane
they see the missile moving towards target
keep your fingers crossed
the pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target
come on baby
just as it gets to the shield perimeter the missile explodes
the shields are still up
they watch the missile blow up harmlessly
deflated general grey grabs his mic
it didnt work
sir get your people out of there
the president is not ready to give up
below his plane another missile drops down and darts off
this one goes past the point of the previous explosion
it moves in closer and closer
suddenly it hits the side of the ship
a huge explosion rips off a part of the side of this immense ship
we see the explosion on the monitor
everyone in the room you did it
a direct hit
the pilots are thrilled
were going in
squadron leaders take point
the fighters break off into six group of five
one by one each fighter drops a missile
we follow dozens of missiles on their way to the space craft
the attacker bay doors open and dozens of alien attackers shoot out
guided missiles explodes as they hit the city destroyer damaging the outer hull
the attackers go after the american fighters
the six groups split wide
an aerial dog fight ensues
miguel searches for russell as the refugees run for the hangar
miguel gets swept up in the tide
as the last of them enter the hangar two alien attackers arrive behind them strafing the ground
the rows of trailers homes explode one after another
constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway
packed into the hallway together they are panicked at the sound of the nearby explosions
as the last one is safely inside constance turns back and sees
the attackers fire and the front half of the hangar explodes
constance is knocked back against the wall
she activates the elevator and the room begins to sink
as the hallway submerges the entire hangar comes crashing down behind them
over monitors the general observes the aerial battle
this room too rocks from the explosions
the monitors flicker
steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where
get us out of here
i cant shake her free
though the attacker guns its engine the clamps below hold david moves over to the computer to see if he can help
suddenly the large window slowly begins to drop down
whatre you doing
its not me
theyre overriding the system
the blast shield continues to peel away
david and steve drop down below the dash hiding from view
as the view becomes unobstructed we see
several aliens looking across at us from the large bay window of the landings control tower
david leans from his hiding position and sees several other alien attackers are moving in on them
they are surrounded check and mate
like images from england during the blitzkrieg the refugees are huddled on the floor the lights flickering and the muted sounds of distant explosions
miguel moves through the refugees searching for russell
a yarmulke is unfolded
as it is lifted we realize moishe is putting it on
he holds the hands with the people around him and begins to pray
nimziki moves next to moishe
moishe takes his hand
im not jewish
as another bomb rocks the room alicia moves closer to philip
this could be our last night on earth
i dont want to die a virgin
if we do well both die virgins
but at last well be together
alicia smiles a nice guy at last
the city destroyer space ship is settling just above the compound as the american fighters circle it chased by the attackers
below the schism begins to open
in all the commotion no one notices as miguel sneaks inside
were running out of missiles sir
were just not causing enough damage
filtered theyre getting ready to fire the big gun
youre going to have to find a vulnerable spot fast
ive got an idea
keep em off my tail
taking the advice the president dives
hes met by two flanking fighters eagles as they cruise the underbelly of the city destroyer
sure enough the schism is opening preparing to fire the wall of destruction
lets take em out before they take us out
the president locks the schism hatchway into the center of his hud heads up display
just as he fires eagle is blown out of the sky
it rocks the president sending his missile off target
off balance the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and explodes rocking the entire ship
im out of missiles
im on it
but before he can target his fighter explodes
the lights continue to flicker
jasmine grabs onto dylan and patricia holding them tight
on the monitor we see the schism and bright lights as several fighters fly past
were out of time
get out of there
get as far away as you can
pissed the president refuses to give up
doesnt anyone have any damned missiles left
sorry im late mr
the president spins and sees darting out of the clouds
russell zooms past the president and alien attackers barely missing their fire
filtered who is that
what are you doing
into mic its okay sir
we see he has a large missiles propped up in the seat behind him
a light on it flashes armed
filtered just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds
hearing his voice miguel is shocked
he moves closer towards the monitors
the remaining fighters lay down cover fire for russells old bi wing
russell heads directly towards the schism
everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and closer to the closing bay doors
miguel is aghast
filtered do me one favor
who is that guy
miguel races over to the microphone attempts to grab it
filtered tell my children i love them very much
russell nears the schism a hail of alien firepower erupting around him
russell smiles at b being called dad
ive got to kid
you were always better at taking care of them than i was anyways
russell turns off his radio as he banks upward towards the open schism
the climb is steep and the bi wing nearly stalls out
suddenly the bright lights vanish and the beam begins to form
russells bi wing just makes it inside the open schism and disappears from view
the president and remaining fighters bank away clearing
suddenly a gigantic explosion rips through the center of the space craft
its causing a chain reaction of explosion
teetering the entire space ship turns away out of control
the room erupts in cheers
everyone that is except miguel
not far away from area the enormous craft is burning from the center outwards
suddenly it drops and collides with the mountain range exploding on impact
intercepting the celebration general grey moves over to a radio technician
lets get on the wire
tell every squadron around the world how to shoot those fuckers down
sitting below the dash steve takes out the cigars hands one to david
i guess theres nothing left to do
lets nuke em
david realizes theyre both about to die
he stares at the cigar
re cigar funny i always thought things like these would kill me
they share a quick sober laugh
nice meeting you
you as well
steve lights his cigar then lights davids
popping up from behind the dash cigars in their mouths steve and david start waving good bye like idiots
the aliens in the tower dont know how to react
the attackers move in for the kill
think they know whats coming
he reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the launch code
still waving not a chance in hell
suddenly the missile erupts from behind the manifold and blasts into the control tower shattering the glass window
the missile smashes through the glass
the atmosphere impeached the aliens quickly succumb to the elements chocking and dying
the missile blasts by wrecking equipment until it lodges into the back wall of the landing tower
a small counter on the missile begins to count down
rocked from the explosions the docking clamps releases and the ships jostles free
steve grabs the controls
i dont hear no fat lady
steve throttles it
the craft jolts away
steve and davids attacker blast away the other alien attackers follow in hot pursuit
the attackers fire
steve swerves avoiding the blasts as they race for the exit
grasping for breath a dying alien looks up at the wedged in nuclear missile
the counter reads
we get the feeling the alien knows whats coming
steve and davids attacker just reaches the doorway as the center of the landing explodes behind them
the enormous impact rocks some of the lagging attackers off track
steve darts his attacker out from underneath the mother ships belly
a group of attackers follow
just as the last of them exit the docking bay a huge fireball erupts behind them ripping through the mother ship
zooming towards us steve guides his ship away
the alien attackers in hot pursuit
behind them we see the entire the immense explosion grows outwards coming right at us
the attackers are gobbled up as the explosion widens
quickly the explosion gains ground on steve and david
like a loose board caught in the surf steve and davids ship rides the edge of the explosion getting knocked end over end
tumbling ass over tea kettle david and steve are rocked in their seats
steve battles to regain control of the ship
the mammoth fireball reaches the outer edge of its zenith
steve and davids ship is spit out tumbling down towards the fighters are returning home
crowd race out of the ruins of the smoldering compound to greet them cheering their arrival
the president is climbing out as general grey rushes to his aid
behind him jasmine leads dylan and patricia who breaks free and rushes to her father
the president sweeps her up in his arms as jasmine approaches
to general grey any word from steve
behind her constance rushes over the same thing on her mind
before he can answer they hear a roar above
they all become silent as they turn and look to the skies
the fireball comet is rapidly shooting down towards us
suddenly bursting out of the flames steve and davids ship just over the heads of the cheering crowds steve and davids ship zooms overhead disappearing out of sight
several army jeeps race across the arid desert floor
as they whip past we see they are headed towards a gigantic black plume of smoke in the distance
the jeeps skid to a halt
jasmine and constance are the first to leap off the jeeps
steve and david walk towards us cigars in their mouths
jasmine races over to him
you scared the hell out of me
yeah but what an entrance
constance comes running up to david hugs him tightly
are you all right
did it work
you bet it did
she hugs him
behind them dylan patricia the president and general grey come walking over
the president and general grey approach
were getting reports from all over
their ships are going down
as they begin to celebrate they look up to the sky
the debris from the mother ship explosion enters the atmosphere like thousands of shooting stars
its an incredible sight
the group stares happily at the show in the sky
steve takes dylan by the hand
didnt i promise you fireworks
everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights
