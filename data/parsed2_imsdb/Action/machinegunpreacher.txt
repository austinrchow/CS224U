written by jason keller based on the life of sam childers this is true
the night is stillborn
without sound or movement and nothing is in definition
all we see are degrees of blackness in this unlit world
the vague impressions of an african village in the void
a ragged line of tukuls straw huts
a bicycle propped against a mud wall
a soccer ball in the dirt
and we find a sudanese family asleep on reed mats
a mother father and their two boys
the younger boy well come to know as william
his older brother christopher curled next to him
and slowly the blackness begins to shift
an otherworldly light seeping in from someplace far off
shadows contorting in a ghostly orange flicker
the silhouettes of men coming into this village carrying flaming torches
the family still sound asleep oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside and suddenly the family bolts awake moving to their feet as the door to their tukul slams
open three soldiers from the lords resistance army lra coming in carrying ak s shouting in arabic get up
the father stepping forward holding up his hands dont shoot
and hes gunned down in cold blood
the soldiers grab the mother and boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul but william breaks free scrambles deeper into the room the soldier going after him
william darting behind a stack of storage boxes knocking them to the ground frantically burrowing into the corner trying to get away but its useless the soldier grabs his feet and begins to pull him out william kicking wildly digging his nails into the dirt and as hes dragged out of the corner he reaches out
inadvertently grabs a faded photograph which has fallen on the ground
the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire families yanked out of their burning tukuls by lra rebels the adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death the
women and children forced into the center of the village huddled together and weeping and now we see william hauled out his captor shouting to another soldier pointing to williams mother and shes pulled from the group and forced onto her knees
and william is brought in front of her his captor saying something in arabic as he hands him a club kill her
william shaking his head no tossing the club in the dirt and crackkk
william is hit with the butt of a rifle goes down blood streaming down his face as hes pulled back up to his feet crying shaking with fear
and then he sees his mother staring up at him
and despite the hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and son
something calm and reassuring in the way shes looking at him now
her eyes full of love
for her child in this terrible moment
and before we see how this ends we and we see sam childers coming down a corridor toward us dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard
hes stocky years old with a bikers handlebar moustache
on the surface he appears good looking
even handsome if the light is right
but his face is tricky
behind the quick smile around his dark eyes in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence
we see a clerk handing sam a prison issue tub full of his personal affects
he takes out his clothes digs out a leather wallet a watch some silver rings and a lighter
he looks up to the clerk and flashes a malicious smile yall go fuck yourself now k
a beat up chevy vega parked at the curb
sams wife lynn s in a thrift store dress leaning against the car waiting
sam dressed in civilian clothes now pushes out a door and she sees him straightens her hair an uneasy smile
the vega pulled of the side of the road and sam fucking lynn in the back
theres nothing tender about what were watching here
sam finishes and lynn slumps into the seat pulls down her dress
gimme a smoke

shit that aint gonna last
the vega pulls up to a beat to shit single wide and sam and lynn get out
we see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads welcome home daddy
and now sams daughter paige bursts out of the trailer and down the steps
followed by sams mother daisy mid s comes out of the trailer
and she jumps into his arms

lynn enters the trailer paige follows

lynn reaches for him but he shoves her back violently
gitcha hands off me
you cant keep goin the way you goin baby
sam straddles the bike and kicks it to life
he peels out kicking up gravel as he blasts past paige and daisy
sam riding down the road
a tough biker bar in johnstown pa
a jukebox in the corner playing lynard skynard
sam coming through the door ad libbed greetings from some of the other bikers here
he makes his way to a back table where a hulking biker in a leather vest named donnie is sitting with two girls
donnie looks up sees sam
there he is
they embrace old friends
figured youd be rollin out round now

better him than the milk man i guess
aint so sure bout that
donnie laughs slaps him on the shoulder
you wanna taste
sam smiles that wicked smile and we go as a biker chick leads sam down this hallway into sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall skynard pounding
through the walls
he rolls up his shirt sleeve as she cooks a spoon of methamphetamine
juices a hypodermic
he finds a vein and she spikes his arm
presses the plunger and his head rolls back on his shoulders
speed slamming into his bloodstream as we ramp up the music
snow piled up on the windowsills and its cold as shit outside
sam passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell
thinner than the last time we saw him skin sallow and drawn tight over his face
he stirs awake sees paige playing by herself on the floor next to him
she sees that hes awake picks up her doll and quietly goes outside without saying a word
sam coming in taking a piss staring at himself in the mirror and we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms
and then we hear a pentecostal communion hymn the old rugged cross coming through
taking us to
a congregation packed into this church for sunday service
we see lynn and paige in the crowd singing along with the congregation
sam and donnie in this car parked in front of broken down clapboard houses
donnie pointing through the windshield
with the green light
bone chill cold
sam and donnie on this porch scarves pulled around their necks hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm
donnie knocking at the door
hey man you there
donnie knocking again and the door cracks an inch
and we see a black man with a shaved head on the other side looking out
fuck are you
its me man cmon
fuckin cold out here
i dont know you
yeah you do man
i saw you the other day
im bobbys friend
who the fuck is bobby
suddenly sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket mossberg gage presses it to the door and door splintering open
concussion like a fucking pipe bomb wood splintering through the room like shrapnel sam and donnie dont fuckin move
junkies hopping off the couch scattering like rats deeper into the house shaved head darting out of the room sam leveling the mossberg in his direction booom
the room flashing like a fucking supernova
shaved head scrambling up these stairs sam coming up after him hunting him mossberg blasting in his direction booom
shaved head sprinting down this hallway sam tracking him in the b
bloodlust in his eyes leveling the mossberg and shotgun slugs ripping through the house like cannon shot shaved head bolting through the smoke crashing through a door into shaved head
bombing in hitting the ground trying to get to his feet but its too late because sam kicks open the door behind him shaved head going onto his back trying to crab crawl away from him but theres nowhere to go sam moving closer shaved head working his way into a corner holding his hands in front of his face terrified shaking donnie coming into the room tell me where the shit is or ill blow yer nigger brains all over this floor
indicating a closet in there
sam kicks him toward the closet hurry the fuck up
shaved head crawling to a small safe in a closet spins the combo opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine
shaved head grabs a stack of hundreds hands it to sam and crackkk
he slams the butt of the mossberg into shaved heads face and he hits the ground on his back sam standing over him shoves the barrel of the shotgun into
his mouth cmon lets go
but sams not moving
just staring down at shaved head
and were watching something here
a terrible intelligence taking over
something bloodless and inhuman coming over sam in this moment
and he chambers a slug into the shotgun
fuck are you doin
and this is it
hes going to blow this guys brains all over the floor
his finger curls around the trigger eyes becoming lethal
and he snaps back looks around sees donnie standing there
we need to get the fuck outta here
music loud as it goes
sam and donnie pumped and celebrating after the robbery
sam in the passenger seat already cooking coke in a bent spoon
see that niggers face when i put it in his mouth
cook that shit up man
i wanna hit when im going a hundred miles an hour in this thing
sam juices a needle and spikes donnies arm
donnie feeling the rush
pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man
both of them wired out of their heads
blasting down this dark country road
and then they see
up the road standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out
look at this sorry fucker
donnies car pulls off the road and the hitchhiker hustles up to it
the hitchhiker climbing into the backseat
hes late s a drifter probably american indian
donnie starts driving
cold enough for ya out there boy
where you goin man
thats up there past muncy right
we can take you far as mcclure
take me to dunshore
sam looking back we aint goin to dunshore boy
said we can drop you at mcclure
suddenly silver flashing a blade out of nowhere pressed into donnies neck from the backseat the drifter pulling him tight against the seat rest pressing it into his throat what
dunshore or ill cut his fuckin throat
get that fuckin blade off him
sam reaches his leg over and stomps on the gas peddle the car lurches forward accelerating sam
but sams not letting up
pressing down on the peddle hard
mph donnie yelling trying to keep the car on the road music blaring like some wild ride to hell and then sam suddenly jumps in the backseat wrestling with the
drifter fighting wild elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now and stick stick stick stick stick stick
he stabs him six times in the gut
the drifter howling in pain
donnies car skidding off the shoulder of the road back door popping open and the drifters body dumped into the dirt
the car peels out accelerates tail lights disappearing into the dark
lynn sound asleep in bed
and she slowly stirs awake hears water running from somewhere in the trailer
lynn moving down the hall
toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door
gently pushing it open to see sam standing at the sink
covered in blood
frantically trying to clean himself up
trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but its useless
and the sense we get is that were staring at a man at the edge of an abyss
set to swallow him whole
and now he realizes lynn is here and he turns to her
holding up his stained hands
a terrible fear in his eyes when he says
days later and we see lynn and paige dressed up sitting in the idling car waiting
he comin or aint he
i dont know
and we find sam in this bedroom all alone wearing a thrift store sportcoat sitting on the edge of the bed
staring at his stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the floor
lynn steps into the doorway
sam turns to her and he looks lost here
like a little boy
i dont got no good shoes lynn
and she comes into the room sits on the bed next to him puts an arm around his shoulder
he dont care what kinda shoes you wearin baby
packed with sunday families listening to pastor krause at the pulpit
behind him we see a baptismal tank filled with water
and now we see sam lynn paige and daisy sitting near the back
sam looks uncomfortable on edge
the point of receiving gods word is life
life upon life
and to accept the blood of jesus is life upon life upon life
praise be to god
he breathes his spirit into darkness and makes something good
he sees our shadow and says let there be light
now proclaim his saving grace
if there are sinners here looking for god raise your hands
a few hands shoot up stand up
receive jesus christ as your light and saviour
three or four people moving to their feet making their way up to the altar
lynn turns to sam their eyes meet
he looks hesitant unsure
she gives him a reserved little smile nods her head slightly as if saying you can do this
and in her look he finds strength gets up slowly makes his way to
and now we see sam on his knees in the baptismal tank
the water almost up to his waist
pastor krause kneeling behind him
receive jesus as your lord and saviour
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
and he leans sam back cradling his head as he submerges him in the water completely
and when sam comes back up the church breaks into rowdy hallelujahs
and we see lynn
tears in her eyes
clapping in the back row
and an organist and singer begin to sing amazing grace taking us to
months later and the snow has thawed
and we see sam with other construction workers finishing their day packing up their tools cleaning up
we notice that his gaunt cheeks have filled out and he looks healthier
and now a contractor comes up to sam hands him a check
thanks for your help sam
you need me to stay on i can
were movin inside next week
i can drywall tile whatever you got
know my way round some electrical too
sorry sam i gotta cut the crew
just aint enough work
sam alone on these steps lost in thought
screen door opens and lynn comes out sits next to him
think so in our bed
i thought that was goin through august
sam shakes his head and theyre quiet
both of them sitting here on these steps
the burden of this life catching up to them in this moment
a woman stares down at her desk with a frown shaking her head
sam sitting in a small chair in front of her
i got somethin in pitt but you gotta have some college for that
im a hard worker and i learn real fast
but you got no education mr
and we see sam standing next to his harley talking to a mechanic
dont deal bikes
probably have a better shot if you take it over to pitt
or maybe down to philly
i gotta sell it today
give you four hundred for it
theres almost two grand on this bike
them pipes right there is custom
you wont see pipes like that on anything round here
like i said dont deal bikes
ill give you four twenty
best i can do
sam on the edge of paiges bed reading her a childrens book
into the street the piper stept smiling first a little smile then three shrill notes the pipe uttered like a great and mighty army muttered
like spoke up made a sound
okay keep goin
turns the page and out of the houses the rats came tumblin black rats brown rats brother rats sister rats and husband rats followed their little rat wives
til they came to the ragin water where they drowned and lost their lives
they got rid all them rats
how come you sold yer harley
cause its what i had to do
off her look
were gonna be ok bug dont you worry
paige curls into him closer and were watching him here
in this moment
holding his daughter
not so sure theyre gonna be ok
close on sam behind the wheel of the car parked staring out the front windshield
reverse to see hes in the parking lot of the bar just watching the entrance
empty except for a handful of regulars
sam coming through the door taking in the place the fucking grime and despair
moving to donnie who is sitting in his same spot
well well well wondered when i was gonna see you again ole buddy
how you doin
heard you was followin the lord now
donnie sizes him up how much is a little bit
turns to the jackie gimme a mash and bud

sam shakes his head
you know that old indian didnt die out there that night
story in the lehigh valley news bout it
somebody picked that poor bastard up after us took him to the emergency room you believe that shit
god was lookin out for us both i suppose
waitress slides a shot and beer in front of donnie
well then heres to him
didnt hear you pull up
got lynns car
she broke down on ya
ahhh shit man
shoulda come to yer ole buddy first
donnie smiling inviting him back into this world
and were watching sam threshold moment here considering
its late and we see lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone
sam has not come home and she is clearly worried
and then we hear a car pulling up outside door opening and closing and sam coming into the trailer
sorry im late
lynn staring at him trying to read this mans face but hes not looking at her
avoiding her gaze
did he use
is he high
and then she sees a pinprick of dried blood on his shirtsleeve
her face contorting almost imperceptibly
her worst fear realized
and she moves to him without saying a word
lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt
slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a needle prick in his arm
and then he pulls out a bill and hands it to her
gave blood over in pitt
lynn searching his eyes and she knows hes telling the truth
thats all i got
and she pulls him close hugging him tight grateful
somethin will come through
and we hold on sam his troubled eyes
completely out of options
and we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family is crushing
flashes of lightening
a storm starting to batter the trailer park
lynn in front of the tv scared watching an emergency weather warning
winds buffeting the trailer
sam coming into the room from the back
two touched down near harrisberg
sam opening the door coming down the steps looking up to the sky and it is fucking black swirling ominous
sam coming back into the trailer fast come on
lynn following him down the hallway wind picking up starting to rock the trailer back and forth
get paige grab a blanket
lynn darting into a bedroom scooping paige out of her bed
sam coming in moving to a metal gun locker in the corner of the room pulling out a shotgun
the wind slamming the trailer now lynn and paige terrified watching as sam moves to the center of the room points the barrel of the shotgun toward the floor and
blows four gaping holes in the floorboards then starts to kick through the wood with his boot yelling over the wind what are you doing
he kicks a hole in the planks turns to lynn and paige paige crawling through the opening
into a shallow trench underneath the trailer
lynn squeezing in behind her
sam staying outside
no room for him
the trailer starting to buck violently in the tempest
thin walls contorting around him
and paige starts to cry terrified sam laying down on the floor next to the opening close enough so she can hear his voice
bug you hear me
and he starts to play a childs word association game with her
something she knows
something theyve played before
im thinkin of a snail
you hear me bug
and we hear her tiny little voice say
good job bug good job
you said whale im thinkin of a pail
you said pail im thinkin of a tail
and so this little game goes between father and daughter
paige listening to his voice
in the midst of this terrible storm
somehow becoming less terrified
a brilliantly clear day and we see neighbors picking up after the storm
sam on a ladder leaning against the trailer nailing down a strip of bent aluminum as a pickup truck pulls up
window rolls down and we see its the contractor from before
tried to ring ya but your phones down
sam climbs down moves to the truck shakes his hand
looks like ya made it through pretty good
damn twister touched down eight places between here and noblesville
chewed up six hundred homes in fulton county alone
got all the work you can handle if youre interested
sam seizing an opportunity here
but im puttin my own crew together
we go on the jobs
you cover any heavy machines i need
til you pay me back on the tools
then well go half
you got a deal
a shot of lynn carefully applying a vinyl application on the side of a new but used truck that reads childers construction company c
on lynns closed eyes smiling what are you doin sam childers
months later and were with lynn and paige their eyes shut as sam leads them both by the hand
i wanna peek
keep em closed
sam finally stops them
open em up
they do and both of their eyes go wide with surprise
where are we
were home little girl
reverse to see a modest two bedroom house at the end of this driveway
their new home
go check it out
paige sprints for the house as lynn hugs sam softly starts to cry into his shoulder
the first night in their new home and we see a few unpacked moving boxes here
paige sound asleep on a small bed upstairs
lynn in the kitchen organizing the cabinets
and sam enters carrying a box sets it on the counter
you get whats in the trunk
lynn looking up seeing how dirty sam is from the move
lord youre filthy sam childers
lynn tossing him a kitchen towel
sam smiling mischievously
who you callin filthy woman
you dirtier than i am
no i aint
yes you are
i seen it
cmon girl gimme a little shake
sam winking at her and playfully snapping a kitchen towel at her butt
lynn giggling and scooting away
i aint doin that no more
just a little somethin for yer old man cmon
and he snaps her butt again but she grabs the towel and snaps him back
you gimme a little shake
she snaps him again and he feels the sting
she snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other against the counter
and he kisses her
playful at first and then it becomes more passionate
and just as it starts to lead somewhere we go
two years later and were watching a congregation finish a sunday hymn
sam lynn daisy and paige in the crowd listening to pastor krause
today we are blessed with a special guest
its my pleasure to welcome pastor relling from the kilangire christian ministry in uganda africa
polite applause as a tall white south african man named paul relling steps up to the pulpit and in a deep afrikaner accent he thank you pastor krause and thank
you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the lord
im here today to talk to you about your christian brothers and sisters families just like yours a half a world away that desperately need your help
and we see sam in this sea of faces listening
parishioners slowly filing out of the church after service
lynn paige and a few other women chatting by the entrance
and now lynn looks over her shoulder and sees sam talking with paul relling off to the side just the two of them in a corner deep in discussion
the first thing we notice is the relative opulence of this place
deep shag new color tv matching sectional sofa
the rural idea of making it
sam lynn daisy and paige at the dinner table eating
sam in his own world oblivious to the minor conversation until paige go get some more beans
paige heads to the kitchen
what are you thinking
thinking about africa
paige comes back in carrying the beans
they have tigers over there
they eat people
what about africa
just thinkin bout that fella today
he talked funny
just from a different place than us baby thats all
was thinkin maybe id go over there
help em out fer a few weeks
to see the tigers
he was talkin about puttin box beam roofs on school houses over there
what about finishing that job in boswell
ill only be gone a few weeks
be back before you know it
two weeks later and were in the rural countryside outside kampala uganda
sam on the roof of a bombed out school building with other white volunteers working
sam looks below to see a dozen black men dressed in the ragged fatigues of the sudanese peoples liberation army spla
each is carrying an ak and standing guard at various points around this compound
the lead soldier is a man named deng
angle three others well come to know as nineteen marco and a
its later and we see deng sitting underneath an awning by himself working on his machine gun
you ugandan army or what
sudanese peoples liberation army
we are freedom fighters
names sam childers
i am deng
there is a certain reserved nobility in this man in the way he carries himself and speaks
an unwavering strength and self reliance born from a lifetime of war and struggle
re dengs weapon givin ya problems
lemme have a look
deng hesitates then hands his ak over to sam who pops the mag out and studies it
yer mag is tight
the loads are feedin right to the barrel face
thats yer problem
sam pulls out a knife and begins to work on the base plate of the mag as he explains
you need this plate to ramp into the chamber
that way yer brass wont get stuck
there ya go should be better
and sam hands the weapon back
are you military
no not me
i aint the military type
aint so good with bein told what to do
when did you learn about weapons
sam considers the question for a moment
then simply says
long time ago
fifteen or twenty volunteers lounging on cots in this dorm playing cards talking smoking
and we find sam off from the group on his bunk reading the bible
sam turns to find a british man in his late s named dan standing next to him thick cockney accent smoking a cigarette
some of us are going into kampala tomorrow night
find ourselves a little fun this weekend
i was thinkin bout goin up north
theres a civil war going on up there
its mid day blazing hot and we see sam approaching deng
hey deng you wanna coke
sam offers him a can and he takes it
got a question for ya
i wanna go into sudan this weekend
need someone to show me around
the others are going into kampala
that aint my speed no more
i wanna see some country
deng looks at him surprised by the request
you want to see
a dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every direction
and we see a bright yellow bus speeding toward us in the distance kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air
and as it gets closer we see or men piled onto the roof hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road
sam and deng crammed into this crowded bus
they always drive this fast
traveling is the most dangerous time in sudan
if the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad
an awkward silence as deng stares out the window
sam wanting to connect here but deng is reticent
you got kids deng
i have no children
where you from
a little village called aweil
many hours from here
thats where your family is
and deng simply says
my family was killed by lra
unyama is about two hours from here
we will stop there for lunch
deng turns and looks out the window again silent quietly watching the land blur past
and sam says nothing more intuitively feeling this mans need to be alone in the moment
a great lost giant
a dense sea of people
displaced refugees living on top of each other
life is lived out in the open here
women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water
smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air
semi clothed children some with even younger children on their hips running everywhere
the poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming
and we see sam and deng walking through the camp
the muslim north has tried to kill the christian south for years
two million have lost their lives
deng sweeping his hand indicating the mass of refugees
these people have been driven from their villages however these camps are not much better
a row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area
each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick
battle weary aid workers move among them doing what they can caring for the ones who are most desperately ill
cholera and malaria are everywhere there is little food and not enough un soldiers to protect everyone
even here they worry the lra will attack at night
and another spla soldier comes up to deng are you from kitgum
someone wants to speak with you
deng turns to sam
im sorry sam
ill be five minutes
course do what you gotta do
deng leaves and now sam is completely alone taking in this mire of humanity all around him
and suddenly theres commotion
two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a woman on a stretcher
one of the aid workers looking around a white woman mid s her name is agnete closson regional director of doctors without borders
she sees sam across the tent
can you help please
sam moving to her we need to transfer her to the bed
get her shoulders
sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet
one two three
and they swing the woman over to a cot
but as they do the sheer piece of blood stained muslin that was covering her face falls away
and we see that she has been mutilated
her lips cut off of her face
and now a doctor sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her
sam and agnete pushed back away from the action
sam still shocked by what hes seen
what happened to her face
the rebels cut off her lips because she argued
these are konys orders
agnete suddenly suspicious takes an appraising look of sam
who are you with
im with deng over there
what organization are you with
working with a christian group down south
just up here takin a look around seein a bit of the country
this isnt a tourist destination this is a war zone
you stay in this area youll be killed
thank you for your help
and she walks off
establishing a bustling trading center on the border of uganda and sudan
noisy and overpopulated a maze of concrete and tin buildings hundreds of people on the streets riding bicycles finishing their business before nightfall
a stale room with two cots bare institutional
deng on the edge of his cot pulling off his boots taking off his jacket getting comfortable
and we see sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking the empty street below
some say joseph kony is a wizard
he calls himself a christian
he pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette
but i say he is satan who devours his own people
kony is the leader of the lra
he is the one we have been fighting for years
but there is very little we can do
our weapons are old and our boots are full of holes
we have been forgotten by the rest of the world
and now deng turns to sam
why are you here
what are you looking for in this place
aint lookin for nuthin
deng staring at him skeptical
and then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends
sam has no response
and deng lights his cigarette
and suddenly we hear voices
through the open window
sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing
only empty streets
and then one by one
out of the darkness like apparitions
we see children coming up the street carrying bedrolls
some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk
laughing as children do
at first just a dozen or so
and then more
deng steps onto the balcony next to sam
they are night commuters
they come from deep in the bush
their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes
because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps
and we continue to watch this great migration of children
now streaming into this town
a few of them finding a dark corner just below us
unrolling their reed mats
huddling up against each other for the long night
these are the lucky one so far
the ones the rebels have not found
the invisible children
sam watching them for another beat then suddenly turning moving back into the room
where are you going
sam coming down these steps
sam exiting the hotel moving to a group of children huddled on the sidewalk
the children looking up surprised to see a white man here
the children getting to their feet
and sam moves to another cluster of children up the block as deng catches up to him
what are you doing
they aint sleepin out here
tell em theyre comin inside
to children on the ground yall get up
and sam starts to move up the block further wanting to gather up more children but deng stops him
sam there are too many
and he looks up the street and we see more children here than we thought
hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets
you cant help them all
sam knows hes right
a moment here as he looks to the children hes gathered staring up at him
i can help these here
and a dozen children are ushered into this small room
sam pushing their cots against a wall so theres more space
deng speaking to the children settle down
you can sleep here till morning
and they begin to settle onto the floor
and now we notice a particular boy in this group
maybe years old
wearing bright green shorts
and we watch as he and his sister move to a corner of the room and unroll their mats
and eventually sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the dark
sam on his cot listening to these little children breathing
their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get comfortable
sams closed eyes
just before dawn
deng standing over him shaking him awake
the lra attacked a village last night
sam looking up to him
you said you wanted to see
sam sits up looks around the hotel room and we see that its empty
the children vanished
only a small handmade toy on the ground which has been left behind
sam deng and a few other spla soldiers jammed into the flatbed of this truck carrying heavy weapons bouncing fast over this open dirt road
featureless savanna fading into sporadic mud huts
the outskirts of a village in the distance
and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air
and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass children walking along the side of the road
night commuters returning to their village
some of them huddled together weeping
and we notice sam notices the little boy in the green shorts walking hand in hand with his sister their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to
the pickup arrives and sam deng and the other soldiers hop out
and this is what they see complete devastation
or bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls
some children already here on their knees weeping next to the corpses of their parents
if you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death
sam silent aghast just staring at the horror all around him
and now we see green shorts and his sister arriving at the village
moving to their familys tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside
naked and burned alive
and the sister falls onto her mothers corpse and begins to wail as green shorts stands there frozen staring down at his dead parents and suddenly movement
from inside the tukul
a small dog
a family pet
darting into the open
running across the dirt
green shorts going after it yelling his name
sam watching the boy chasing after his dog rounding a corner out of sight
for a moment
just the boys voice calling after his dog
a muffled burst in the distance sam deng and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion
sam deng and the others arriving at the source of the explosion
and we see green shorts laying on the side of the road
cut in half by a land mine
his dead eyes wide open with surprise
and sam drops to his knees
lifting whats left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth
and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him
something happening here
a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy
in the dirt
in the middle of this savage world
and as sam puts it his life changed forever in this moment
and we see him looking up to the heavens
tears streaming down his face
saying something we cant hear but its a promise
to save the children of sudan
a bright fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes
and we find sam coming down this concourse carrying his duffle bag his face expressionless
he reaches a revolving door but stops
doesnt pass through
sees lynn paige and his mother waiting for him on the other side
their happy expectant faces
but they dont see him yet
and he just stays here
watching them through the glass
and as sam puts it at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again
in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in yei
and finally he forces a smile pushes through the revolving door and we watch from this side of the glass as paige leaps into his arms
lynn and daisy moving to him too embracing him welcoming him home
paige brushing her teeth at the sink
sam watching her from the doorway
you see any tigers over there
naw didnt see no tigers
but they do have them over in africa
so i hear but not where i was
sure am glad youre home
me too bug
im thinkin of a plane
its late you better get to bed
and he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom plops her onto the bed
im thinkin of a plane
sam giving in playing their little game as she gets under the covers
you said plane im thinkin of a train
you said train im thinkin of a brain
you said brain im thinkin of a
ok you got me
you coulda said drain or mane
like horses hair
sam bending over kissing her forehead
sweet dreams bug
sam coming out of paiges bedroom pulling the door closed finding lynn waiting for him
you comin to bed
in a bit you ok
just a long flight
she senses more but knows this man well enough not to push
and so she simply turns away
just sam on this porch all alone been here for some time eyes far off images in his mind he cant seem to shake
and he steps into the yard
walking along the side of the house
trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin
and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in his tracks
something we dont see yet
and slowly he reaches down and picks up
a little doll
one of paiges toys
soiled and faded and left in the dirt
and we watch him holding this forgotten doll
and what we see on his face aint pretty
his world collapsing out from under him
trying to keep rein on his emotions
a battle hes losing
lynn stirs awake looks next to her and realizes sam never made it to bed the night before
lynn coming out the front door in her nightgown sees a light on in a utility shed in the back
lynn slowly pushing open the door to find sam on the floor hunched over a pad of paiges art paper
paper wads strewn all around him
been here all night
baby whatcha doin
he looks up
you been to bed yet
he gathers up a couple of the papers moves to her
i had a vision last night lynn
crazy as it sounds god spoke to me
he hands her a sheet of paper cu to see its a crude drawing of building
im gonna build a church
right across the street
not like faith united or calvary fellowship
place that aint gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever
place for sinners just like me who wanna hear the word of god
lynn studying him trying to judge how serious he is here
and sam looking back at her his eyes like we havent seen them before
how we gonna pay for a church sam
we got money in the bank
business is good
besides i own a construction company
im gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build
she smiles shaking her head catching his enthusiasm
he hands her the other paper cu to see its a another drawing
thats the orphanage i wanna build
eight months later and were looking at a simple cinder block church which is under construction
a scattering of pickup trucks parked at the site and a flurry of activity
workmen pouring cement laying sheetrock etc
and sam in the middle of this crew putting the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised
children at play laughing screaming swinging on swing sets and digging in a sand pit
and we see sam off to the side leaning against a new black harley watching paige playing in the group
sam turns to see a biker late s leather vest standing with his year old daughter
the biker extends his hand they shake
hey bro ben hobbes knew each other long time ago
yeah ben how you doin

she runs off

but hey good seein ya man
a torn up house in a shitty part of town windows spray painted black
sam pulls up to the curb on his harley gets off opens one of the bikes hard cases and pulls out the same sawed off gage weve seen before
chambers a slug as he moves toward the house
dark junkie squalor
two or three people slumped on a ratty couch strung out watching a flickering tv and then sam coming into the house sawed off leveled junkies scrambling for cover yelling
sam moving into sam comes around the corner and finds himself face to face with a crackhead pointing a
magnum eyes amped up and wild shaking a stand off and sam sees a body on a bare mattress in the b
bone thin and pale spent hypodermic hanging out of his arm its donnie
im here for that boy right there
you gonna get in the way a that
a tense beat not sure how this is gonna go and then the crackhead shakes his head no donnie in a bed covers pulled up to his neck and hes
shaking bad retching in a bucket deep in the throes of a detox
sam and lynn here doing what they can toweling off his forehead trying to keep him warm as donnie pulls the sheets tighter gritting his teeth shaking his head
i cant do this
look at me
god dont make trash boy
now he aint givin up on you so dont give up on him you hear me
and somehow donnie finds strength in his words and in sams hand touching his head and he nods
a bright sunday morning and were staring at the cinder block church which is almost completely finished
the sound of a garage band coming from inside playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual hymn
and a handful of people dressed for service moving up the cement stairs into
and we see donnie dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown shirt sober for the moment greeting people as they come through the front door
standing next to him is daisy handing out programs
welcome to shekinah fellowship church
still under construction
exposed beams and bare insulation on the walls
theres a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar organ and the garage band playing the rocked out hymn
a handful of people here sitting in pews
farmers in clean overalls factory workers bikers still dressed in their riding leathers listening to the garage band and chatting
and now we see lynn and paige standing near the back
lynn nervous checking her watch
sam on his knees sleeves rolled up to his elbows wrenching a leaking pipe
lynn and daisy walk in
its five til and he still aint here
sam hearing this moving to his feet toweling off his hands
you call him
try him again
lynn exits and daisy steps forward shuts the door behind her
just she and sam here alone now
you like this dress sam
you aint never seen this one
i bought it a long time ago
been keepin it for a special occasion
i never told you this but when i was pregnant with you now this was way back probably when yer daddy and i was still in grand rapids a pastor
prophesied over me
pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me i was gonna have a preacher for a son
smiling at the thought yer daddy and i were so proud
i remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night
just laid there and talked bout you bout what was comin
i just built a church
i aint no preacher
yes you are
you were born to it
just took you a little ways to get here
sam entering at the back of the chapel taking a moment to appreciate what hes looking at or people here in the church that he built
a dream realized
and he walks down the center aisle shaking hands with a few people climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone
to the band thank you tommy
you boys is soundin pretty good up here
sam turning to the crowd clearing his throat clearly nervous
i wanna thank yall for comin out for the first day of worship here at shekinah fellowship church
lynn and paige sitting with daisy who is beaming
the guest preacher we had booked today aint shown up
so i thought id say a word or two
an awkward beat
lotta yous been wonderin what made me wanna build this here church
seein as i aint the best seed in the bunch i can understand that
a beat considering what to say
and he begins
buncha years ago i was runnin from some bad fellas in the woods over there by cleary
those old boys was comin after me hard and i reached in my bag lookin for my old shotgun but it was gone
my momma had took it out when i wasnt lookin and put this bible in there instead
sam holding up a worn bible and we start to notice something here
a transformation happening in this man as he speaks to these people
his nervousness falling away and a natural charisma taking over
well i figured i was done for so i sat down under an old tree with this useless book and i waited
and we see the congregation hanging on his every word identifying with this man standing before them
one of their own
and then the strangest thing happened
them boys ran right on past me
didnt even see me sittin there
now the way i figure it things would have turned out pretty different if i had pulled out that shotgun instead of this here bible
and thats probably the first time i can remember god savin my butt
and my momma
some laughter and applause
figure least i could do was build em both this church
and the congregation responds with a hallelujah
sam holding paige her face buried in his shoulder crying
be back soon as i can
youre gonna miss my play
have momma videotape it for me k
now i gotta git
lynn pulling paige off kissing sam on the lips
call us when you can
sam turning to donnie and we see hes back to the hulking man he once was
you watch out for em while im gone ya hear
thats done buddy
sam winks slaps donnie on the shoulder as we and we see a line of spla soldiers including nineteen marco and a
sitting in the dirt pulling on new boots smiling spit polishing them to a high shine
sam and deng watching the soldiers
you came all this way to bring us new boots
deng driving fast down this bumpy road
sam in the passenger seat
nineteen marco and a
in the flatbed of this truck ever watchful
right here stop the truck
sam already out of the truck moving into the bush
but hes not listening moving through the scrub to a small clearing
it is not safe here
sam kneeling down picking up a handful of red dirt letting it trickle through his fingers
this is it
establishing a busy trading town on the border of sudan and uganda
and we see a small crowd of villagers standing underneath a tarp watching a small color tv the only tv for miles on the screen we see a black man
in a military uniform giving a fiery speech this is john garang one of the good guys the founder of the a tight cramped office filled with villagers
two or three men here at desks handling the administration of life in the bush renewing travel papers registering newborn children hearing complaints from local farmers etc
and we see sam and deng at one of these desks a topographical map splayed out in front of them
this is not a good idea
i think its a heckuva good idea
it would be better further south
closer to kampala
if i wanted to be closer to kampala id be closer to kampala
i wanna be right here
sam pointing to the map
the administrator turning to deng he should not be this far north
what are you sayin
the villages in this area are very remote mr
there is nothing there
then it seems to me them people need help the most
to deng arabic he will be killed
talk to me
the administrator turning to him laying it out simply this is in the war zone mr
the lra will kill you here
i dont think you understand me so lemme make it real clear to ya
i didnt pick this land god did
what were looking at is the modest beginning of the angels of east africa childrens orphanage
a cluster of tukuls and or rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt sam first let trickle between his fingers
and we see life already finding its place within these bamboo walls
acholi workers laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel
and we find sam with two or three small children who are crying for no apparent reason
hes on his knees trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here
and now we see deng in the b
approaching with a powerfully built ugandan woman in her late s
this is betty
she is from the village of kotido
a few miles from here
good to meet you betty
betty no reaction
just the incessant crying of the children in the b
she is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage
im lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order
make sure things is taken care of when im away
she can do this
shes gonna have to take care of the children too make sure theyre fed fix em when theyre sick
can she do that
betty hears this turns to the crying children and softly says quiet now
and instantly their crying stops
tell her shes hired
we see betty and another camp woman rose moving through this room carrying lanterns helping the children get ready for sleep you two share a blanket and tomorrow we will
shhhh its time to shut your eyes
and we see sam here too doing what he can tucking in a few of the kids starting to make a connection with these children
and we see a handful of spla soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound standing guard
sam and deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate
you know whats funny
in english your name means darn it
what is this darn it
it means shucks
you know like you stub your toe and you go ahhhhh deng
this is not funny
in my language in arabic names are very important
they tell you everything about a man
your name proceeds you wherever you go
you are sam
this is how you are known
in my language this means something
sam feeling terrible realizes hes offended him
im sorry buddy
it was just a joke
quiet awkward just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long beat
what does sam mean in arabic
and deng smiles brightly
sam realizing hes been played
and deng starts to laugh
a deep guttural infectious laugh
sam joining him and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends
and gradually their laughter subsides and its quiet again
can i ask you a question
you believe in god
deng considering this for a beat and then
i was raised to believe there was a god in heaven
but it is impossible to live here to see what i have seen and not turn your back on him
maybe youll invite him in again one day
i dont think so
the heavy stillness of an african summer night
only the sound of kestrel hawks screeching far off in the distance hunting prey
and the drone of african cicadas buzzing all around us
the children sprawled on their mats sound asleep
deng and a few other soldiers sleeping on bedrolls
sam sitting on his cot
he rips open an airmail package and pulls out a small videocassette slides it in a videocamera hits play on the small video screen we see paige dressed in a
pilgrim costume performing in a thanksgiving day play
her voice coming through the tiny speakers as she recites her lines
sam smiling at what hes watching
a few of the spla soldiers sitting next to their weapons in the dark smoking tossing beads into a carved wooden trough playing the ancient game of mancala that was
your third house is open
soldier reacting to his mistake as the spla soldiers oblivious to the advance
sam watching paiges play when suddenly an explosion
machinegun fire popping o
sam hitting the ground scrambling for cover sam rushing out of his tukul sees the front gate obliterated from a grenade blast bamboo fence burning the death song of ak
s howling in the darkness sam hustling across the compound joining deng and another soldier behind a makeshift shed how many are there
there and there
sam peering around the corner sees muzzle flashes in the blackness maybe or rebels moving through the bush like specters flanking the compound where are your men
i dont know
sam looking around realizing the rest of the spla soldiers are scattered throughout the compound firing randomly into the dark
theyre gonna pick us off like this
sam split second decision here and he starts to sprint across the compound to terrified screaming
the children cowering in the corners betty and rose here trying to calm them down stay down
we are protected
sam bursting through the door betty
get em to the church right now
betty nodding as sam rushes out sam bombing into this shed quickly opening a metal chest and pulling out an ak and mags of ammo sam scrambling across the compound
with the ak moves next to deng and pops a mag into the machinegun get yer men back to the church
thats our best shot
ill cover you
and sam starts to open up the ak laying down a curtain of suppression fire as deng shouts to his men to the church
and they start to fall back to the center of the orphanage betty and the other camp woman herding the terrified children into this building the only brick structure on
the compound and then deng marco a
and the other spla soldiers coming in moving to the window holes and returning fire sam sweeping the ak back and forth trying to hold off the rebels as long
as he can and then more of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast
sam becoming overwhelmed in the fight firing as he retreats back into the compound sam storming into the chapel turning to betty meaning the children put em in the middle
betty and the other woman do exactly that they move the children into a tight group in the center of the room
in the center
all of you
rebels moving through the compound firing into tukuls and setting everything on fire
sam deng and the other soldiers returning fire four on the right
there are too many
just keep firin
sam starting to open up with his ak krakakakakakak
spent shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of the room
rebels swarming around the chapel but reaching a point where they cant advance any further and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an rpg into a
launcher he pops up levels the launcher at the chapel and krakakakakak
hes cut down before hes able to fire sam sweeping his ak across the compound the other soldiers burning through magazines and reloading rebels firing back betty and the children
crowded on the floor in the middle of this storm of gunfire and we stay in this little chapel watching this last stand until we and we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground
betty and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings and torched tukuls looking for anything salvageable
deng nineteen and some of the spla soldiers loading the corpses of rebels into the back of the truck
and now we find sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound
the only structure that remains
everything else his entire dream in ashes
and we see lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle past shelves loaded with packaged produce
and we hear buzzing
lynn digging the cell phone out of her purse hello
and we find sam sitting at a table along this dusty crowded street
his duffelbag on the ground next to him
lynn immediately senses something wrong
and we see that hes not
this man is empty alone defeated
they burned it to the ground
all of it
aint nuthin left
she hears the anguish in his voice
where are you
im comin home
and were watching her here clocking the resignation in his voice
a moment of quiet for both of them
lynn sensing the dimensions of his heartache
all she wants to do is bring him home hold him close ease his pain
but she knows thats not what he needs
not this man
can you hear me
i can hear you
and we see her move around a corner into an empty aisle away from the other shoppers
and she says
then quit feelin sorry for yerself
them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse
how many of them you see givin up
and we watch sam listening finding strength in what this woman says next
god gave you purpose sam childers
now stop yer cryin get off yer butt and build it again
giving us a sense that many months are passing
sam and a crew of village men hauling the charred remnants of tukuls and burned building out of the compound on their backs
the remainder of the bamboo fence that once surrounded the orphanage being torn down
nineteen marco a
and a few other spla soldiers cutting the bush away from the edge of the compound with machetes
cut it all down
so they got nowhere to hide
sam deng and the crew of village men digging post holes around the perimeter of the orphanage
all the way around
the men sinking metal beams into the holes with cement then surrounding the compound with heavy gage chainlink fence
new dorms being built from brick
a mess hall
and finally sam laying the last brick on the chapel in the center of the compound
a simple administrative office with a short wave radio and sat phone
sam here sitting at a desk when we hear a knock at the door
come on in
the door opens and we see deng
preacher you need to come see this
sam following deng to the center of the compound where we see or camp women including betty and rose dressed in colorful robes and headdresses
maybe children here quietly sitting in the dirt watching the women
nineteen marco a
and the rest of the spla soldiers here too watching from the side
whats goin on
the acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland
each year they blessed the soil before a planting
and now the women begin to move in unison
singing an ancient acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in accompaniment
they are saying that fire brings strength and ashes abundance
the women continuing their dance
moving in a tight circle and stomping their feet as they sing
when the land burns the next year the soil produces more
and now betty peels away from the group and approaches sam talking to him directly in arabic
the children are your fields
she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops
sam looking to the little orphans watching this from the side
and now betty bends down and scoops up a bit of ashen earth and runs her finger across his forehead blessing him
and this ground will grow them tall
and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it
off sam standing here with his ashen face staring at these people in front of him his african family
days later and we see sam here with nineteen and a few other spla soldiers eating lunch trying to learn their language
and its humorous to these guys as sam tries to pronounce some words in arabic
and suddenly we hear yelling coming from outside
sam coming out fast sees soldiers pulling open the front gate as three pickup trucks speed into the compound spla military trucks skidding to a stop
sam rushing over as soldiers help two young boys out of one of the trucks
both are around years old injured and crying
and then a third child is lifted out in a makeshift stretcher this is alice years old her broken body limp and bleeding profusely mumbling something to herself in arabic
over and over again doors banging open
controlled chaos as the children are hauled into this clinic betty taking care of alice the worst off hooking her up to an iv as sam moves to her bedside
the little girl still mumbling quietly what is she saying
she is asking what she did wrong
sam taking alices hand in his
very slowly her beautiful eyes open and she sees him
and says something in arabic
she is asking if you are the preacher
tell her shes gonna be ok
betty translates and alice smiles faintly
and now one of the other camp women comes over and sam steps back so they can work
sam coming out of the infirmary and finding deng here with a few of the spla soldiers who brought the children
where did they find em
their village was hit out adjumani
off sam hearing this we
and we see sam and deng sitting outside the infirmary exhausted been here all night waiting
and now the door opens and betty comes out
she looks down at them and simply shakes her head
and we know alice is dead
and it looks like a grenade has gone off inside sam
and suddenly he grabs an ak and gets up seething walks off
sam walking fast through the compound
where are you going
sam please wait
i aint waitin
you wanna see what waitin gets ya
take a look in that buildin over there
sam reaching the suv and starting to gear up
fade up the plaintive wail of an acholi war song
and then a chorus of voices rising up
taking us to
bombing down this rutted red dirt road
the engine at full tilt
sam deng nineteen marco and a
jammed into this truck riding in dead silence
ak s bouncing between their knees
only the sound of the war song playing as we watch these men
a grave stillness on their faces
thinking of what men do just before their own death
we see two lra vehicles approaching in the distance
a lead jeep and a pickup truck behind it
four child soldiers squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying ak s
we recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the opening scene william
with two adult rebels in this jeep as they drive down this road past bombed out vehicles
and in the distance we see the smoldering wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road
the thick smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain
blocking out vision of the road ahead
and the jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup truck
and were lost in the swirling haze for a moment before coming out the other side
and this is what we see sam standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a rpg the adult rebels see him just as whoooosh
an rpg streaks right at us and detonates kaboooom
and the jeep flips onto its side the pickup grinds to a stop
the driver slamming it into reverse accelerating back into the curtain of smoke trying to get the fuck out of there when bbrrraaaappp
caliber machinegun strafe across the front hood and we see a
cal opening it up bbraaaaaappp
blasting the engine compartment of the truck trying to disable it the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke out of control going off the road into a ditch
william and the other boys bailing out of the flatbed two adult rebels piling out of the cab scrambling for cover behind the truck
sam deng a
and the others hustling through the smoke and finding cover
from sams vantage point he sees rebels hiding behind the disabled truck for cover shooting back a withering firefight the big
cal roaring offscreen but the truck is protecting the rebels no clear shot william and the other child soldiers here with two adult rebels crouched behind the truck for cover
the adult rebels returning fire but the children arent moving scared shitless
william peers around the truck and sees sam fifty yards away turns to the boys next to him
its the white preacher
the other boys reacting this means something to them
and now one of the adult rebel turns to the children
and he pops up and returns fire but the boys dont move
marco running through the smoke toward sam
he hits the ground and starts to screw an rpg into his launcher
he wants to hit the transport truck but sam shakes his head waves him off
there are children behind the truck
marco hears this ditches the rpg and picks up his ak
marco laying down suppression fire as sam sprints across the road advancing on the transport truck firing his ak from the hip bullets zinging past him he dives behind a
berm and finds himself next to deng
neither man says a word as they jam fresh mags into their aks gunfire erupting all around them
the adult rebels continue fighting alternately popping up from behind the truck and returning fire
the adult rebel realizing that william and the other boys still arent fighting fight you cowards
but william and the other boys dont move and the adult rebel keeps shooting until his mag clicks empty
he looks around and sees an rpg launcher on the ground picks it up arms it sam and deng behind the berm
sam peers over just as gunfire misses him by inches
he drops back
why dont you just go home
this is not your war
deng shakes his head well then i aint leavin neither
sam chambers a round pivots around the berm as the adult rebel stands up with the rpg fires
at the same instant william shoots him in the head he jerks wooooosh
the missile launching at a bad angle as rpg streaking directly at him hitting the ground short for a long beat
and then slowly the white begins to fade
and we see sam flat on his back
eyes blinking open
staring up at blue sky
and then a shadow coming over him
someone stepping into his pov
its william hands held open in surrender staring curiously at this strange white man laying in the dirt
and now deng and marco appear next to sam and help him to his feet
and we see the battle is over
the remaining child soldiers slowly emerging from behind the lra truck
laying down their weapons and walking toward sam
staring at this white man in front of them
william reaches into his pocket and
deng and marco react lifting their aks dont move
but the boy only pulls out a faded photograph
the one he grabbed just before his capture
a picture of him and his older brother
standing next to each other smiling
have you seen my brother
children laying on the floor on reed mats getting ready for sleep
and we find william in mid conversation with a young boy named anthony
where are you from
were you with the rebels
william pulls out his photograph
did you know my brother
he was called christopher
anthony studying the photograph
he has a funny left eye
it looks the other way sometimes
do you remember him
william folding up the photograph getting up moving to another little boy a few feet away
kneeling next to him
and so he continues
i am william
were you with the rebels
a soldier cuts off the generator and the compound goes black
and we see sam on his cot when the light goes out
he leans over and torches a small kerosene lamp next to him
the children on their mats in the dark now
a few of the younger ones whimpering starting to cry
the darkness becoming too much
reminding them of past horrors
and then we hear a faint voice in this dark room
an ancient african lullaby
and then other little voices joining in
singing this song they all know
a song their mothers once sang to them
sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound
somehow finding comfort in it too
blowing out the lamp and laying here in the dark
listening to the children sing
a slow dissolve
life springing up in the camp
a routine seen here
betty rose and the other camp women arriving at the orphanage
cooking fires being lit
soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee warming themselves after a long night
and sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag
discovering william curled up next to his door sleeping on a mat in the dirt
been there all night
william stirring awake seeing sam above him and scrambling to his feet
william no response
just staring up at him
aint you gonna say nuthin
and sam walks across the compound followed by william a few paces behind
and he reaches deng betty nineteen and a few of the other volunteers waiting by the truck
looks like youve got yourself a bodyguard
guess i do
sam tosses his bag into the back says goodbye to everyone
take care of things while im gone ok
i will preacher
they shake hands and sam gets into the truck
and we see william already here sitting in the backseat
you cant come with me buddy
to william arabic get out of there
but william isnt moving
and finally deng reaches in and grabs him
tries to pull him out but he fights back
yelling as deng drags him out of the truck
sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound
and he sees william still struggling in dengs arms
and finally he breaks free and sprints for the truck as it drives off
fast as he can
chasing sam until he no longer can
and we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from inside the church responsive hallelujah
and then sams voice over it all
in your actions you give service to the lord
sam at the pulpit in mid sermon
there is an air of fire and brimstone to what were watching here
the congregation listening in rapt attention
hes not interested in your good thoughts
your good intentions
he wants your hands
your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom
ad libbed shouts and praise
and now we see lynn daisy donnie and paige in the congregation listening
as we go lynn and sam walking through the facility and we see this place is alive with activity
more than just a church this is a community center
lynn opening a door and we see a volunteer here with a dozen little children running around this playroom
we started daycare last month
monday thru friday from to
sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it
how you doin sue
lynn pulling the door closed and they continue
moving down a set of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents
some of them playing ping pong and air hockey
others in a corner rehearsing for a christmas play
been thinkin we need to put up a playground
some things the kids can climb on
we cant build anymore
not for awhile

lynn catching up to him now realizing his head is still back in africa
sam working on his harley

sam and donnie share a laugh

the lord dont ask for nuthin you cant deliver buddy
and yer one tough ole boy
sometimes i aint so sure how tough i am
and we see in donnies eyes just how troubled he is
why dont we pray together then
and they both take a knee bowing their heads as sam continues
our gracious heavenly father bless us with the strength to carry on in your name
and grant us in our darkest hours the understandin that you are always by our side
and we leave these two men their heads bowed in quiet supplication next to this harley praying for strength
four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor
and we see sam sitting across from bill wallace late s gold rolex

sam shifting not giving up coming at him another way

but with that kinda money we could feed them kids house them kids
bill staring at him saying nothing on the spot
sam hoping that somehow hes reached this man
and finally bill stands up
alright tell you what lemme see what i can do
sam feeling this victory flashing a smile shaking bills hand
why dont you and the family come over to the house next sunday
were havin a little barbeque ok
upscale french provincial in suburban johnstown
a barbeque is underway
couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters in white tie offering champagne and hors doeuvres to the guests
door bell ringing and we see a perky woman in her late s coming through the crowd blonde hair from a bottle accessorized to the hilt holding a glass of
she opens the door to find sam lynn and paige standing in the doorway
well come on in
and they enter
lynn smiling awkwardly dressed in the same yellow dress we saw her in previously
her only dress
and sam looking around this enormous room
yall must be the childers

smiling a joke she loves
im lynn this here is sam our daughter paige

everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd smiling a little drunk
ad libbed introductions and then
glad yall could make it
get on in here and meet some people
bill ushering them deeper into the house
quick intros to a few guests as they pass
sam lynn and paige taking it all in
starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house
the waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food
like nothing theyve ever seen
bill pulling sam off from the crowd so its just the two of them
taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him
this is a little somethin for the kids ok
what we were talking about
thank you bill
now cmon can i get ya a mojito or somethin
sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door
taking the envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open
pulling out a personal check close up to see its in the amount of hold on sam face and its disgust we see in his eyes
front door opening fast and lynn and paige coming out followed by sam pushing them along
why we leavin so soon
shannon appearing in the doorway in the b
lynn turning to respond but sam keeps her moving forward down the driveway past the line of parked bmws and mercedes to their truck at the curb
get in the car
as they load into the truck
sonuvabitch is cryin pour mouth to me and hes livin in the damn taj mahal
i asked him for five thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me
taking out the check wadding it up hundred and fifty bucks
handed it to me like it was gold bouillon
sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party
sam coming into the house enraged followed by lynn
he moves to his gun cabinet grabs a hidden key unlocks it
what are you doin
ive had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help
and he starts pulling out weapons
shotguns and assault rifles
stuffing them into an oversize gun bag
lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist
staring at her with dark eyes
a flash of the old sam childers here when he says
stay outta my way
and for the first time in years this woman is scared
he lets go of her wrist and continues to fill the bag and we go sam coming out followed by the shop owner
im sorry twenty five hundred is the best i can do for them gun
reverse to see lynns car parked at the curb sam pointing to it
throw in the car for five
the shop owner considering as we go
windy pissing rain
and we see sam walking up this rural road hands in his pockets head down
the only human for miles
trudging through this shitstorm completely alone
and we see sam with a group of men working in the sweltering heat
adding another room to the childrens dorm
and he squints into the distance sees a cloud of dust on the horizon cars coming closer
seven or eight heavily armed vehicles coming through the gate
maybe or spla soldiers guarding a black suburban in the middle of this motorcade
nineteen waving his hand yelling as the cars pass its garang
palpable excitement ripples through the compound
sams soldiers grabbing their weapons and forming a ragged line near the suburban as it stops
the back door to the suburban opens and a black man dressed in shirtsleeves and slacks steps out
the same man we saw giving the fiery speech on the little outdoor tv in nimule earlier john sam turns to deng whos this guy
thats our leader
deng nods as we go
sam and garang walking through the middle of camp trailed by a squad of spla bodyguards and camp children
they call you preacher
is this what i should call you
sam is fine
i hear what you have done for the spla and i am grateful
we can thank god for his blessins
yes we can
how many children do you look after sam
couple hundred with us here
feed another thousand a day from nearby villages
anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal
and they continue through the camp
a few of the children running up to garang touching the cuff of his shirt then sprinting away
what you are doing is noble but too dangerous
i must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle
until someone starts fightin for these children im the one thats gonna do it
you are stubborn arent you
as a mule
garang smiling an instant affinity for this man
you and i come from very different worlds but we are not so dissimilar
and another child runs up to garang touching him and then sprints away giggling
i founded the spla in order to fight for the future of sudan because nobody else would
we fight for freedom from the government in khartoum for the right to vote and for the right to worship any god one may choose
more children running up
garang touching their heads
but most important to me is our struggle for the children
their laughter has been lost to this country for far too long
there are peace talks scheduled for the end of august in naivashu
id like you to come as my guest
talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time
you gotta go out and make it
you are correct but we must fight them at every level
part of my battle is waged in those rooms
we must talk of peace but keep our rifles ready for war
sam turning to him coming to an understanding here
realizing that both of them are warriors in the same fight
maybe together you and i can make sudan free once again
and now we see they have arrived at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound
garang turning to him eyes suddenly becoming dark
there is a cost for freedom sam
a price for the future of these people
some pay with their lives others pay in different ways
my only hope is that your cost is not too great
donnie tucking paige into bed making it up as he goes clearly out of his depth here but wanting to do it right
you say prayers or somethin
ok then sweet dreams
aint you gonna read me a book
ahh paige you know i dont read so good
then lets play a game
im thinkin of a dog
what about it
never mind donnie
dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves
you can do that
sure i can
and donnie does just that bends down and kisses paige on the head
and now we see lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this through the cracked door keenly feeling sam absence in this moment
and we see sam betty and rose leading a group of children their hands covering their eyes so they cant see into a clearing behind one of the dorms
keep em closed
a little bit more
keep your eyes closed
stern arabic michael
cover your eyes
the children inching forward following his voice until
open your eyes
open your eyes
and we see a hundred little eyes popping open staring at something off screen confused for a split second at what theyre looking at
reverse to see a playground two or three battered swingsets a few see saws and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe
and the kids sprinting for it climbing all over the jungle gym like ants
hitting the swing sets
and then we hear it
something we realize we havent heard in this place before
the sound of laughter
children losing themselves in play
innocence flooding back
and now we see nineteen a
and two other spla soldiers standing around a bunny bouncer
staring at it quizzically
talking in arabic trying to decide what this thing is
and then a
the bravest slings his ak onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer
pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs
and he begins to bob back and forth
holding onto the bunnys ears with his big hands
the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster
and then we see a
a million watt smile on this guy
the first time hes played like this since he was a boy
hours later and we see sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset
some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life
that kony is offering money for your nose and ears
sam no reaction just keeps swinging the children
id like to assign a few more men to you during the day
he aint the first old boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall
keep yer soldiers where theyre needed
i can take care of myself
deng clearly worried for his friend but doesnt press the issue
and now sam notices william off from the group sitting on the ground by himself not playing
he said anything yet
all we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the lra
wheres the brother
sam approaching william kneeling down next to him
hey buddy you dont wanna play with the other kids
william no response
you know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside know what i mean
william no reaction whatsoever
something dawning on sam in this moment
you have no idea what im sayin do you
william just stares back at him and sam realizes he doesnt speak english
and they both just sit here for a moment silent staring at the children playing on the playground
and then sam feeling the need to unburden himself begins to talk
i done a lotta things i aint proud of
hurt a lotta people
truth is helpin you kids is about the only good thing i ever done in this life
william watching him quietly
but im scared
scared one day ill close my eyes to all this and make it somebody elses problem
just like everybody else in this world
and he stops and its silent between them again
william just sitting there quietly
and sam looks up to the sky
feeling his life washing over him
sam behind the wheel driving alone the edge of a dry ravine
deng is in the passenger seat and we see nineteen marco and a
crammed into the back
i dont see nuthin
deng checking a handheld gps unit this is it
sam looking out the window sees movement at the bottom of the ravine
and we see what he sees children hiding behind a bush
i got em
and we see the suv picking its way down the rocky slope
reaching the dry riverbed below and moving closer to the children
and the terrain becomes inaccessible and the suv stops
unable to go any further
sam and the others getting out of the truck and we see two children hiding behind a bush yards away
sam whistling to the kids but they draw back
too scared to move
deng tell camp were comin back with two
nineteen go get them kids
and nineteen move off as sam pops the rear hatch on the suv and pulls out a medical bag
and nineteen moving over rocks toward the children calling out to them in arabic come out we wont hurt you
but they dont move
and finally they reach the kids and we see its two boys years old kneeling in the dirt terrified
dont be scared
he smiles reaches for one of the boys and a bullet hits a
in the neck killing him instantly
nineteen dives behind a boulder for cover
sam deng and marco scramble behind the suv
a moment before we hear nineteen yelling offscreen
whats he sayin
tell him to stay where he is
yelling to nineteen arabic dont move
ask him if he saw the shooter
yelling to nineteen arabic did you see him
he did not see
sniper pov and we see a
s lifeless body lying by the children
and the suv
and then part of sams head peering from behind the truck sam looking through binocs as a shot rings out
hitting the windshield right next to his head and he drops behind the truck
you got em
hes on the ridge
just below that outcropping
can you reach the browning
deng opening the rear door and reaching inside the truck
pulling out a long barrel hunting rifle as
the bullet hitting the suv narrowly missing deng
he slides the hunting rifle to sam
need you boys to cover me on three alright
put everything you got into that rock up there
sniper pov locked on the suv when suddenly deng and marco pivot around the truck and start firing bullets popping all around and the sniper drops for cover as sam
sprints over the rocks and dives into a shallow ditch out of sight
deng and marco stop firing and drop back behind the suv
sniper pov slowly pops up from behind the rocks after the shooting stops
and we realize he didnt see sam change positions
sam rolling onto his stomach and slowly sliding the barrel of the rifle between two rocks
then seeing a sliver of the sniper hidden on the ridge
sniper pov still locked on the suv waiting for a clear shot
sam putting a bead on the sniper but at this range the shot is going to take instinct
sam turns his head away from the rifle and exhales controls his breathing as we go sniper pov trained on the suv
and then we see a flash from the right side of the screen
and a delayed pop
deng looking through binocs at the ridge calling out to sam i think you got him
sam deng and marco moving toward the children weapons drawn scanning the area in all directions
deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground shaking from fear
it is ok
you can get up now
but the boys dont move
and deng reaches down pulls them to their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which has been buried in the ground
sam joins deng sees the chains
lra wanted us here
sam realizing that these children were used as bait for him
were at the top of the ravine now and we see sam and the others moving toward the location of the sniper
and sam is the first to reach the body
laying on the ground face down
a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath
and he rolls the body onto its back and we see its just a kid no older than years old
its late at night and we see sam on his cot sitting here in the dark
and we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the table next to him
he picks it up sees donnies name on the screen
and we see donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room
sam its me
oh yeah everybodys just fine
i was just callin to say hey is all
howre the girls
paige cooked us all dinner the other night
chocolate chip pancakes
by herself huh
i helped her with the stove is all
she did everything else
pretty good too
and now we see donnies dope works sitting on the table in front of him
hes using again
hows it goin over there
hey maybe ill come with you one of these trips
id like to get outta here for a spell
see what its like
and its silent between them
both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment
ask you a question
you think god will forgive us for the things weve done
and were watching sam this question hitting him like a freight train
unable to answer
were hit by a crush of people a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town
and we find sam deng and nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the suv
they talk about you
sam turning to find agnete the aid worker approaching him
in the camps
they say there is a white preacher who hunts the lra
this place does not need more killing mr
im just tryin to help these people
same as you
war upon war does not fix what is broken here
the history of this country is filled with righteous killers
that is how it always begins with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons
i got a kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food
right or not thats all the reason i need
and what about the rumors i have heard about you supplying weapons to the spla
sam turning to her face to face starting to get pissed
you fight the evil in this place your way ill fight it mine
do not delude yourself mr
youre a mercenary not a humanitarian
sam finished with this conversation slams the lift gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in
they say you are doing good
that you have special powers
that you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets
sam looking at her and theres a warning in what she says next
about violence corrupting men
they said the same thing about kony in the beginning
sam sitting outside his tukul alone tearing open an airmail package and pulling out another videocassette slides it into his videocamera hits play on the small screen we see a
children dressed in costumes shuffling across the stage
lines being spoken by rote
and then the awkward entrance of paige speaking her lines
but instead of finding joy in this sweet moment he finds heartache
the distance from his family
from their innocence
simply too great to bear in this moment
and then he hears giggling
and he realizes two young orphan boys have snuck up behind him and are looking at the screen over his shoulder
and sam holds it up so they can see better and now more children gather around maybe or kids pointing at the small screen
giggling and chatting in arabic
look at their shoes
they look silly
this is how americans dance
their dancing is terrible
the children laughing hysterically
and for an instant sam is swept out of his melancholy by their sweet enjoyment
and then sam sees deng and nineteen approaching quickly
whats goin on
an lra convoy has moved north over the border
theyre heading for ed duim
thats where they sell em on the black market aint it
a moonless night
and we see headlights piercing this blackness
bouncing down a singletrack road
deng behind the wheel driving sam in the passenger seat marco nineteen and a third spla soldier jammed in the back look
far ahead we see three sets of headlights coming towards us on the road just bouncing white dots on the horizon and silently they begin to check their mags and
weapons preparing for battle and the headlights get closer deng not slowing down and we realize we are on a collision course with this convoy and finally we see muzzle flashes in the distance and machine gun strafe hitting the front and side of the truck lets go
sam and nineteen leaning through the open windows as deng drives leveling their aks and firing and now the approaching convoy lights up with return fire
sam and nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back deng stepping on the gas accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of chicken reminiscent of sam and donnies wild
ride with the drifter in scene and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore bullets popping across the windshield of the truck sam and nineteen in constant fire mode the sound deafening headlights blown out on both trucks and now were plunged into total blackness only the wild strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as these trucks slam towards each other and finally deng skidding to a stop as sam nineteen and the third spla soldier pile out of the truck firing and advancing on the caravan by foot
rebels jumping out of their disabled trucks sam and his men flanking them blasting one of the trucks until the engine bursts into flames cutting down the rebels before they
even knew what hit them
and then theres a great stillness
the quiet of death
sam coming out of the blackness with his ak leveled
moving toward the flaming wreckage of the caravan
deng nineteen and marco moving to each rebel body
making sure theyre dead
sam and deng moving to the back of the transport truck
bring me a flashlight
marco hustling up with a spotlight sam switching it on as deng rips the canvas back and we see boys and girls
none of them older than twelve
tied together with rope
in very bad shape
the front axle is broken
this truck wont drive
whatd he say
the truck is too damaged to move
meaning the children we dont have room for them all preacher
the implication of this hitting sam his mind reeling turning to nineteen
bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us
pull everyone of them kids outta there
to soldiers arabic bring the children out
deng and marco helping the children out
one by one
put em right here
put them together here
and now nineteen pulls up in the suv lighting up the children
what are you doing
were takin the ones that aint gonna make it through the night
come back for the others later
and sam moves to the first child in the group a little girl reaching out to her but she pulls back
tell her im not gonna hurt her
he will not hurt you
and slowly the little girl steps forward
and sam gently unbuttons her shirt and begins to examine her little body
turning her around in the harsh light of the suvs headlamps
and he finds five infected gashes on her back
already turning gangrene
and he gently pushes her toward deng
put her in the truck
and sam continues with the group
assessing each childs health
tenderly running his hands over their broken starved bodies
somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of line
and he reaches the last child and we see that the suv is now packed with children
huddled into every available corner
children in total
theres no more room
tell em were comin back
deng hesitating knows the reaction hes going to get
we will be back for you
the children become hysterical crying running at sam and grabbing for him begging to be taken
to the children holding up two hours
ill be back in two hours
sam deng and the others loading into the suv
some of them climbing onto the roof
the only available space
the remaining children clamoring around the truck as it begins to pull away
tell em to hide
dont come out til they see my face
deng yelling this to the children as they drive off
hide until we return
the faint cries of the children slowly fading as they speed into the darkness
a red sun breaking the horizon
its one hour later and we see the suv blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to a stop doors popping open soldiers jumping off the roof
betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of the truck
ushering them into the infirmary
sam yelling at another soldier as he walks across the courtyard gas it up
were leavin here in five
two hours into this return trip and its silent in this cab
deng checking a handheld gps clocking their position and then they see it through the windshield in the distance rising in a thin column a half mile away
the scene of the ambush the night before
burned out pickup trucks and dead lra rebels strewn in the dirt
sams suv arriving and hes the first one out
whistling for the children but theyre nowhere to be seen
and now we realize that the column of smoke isnt coming from the bombed out lra trucks its coming from behind them
sam moving around the back of the transport truck to see the children sam left behind
burned alive by the lra an hour earlier
sam just standing here staring at this smoldering pile of children
starting to go someplace very dark
and as he puts it most of him died in the bush this morning too
and we see a line of american travelers waiting to be checked through customs
business men in their rumpled suits carrying briefcases parents with their tired children returning from vacation
and sam standing in this line with his duffel bag somehow cut off from the life all around him
and the customs officer waves him forward
sam handing him his passport
and he looks up studies sam what are you doing over there
and we see sam has no answer for him
this question beginning to plague him like a festering sore
its raining and we see sam sitting on a bench waiting staring o
at a skycab trolley
two men working through a pile of black golf bags heaped on top of each other like bodies tossing them one by one into the back of the trolley
he looking up as donnie gets out of his car smiling
sorry im late
sixteen was all jammed up
donnie is strung out but sam is too deep in his own shit to see it
welcome home buddy
a bank manager at a desk in a gray suit shaking his head
i understand what youre saying but theres just not a lot we can do until we pay down some of what you owe my hands are tied
reverse to see sam sitting in a chair across from him a manila folder filled with his business papers sitting on his lap
its just an application for a short term loan
sam we already took out a second on your home
its only days
youre completely leveraged
i only got one truck over there john
i need the money to buy a second vehicle
sam opens a manilla folder and pulls out a photo of a truck for sale
now theres one in kampala i can probably get for twenty one
cutting him off sam we know what youre doing over there in africa and we support it but
sam leans over the desk and sets another photograph down in front of him and we see its a gruesome photograph of a mutilated boy
i want you to look at this
twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by lra
an employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign looks down at the photos
the bank manager becoming uncomfortable
its not necessary
sam pulls out another photograph and sets it in front of the bank manager this one even more gruesome
look at this john when we found this little girl her breasts had been hacked off
bank manager not looking at the photograph
sam this isnt necessary
look at her
look at this girl
bank manager glancing at the photograph then looking away
now i aint in here askin fer money fer a hot tub or vacation or somethin like that
im askin for an extra vehicle so i can save some children
you understand that
i do but
i need you to open yer little book there and do whatever you need to do to get me that loan
sam you need to calm down
dont tell me to calm down
look at those pictures
look at em john and he slams the desk with his open hand taking us to
a c on the fritz and its blistering hot in here
parishioners in pews waving themselves with hand fans trying to stay cool
and we see sam at the pulpit in mid sermon shirt pitted and rolled up to his elbows
the rage in this man is palpable
open yer eyes
you call yerselves children of god but you aint
yall just sheep followin him deaf dumb and blind
but god dont want sheep
he wants wolves to fight his fight
men and women with teeth to tear at the evil thats out there
the congregation whipped into a frenzy
a few of them jumping to their feet shouting praise
and we see john garang in the back of this car as it drives through downtown kampala
sam becoming more possessed
the congregation responding amen
the motorcade pulling to a stop
garang and other government officials getting out and making their way to a waiting helicopter
sam a building fury
garang and the others loading into the helicopter locking doors
propellers starting to rotate
the helicopter lifting off the ground ascending into the cloudless sky until its just a speck in the limitless blue
and only then will their hearts beat no more
and they will be turned to dust
paige and her girlfriend from her th grade class sit on the landing
donnie flips through a magazine lynn puts away laundry
chatter here about an upcoming formal
mary strauss and them is havin dinner at the chimney
whos her date
i thought tony wilkes was goin with patty hobbes daughter
they broke up last month
and now we see sam off from the group absently watching the tv in an adjoining room
and a news report begins
a picture of john garang flashing on the screen
sam moving closer to the set so he can hear sudanese opposition leader john garang has been killed in a helicopter crash according to a statement released by the sudanese
government in khartoum today
sam going completely still
garang was hailed as a peacemaker in sudan and was instrumental in ending the year civil war that has ravaged that country
six of garangs associates and seven others also died in the crash which is being blamed on bad weather
sam frozen shocked
just staring at the tv as the newscast switches to another story
sam looking up to find everybody staring at him
what do you think about us gettin a limo for next weekend

sam lost here for a moment
earth to dad

tears welling up in paiges eyes anger hurt wanting to lash out at him somehow
and what she says next shes felt her whole life
you love them black babies more than you love me
donnie instinctively grabbing his arm protective
and sam spins gets in his face eyes dark and threatening what the hell you think youre doin boy

dont tell me to take it easy in my own fuckin house
sam and donnie toe to toe and the threat of serious violence here
tension like a hair trigger
that aint your wife and this aint your family

hell i dont
now you get the fuck outta here fore i put yer head through that wall
donnie standing here hurt
looking to lynn to make sure shes alright and she nods for him to go
and he turns and walks out
paige bursting into tears and running out of the room
a crowded noisy outlaw bar in johnstown
we see sam sitting at the bar all alone a shot of whisky and a bottle of beer in front of him
staring into a void
you that preacher aint ya
sam turns to find a burly looking biker standing next to him smiling
yep you him
i seen your face in the papers few years ago

to his buddies told you this is the guy
hot damn i knew it
papers was talkin bout how you was like some kinda african rambo or somethin right
you dont mind id like to just sit here right now
you still helpin them niggers over there
the way i figure it the reason you so interested in helpin them porch monkeys is cause you probably throwin it in them nigger bitches aint ya
the biker smiles a nasty malicious smile
his buddies moving next to him now
and we see a quiet storm brewing in sam
am i right
you a nigger fucker boy
a moment here sam staring at the biker with a look weve come to know and crackkkk
sam head butts the bikers face and a sudden violent brawl breaks out bikers swinging cue sticks sam wading into the crew swinging wild taking the biker down and stomping
on his face bloody murderous and then sam released coming out a door and we see lynns car parked in the parking lot engine idling
lynn behind the wheel as sam comes around the passenger door and gets in
and the two of them just sit here for a long beat until
youre gonna sit there and youre gonna lemme talk
sam says nothing
ive always believed in you
i trusted you trusted the lord and did what i could so you could follow your dream
but i aint willin to lose you to what youre doin over there
aint gonna just stand by and watch you get swallowed up by it
she looks to him and we see she has tears in her eyes
i know youre all them kids got but youre all we got too
paige needs her father
i need my husband
sam sitting in a chair in the dark
and we hear his cell vibrating on the desk
he picks it up and sees donnies name on the screen
a moment here and then he sets the phone back down
doesnt answer it
as we go
donnie on a couch and he looks like hell
pale gaunt face
phone at his ear listening to ringing and ringing
and then the sound of sams voice
this heres sam
you know what to do
hey buddy its donnie
shoot i was hopin you was there
doesnt hang up
and we can feel how badly he needs to talk to somebody
other day i was thinkin bout when you and me was kids
that summer wed go down to the quarry over in montrose remember that
we hooked up them ropes and spent all day swimmin and jumpin off them walls
donnie smiling to himself a fleeting memory and then something dark coming over him
and now we see another man here in this shitty dope house cooking up a spoon of black tar juicing a needle
donnie watching him like a hawk
i wish you was there to pray with me buddy
eastern white pine wrapped in early morning fog
floating like a dream
and then the sound of wood splintering
and we find sam alone in this vapor cutting logs with an axe
sweating despite the chill in the air
and then a voice from somewhere far off
sam stopping looking into the haze as a figure materializes
coming toward him calling his name
at first it looks like donnie
but then we see its lynn
and when she reaches him her look tells us something terrible has happened
donnies corpse lying in a casket
packed with mourners
and we hear a childrens choir singing a plaintive hymnal
my jesus i love thee
and donnies mother in the first pew dressed in black surrounded by a few other women offering her comfort
and now we see sam moving up the steps to the platform
and the choir softly finishes
and he looks out over the congregation
not saying a word for a long beat
most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this
thats why you come here today
you want me to tell you that god has his plan for all of us and when he wants to call us back home hes gonna do it
thats what you wanna hear
thats what you wanna hear
and sam stops unable to continue
just stares out at the congregation
at the expectant faces looking back at him waiting
but he steps away from the lectern down the steps and walks up the aisle toward the exit
the congregation staring at him as he passes
lynn and paige still dressed from the funeral driving up the driveway to their house
mom who are those men
through the windshield we see a flatbed truck parked next to the house and or movers pulling heavy machinery out of the barn
lynn getting out of the car approaching some of the men
scuse me what are you doing
and she makes her way into
filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage
lynn coming in confused
hey scuse me
and now she sees sam going through a cabinet in the back
sam whats goin on
what are these men doin here
sam slamming the cabinet closed moving past her without saying a word
lynn grabbing his arm stopping him
where are they taking our stuff
aint ours no more
best go through and make sure they aint takin nuthin that belongs in the house
he walks off
and she sees two men start to dismantle the childers construction company sign that she painted herself years ago hey
dont touch that
sam moving toward the house
lynn comes out of the barn after him
but hes not stopping
he reaches the house
sam coming inside moving to the kitchen
lynn following him
honey i know youre hurtin
i know youre angry but we need to talk about this
its all done so save yer breath
wheres the keys to the safe
sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to lynn
she quickly pages through them cant believe what shes reading
you sold the business for
i need a new truck for the orphanage
a new truck
you sold our business for a new truck
sam finds the keys
that was our future sam
lynn follows sam into the office
everything we have has gone to those children sam
theres a point when there aint no more to give
whats the combination
whats the fucking combination
sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates
you dont know it do you
you dont even remember your own daughters birthday
what are the numbers
you fight for everyone but us
she moves past him spinning the combination and cranking open the vault
sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash
you take that and we lose the house
all of it
you can make it up with the ministry
they see what youve become sam
they see how far gone you are
you need to get quiet with the lord
and he looks to her
fuck the lord
dont say that
dont turn yer back on him
he turned his back on me
on every one of them kids over there
the good youre doin is destroyin this family
what good have i ever done
sam standing here weighing something in his mind
a choice he must make here
and finally he moves past her
please dont leave
but hes gone
and we see sam moving across this crowded tarmac
a bit frightening
and hes greeted by deng
but sam says nothing and deng sees that his eyes are deserted
and sam moves past him without saying a word
or adults and children here eating the last meal of the day
and we see sam in a corner off from the rest of the group
and maybe its just the lighting in here but theres a darkness around him literally as if the space surrounding this man is devoid of light
and we see william working his way through the room
refilling cups with hot tea
his particular job here
and he comes up to sam and accidently sloshes some of the tea onto sams arm and he flinches
burned damn it
shoots his arm out and accidentally hits william in the chest knocking him backward onto the ground
the entire room falls silent
and sam gets up and walks out of the room
a convoy of or aid relief trucks coming down this dirt road
and we see agnete here with a driver in the first truck as they drive onto a narrow bridge and just before they reach the other side a pickup truck
filled with heavily armed lra rebels pulls in front of them cutting them off
the truck grinding to a halt
the driver becoming terrified trying to jam the truck into reverse no no no
dont go back you move and theyll shoot
i will talk to them
agnete climbing out of the truck as we go rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as agnete approaches holding up her hands its ok
we are a relief convoy agnete and the lra leader meet in the middle of the bridge we have only medical supplies non and suddenly the lra leader slams her in the gut with the butt of his rifle and she collapses
the other rebels swarm all over the convoy pulling out aid workers and drivers forcing them onto their knees in a group
get on your knees
on your knees or we will take your legs
everyone terrified some of them sobbing agnete looking up trying to talk to the lra leader we are only a relief convoy shut your mouth
and he slams her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she goes down hard
and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back of her head
hes going to shoot her and his chest explodes
three bursts from behind the other rebels spinning toward the gunshots as a firestorm of lead sam deng and the rest of his team coming onto the bridge shooting rebels
scrambling for cover but its too late dropping as they try and sprint away and in an instant its all over
agnete sees sam rushes toward him but when he looks at her she freezes
he is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment a killers thousand yard stare barely human more like a machine than a man
and he moves past her down the bridge to the lra leader on the ground who is still alive
and he puts the barrel of his rifle against the rebels head and
just like that
and he continues walking up the bridge
and we see agnete deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this
william coming in quietly moving next to one of the captured rebels from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed injured
two spla soldiers here standing guard
i want to ask you something
william pulls out the photograph of his brother holds it up
this is my brother
his name is christopher
he was stolen by the rebels
do you know if he is alive
the rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing just shakes his head
and he looks off his thousand yard stare inscrutable
and william simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket
but he doesnt leave
he sits here a moment longer
were you taken when you were young like me
the rebel hears this and turns to him
and nods his head
do you remember your parents
and we see something happening in this hardened rebel
his eyes filling with a distant memory
and slowly he nods his head again
and we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other
connected by a shared history and anguish
sam sitting alone lost to the world around him
neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until
do you hear that preacher
there is no more laughter
the children do not play here anymore
they are scared once again
but now they are scared of you
sam no response
the men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle
they say you have a wish to die
i am worried about my friend
i want to help him
i dont need your help
and sam turns away
after a beat deng walks off leaving him alone once again
and we see sam here in the dark
moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof
like shards of glass cutting through the blackness
and he doesnt look right here
soul worn thin
starting to go someplace very bad
images flashing in his head
babies burned and screaming
donnie in his coffin
and we realize were watching something here
his world starting to cave in on him
and he drops against his cot
tears in his eyes and this man is breaking
and suddenly we see a gun in his hand
finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head
eyes closing against the world
still holding the gun
and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room
and william steps into the light sees sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand
and slowly he moves next to him sitting on the cot without saying a word
just the two of them here for a moment
and then slowly he begins in perfect english
i remember my parents when i sleep
i see them in my dreams sometimes
sam looking to william
this small boy sitting above him
telling his story
my father was big like you
they shot him
we were so scared
then the rebels gave me a club and told me if i didnt kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me
and william pauses in his story
lost in this memory
his face becoming a mask of pain
but no tears
there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed
and so he continues
i refused but my mother told me to swing hard
that i must make her proud
and so i did
i made her proud
and now william looks down at sam
staring at this man on the ground
and he reaches out and gently touches sams head
a moment of tenderness for both of them
an act of love
these two broken souls finding each another here
and william says
if we allow ourselves to become full of hate then theyve won
we must not let them take our hearts
this is the most important thing
and sam sets the gun down and reaches out to william pulls him into an embrace
holding him close
and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this mans life
soft christian music is playing on the radio
lynn folding clothes in the laundry room when the phone rings
paige comes into the upstairs hallway and answers it
quiet into phone hello
sam on his sat phone bug
yeah its me
im ok bug
and theres a long pause
so much to say but no words to say it
each of them holding their phones to their ears and just listening
and finally sam says
im thinkin of a tree
and we see tears well up in paiges eyes when she hears this
and now we see lynn coming around the corner overhearing them as they begin their little game one more time
you said tree
im thinkin of a knee
sam smiling to himself
and we realize this man is coming back to life when he says
you said knee im thinkin of bee
i love you bug
i love you too daddy
lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go
and we see the soldiers at their posts
betty and the other camp women cleaning clothes and preparing food
and we see most of the children loitering around a tree in the shade sullen not playing on the playground
and then we see sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer ball
some of the children see him and point
and slowly the entire camp begins to notice sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly by himself out in the open
betty and the other women stopping their chores and watching him speaking to one another in arabic
deng and the other soldiers staring as sam pops the ball into the air and bounces it off his head
and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks them the ball
and slowly the rest of the children join in the fun
kicking the ball back and forth
an impromptu soccer game
and then we hear laughter again
joy flooding back into this place
deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these little children
a pied piper of joy
playing in the dirt
and we see william approach a knot of soldiers standing by the front gate smoking cigarettes
what is it
is it true an lra commander was captured last night
soldiers nodding their heads yes
where is he being held
at the army base in kisoro
are you going there
can i ride with you
why do you want to go to kisoro
i want to ask the commander something
no you cannot ride with us
wait till tomorrow and go with the women on the bus
and the soldiers turn their backs on william and he slinks away
we see a line of women along the riverbank in their colorful dresses
scrubbing pans and washing clothes
singing an ancient african spiritual as they work
the sun dropping pale red on the horizon
and we see sam here too
alone with himself
sitting at the rivers edge watching the water rolling gently past
listening to the soft serenade of the women
the beauty of it all
and then he gets up and walks into the river
and he kneels down so that water reaches his waist reminiscent of his first baptism in scene
and now the women on the riverbank stop their work watching him as he closes his eyes and gently leans back
submitting to the water
and when he comes up again we see in his eyes that his soul has been saved in this simple act
and the women begin to shout their praise from the riverbank as we go
and we see william here alone pulling out a small satchel
filling it with a bottle of water and a blanket
william at the edge of the compound
looking over his shoulder to make sure nobody is watching him
and then quickly slipping under the fence and hes gone
william walking through the dry scrub alone
already a couple miles deep in the bush
the sun starting to set
william starting to get nervous picking up his pace
a squad of lra rebels coming through the scrub
william hiding under a bush terrified
the men coming closer
no idea if they saw him or not
his mind racing
voices getting louder
starting to hyper ventilate from the fear and sprinting through the bush running for his life rebels see him yelling for him to stop chasing him down shooting their rifles
into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position too terrified to continue eyes clamped shut as or rebels surround him guns pointed at his head caught
sam coming into the building finding betty tending to a sick child
have you seen william
betty shaking her head no and we see the worry on sams face
intuitively knows something is wrong
william bound and gagged being dragged through the bush by or rebels
and one of the rebels sees him staring at them and he brings the butt of his kalishnikov down hard striking william on the head as we go deng coming
up to sam
some of the soldiers said he was asking about the commander that is being held at kismoro
sam closing his eyes knows instantly what william has done
get em on the phone see if hes shown up at the base yet
william shoved through the bush
moving deeper into this rebel encampment
dark and otherworldly
figures moving around camp fires
men with little girls
their child wives
with pregnant bellies
and incongruously the sound of american rap music coming from a jambox somewhere
the overriding sense we get from this place is one of insanity
and william is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and hes kicked to the dirt
two other soldiers pinning him to the ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes
william yelling and now a handful of other lra soldiers start to gather around
most of them only a few years older than him
watching as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block
and now another soldier steps forward with an axe
and the crowd whips into bloodlust
the soldier freezes everyone turning as an lra commander comes through the crowd takes the axe from the soldier he ran from us
he is worth nothing with no feet
put him with the others until tomorrow
deng hustling up to sam
shaking his head
they have not see the boy
get nineteen and marco were gonna go look for him
and we see william in a bamboo cell in the center of camp
and we see other children here
in various stages of fear and suffering
some of them completely naked
shivering in the cool air
others catatonic probably doped up or too battered to move
sam deng nineteen and marco in this lead truck
been out here for hours
behind them we see the second camp truck following
and they come to a fork in the road pulling to a stop
it will be light soon
what do you want to do
sam looking at a topo map on his lap
lets go through maridi see if theyve seen anything
pale yellow sun breaking and we see william and a line of or other children shackled in iron being loaded into the back of a transport truck
both suvs parked off the side of the road now
sam and deng here looking at maps and the gps tracker
and we hear dengs radio squawk
he digs it out responds in arabic then turns to sam
the village outside of akot says an lra caravan came through there an hour ago
they were headed for ed duim
a convoy of or lra trucks barreling down this dirt track
and we see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks cradling heavy weapons alert and suddenly we see in the distance from different angles converging on
the lra convoy the rebels see them and point they know whats coming and they begin to prepare for war getting closer and then we see them bouncing over the terrain towards us coming fast and then an rpg streaks toward the lead lra truck and kabooom
the truck is blown off its axles the other lra trucks pulling off the road and suddenly were in a withering firefight the roar of heavy weapons at full tilt
jumping out of their trucks and flanking the lra convoy triangulating fire shredding the rebels blowing them back off their feet
sprinting through the bush edging around the lra trucks finding a position on their weak side and locking an rpg into a launcher shouldering it aiming woooosh
the missile streaking toward the second lra jeep and its blasted into the air onto its side rebels scurrying away from the wreckage still firing an absolute hail of lead
aks barking in every direction one of the rebels standing up firing an rpg wooooosh
marco crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing sees the white streak coming at him dives just as sam moving closer to the rebels shooting picking them off one by
one gunfire raking over his head a dozen muzzle flashes coming from everywhere sam yelling over the thunder go
and we see deng coming out of the bush to his right and then nineteen to his left and they charge on the remaining rebels sam providing covering fire a
curtain of lead cutting through the enemy and just like that its over sam waving behind him cease fire
and suddenly theres just a sick silence smoke rising from the shot to shit lra trucks bodies strewn in the dirt the brand new orphanage truck bombed out and smoking
on its side
and sam makes his way to the first transport truck deng covering him as he rips the canvas back to see pull em all out
cmon lets go
to soldiers arabic take them out
soldiers start to unload the children cut them loose
to soldier arabic cut the ropes
sam moves to the second transport truck rips the canvas back to holy fuck indeed
hes been here before
kids and he only has one good vehicle
and we watch him standing here
staring at these tiny faces looking back at him
lost in indecision until one of the kids stands up near the back
sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do
cmon lets go
get em out of there and line em up
and weve seen this before
sam going through these children
assessing their health
one by one
separating the worse off from the others
forming two group
turning to deng and nineteen and motioning to the smaller group about children
load these here into the truck
put em three deep if you have to
deng herding the children toward the one good truck
turning to marco arabic come with me sam and marco moving from one dead lra rebel to the other
rolling them onto their backs
going through their belts
pulling out extra ammo clips and grenades
get them aks too
the machine guns
marco swinging four or five machine guns onto his shoulder
at the suv now jammed with children
sam talking to nineteen marco and the others
i need all you to climb up on that roof and keep yer eyes peeled
that road back might be hot so be ready
what about you preacher
sam turns to see deng next to him holding an ak in his hands a steely resolve in his eyes
sam nods emboldened by his support
to the soldiers go on
get outta here
the soldiers load onto the suv and drive off leaving sam and deng standing here in the middle of these children
waiting for the war that will surely come
and we stay in this truck as it pulls away
driving for a long time
until sam deng and the children become only specks on the horizon
to this day sam childers fights for the children of sudan and northern uganda
joseph kony and his lords resistance army continue their reign of terror in sudan and northern uganda
amnesty international estimates that kony and the lra are responsible for over murders and more than child abductions
these children are tortured raped sold into sex slavery and forced to take part in ritualized killing by lra commanders
the islamic government of sudan continues to provide weapons and safe haven to kony and the lra as part of a deal to wage a proxy war against the predominately
without pressure from the united states this support will continue and more innocent children will be slaughtered
now you know
as of sam childers has rescued over children from the lra
his angels of east africa orphanage is home to more than orphans and feeds over meals a day to neighboring villagers in need
