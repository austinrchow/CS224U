screenplay by story by and a mountain peak dominates the landscape
riders on horseback cross the desert
from this distance they appear to be a company of army cavalry soldiers
reveal only details of saddles hooves and uniforms
the riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient cliff pueblo
the officer in command raises his hand halting his troops
riders climb down from their mounts
and only now do we realize that this is a troop of boy scouts all of them about thirteen years of age
the commanding officer is only their scoutmaster mr
one of the scouts a pudgy kid named herman steps away from his horse bends over and pukes
the other scouts rag on him
a blond scout however befriends herman
he has a thatch of straw colored hair and the no nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school
additionally he has adorned his uniform with an authentic hopi indian woven belt
chaps dont anybody wander off
some of the passageways in here can run for miles
two boy scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff
the two boys head down the passageway
its dark and the temperature drops several degrees
spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys hair
herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise but hes drawn on by his companions adventurous curiosity
i dont think this is such a good idea
laughter is heard the blond scout pulls herman forward toward its source
the voices grow louder now as the boys get closer to their source
the light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead
the boys approach cautiously careful to stay hidden
what is it
this is what they see four men digging with shovels and pick axes
they have broken into one of the pueblos secret chambers
the men are rough rider his name describes his dress roscoe a bowery boy bully of and halfbreed with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders
and the fourth man wears a leather waist jacket and brown felt fedora hat
he has his back turned to us but we would be willing to bet anything that this is indlana jones
however when the man turns and his face is illuminated by the lanterns glow we are shocked to discover that it is someone else
well call him fedora
the two boys are mesmerized by what they see
now we realize that the blond scout is actually young indiana jones
alfred did you get anything yet
two of the men stand and look at roscoe who steps forward holding a box in his hands
hey ive got something
whoops from the other men
i got something garth
roscoe rushes forward and gives fedora the box
fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock
i got something
i got something right here
more whoops from the other men
fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern
halfbreed pushes roscoe as he jumps with excitement
rough rider steps forward to look at the box as fedora opens it
more whoops then oh look at thatl more whoops were richl were rich
fedora takes a bejeweled cross from the box and holds it aloft
fedoras comrades practically salivate at the sight of it
well were rich aint we
l indy takes off his hat and looks down at the o
what are they doing
shhhl fedora blows dust from the cross turning it in his hand silently appraising its beauty
and its value
he seems aloof from the others somehow superior to them
hey we got to find more stuff to bring back
indy stays hidden but is astounded by what he sees
hushed urgent its the cross of coronadol cortes gave it to him in fedora continues to admire the cross then places it on the rock next to its box and
indy turns back to observe the men
that cross is an important artifact
it belongs in a museum
a look of resolve comes into indys expression and he turns back toward run back and find the others
tell mister havelock that there are men looting in the caves
herman doesnt seem to be listening
instead he watches in wide eyed horror as a snake slithers across his lap
have him bring the sheriff
indy matter of factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside
its only a snake
indy grabs hermans scout scarf and pulls him closer
did you hear what i said
what what are you gonna do
i dont know
ill think of something
indy releases the scarf gives herman a pat and herman dashes off
indy sees the cross on the rock next to the lantern
as the robbers continue to search for additional valuables indy is able to work his way unseen to within arms reach of the cross
fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b
dig with your hands
indy picks up the cross
not with your mouth
as fedora stands watching the other men digging indy puts the cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby
as he climbs indys feet break a wooden beam attracting the mens attention
hes got our thing
the three robbers are so eager to get their hands on indy they almost knock each other over in the attempt
only fedora is unperturbed
he casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off after indy
indy emerges from the darkness of the pueblo into the brightness of day
he pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions
anybody everybodys lost but me
he hears running footsteps behind him and dashes off
rough rider halfbreed and roscoe are quick to appear and run after him
there he isl lets go
lets get him
indy jumps from one rock to another the scout troop horses are below
indy puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles for his horse who trots over
indy puts the cross in his belt
indy prepares to jump into the saddle
but the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position
the impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth
indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse
fedora and his men arrive at the roofs edge in time to see indy climb into the saddle and gallop off
come back here
fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles
and a vintage truck and automobile come roaring out from behind the pueblo driven by two more gang members
now we glimpse
the passenger in the car
his face is concealed by the hats wide brim
his arm is out the window however and we see an olive colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit
he gestures to the robbers now in the truck
indy spurs his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse
they begin to squeeze in on it
indy crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle his heart pounding his adrenalin pumping
indy veers off in a new directiontoward a railroad track
the train is barreling down the track
indy rides up beside it
he glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him
no other choice
he he clings to the side of a boxcar as halfbreed and rough rider leap from the truck onto the train
halfbreed tries to grab indy but indy leaps onto another boxcar
halfbreed runs after him but indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar
indy loses his balance but regains it
with halfbreed and rough rider still running after him indy enters the trap door of
and finds himself crawling on a catwalk suspended from the cars ceiling
several feet below are numerous vats containing all manner of reptiles alligators crocodiles giant lizards etc
then halfbreed enters through the trap doorfollowed by rough rider
halfbreed grabs hold of indys feet but indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp
indy crawls away toward an opening on the opposite side
halfbreed grabs at indys feet again indy rolls away and we see large bins of squirming snakes
the combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for and the bolts begin to rip from the ceiling
everyone holds their breath afraid to make another move
several bolts tear free
halfbreed and rough rider scream
but its indys end of the catwalk that drops down
plunging indy to the floor of the car
he lands hard with a splash into a vat of water
where he finds himself eye to eye with an the head of this snake is so damn big it looks more like a tyrannosaurus rex
indy jumps back in horror
only to land with a squish into the snake vat
hundreds of slippery squirming snakes
indy sinks into them
they cover him
almost smother him
indy jumps out of the side of the vat freeing himself
indy locates a clean out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape
halfbreed meanwhile tries to open the closed window of the car
rough rider moves to assist him
here let me
indy stops checks to see the cross still lodged in his belt
suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt removes a snake from and tosses it away
roscoe appears atop the reptile car and manages to grab indy
indy kicks at him
roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as indy moves on to
indy climbs over canvas covered circus equipment
roscoe follows grabbing a long stick with a hook on it
he reaches forward and trips indy who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar
as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of indys fall hitting a huge roscoe grabs indy by the ankle and yanks him off his feet
the two struggle rolling from side to side coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge
things get even more serious when roscoe pulls a knife
the ferocious black rhino is becoming extremely agitated by the commotion going on atop his cage
finally he raises his head and thrusts his as the horn smashes through the wood only inches from indys head
indy and roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle
the horn comes up againright between indys legs
indy kicks roscoe away
roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling
indy flips over onto his stomach
the wooden trap door explodes as a bullet is fired from within
the door is pushed open and halfbreed and rough rider hurry out of the car
indy gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a water tank alongside the track directly up ahead
indy gets an idea
in an instant he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand leaps for the tanks water spout
he catches it perfectly
but his velocity causes the water spout to rotate a full degrees
with indy hanging on feet kicking the water spout deposits him back on the train onto the roof of a stockcar where he looks up to see fedora walking toward
come on kid
theres no way out of this
as indy edges away from fedora a portion of the stockcars roof collapses and indy falls through into the car below
indy crashes down from above
indys eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark
a bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards
then indy sees it
at the far end of the boxcar
rising slowly to its feet
an african lion
the lion roars
the boxcar walls shake
dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight
and indy has one more surprise in store the cross of cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall
indy glances around sees a coiled lion tamers whip hanging on a nail
he carefully takes it down by the handle
the lion sees this and growls softly
indy swallows hard and gives the whip a try
it unravels awkwardly its tip flying back and hitting indy in the face
cutting his chin
the lion growls louder
indy quickly gathers up the whip wets his lips and tries again
the whip cracks sharply
the lion bellows and swats the air
and steps back
indy looks amazed and delighted
he cracks the whip again
the lion backs away even more
indy inches forwardbends down never taking his eyes off the lion picks up the crossand steps back again sweat pouring down his face
how to get out
he looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees fedora looking down at him
fedora extends his hand
toss up the whip
fedora assisted by halfbreed and rough rider reels indy out of the stockcar as the lion roars and lunges and indy screams
the men including roscoe pull indy through the hole in the roof
he stands to face them as rough rider points a gun in his direction
youve got heart kid
indicates cross but that belongs to me
takes cross from his belt it belongs to coronado
overlapping coronado is dead
and so are all his grandchildren
this should be in a museum
now give me thatl roscoe makes a grab for the crossbut indy doesnt let go
a tug of war ensues until a snake wiggles out from indys shirtsleeve and wraps around roscoes hand
roscoe screams bloody murderreleases his grip on the cross and tries to shake off the snake
this is all the opportunity indy needs
he leaps onto dont let him get awayl indy swings down to the caboose
he sees a sign above the caboose door reading magic
he glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose stepping inside
fedora puts out his arm gesturing for the others not to follow indy
make sure he doesnt double back
which contains the circus magic equipment
indy rushes to the rear door of the caboose but cant open it
he hears fedora coming and dives into a magic okay kid
out of the box
fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box
the box unexpectedly collapses all four sides flop away
indy has completely vanished
fedora is mystified frustrated and angered
then he feels a breeze at his back
he turns and discovers that the caboose door is open
he rushes out onto the balcony and sees indy running along the tracks turning up a street of modest clapboard houses
as indy runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name jones painted on the mailbox
indy bursts through the front door holding the cross in his hand
a husky barks as indy runs past in search of his father
indy charges in
the study is cluttered with books
pictures charts and maps clearly reflect the fathers passion for medieval studies
professor henry jones is absorbed at his desk
in fact he is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk
the page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained glass window
the sketch incorporates a series of roman numerals
the professor is not just studying it he is copying it into his own notebook
we never get to see the professors face in this scene
so indy charges in
then waitcount to twenty
you listen to me now he shouts junior
no question who is the boss here
indy gulps his look says what am i going to do with this guy
and obeys starts counting very very faintly
one two three four
now we see what henry is concentrating on
we see his hand sketching then he holds up one finger
indys reaction louder in greek one
an ancient car is heard arriving
perhaps indy glimpses it going past the window
anyway it stops outside the house
two men sit in the front seat
herman sits in the rear blowing a trumpet
indys reaction trouble
henry is just finishing the sketch
may he who illuminated this
the study door is just closing indy closing it behind him
just as herman comes through the front door still playing the trumpet
indy reaches for the trumpet pulling it from hermans mouth
herman continues to spitright into indys face
i brought the sheriff
herman means the sheriff who now enters the house
just the man i want to see
now there were five or six of them
interrupting all right son
overlapping they came after
you still got it
well yes sir
its right here
indy shows the cross more or less handing it to the sheriff to make his point
the sheriff takes it casually
im glad to see that
because the rightful owner of this cross wont press charges if you give it back
fedora enters the house followed by roscoe rough rider and halfbreed
he politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand
he nods at indy in a friendly manner
hes got witnesses five or six of them
the sheriff and fedora are in cahoots the sheriff hands the cross to fedora
roscoe reaches in and takes it from fedora then runs out the door
as roscoe runs outside indy seesthrough the screen doorthe man in the panama hat waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front
roscoe approaches and gives the man the crossthe man hands roscoe some money in exchange
the sheriff tips his hat and leaves
fedora remains behind for a moment
he turns and speaks to indy in an ironic man to man way
you lost today kid but that doesnt mean you have to like it
then fedora takes off his hat and takes a step towards indy
he holds the hat by the crown and puts it on indys head a show of respect and admiration for the boy
the hat blocks indys face
the hat brim fills the screen
as the brim tilts up we see the face of full and
hes punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back
small world doctor jones
too small for two of us
the man in the panama hat years older now removes the cross of coronado from indys belt
this is the second time ive had to reclaim my property from you that belongs in a museum so do you
he moves his eyeline throw him over the side
rain pours down
were in the middle of a violent storm at sea
thirty foot waves crash across the deck
the two portuguese sailors who have indys arms pinned behind his back propel indy across the deck toward the rail
as they pass a bundle of fuel drums indy uses the two sailors as leverage to kick up his feet and break open the clamp on the metal bands that
hold the drums together
indy jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled sailors and rushes toward the man in the panama hat
panama hat sees indy coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge
indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where panama hat is climbing the ladder
he pulls him off the ladder from behind the two men fall down on the deck
indy takes the cross back from panama hat
a sailor delivers a powerful blow to indys face sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck
indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides
indy sees that the cross is about to be swept overboard
he lunges for it
he snatches up the cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave
he struggles to his feet managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him
several more drums come indys way
he sidesteps them all
grab him hes getting away
indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch
indy sees a large stevedores hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it
he grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him
he jumps into the rollicking ocean still holding onto the cross
on the ship a giant fuel drum rolls wildly falling directly onto a crate of tnt
the crate explodes causing the entire ship to blow sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky
as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain
in the water amid the debris holding the cross in his hand
he grabs for something to keep him afloat
it turns out to be one of the ships life preservers
indy loops his arm through the preserver
only now do we see the faded lettering on the preserver revealing the destroyed ships name and city of port vazquez de coronado a shredded panama hat floats past
students walk along brick tree lined paths
indy dressed in professorial tweeds stands before his class
he turns to the blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word fact
the search for fact
if its truth youre interested in doctor tyrees philosophy class is right down the hall
so forget any ideas youve got about lost cities exotic travel and digging up the world
eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and x never ever marks the spot
marcus brody approaches indys classroom
he peers through the window in the door to see indy completing his lecture
seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library
brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room
we cannot afford to take mythology at face value
the bell rings
indy stands at his desk as students begin to disperse
a pretty coed puts a note on the desk
next week egyptology
starting with the excavation of naukratis by blinders petrie in
i will be in my office if anybodys got any problems for the next hour and a half
brody approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall
slaps his pocket i did it
youve got itl indy removes the cloth wrapped cross from his desk
he places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as brody examines the cross
you know how long ive been looking for that
all your life
all my life
well done indy
very well done indeed this will find a place of honor in our spanish collection
indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door
we can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight
he turns back toward brody now holding the cross
bursting with students all competing for his attention at once professor jones
doctor jonesl etc
shushl indy shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary an overwhelmed teaching assistant named irene
im so glad youre back
your mail is on your desk
here are your phone messages
doctor jones you promised
doctor jones this is your appointment schedule
and these term papers still havent been graded
indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his private office
students once again clamor for his attention doctor jones
wait doctor jonesl my grade
sign my registration card
indy silences the mob with a raised hand
very efficiently okay
irene put everyones name on a list in the order they arrived and ill see each and every one of them in turn
the students descend upon poor irene each claiming to be first
indy slips into his where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it
softly reading venice italy
then indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets goes to the window slides it open and steps out into the garden
indy escapes through the garden
indy walks briskly toward the street smiling eruoying his freedom
as he arrives at the curb a long black packard sedan pulls up before him
doctor jonesl three men step out of the sedan
everything about them bespeaks g man
the first man steps behind indy
indy is ushered into a large art deco apartment and left alone
numerous museum quality artifacts are displayed around the room
indy takes this opportunity to examine them
after a moment walter donovan enters from across the room
during the brief time that the door is open we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room voices and soft piano music
donovan strides across the room toward indy
although in his late fifties donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man
dressed in a tuxedo he exudes both confidence and power
i trust your trip down was comfortable doctor jones
my men didnt alarm you i hope
he shakes hands with indy
my name is donovan
i know who you are mr
your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous
some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive
well like yourself doctor jones i have a passion for antiquities
beat have a look over here
this might interest you
donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth
he throws back the cloth revealing a flat stone tabletabout two feet square inscribed with letters and symbols
indy looks impressed
he puts on his glasses to make a closer examination
well its sandstone
early latin text
mid twelfth century i should think
that was our assessment as well
where did this come from
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper
beat can you translate the inscription
translating the inscription is no easy matter even for someone as knowledgeable as indy
stumbling through it
who drinks the water i shall give him says the lord will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life
let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell
donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as indy reads
across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon to the temple where the cup that suddenly indy stops and looks up at donovan with
a startled expression
where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever
reverently the holy grail doctor jones
the chalice used by christ during the last supper
the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea
indy rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne donovan now offers him
the arthur legend
ive heard this bedtime story before
eternal life doctor jones
the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail
beat oh now thats a bedtime story id like to wake up to
an old mans dream
every mans dream
beat including your fathers i believe
indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father nods
grail lore is his hobby
hes a teacher of medieval literature
the one the students hope they dont get
the door opens and mrs
donovan steps into the room
shes a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown
walter youre neglecting our guests
be along in a moment dear
he leans over and kisses her cheek
donovan sighs to herself and returns to the party
indy meanwhile has turned his attention back to the grail tablet obviously hooked by its archaeological promise
he moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet
donovan steps up next to indy
hard to resist isnt it
the holy grails final resting place described in detail
what good is it
this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons
where do you start looking
maybe if the tablet were intact youd have something to go on
but the entire top portion is missing
just the same an attempt to recover the grail is currently underway
indy has to shake his head at donovans apparent lack of judgment
let me tell you another bedtime story doctor jones
after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade
three brothers to be exact
ive heard this one as well
two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france
but only one of them made it
and before dying of extreme old age he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a franciscan friar i think
not supposedly doctor jones
donovan produces an ancient leather bound volume with very brittle pages
indy views the manuscript with considerable interest
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knights story
it doesnt reveal on location of the grail im afraid
but the knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would
indicates the tablet this tablet is one of those markers
it proves the knights story is true
but as you pointed outits incomplete
beat now the second marker is entombed with the knights dead brother
our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice italy
beat as you can now see doctor jones were about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago
were only one step away
thats usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet
you could be more right than you know
weve hit a snag
our project leader has vanished
along with all his research
uh we received a cable from his colleague doctor schneider who has no idea of his whereabouts or whats become of him
beat i want you to pick up the trail where he left off
find the man and you will find the grail
youve got the wrong jones mister donovan
why dont you try my father
after a pause we already have
your father is the man whos disappeared
a ford coupe speeds down the tree lined street
the ford coupe pulls up in front of the house
indy climbs from the car and hurries up the walkway
brody is a step behind
your father and i have been friends since time began
ive watched you grow up indy
and ive watched the two of you grow apart
beat ive never seen you this concerned about him before
they climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar
they exchange a quick look of concern as they enter
indy approaches the half open front door
to brody hes an academic a bookworm
hes not a field mans he pushes open the door
he enters the house and calls out
indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room
we see the place has been ransacked
brody sees indys face and opens the other half
they walk into the room
what has the old fool got himself into now
i dont know
but whatever it is hes in over his head
brody picks up some mail from henrys cluttered desk
its todays mail
and its been opened
indy turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes
then something hits him
thats it marcus
he immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the venice postmark
as he tears it open venice italy
what is it
indy uncovers a small book
it looks like a journal or diary
indy flips through it page after page of handwritten notes and drawings
brody glances at it with great curiosity
its dads grail diary
every clue he ever followed
every discovery he made
a complete record of his search for the holy grail
this is his whole life
why would he have sent this to me
i dont know
but someone must want it pretty badly
do you believe marcus
as indy asks the question he turns to a painting on the wall a depiction of christ on the cross his blood being captured in a golden chalice
a second painting on the wall shows eleventh century crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff
one crusader however floats safely in midair because he holds the grail in his hands
do you believe the grail actually exists
the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us
brody sees that indy is unsatisfied by this response
but if you want facts indy i have none to give you
at my age im prepared to take a few things on faith
call donovan marcus
tell him ill take that ticket to venice now
ill tell him well take two
a limo is parked beside a private airliner that bears the donovan corporate logo
brody peers inside to donovan and indy
tell me whats going to happen when we get to venice
overlapping dont worry
doctor schneider will be there to meet you
overlapping i maintain an apartment in venice at your disposal
brody and donovan shake hands
indy steps from the back seat of the limo
he turns back to donovan and shakes his hand
be very careful
dont trust anvbody
indy opens the grail diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages
he stops at one page and glances at a pencil sketch of what might be a stained glass window
below the sketch is a series of numbers
superimposed over a map that traces a course from new york city to venice italy
indy and brody disembark from the water bus onto the boat landing as other gondoliers steer their boats in the water
uh how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him
i dont know
maybe hell know us
suddenly a woman comes up to him
eyes that are bright and intelligent
i knew it was you she looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious
you have your fathers eyes
indy is instantly attracted to her
and my mothers ears
but the rest belongs to you
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for
indy grins enjoying the repartee
the woman turns to brody who tips his hat
the woman dr
elsa schneider extends her hand to brody
introducing herself doctor elsa schneider
indys grin fades
brody registers a look of surprise
how do you do
indy brody and elsa walk along the narrow canal lined with buildings on either side
the last time i saw your father we were in the library
he was very close to tracking down the knights tomb
ive never seen him so excited
he was as giddy as a schoolboy
attila the professor
he was never giddy even when he was a schoolboy
indy cant take his eyes off elsa
perhaps hes feeling a bit like a schoolboy himself right now
as they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal indy steals a flower from a street vendor
he holds it out to elsa
frauleinwill you permit me
i usually dont
i usually dont either
in that case i permit you
indy gives her the flower
it would make me very happy
but im already sadby tomorrow it will have faded
tomorrow ill steal you another
cutting in i hate to interrupt youbut the reason were here interrupting yes
i have something to show you
she hands a slip of paper to indy
i left your father working in the library
he sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city
when i got back to his tablehed gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which i found near his chair
indy extends the scrap of paper to brody
elsa leads indy and brody into the large piazza
people walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building
here is the library
they have arrived at the front steps of the library
that doesnt look much like a library
it looks like a converted church
elsa leads the way inside
indy brody and elsa enter their heels clicking across the marble floor
we notice along with indy and brody that the library contains many stained glass windows
in this case its the literal truth
were on holy ground
these columns over here
she indicates four huge marble columns that go from floor to ceiling
were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of byzantium during the crusades
indy glances at the columns then notices a stained glass window that depicts a knight of the crusades
indy lingers for a moment in front of the window
now please excuse me
the librarys closing in a few moments
ill arrange for us to stay a little longer
the minute elsa is out of earshot
marcusive seen this window before
indy whips out the grail diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane
in dads diary
brody glances at the diary then at the windownoticing that the roman numerals in question have been worked into the windows design
the roman numerals
dad was onto something here
well now we know the source of the numbers but we still dont know what they mean
indy and brody now see elsa approaching
indy quickly tucks the diary back into his pocket
explaining to brody my dad sent me this diary for a reason
until we find out why i suggest we keep it to ourselves
indy doesnt reply
hes looking in five directions at once
his eyes moving across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery
to elsa uh yes
three seven and tent that window seems to be the source of the roman numerals
my god i must be blind dad wasnt looking for a book about the knights tomb
he was looking for the tomb itself elsa wears a blank expression
dont you get it
the tomb is somewhere in the library
you said yourself it used to be a church
indys eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns
indy looks again to the stained glass window
indy has discovered that each column is numbered with a roman numeral
indy hurries away toward column vii
all brody and elsa can do now is try to keep up with him
he points again to the stained glass window
he looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands
now wheres the ten
look around for the ten
indy walks past aisles of book lined shelves
he stops turns then looks down
three seven and ten
he climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a loft and looks down at brody and elsa
the floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge x visible only from this higher angle
wryly to himself x marks the spot
indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the center tile where the two sides of the x intersect
he blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up but cannot
indy rushes past brody to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained glass window
indy raises the brass stand and timing his actions hits the tile precisely as the librarian stamps a book
the librarian regards the stamper curiously
indy continues to pound at the tile as the librarian resumes his stamping still puzzled by the sound echoing through the library
finally indy breaks the tile
as he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile a cold air and a wet rancid smell escape from the hole
you dont disappoint doctor jones
youre a great deal like your father
except hes lost and im not
lower me down
indy is impressed with elsas spirit and cooperates agreeablyholding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole
when her feet finally touch ground below indy releases his grip on her and slips the grail diary to brody
look after this for me will you
then indy disappears into the hole
indy jumps down a steep step
he reaches back to help elsa
indy and elsa glance around
this is really a horrid place
dark and dank
she removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four leaf clover design
indy and elsa inspect markings carved onto the walls
fourth or fifth century
six hundred years before the crusades
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later
indy takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway
if theres a knight of the first crusade entombed down here thats where well find him
three men carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting brody
one of the men kazim raises his gun and brings it down hard on brodys head
kazim gestures with his gun toward the now unconscious brody
the other two men take brodys hands and drag him into one of the book lined aisles
decomposing corpses rest in niches carved into the stone walls
grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones
indy holds the lighter up as he and elsa inspect symbols carved into the walls
elsa spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesnt recognize
as she blows away some cobwebs whats this one
indy only has to give it a quick glance to know
the ark of the covenant
are you sure
deadpan pretty sure
indy holds the lighter up and he and elsa enter another dark passageway
indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone
he scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the roman numeral x
elsa now holds the lighter as indy rams his shoulder into the wall
the wall collapses on impact and indy falls through into another room
as indy falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling green slimy liquid
more skeletons surround him resting in their carved niches
elsa holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall
i could sink a well down here and retire
indy reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons which breaks apart and falls into the oil slick water
indy uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch which he then dips into the oily water
give me the lighter
using the cloth wrapped bone torch to guide their way indy and elsa come upon a narrow passageway
the water is knee deep and teeming with rats
thousands of them crawling on one anothers backs
thrashing in the water
elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs
indy moves forward through the rat infested water as elsa follows still gasping in horror
suddenly he slips into a hole
recovering his balance he reaches out to elsa
come onl she gasps once again terrified
indy lifts her and carries elsa as he moves forward
kazim and his men step to the opening indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat infested water
more rat infested water as elsa now walking again follows indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones
indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton
a bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions
he takes a moment to compose himself then steps across the water to elsas side
he steps into the water then reaches up to help elsa do the same
the chamber is flooded with black briny water
in the center of the chamber jutting up above the water is what amounts to an island altar on which several ancient coffins rest
they move toward the altar
indy and elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are
these are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass
it must be one of these
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork
one coffin is elevated above the others
its this one
together they begin to push on the lidstraining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform
lie the decomposed remains of a knight in armor
indy and elsa look in
this is itl we found it
look the engraving on the shield
its the same as on the grail tablets the shield is the second marker
indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield
its a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet
the missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield
just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy
wouldnt it be wonderful if he were here now to see this
chuckles he never would have made it past the rats
he hates rats
hes scared to death of them
as it lights a match
pull back to reveal kazim dropping the lighted match into the oil slick water
elsa holds the torch
indy looks around
something is wrong
and then he sees the glow of firelight dancing across the catacomb walls
this is followed by thousands of rats fleeing from around the corner of the narrow passageway stampeding toward elsa and indyshrieking and squealing as they approach
the rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a roaring around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick consuming the oxygen
back against the wall
indy braces his back against the altar and topples the coffin with his feet
it crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the water
they jump into the water beside the bobbing overturned coffin
indy literally dunks her and pushes her underneath
elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin sputtering and now indy pops up into the air pocket
he looks at elsathey are both soaking wet
dont wander off
indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin
indy swims looking for an escape route
the rats are beginning to force their way inside swimming through the water and climbing on elsa who squirms and screams in terror
indy pops back up through the water
i think ive found a way out
they take a deep breath and both dive under the water
the perfect picture postcardst
marks square and the grand canal beyond
cafe customers are startled to see indy and elsa climb out of the sewer wet and smelly
indy looks around at the postcard perfect setting and smiles
wryly ah venicel indys delight however is short lived since kazim and two other turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns
he grabs elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and leap indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock
but not before a turkish agent jumps in with him
elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while indy and the turk trade punches
indys speedboat bounces across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the docked steamship
kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock
they chase after indy
indy grapples with the turkish agent
as indy grips his arms we see a gun in the agents hand
as indy fights with the turk he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him joined together by two giant ropes
indy having gained the advantage leans on top of the turkish agent
to elsa are you crazy
you dont go between them
elsa can barely hear indy over the noise of the motor
go between them
are you crazy
indy finally delivers the punch that sends the turkish agent flying overboard
turning indy sees that elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat
i said go around
you said go between them
i said dont go between them
its purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls
one enemy speedboat chases indy between the two freighters
but the speedboat containing kazim veers off and goes around
its a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another
indys speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap
but the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters flying into the air and splashing back down into the water
spin their boat around in a sharp half circle to see kazims speedboat appear racing toward them
he stands in the moving boat firing a machine gun at indy and elsa
matches indys move for move
the two boats race across the water nearly side by side
a chattering machine gun from kazims boat splinters the wood of indys boat until finally the rear of the boat catches on fire
the machine gun runs out of ammunition
kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the turkish agents in the boat with him
as indys boat drifts toward the giant turning propellers at the stern of another steamer kazims boat draws up alongside and hits them
indy steps into kazims boat
he knocks one of the turkish agents to the deck then turns his attention to kazim
the two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water
indy kicks kazim in the face knocking him into the water then pulls him back into the boat now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamers giant propeller
why are you trying to kill us
because youre looking for the holy grail
my father was looking for the holy grail
did you kill him too
where is he
talkor youre dead
damn it tell me
if you dont let go doctor jones well both die
then well die
my soul is prepared
by now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer
this is your last chance
no doctor jones
the wind of the blades is on their necks
indy grabs kazim just in time and jumps
into the motorboat driven by elsa which gets alongside in the nick of time
wheres my father if you let me go i will tell you where he is
who are you
my name is kazim
and why were you trying to kill me
the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years
and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe
kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark
or is it a tattoo
whatever it is its a cruciform sword a christian cross which tapers down like the blades of a broadsword
let me get off at this jetty
the boat is close to the edge of the canal
indy gives elsa a nod telling her to bring the boat in
kazim steps ashore
ask yourself why do you seek the cup of christ
is it for his glory or for yours
i didnt come for the cup of christ
i came to find my father
in that case god be with you in your quest
your father is being held in the castle of brunwald on the austrian german border
kazim walks away
close on the water soaked paper impression the rubbing taken from the shield of the grail knight
brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack
hows the head
its better now ive seen this
its the name of a city
indy wearing a bathrobe leans over to study the impression
the knights of the first crusade laid siege to the city of alexandretta for over a year
the entire city was destroyed
brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at indy
the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins
marcus you remember what the grail tablet said
across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon
pause but where exactly
your father would know
your father did know
he made a map
brody picks up the grail diary
he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the grail quest
a map with no names
it covers two pages of the diary
brodys finger moves across it
now he knew there was a city with an oasis due east
he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river and the river led into the mountains
straight to the canyon
he knew everything except where to begin the name of the city
now we know
now we know
rising marcus get hold of sallah
tell him to meet you in iskenderun
indy closes the grail diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe
what about you
im going after dad
indy opens the door
his bedroom has been ransacked
the mattress on the floor the drawers turned out
indy approaches another door elsas bedroom and knocks
he goes in
and finds that elsas bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own
the room is empty
he is worried for her knocks and calls out elsa
he steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door
he opens the bathroom door peering inside
elsa is standing before a mirror wearing a silk bathrobe
she gasps startled as indy enters
he retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub
elsa joins indy waiting in the ransacked room
she looks around in shock
what were they looking for
she looks to indy who pulls the grail diary from his pocket
the grail diary
you had it
you didnt trust me
she looks hurt and beautiful
she comes closer to him
i didnt know you
shes awfully hard to resist
at least i let you tag along
give them a flower and theyll follow you anywhere
knock it off
youre not mad
you like the way i do things
its lucky i dont do things the same way
youd still be standing at the venice pier
she stomps her foot angrily
she starts to walk away but indy grabs her
look what do you think is going on here
since ive met you ive nearly been incinerated drowned shot at and chopped into fish bait
were caught in the middle of something sinister here
my guess is dad found out more than he was looking for
and until im sure im going to continue to do things the way i think they should be done
he pulls her to him and kisses her
how dare you kiss me
now elsa reaches for indy and kisses him
leave me alone
i dont like fast women
but he embraces her and elsa begins to nibble at his ear
and i hate arrogant men
indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed
a gondolier sings as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past indys window
indy lies on top of elsa kissing her
he stops for a moment as he hears the ahh venice
elsa reaches up and pulls him back down to her
a mercedes benz glides through the sharp mountain curves
this is superimposed over a map that charts their course from venice across austria toward salzburg
storm clouds darken the skies
thunder explodes in the distance lightning flashes
the mercedes benz drives into the courtyard of the formidable stone castle
what do you know about this place
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors
indy reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip
what are you going to do
think of something
he glances up to the beret elsa is wearing
she reaches up and adjusts it
a butler walks to the door and opens it to reveal indy and elsa standing outside in the rain
she now wears indys fedora indy is wearing elsas beret
indy followed by elsa steps inside shaking the water from his overcoat
he adopts a scottish accent
and not before time
did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day
as indy says this he pushes his way past the startled butler pulling a handkerchief from the mans pocket
elsa follows taking off her coat
indy now look
ive gone and caught a sniffle
indy dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as elsa looks on in amused amazement
coldly with austrian accent are you expected
dont take that tone with me my good man
now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries
dear me the man is dense
this is a castle isnt it
there are tapestries
this is a castle
and we have many tapestries
but if youre a scottish lord then i am mickey mouse
how dare he
simultaneously knocking the butler cold with one slug on the jaw
the butler falls against a wall tapestry sliding down to the floor out cold
indy and elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide vaulted hallway
approaching voices are heard
indy and elsa creep past a room full of nazi soldiers working around a large table with a map atop it
indy reacts to the sight of them
to elsa softly nazis
i hate these guys
indy and elsa continue down the hallway
indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt
he steps to a closed door and listens
i think hes in here
how do you know
indy points out an electrical wire
because its wired
he studies the situation for a moment then decides to enter one of the other doors
he knocks at the doorthere is no response
he looks back at elsa and enters
the room is dark and empty
indy throws open the window shutters and looks out
rain comes down in sheets
there is a wide ledge beneath each window but below that is a sheer drop
indy wants to get out onto the window ledge which is several yards away
indy reassures her
this is kids play
ill be right back
he leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window
he gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight
indy swings from the window to the stone gargoyle
a pair of wooden shutters seals the window
indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands pushes off with his feet
swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended
crashing through the wooden shutters as a clap of thunder disguises the noise
indy crashes through shutters and glass into the room
the broken shutters hang by their hinges
rain and cold air whip through the open window
no sooner does indy get to his feet than a vase comes crashing down on stunned indy sinks to one knee
and indys father professor henry jones steps out of the shadows
indy gets to his feet
a reflex yes sirl this reply is a kneejerk reaction on indys part
now they look at each other
it is you junior
an old familiar irritation dont call me that please
amazed but what are you doing here
i came to get you
what do you think
nazi voices are heard approaching
indy and henry press themselves against the wall henry still holding the broken vase in his hand
indy steps to the window and looks down
henry moves to a lamp holding the vase under the light for a closer look
sotto mumbled late fourteenth century ming dynasty
henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand
father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments
oh it breaks the heart
quietly to himself and the head
to henry aggrievedly you hit me dad
referring to the vase ill never forgive myself surprised misunderstanding dont worryim fine
henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase
he is examining the broken end carefully
see you can tell by the cross section
henry throws the vase against the wall where it shatters
dad get your stuff
weve got to get out of here
well i am sorry about your head though
but i thought you were one of them
dad they come in through the doors
laughs good point
indy steps to the door and stands listening
but better safe than sorry
henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag
humpfso i was wrong this time
but by god i wasnt wrong when i mailed you my diary
you obviously got it
i got it and i used it
we found the entrance to the catacombs
excited through the library
i knew it
and the tomb of sir richard
breathless he was actually there
you saw him
well what was left of him
trembling with anticipation and his shield
the inscription on sir richards shield
beat its a great moment in henrys life
he turns aside lost to himself for a moment then turns to indy with joy
on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire
indy winces and would interrupt but suddenly its not the moment
you did it
if only i could have been with you
there were rats dad
what do the nazis want with you dad
they want my diary
indys interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes
i knew i had to get that book as far away from me as i possibly could
indys hand moves unconsciously to his pocket
his eyes turn inward
bami the door is kicked open and three nazis enter
one is an s
the other two are soldiers with machine guns
henry and indy raise their hands
i will take the book now
simultaneously what book
to indy you have the diary in your pocket
henry laughs genuinely believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the you doltl do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my
diary all the way back here
at which point an awful thought strikes henry
you didnt did you
a beat you didnt bring it did you
look can we discuss this later
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers
overlapping will you take it easy
take it easy
why do you think i sent it home in the first place
points towards the nazis so it wouldnt fall into their hands
i came here to save you
and whos gonna come to save you junior
indys eyes blazes his nostrils flares hes so pissed off he literally rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers
and for a moment we think hes going to use it on his dad
i told you he turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire cutting all three nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room
dont call me junior
henry looks shocked and horrified
look what you did
indy grabs him and pushes him ahead
aghast i cant believe what you just
indy leads henry down the hallway as he searches for elsa
he opens a door and enters indy and henry rush back into the room where elsa had been left only to find a nazi colonel holding elsa hostage
his name is vogel a vicious looking lantern jawed brute
one arm is wrapped around elsas waist the other hand presses the muzzle of a luger behind her ear
thats far enough put down the gun doctor jones
put down the gun or the fraulein dies
but shes one of them
shes a nazi
indy is thrown
he doesnt know what to do
he looks at elsa then back to his father
everyone is yelling at once trust me
i will kill her
to indy dont worry
do what he says
and dont listen to her
she diesl vogel jams the barrel of the luger painfully into elsas neck
waitl and then indy gives in
he drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across shattering glass
henry groans audibly
vogel releases his grip on elsa and shoves her toward indy
she is propelled directly into his arms
he holds her tightly
she buries her face in his chest
indy comforts her
no dont be
her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the grail diary
but you should have listened to your father
she steps back next to vogel
indy is stunned
henry gives him his most withering look of reprimand
a large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor
firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls
indy and henry are ushered in hands tied behind back accompanied by vogel and elsa and two nazi guards
elsa crosses the room toward a high backed chair facing the fireplace
indy and henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair
they only see a hand reach out and take the book
quietly to henry she ransacked her own room and i fell for it
how did you know she was a nazi
how did you she was a nazi
she talks in her sleep
indy nods and then the statement catches up with him
he looks at henry with surprise
i didnt trust her
why did you
because he didnt take my advice
the man in the chair gets to his feet and turns revealing himself to be
indy and henry react with stunned expressions
donovan didnt i warn you not to trust anybody doctor jones
donovan smiles benignly and flips through the grail diary
i misjudged you walteri knew youd sell your mother for an etruscan vase
but i didnt know youd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity
suddenly erupting doctor schneider therere pages torn out of thisl elsa rushes to donovans side
she takes the grail diary from him
elsa takes a look for herselfthen glances up at indy
this book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon
so it did
where are these missing pages
this maps we must have these pages backs henry gives indy a look of surprise
to donovan youre wasting your breath
he wont tell us
and he doesnt have to
its perfectly obvious where the pages are
looking at indy hes given them to marcus brody
henry now wears a pained expression
to indy marcus
you didnt drag poor marcus along did you
hes not up to the challenge
he sticks out like a sore thumb
well find him
the hell you will
hes got a two day head start on you which is more than he needs
beat brodys got friends in every town and village from here to the sudan
he speaks a dozen languages knows every local custom
hell blend in
youll never see him again
with any luck hes got the grail already
henry looks amazed and impressed
brody disembarks from the train along with the other passengers a cross section of arabs and tusks
does anyone here speak english
or even ancient greek
a man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to brody
no water no thank you
no fish make love in it
brody continues through the crowd past various street vendors
a woman holds a chicken out to him
thank you so much
no i dont like that
no i really dont want
no no thank you very much
no thank you madam
im a vegetarian
the woman walks away leaving brody alone in the crowd
does anyone understand a word im saying here
sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward brody
mister brodyl they meet and hug then begin to walk
oh sallahl what a relief
laughs marcus brody sir
and where is indy
overlapping oh hes in austria
a slight detour
you are on your own
a woman runs in and tugs on brodys coat
he waves her away
yes but dont panic
everythings under control
have you arranged our supplies
oh yes of course
but where are we going
oh this map will show you
it was drawn by uh
brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a sinister man approaches
brody puts the map back in his pocket
the sinister man clicks his heels and bows quickly
welcome to iskenderun
the director of the museum of antiquities has sent a car for you
brody takes off his hat
your servant sir
and i am his
follow me please
the man turns and joins a second man
brody and sallah follow them
my reputation precedes me
there is no museum in iskenderun
the second man overhears sallah
he and his companion turn quickly
laughs of course
sallah puts brodys luggage down and glances at brody
brody does not run
sallah pats his clothing searching for his papers
got it here
sallah laughs and pulls out a newspaper
just finished reading it myself
laughs then to brody run
brody looks confused
sallah shows the newspaper to the second man
to brody run
did you say
sallah puts the newspaper in front of the second mans face then punches him through the newspaper
the second man falls knocking over a vendors stand
sallah and brody begin to run
sallah knocks the first man into another vendors stand
the stand collapses on impact
sallah grabs brody and pulls him through the crowded streets
to brody pointing okay okay quick quick quickl hide in that doorl hide in that door
sallah points to a darkened doorway hung with a curtain at the top of a ramp
brody runs up the ramp throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness
thenmetal doors are slammed behind brody and we realize that he has actually run into the back of a nazi troop truck
sallah runs after the truck until he reaches a wall then leans against the wall dejectedly as the truck drives away with brody inside
the room is dark
ancient floor length drapes cover the windows
a huge fireplace thats nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall
the nazi guards have tied indy and henry back to back in a pair of chairs
elsa and donovan stand over them
message from berlin
you must return immediately a rally at the institute of aryan culture
your presence on the platform is requested
at the highest level
thank you herr oberst
to donovan i will meet you at iskenderun
take this diary to the reich museum in berlin
it will show them our progress ahead of schedule
without a map im afraid its no better than a souvenir
he hands her the grail diary
to donovan meaning indy and henry let me kill them now
if we fail to recover the pages from brody well need them alive
to vogel with a helpless shrug always do what the doctor orders
donovan leads vogel out
the nazi guards follow
once they are gone elsa turns to indy
dont look at me like thatwe both wanted the grail i would have done anything to get it
you would have done the same
indy shakes his head no
im sorry you think so
she runs her hand down the side of his face
indy pulls away
indy and henry are still tied back to back of course
elsa bends to speak quietly into indys ear
which is near enough to henrys ear
whispers i cant forget
how wonderful it was
it was rather wonderful
she smiles and kisses indy passionately
henry glances back and looks rather disappointed
vogel appears to remind elsa of her appointment
your car is waiting
to indy after finishing the kiss thats how austrians say goodbye
vogel stays behind for another moment
and this is how we say goodbye in germany doctor jones
vogel punches indy in the jaw
a hard and vicious jab that snaps indys head around
indy shakes his head clear
to himself ooooh
i like the austrian way better
so did i
lets try and get these ropes loose
weve got to get to marcus before the nazis do
confused you said he had two days start
that he would blend in
are you kidding
i made that up
you know marcushe got lost once in his own museum
indy and henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency
can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket
henry is able to wiggle his hand towards indys coat pocket
indy squirms his body around towards henrys hand
what am i looking for
my lucky charm
feels like a cigarette lighter
try and burn through the ropes
henrys fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame
henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand
he drops the lighter to the floor
henry kicks at the lighter trying to reach it but cannot
the rug starts to burn
indy doesnt know it yet
i ought to tell you something
dont get sentimental now dad save it til we get out of here
the floors on fire
turns and sees what
and the chair
all right movel move
rock your chair
do what i do
they begin to rock their chair legs inching their way off the burning carpet
as elsa is driven away
vogel and donovan remain behind flanked by nazi another car pulls up and vogel holds the door open for donovan who gets into the rear seat
a lieutenant approaches with a written message for donovan
etwas wichtig mein herr
donovan puts on his glasses to read the message
well we have marcus brody
but more important we have the map
a radio operator steps forward with yet another written message for aus berlin mein herr
reading by the personal command of the fuhrer
secrecy essential to success
eliminate the american conspirators
to vogel germany has declared war on the jones boys
to driver los fahren
the car drives off
indy and henry are still in their chairs tied back to back
indy tries to communicate with henry but each time he calls him the men turn their heads in opposite directions
finally they turn their heads in the same direction
head for the fireplace
banging rocking and hopping their chairs they work their way into the fireplacethe only safe place from the now roaring fire
i think i can get these ropes off
indy struggles to free his hands
his foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a secret door
whoopsl the fireplace floor rotates like a lazy susan and indy and his father find themselves in the where a nazi radioman wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of
dials switches and meters and a woman stands over a map plotting coordinates
their backs are turned to indy and henry
the floor begins to rotate again and indy and henry find themselves back in inside the fireplace still tied back to back
our situation has not improved
indy glances over his shoulder at henry
im almost free
indys foot hits the grill again
and the fireplace rotates to four nazi radiomen and the woman are still hard at work with controls and coordinates
suddenly the woman looks up and spots henry and indy
now the radiomen turn to see henry and indy
two nazis draw their revolvers and fire several shots at indy and henry indy and henry rotate into the room which is now an inferno
the carpet drapes and furniture are all ablaze
this is intolerable
im out dad
indy finally breaks free
and he immediately begins to untie his father
well done boy
all four radiomen now have their guns drawn
they activate the lever and begin to rotate through the secret door
the radiomen appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is no sign the radiomen move cautiously toward the flame shielding their faces with one hand holding their guns
with the other
is it possible that indy and henry escaped through these flames
not a chance
theyve hidden themselves up the chimney
and now they drop down behind the radiomen
one of the radiomen grabs indy by the neck
as they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room leaving a frightened henry behind
henry presses against the wall which rotates again
as he disappears into the next room a dead nazi radioman swivels into the room
the other nazis rush forward to him
indy picks up a bust of hitler and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place sealing the nazis inside the burning room
vogel strides purposefully down the hallway
he barks an order and two more nazis fall into step with him
indy grabs his whip his leather sack and henrys case from a table
he hands the case to henry and they begin to run
come on dad
indy and henry step into an empty room
henry looks horrified by what hes been forced to do as indy searches frantically for an exit
theres got to be a
a secret door around
a passageway or something
indy begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic
i find that if i just sit down and think
henry sits on a chair which tips back hitting the wall behind it
the floor at indys feet suddenly begins dropping awayi indy grabs a railing to keep from falling but loses his grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a
he rolls down the stairs
the solution presents itself
henry follows indy down the staircase
the stairway deposits indy and henry into an enormous watery cavern beneath the mountain on which the castle was built
a full scale nazi boat dock has been built inside the cavern
we see motorboats gunboats supply boats etc
indy boards one of the motorboats and starts the motor
would you say this has been just another typical day for you
henry tosses his case at indy who catches it and angrily throws it back to his father
ironically ooofl no
its been better than most
indy moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away
henry looks confused
come on dad
come onl what about the boat
were not going on the boat
vogel and the nazi soldiers enter the room and spot the spiral staircase leading below
they quickly descend the stairs
as vogel and the nazi soldiers rush to the dock
vogel sees that a motorboat is missing
he orders the nazi soldiers into a boat
sie alle ins boat
camera pulls back to reveal a large box which suddenly breaks apart as indy now on a motorbike with henry in the sidecar roars past the dock hitting two nazi
soldiers who scream as they fall into the river
vogel screams after indy and henry as they drive off
indy looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road but henry appears worried
they chase down the road after indy and henry
indy turns the motorbike down a smaller dusty tree lined road
henry gasps as he is jostled about in the sidecar
one of the nazi soldiers gives chase along a higher road running in the same direction
indy approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the nazi soldiers approaches from a higher road
a guard steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as indy and halt
the nazi soldier rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier indy grabs at a flagpole as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand
the nazi soldier drives his motorcycle toward indy and henry
he unshoulders his machine gun
indy uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the nazi soldier from his motorcycle
drives on toward the other nazi soldiers now approaching the guardhouse the remaining nazi soldier maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen comrades and continues the chase
as the remaining nazi soldier rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun preparing to fire
indy quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the nazis front wheel
the nazi soldiers motorcycle flips three times throwing him high into the air
indy glances back and smiles but the smile fades as he looks forward again to see a sign at a crossroad
arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to berlin or venedig
indy starts down the road marked venedig
the motorbike skids to a stop
youre going the wrong way
we have to get to berlin
pointing towards venedig brodys this way
my diarys in berlin
you dont need the diary dad
marcus has the map
there is more in the diary than just the map
all right dadtell me
well he who finds the grail must face the final challenge
what final challenge
three devices of such lethal cunning
but i found the clues that will safely take us through in the chronicles of st
but what are they
cant you remember
i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldnt have to remember half the german armys on our tail and you want me to go to berlin
into the lions den
the only thing that matters is the grail
what about marcus
marcus would agree with me
two selfless martyrs
jesus christl henry slaps him across the face
indy is rocked to his foundations not by any means entirely by the blow itself
thats for blasphemy
the quest for the grail is not archaeology
its a race against evil
if it is captured by the nazis the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth
do you understand me
this is an obsession dad
i never understood it
neither did mom
oh yes she did
only too well
unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her
arrows point in opposite directions to venice and berlin
the camera moves in on the portion of the sign reading berlin
a nazi rallya book burning is in process
the mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as college students and nazi brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire
flags banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd
indy and henry walk toward the square
indy wears the uniform of a nazi soldier
he is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes too big
my boy we are pilgrims in an unholy land
indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks
we pan along his line of sight to where high ranking officers of the third reich stand flanking adolf hitler as they oversee the rally
elsa is walking away in an open area background of torches vehicles nazi officers
one of whom is now none other than indy coming up to her before she knows he is there
his voice is quiet and tough his eyes hard
where is it
still startled her reaction makes it clear that indy is even now a lover in her thoughts
how did you get here
where is it
i want it
indy pushes elsa against a column and begins to search her clothing for the diary
he pulls the book from elsas pocket
you came back for the book
my father didnt want it incinerated
she understands him
its as though he slapped her
is that what you think of me
i believe in the grail not the swastika
vicious yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think
hard and fast you do
now its as though shed slapped him back
his hands fly to her neck
all i have to do is squeeze
all i have to do is scream
its a standoff emotionally
he knows hed never do it
she knows it too
and the same goes for screaming
indy releases her and backs away
she looks at him with a lovers pain
he moves over to henry
ive got it
lets get the hell out of here
they move off and almost run headlong into hitler and his entire entourage coming down from the podium
kids push their autograph books for hitlers signature
hitler pauses to sign them
hitler looks indys way
they make eye contact
it only lasts a moment but the moment is electric
hitler breaks the spell by taking the grail diary from him opens it to the first page and signs his autograph
he hands it back and moves on
indys motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal
a plainclothes agent distributes leaflets bearing henrys picture to nazi soldiers inside the terminal
henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as indy enters down the stairs and taps henrys shoulder
they begin to walk toward the boarding gates
what did you get
i dont know
the first available flight out of germany
indy and henry show their papers to the boarding guards then join the line of passengers which has already begun to move toward a ten stories tall and longer than
two football fields flying in the grand tradition
the zeppelin is about to take off
indy and henry make themselves comfortable in one of the compartments
well we made it
henry looks over his newspaper at indy
when were airborne with germany behind us then ill share that sentiment
but indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees rushing across the tarmac toward the zeppelin
wir steigen ein
sits back in his chair looks to henry now reading his newspaper
a steward enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of indy and henry then continues down the aisle of passengers
indy follows after the steward
he puts his arm around the stewards shoulder and together they walk up a flight of stairs
now walks up the aisle
he approaches a male passenger hidden behind a newspaper
vogel uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the passenger the leaflet with henrys photograph
haben sie disen mann gesehen
the passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative
vogel shows the picture to other passengers
vogel turns to see ich habe ihn night gesehen
the passengers do not react to the request made in english
fahrscheine meine dame
approaches henry still hidden behind his newspaper
again vogel uses his walking stick to lower the paper revealing henrys face
guten tag herr jones
now indy still playing the role of steward asks vogel for his ticket
fahrscheine meine herr
henry looks confused
in german was
vogel glances up and recognizes indywho quickly punches vogel in the face knocking him toward the window
in another quick move indy tosses him out the window onto the tarmac below
shocked passengers blink in bewilderment
in german with a shrug no ticket
everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in indys face
vogel gets to his knees as the huge zeppelin rises into the sky above him revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship
vogel shakes his fist at the rising zeppelin
du wirst nochmal boren von mir
indy and henry together again in their compartment
you know sharing your adventures is an interesting experience
meaning elsa thats not all we shared
youre old enough to be her fa er her grandfather
well im as human as the next man
i was the next man
laughs ships that pass in the night
henry opens his diary and begins to thumb through it
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink
i had a milk shake
what did we talk about
we didnt talk
we never talked
and do i detect a rebuke
it was just the two of us dad
it was a lonely way to grow up
for you too
if you had been an ordinary average father like the other guys dads youd have understood that
actually i was a wonderful father
henry looks up from his diary
did i ever tell you to eat up
go to bed
wash your ears
do your homework
i respected your privacy and i taught you self reliance
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country
and i learned it so well that weve hardly spoken for twenty years
you left just when you were becoming interesting
dad how can you
interrupting very well
im here now
he closes the diary and leans back in his seat
what do you want to talk about
indy stutters uncomfortably as henry stares at him waiting for a response
i cant think of anything
then what are you complaining about
laughs look we have work to do
when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges
he reads from the diary first the breath of god
only the penitent man will pass
second the word of god only in the footsteps of god will he proceed
third the path of god only in the leap from the lions head will he prove his worth
what does that mean
laughs i dont know
well find out
sunlight falls across the table from the window
indy reaches for the drink
the bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks
we see indy puzzled
only for a moment
theyre turning around
theyre taking us back to germany
indy and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the zeppelin
the zeppelins elaborate metal framework is exposed
indy and henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a pair of doorways framed into the zeppelins outer skin
well i thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead
come on dad
then indy opens the doors
we see plenty of blue sky and white clouds
we also see a small biplane that is suspended from the zeppelin by a hook crane come on dad
indy climbs into the cockpit of the biplane as henry takes the tail gunners seat
with delight i didnt know you could fly a plane
indy turns in his seat to give henry the thumbs up
henry smiles valiantly and points down to the ground
then they both become aware of a strange sound in the skies behind them
something between a roar and a wail
streak out of the clouds and race across the sky
shrink in their seats as the messerschmidts going three times as fast as they are scream past on either side
dad youre gonna have to use the machine gun
get it ready
henry turns and grips the mounted machine gun with a perplexed expression
turning pointing eleven oclock
henry pulls out his watch
what happens at eleven oclock
indy uses his arm to demonstrate that hes referring to a direction and not a time
henry doesand the exploding gun nearly shakes him out of his seat
indys slow speed and small size works to his advantage
the speeding messerschmidts continually overshoot him whizzing past in a blurmaking wide turns miles away in the sky
henry has one of the messerschmidts in his sight
he pulls back on the trigger the messerschmidt banks to the left but henry keeps it in his gun sight
henry swings the gun around inadvertently cutting his own rear stabilizer in dad are we hit
more or less
son im sorry
they got us
indy looks back at the missing tail section then at his father
the plane begins to go down
indy struggles to control its descent
hang on dads were going in
henry slumps down fearfully in his seat
the wheels of the plane touch down
out of control the plane skids and crashes first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air
as indy pulls himself from the cockpit sarcastic nice landing
suddenly indys attention is directed to coming in low
as bullets explode around them indy and henry jump over a stone barricade
henry frightened grabs at indy
those people are trying to kill us
i know dadl its a new experience for me
it happens to me all the time
an old man kneels at his car repairing a rear tire
turns to the wheel the hubcap in his hands
suddenly the wheel moves forward startling the old man
indy has the throttle down both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel
henry is a very nervous passenger
indy sees a low flying messerschmidt coming up behind him in the side as the messerschmidt roars by overhead bullets explode around them narrowly missing the car
this is intolerable
this could be close
the car races toward a tunnel that cuts through a steep mountainside
the messerschmidt bears down on indys car machine guns chattering
the car enters the tunnel
the messerschmidt cannot pull up in time
it slams into the mouth of the tunnel shearing off its wings
the flaming fuselage continues to rocket through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun
sparks fly as its belly scrapes against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel
indy and henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless ball of fire gaining on them about to overtake them
faster boy faster
the car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road
the flaming messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and explodes in the middle of the road
as the car emerges safely from the flames henry wipes the sweat from his brow
well they dont come any closer than that
henry looks out the windshield and sees the second messerschmidt screaming out of the sky toward them
the messerschmidt drops its single under fuselage bomb
it explodes in the road directly ahead of the car missing it by only several feet
falls into the hole made by the bomb
indy climbs out of the car still in the bomb crater
he turns back to henry
dad hes coming back
indy and henry run down the mountainside to indy and henry run to the shoreline
indy reaches for his gun tucked in his pants
he opens the chamberthe gun has no bullets
swings around and is coming in for another pass
exchange a wordless glance
they dont even think about running there is no place to run to
henry hands his case to indy
holding his umbrella henry suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into a flock of sea gulls
the sea gulls take to the wing in flight
thousands of them
bullets kick up sand leading up to him
then the messerschmidt and the sea gulls meet in midair
sea gulls are shredded by the messerschmidts whirling propeller blades into a feathery white puree that splatters against the cockpit and clogs the engine sputters
the messerschmidt falls from the skies and explodes in an off camera sound effect
indy stands as beforestunneda statue
henry walks back to indy
i suddenly remembered charlemagne
let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky
he chuckles indy wears a proud expression as he watches henry walk down the beach
the sultan is seated in his royal chair flanked by walter donovan and vogel and surrounded by his minions
donovan holds the missing grail diary pages
these pages are taken from professor jones diary your highness
and they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the grail
donovan and the sultan walk together through an archway
as you can see the grail is all but in our hands
beat however your highness we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission nor of removing the grail from your borders without suitable compensation
what have you brought
bring den schatzl two nazi soldiers bring forward a huge steamer trunk
they open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents gold and silver objects of every description
precious valuables your highness donated by some of the finest families in all of germany
the sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk
he goes right past it and begins to inspect the nazi staff car parked nearby
rolls royce phantom two
litre horsepower six cylinder engine with stromberg downdraft carburetor
the sultan points to the engine under the hood
can go from zero to kilometres an hour in
and i even like the color
after a beat the keys are in the ignition your highness
you shall have camels horses an armed escort provisions desert vehiclesand tanksl youre welcome
somebody else is also taking note
and we see that it is kazim the spy at the court
elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward donovan and vogel
we have no time to lose
indiana jones and his father have escaped
sallah drives his car through the crowded streets indy beside him and henry in the back seat
we go this way
sallah waves his arms and shouts to a camel herder
get that camel out of the way
what happened to marcus sallah
overlapping ah they set out across the desert this afternoon
i believe they took mister brody with them
henry removes his hat and hits indy with it
now they have the map
and in this sort of race theres no silver medal for finishing second
elsa and donovans partyconsisting of a supply truck open car tuhkish vehiclesall moving along through the ramble of this box canyon
elsa donovan and vogel travel in the open car
the tank is a vintage world war i model with enormous treads
the turkish soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers
brody sits alongside elsa in the rear of the car carrying donovan
donovan hands a canteen back to him
care to wet your whistle marcus
id rather spit in your face
but as i havent got any spit
vogel snatches the canteen away from brody before he can drink
we must be within three or four miles
otherwise we are off the map
he hands the map to elsa drinks from the canteen and hands that back to well marcus we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in
the history of mankind
youre meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend
henry and sallah are at indys side as he views donovans party in the distance
parked nearby is a car containing all of their supplies
ah i see brody
he seems okay
theyve got a tank
six pound gun
then donovan notices a reflection from the hills
what he sees is what do you think youre doing
dad were well out of range
at that moment the tank fires a shell in their direction
it whistles overhead and blows up the parked car
indy henry and sallah cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them
that car belonged to my brother in law
gesturing to the others come on come on
i cant see anyone up there
maybe it wasnt even jones
its him all right
hes here somewhere
to vogel put brody in the tank
kazim peers over a rock pointing his rifle at the group below
to elsa well in this sun without transportation theyre as good as dead
bullets explode off the vehicles and cliff
donovan and elsa duck
a nazi soldier falls from the tank as bullets explode around him
kazims men brethren of the cruciform sword continue to fire
elsa and donovan take cover beside the parked car
its jones all right
indy and henry followed by sallah take cover behind a rock to watch kazims men and the nazi troops exchanging fire below them
now who are all these people
as long as theyre keeping donovan busy
dad you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation
cut back to the action
the brethren are firing at the donovan party and are being fired on by the donovan party
two nazi soldiers throw hand grenades into the cliffs
they explode killing one of kazims brethren
the battle continuesa fierce exchange of gunshots grenades and machine gun fire with losses on both sides
crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses
im going after those horses
ill take the camels
i dont need camels
but indy no camels
they look down at kazim who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet
elsa looks saddened
re kazim who is he
a messenger from god
for the unrighteous the cup of life holds everlasting damnation
leaps atop a turkish soldier on horseback pulling the man and the horse to the ground
a second turk comes to assist his comrade indy mounts the horse knocking both turks to the ground
brody has been left alone in the tank
henry climbs down into the tank and taps brody on the shoulder startling him
they exchange an old university club toast swinging their arms at one another and missing
then henry flaps his arms and tugs his ears
genius of the restoration now brody tugs his ears flaps his arms and touches his head
aid our own resuscitation
they exchange a handshake
henryl what are you doing here
its a rescue old boys come on
as henry starts to climb out of the tank two nazi soldiers drop down from above their lugers drawn
they are followed by vogel
re henry search him
the nazi soldiers point their guns at henry and brody
to henry what is in this book
that miserable little diary of yours
vogel removes a glove and slaps henry with it
heres the map
the book is useless and yet you come all the way back to berlin to get it
he slaps henry again
what are you hiding
what does the diary tell you that it doesnt tell us
vogel reaches out to slap henry yet again but henry grabs his arm stopping him
it tells me that goose stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them
donovan appears at the turret cover
jones is getting away
indicating henry i think not herr donovan
not that jonesthe other jones
indy rides away on one horse leading three others as he goes
sallah approaches on horseback leading five camels
sallah i said no camels
thats five camels
cant you count
compensation for my brother in laws car
indy your father and brody wheres my father
they have them
in the belly of that steel beast
indy and sallah charge forward leading their horses and camels
then vogel commands the tank driver to give chase
vogel shouts to the tank driver
the tank starts firing at indy on horseback
indy zigs and zags as the tank fires two rounds at indy barely missing him
each time indy emerges from the plume of desert dust hanging like a toadstool in the air
henry and brody hold their hands over their ears
donovan shouts orders to the troops
indy is followed by various vehicles in the caravan
indy notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far
indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank turns his horse completely around degrees
the tank starts to follow
vogel watches the ground turning degrees as he tries to catch up with cleverly indy has turned the tank directly into a head on collision course with some of the
pursuit vehicles and a kubelwagon
the tank and the kubelwagon smash into each other the german military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six pound
cannon on the turret
indy meanwhile leans down on his horse scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert
he reigns his horse paralleling the tank as everyone scurries about inside looking through viewing ports trying to figure out exactly where indy is
vogel shouts to the gunner
der kubelwagon sprengen
the gunner puts a shell into the large gun
he fires catapulting the kubelwagon into the air where it explodes
the tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust then rolls over the kubelwagon crushing it indy gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel
lodging several rocks inside
then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun
a nazi soldier pushes henry away from the window
he points his gun at henry and brody
the smaller gun blocked by the rocks backfires blowing the breech out into the face of the gunner killing him and filling the tank with smoke
brody henry vogel and the driver begin to choke
indy rides his horse alongside the tank
henry and brody still held at gunpoint by the nazi soldier
the nazi soldier swings his fist knocking henry off his seat
smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open
vogel emerges and aims his gun at indy
indy and vogel exchange shots as indy chases the tank on his horse
indy pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty
indy immediately takes the high trail
now indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail
he moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank
hate staring at indy hate staring back at vogel
suddenly from nowhere a german soldier flies into frame tackling indy
one of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon nazi soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over indy
indy is struggling with a germans luger
indy presses the luger against his assailant and forces the nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself
the bullet not only passes through the nazi but passes through two other nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away leaving indy
to stare at the gun in disbelief
another soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs indy
they struggle and fall
indy sits up to see vogel standing over him
vogel wraps a chain around indys neck
indy appears at the entrance the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by dad
he drops the gun down into the tank
dadl get it
vogel pulls indy from the tank entrance yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck
a nazi soldier approaches
indy hits him knocking him onto the tank tread
the nazi soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank
now indy and vogel struggle with one another the chain still wrapped around indys neck
we see indy and vogel struggling atop the tank
indy lifts his feet lunging toward the periscope and pulling vogel with him
indys face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope
the nazi soldier looking through the periscope pulls away from it smiles then turns back to it
indys face still pressed against the lens
vogel pulls indy from the periscope
the nazi soldier pulls away from the periscope again
laughing diese amerikane
sie kampfen wie weiber
indy now lies on top of vogel
he kicks out at the periscope which spins around
the periscope handle spins around and hits the periscope soldier in the head
he falls against the nazi soldier guarding henry and brody
henry pushes the nazi soldier aside and grabs the gun
the periscope soldier struggles to take the gun from henry
vogel holds the chain around indys neck pushing his head downward toward the revolving tread
the periscope soldier holds henry from behind forcing the gun toward him
henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket
as the periscope soldier pulls on henrys face henry lifts the fountain pen and squirts ink into his face
the soldier falls his head smashing into the wall of the tank
at the same time henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the floor
henry the pen what
but dont you see
the pen is mightier than the sword
a troop truck pulls near the tank
henry fires the tank gun at the troop truck
soldiers fly into the air
the troop truck flips over and explodes
the explosion knocks indy off the tank and onto the tread
he grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank
vogel looks down at indy and smiles smugly
the tank is approaching a cliff wall
as indy tries to secure footing vogel steps on his hands
brody looks at henry
look what you didl its war
vogel now swings a shovel at indy smashing at his hands
brody climbs up out of the tank followed by henry
didnt i tell you it was a rescue huh
a nazi soldier appears and pulls henry down
vogel raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on indy still hanging from the protruding gun
indy loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch
he screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall sending stones tumbling down over him
the nazi soldier knocks henry into a pile of boxes then punches him in the face
as the soldier raises the gun to henrys face brody hits him over the head with a canister
the soldier falls discharging the gun into the air
the bullet ricochets around the tank past the tank driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel
sparks fly then the bullet pings against the window and ricochets once more this time passing through the tank drivers hat
blood flows from under the hat as the tank driver slumps forward his body depressing the levers
indy still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves barely missing the rocks and causing vogel to fall
indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches vogel over the side then peers down to henry still inside the tank
you call this archaeology
get out of there dad
indy pulls henry and brody from the tank
vogel pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at indy who ducks and grabs vogels arm
how does one get off this thing
as indy winds up to punch vogel he catches brody in the face on the backswing then completes the movement and knocks vogel down
vogels hat sails in and falls to the floor
to indy wheres marcus
before indy can answer vogel is up and swinging with the shovel
indy ducks but the shovel catches henry sending him over the side and onto the moving tread
indy grabs his whip knocking vogel aside
as henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom indy with lightning speed whips out his bullwhip wrapping the end of the whip around henrys right ankle
henry is bouncing across the treads like a rag doll
indy struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip
hang on dad
sallah draws his horse next to the treads
he tips his fez to heney
father of indygive me your hand
vogel now punches indy in the back and grabs him around the neck
still indy refuses to let go of the whip
get dadl sallah reaches out to henry
give me your hand
sallah manages to hold onto henry as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliffs edge
indy finally frees himself of vogels grasp twisting his arm painfully away from indys neck then landing a hard blow to vogels head
looks down at the fast approaching cliff his face filled with horror
we see his hat blow off and sail over the cliffs edge
he sees his life passing before him he screams at the top of his lungs
the tank trundles over the cliff and plummets to the bottom
henry brody and sallah look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank
we hear the tank exploding
ive lost him
and i never told him anything
i just wasnt ready marcus
five minutes would have been enough
looking dazed and bewildered indy staggers up behind them
he joins the others at the edge of the cliff looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression
finally henry becomes aware of his presence
henry says nothing
he just looks at indy overcome with emotion
finally he throws his arms around him
i thought id lost you boy
after a moment indys head clears
and he becomes aware of his fathers embrace
something he hasnt felt in a long timeif ever
and it touches him
he hugs his father back
i thought you had too sir
brody and sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation
henry pats indy on the back and indy collapses sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge
unaware henry sallah and brody start to walk away
henry turns back to see indy still sitting on the ground
lets go then
why are you sitting there resting when were so near the end
come on lets go
henry turns and walks toward the horse with brody and sallah
suddenly the fedora borne on the wind blows into scene and lands at indys feet
donovan peers through binoculars to see the canyon of the crescent moon
he lowers the binoculars and turns to elsa
the canyon of the crescent moon
now elsa peers through the binoculars
indy henry sallah and brody ride into the canyon
they hear a wailing wind
feel the biting cold
and sense the danger
now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city
its spectacular grecian facade is carved directly into the rock
it is a stunning sight
the vehicles camels and horses belonging to donovans party have been left at the entrance
indy sallah henry and brody creep forward to see hes walking slowly
muttering a prayer under his breath
whats going on here
the turk stands alone in the center of the temple
it is very dark
giant columns define the temples perimeter
watch him from a safe distance
is about to approach the spot where a turkish soldier lies dead
we dont notice it right away but the dead soldier has been decapitated
the turk stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier
takes one more stepa fatal step it turns out
we hear a roara whoosh of airbut we see nothingexcept the turks head fly off and bounce across the ground
react to the sight
she looks at him horrified
helmut another volunteer
two nazi soldiers force another turk forward
the sound of rifle bolts being cocked
everyone turns to discover indy and his party surrounded by nazi soldiers
indys group are relieved of their guns
indy henry brody and sallah are brought forward by the nazi soldiers
elsas eyes light up glad indys not dead
she controls herself and continues more coldly
to indy i never expected to see you again
im like a bad penny
i always turn up
step back now doctor schneider
give doctor jones some room
hes going to recover the grail for us
what do you say jones
ready to go down in history
a nazi stooge like you
is that the limit of your vision
the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world
well theyre welcome
but i want the grail itself
the cup that gives everlasting life
hitler can have the world but he cant take it with him
im going to be drinking my own health when hes gone the way of the dodo
he draws his pistol the grail is mine and youre going to get it for me
shooting me wont get you anywhere
you know something doctor jones
youre absolutely right
then donovan shifts his aim just a bit and shoots henry
the bullet enters his side below the ribs
to elsa get back
blood flowing from the wound
brody and sallah rush to his assistance
indy spins toward donovan with murder in his eyes
donovan points the gun at him you cant save him when youre dead
the healing power of the grail is the only thing that can save your father now
its time to ask yourself what you believe
indy takes in the situation
the two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him
he walks to the entranceway flanked by two stone lions
we get silent reaction shotselsasallahbrodydonovanregistering their different emotions indy proceeds forward
his hands open the grail diary
the breath of god
only the penitent man will pass
only the penitent man will pass
indy takes a few steps forward
the penitent man will pass
the penitent man
he is about to reach the spot where two men have just died
henry looks at indy
indy looks at henry
in a raspy voice only the penitent man will pass
only the penitent man will pass
quietly to himself the penitent man will pass
the penitent man
the penitent man
indy takes a step forward through the cobwebs
the penitent man is humble before god
the penitent man is humble
the cobwebs begin to move
he kneels before god
to himself suddenly kneel
we hear the awful rush of airwhoosh
because indy is in the act of kneeling only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face
instinctively he rolls forward on the ground out of harms way and looks up
from his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble a razor indy gets cautiously to his feet
now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a small corridor which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead
wooden wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades
indy loops a rope around the wheels jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid swipe
brody and sallah smile relieved
to henry hes all right
henry shakes his head
holding the grail diary reading once again his fedora now covered in cobwebs
the second challenge is the word of god
only in the footsteps of god will he proceed
to himself the word of god
the word of
indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path
each cobble is engraved with a letter
proceed in the footsteps of the word
lifts his head painfully
the word of god
try not to talk
the name of god
as he studies the cobblestones before him
the name of god
jehovahl still lies in sallahs arms
brody leans over him
but in the latin alphabet jehovah begins with an i
indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and indy falls up to his hip his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was
who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole the v rail diary in his hand
in latin jehovah starts with an i
now we see each letter on the stones as indy carefully walks forward
donovan and elsa follow in his footsteps
indy sighs with relief and steps forward to indy stands in a small opening just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a foot drop to
the rocks below and feet across nothing but a rough stony cliff wall
he can see nowhere to cross
he looks again to the v rail diary
the path of flood
only in the leap from the lions head will he prove his worth
indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion
impossiblel nobody can jump this
indy looks down into the diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do
rushes forward and calls to indy
indy you must hurry
a leap of faith
calls to his son
you must believe boy
we see him do it
we see him leap into space
we see that he is in midair
we see that he is not going to make it
his hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall feet to his death
and thenhe doesnt
he appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees
indy looks around and down and now he figures it out
ingeniously the first crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks feet below
it is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping
its painted to blend in with the rocks below
highly evolved camouflage
in perfect alignment with everything we see below
when indy leans out to the left or right
thats when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick
indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first crusader from the painting over henrys desk
indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a temple
a vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small temple
perhaps a hundred or more
many sizes many shapes some gold some silver but they all glitter and shine
indy is mesmerized by their number and their beauty
and then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl he has his back turned to indy
but he is dressed as what he is
a grail but we cant see the grail knights face
the visor of his helmet is down
perhaps we see his eyes
when the grail knight sees indy he gets wearily to his feet and surprisingly prepares to give combat
taking up his two handed broadsword
he comes at indy attempting to swing the huge heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much
indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword making no attempt to fight back
until the knight exhausted drops the sword and collapses
indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the knight is a very ancient man
i knew youd come but my strength has left me
who are you
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it
that was seven hundred years ago
a long time to wait
the grail knight reaches forward and fingers indys clothing
youre strangely dressed
for a knight
im not exactly
what do you mean
i was chosen because i was the bravest and the most worthy
the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat
i pass it to you who vanquished me
the grail knight holds his sword out to indy
gulp listen i dont have time to explain but at that moment donovan and elsa appear
donovan turns to face the display of cups
which one is it
you must choose
beat but choose wisely
for as the true grail will bring you life the false grail will take it from you
im not a historian
i have no idea what it looks like
which one is it
let me choose
thank you doctor
elsa and indy exchange looks
he thinks he is seeing her in her true colors
elsa chooses a cupa solid gold emerald encrusted goblet
donovan instantly takes it from her
its more beautiful than id ever imagined
this certainly is the cup of the king of kings
donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water
donovan drinks from the goblet
then donovans entire body starts to convulse
his face contorts in agony
he grabs his stomach and turns toward elsa
he starts to agefast
his hair grows long and gray and brittle
his face sinks
fingernails curl back on themselves
milky cataracts coat his eyes
elsa gasps and screams
his skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits
his skeletal hands reach for elsas throat choking her
indy rushes forward and pushes donovan away
as he falls he body breaks into flames then shatters against the wall
indy studies the array of chalices
it would not be made out of gold
indy picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug
thats the cup of a carpenter
he and elsa exchange a look
theres only one way to find out
indy goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water then pauses
indy brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows
a strange sensation overcomes him a feeling of peace and contentment
and we see his wounds begin to heal
you have chosen wisely
but the grail cannot pass beyond the great seal
that is the boundary and the price of immortality
cut to brody and sallah who attend to henry awaiting indys return
indy and elsa come forward with the grail
the two nazi soldiers are over awed by the possessors of the grail
they put down their guns and kneel
indy kneels by henrys side and tilts his head forward and holds the grail to his lips
henry is too weak to even open his eyes
henry swallows some of the water
much of it runs down the corners of his mouth
finally indy pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes
the color returns to henrys face
henrys eyes open
the first thing he sees is the grail and they light up
then they shift to indys faceand they light up even more
sallah points a rifle at them
drop your guns
the nazi soldiers drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender
to henry dad come on
get to your feet
steps forward and picks up the grail
she turns to indy her face alight with possession of the grail
we have got it
elsa steps onto the edge of the great seal
elsa dont movel its ours indy
yours and mine
elsa dont cross the seal
the knight warned us not to take the grail from here
a rumbling sound is heard and the ground roars and shifts
dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern
elsa falls on the great seal
the grail bounces away from her grasp
she reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to split open
elsa slips into the crevasse
elsa is hanging perilously in the abyss with the grail almost within her reach
as her hands lose their grip indy just manages to one of them he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor
with her free hand elsa is trying to get the grail
indy cant save her unless she gives him her free hand
she has to choose
give me your other hand honey
i cant hold you
i can reach it
i can reach it
her hand begins to slip from indys grasp
give me your hand
give me your other hand
elsa just manages to touch the grail
in doing so she has tipped the balance too farindy slides down another yard elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death
now the ledge indy lies upon begins to break apart
henry grabs one of his hands as indy struggles to reach the grail with the other
junior give me your other hand
i cant hold on
i can get iti can almost reach it dad
indy looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved
indy snaps his look up to his father
his father has never called him this before
very calmly let it go
indy abandons the grail and grabs onto henry with both hands
henry pulls him up to safety
looks through the falling debris to indy and henry
sallah and brody rush from the crumbling temple
the grail knight raises his arm to henry
indy and henry down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood
the grail knight lowers his arm as he watches them leave
indy henry sallah and brody emerge from the mountain temple through the grecian facade
from within the mountain temple the roar of walls caving in is heard
a cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance
henry turns to indy
elsa never really believed in the grail
she thought shed found a prize
what did vou find dad
henry and indy mount their horses
henry turns back to his son
what did you find junior
what does it always mean this
thats his name
henry jones junior
i like indiana
we named the dog indiana
may we go home now please
to indy the dog
laughs you are named after the dog
embarrassed ive got a lot of fond memories of that dog
a moment passes as they all ready their mounts and sallah continues to laugh at indy
henryl follow met i know the way
to his horse haaa
to indy got lost in his own museum huh
after you junior
to his horse haaa
they thunder through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse upon them
