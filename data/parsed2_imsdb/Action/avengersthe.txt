href b b avengers screenplay by don macpherson june pan down to reveal a flat horizon stretching to infinity
a degree pan reveals nothing
deserted no hiding places
no animals no humans no objects
except in mid distance brightly painted traditional comforting belongs in a village green
perfectly ordinary except for its location
only the wind over the plain
except the phone rings
a mellow old fashioned tone
we wait for someone to answer it
but of course nothing and nobody for miles
except a car engine
a puff of smoke on the horizon
va va voom of high geared acceleration as into view speeding like a bullet
driven at maximum breakneck speed mph
a petite open top lotus elan all streamlined curves full throttle it nears the phone box and screeches to a halt
dust clears engine noise fades
from the seat hops in black leather
strap at ankle
crunching into the ground
in closeups of tight black leather catsuit
a flash of auburn hair
black leather like a second skin
smoothed over legs thighs
buckled at wrists straps at ankles zips pulled up over flesh
this is emma peel scientist
sexual invulnerable cool
she locks up at clouds in the sky
then steps across to the phone box
picks up the phone
how now brown cow
pause the rain in spain falls mainly on the plain
pause the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy from the receiver an irritated official voice
filtered password affirmative
thank you doctor
emma puts down receiver
hangs a cardboard outside the phone box
then presses button bakelite box
a seconds wait
a coin from the slot
then a hum as the floor lowers automatically
hanging outside the box a notice now reads out of order
next to the call box we notice a sign an arrow pointing into the desert london miles
emma descends on the lift platform steps into a research lab in retro hi tech
walks past assistants down long pink and orange steel corridors werner von braun goes disco
nears a door marked prospero project authorized personnel only
logo with lightning emerging from a cloud
a man enters older
in matching leather suit like an astronaut
early s handsome charismatic with swept back silver black hair
his name tag dr
peter fixes her name tag dr
emma peel runs a finger down over her breast
ready as ill ever be
mutual erotic intellectual attraction
peter takes her hand and they walk down air lock doors a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech labyrinth a man joins them
a shyer bespectacled less handsome version of peter
on his name tag dr
valentine peel brother and partner
a countdown starts echoing thru the lab atmospheric pressure checked antenna ready
thermal chamber ready
compression module set
temperature control on course between one and one forty
water turbulence steady
valentine smiles shrugs good luck
emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek
a shy look from valentine at emma
peter senses just a minute darling
my brothers a worry wart
i better have a word
valentine peter takes valentine over to one side
emma checks gauges and dials
behind her a conversation
he takes a ring from his finger on a gold ring
he slips it onto her finger
something to remember me by
the remark strikes emma as curious
but no time to query
she smiles back
he gives her a kiss checks his watch see you in an hour
one sunny day
the countdown echoes around them as they separate
valentine watches her
inside a bed of ice emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive thermal chamber glowing eerily blue the effect is very cold
like a sci fi sleeping beauty beauty entombed and sealed in a glass coffin
plunged down into a vault
opposite her in another glass coffin peter peel is lowered down
the sound of their heartbeats
bleep and pulse of electronics
thru glass and leather
like cerebral sex
peter winks at her emma locks longingly at him as valentine watches behind glass
like a kid excluded from a bedroom
he attends to dials
and to his female assistant thrilled readings still normal
the assistant smiles oddly
focus on an insignia tattooed on her neck x
they monitor screens
a dull hum
a weather antenna emerges from the ground an enigmatic phallic silver blob like a koons sculpture
the sun glints off it
a temperature gauge rises
the ice is infused with pulsating colors purple blue green red
starts to heat up as if it soaks up temperature from cold to hot in instants
the graphs accelerate but over the dull hum a murmur a breath
as emmas heartbeat rises the gloved hand turns up the dial past a red danger mark
suddenly a blip
peter peels coffin starts to overheat
peter reacts intercom cutting out losing control malfunction in thermal chamber for christs emm
needles push off the dials as the ice swells strange mix of colors absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten metal
steam and sparks ignite
valentines eyes widen in alarm
five four three two one
three two one
repeating three two one
peters glass cracks the emergency light goes on the alarm sounds lab assistants running
emma realizes looks to peter the koons antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it from otherwise blue sky
siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow
valentine looks aghast at the graphs all systems fucked over the intercom emma peter get out
its going to explode
from valentines anguished face to emmas face as emma
emma undoes the straps clambers out of her pod emma clambers onto her husbands pod in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a nightmare get out
the purple smoke enveloping peters pod soft caresses peter struggling within looking at emma peter
her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin
her heartbeat sounds
she grabs claws on glass her fist draws back blam
three deadly blows emma smashes the pod cover it cracks splinters not breaking obscuring his face inside like a spiders web as behind her dont wait for him hes not
breathless blood smeared on glass emmas gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove twisted mass of flesh and glass growling sound growing as the voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna
gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass faint emma
as a growling sound grows till boom
an explosion rocks the vault flames burst out sound and vision separate emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche
the blast flings emma back thru space flying unconscious as if in a dream floating backwards in a milky way op art swirl of glass and steel fragments now out
of control weightless powerless as the background of sealed doors white corridors all vanish
a spinning black void opens up behind her as her eyes shut head falls back an orgasmic dream of near death as a crash of music begins a hip new
version of the avengers theme tune in stark silhouette the swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space an umbrella tossed in the air flicked like a deadly weapon a rich velvety feel key colors black white red
dandyish and erotic followed by blasts of violence dreamy op art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over a sensuous black background slowly revealed to be a womans leather clad body in
silhouette a bowler hatted man steed a catsuited woman emma
flashes of hair eye a red rose in bloom petals folding and unfolding then tightly shut
a thorned stem sharp to the touch from black and white into color leather background metamorphosing into black and white of a chessboard as
a medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance a fetishistic attention to detail leather catsuit swish of legs boots
hair tossed back red nails over black
creamy white skin
a silhouetted man in bowler hat in savile row suit old etonian knotted tie umbrella stabs like a sword umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round then a
tear gash rose cut and tossed into his lapel
until at the end together in silhouette
bowler hat thrown skimming swishing thru air until now only a single heartbeat
then pistol shots over as a gasp as emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare years later startled by the shots naked beneath satin sheets
her heartbeat fades as she looks around her klaus oldenberg room vinyl comforter satin sheets
a toss of her hair
looks more mature
emma peel widow
same every night
next to the clock a framed photo of her dead husband peter peel
from outside another shot
emma flings on a satin robe goes to the window and sees a car zooooming past its bowler hatted driver racing thru early morning streets
the damn thing backfires again
emma frowns annoyed
the sleek sporty black jaguar ss burns down deserted streets
inside is a bowler hatted man john steed late s
handsome english gent roguish looks dandys clothes
a beau brummel figure in a savile row suit velvet collar embroidered waistcoat
a debonair etonian steed oozes charm wit and when he chooses to hard edged steely menace
he drives through this is avengersland a parallel world painted by rene magritte forever england
bright pinks greens and reds an imperial city in final decadent bloom
white stucco buildings
regency style in candy colors
a surreally s city like a hipper edgier version of the s preserved in aspic where over the radio a plummy voice filtered the war office today approved military expenditure
for the nations new defense alert system
a spokesman said he would raise the matter at the forthcoming world council of ministers but that a state of vigilance was still necessary in the uncertain climate
as steed turns into a mews we realize that in this kinky pop world ordinary life does not intrude
nothing to spoil the view
as the radio continues with a weather forecast steed steeds car enters his garage door closes as but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark
a large bachelors den
dark wood leather armchairs
steed enters his library from a concealed door titles on wine and birdwatching
he clicks the door goes to his drinks cabinet
pours a brandy
hears a noise
instantly on guard
in his glass sees a shadowy reflection move
steed peers round a corner
sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk a burglar
steed sneaks up behind raises his umbrella and crack
brings the umbrella down on the suspects head
who manages to dodge swivel round and bam
delivers an expert blow to steeds stomach
a rapid exchange of blows
steed recoils about to jab the umbrella when his assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch steed covers the area bam
a spiked heel hits his bowler as the curtains are drawn back light floods in they freeze
steed knows his opponent a lethal blonde in red leather
a voice steed
steed swivels round to face upside down a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling inches before him pommaded hair fat dandyish mother head of secret services hands of
extendable metal hooks
and brenda his beautiful leather clad bodyguard
who smiles seductively
i thought you were burglars
brenda and i thought wed drop in
mother suits action to the word drops into his wheelchair
see how youre getting on
something in the wind
mother wheels himself from the study
taps a barometer
it whirls around
weathers turning nasty
you didnt come to talk about the weather surely
oh yes i did
i want you to meet somebody
off steeds look i expect youll like her
brenda coolly files her nails
a flash of jealousy
a groovy penthouse a lichtenstein come to life
bach piano music floats in the air
hands gliding over keys emma peel plays with virtuoso skill
on the piano a framed picture of her late husband
and a photo of emma between peter and valentine
emma gets up goes to the door
the music keeps playing keys jumping up and down automatically as emma flicks open a large automated eye
opens a messenger distinctive outfit hands over a package tied in a bow
emma shuts the door
unties the bow opens up finds an embossed card reads please answer the telephone
emma looks the phone sits there
emma goes over picks up the phone
a recorded message an upper class womans voice filtered boodles club the mall p
boodles club the mall p
the phone goes dead
emma opens up the case
unveils a brace of kippers
puzzled she holds up a fish
near the mall outside white stucco buildings a lotus elan pulls up and parks as a car conveniently leaves cutting off another angry car
a dash clock says
out gets emma peel different attire
she climbs steps
on a brass plaque boodles gentlemens club
she goes in passing an astonished uniformed commissionaire
a porter approaches her equally surprised
may i help you madam
john steed please
im afraid thats impossible
the porter points to a notice no non members
you are female
as you see
then you cant come in
i have an appointment
not in boodles
really what happened in
bored emma breezes past already inside the hall
old mahogany portraits of dead politicians leather chairs
a male enclave
the porter rushes up to restrain her
hardly missing a step emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder finds the nerve ends
the porter winces and thank you so much
i can find mr
collapses on the ground in agony
emma ignores him
pushes thru double doors upstairs statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her into thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room steed sits naked save for a
he hears a disturbance thru the mist sees emma before him
automatically steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction
doctor peel i presume
and you must be steed
please dont get up
hissing steam between them as they study
i was about to throw in the towel
i had a spot of bother at the door
i shouldnt wonder
not a woman inside boodles since
why the kippers
red herring would have been too obvious dont you think
looks around so what was all this some sort of test
congratulations youve penetrated a bastion of male privilege
i guessed you werent a stickler for tradition doctor
whereas you are
dyed in the wool
but i can admire someone who doesnt play by the rules
rules are made to be broken
not by me
play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
and just what is the game
i say this is all terribly formal
must i go an calling you dr
re the steamroom under the circumstances you may call me mrs
and now that weve settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you
steed steps closer smiling
i expect youll like him
off emmas reaction car roar over
down the embankment parliament and big ben in b
the sleek jaguar zooms at mph
steed dodges traffic wearing racing goggles windscreen down executes a nifty maneuver swerves on a zebra crossing scatters pedestrians honking his horn
beside him emma is cool as a cucumber
steed turns charmingly
tea time four oclock
mustnt be late
beat a word of warning
dont take the macaroon
steed swerves down a narrow alleyway into a secret car park entrance by the riverbank
he pulls up before a sign no admittance at a control barrier steed inserts a card
emma sees a light flash up security top priority clearance only
the barrier lifts
she looks again at steed reappraising him as big ben approaches four
the car disappears in darkness
opens revealing water
we are beneath the thames garbage and fish float past a window of reinforced glass
an original campbells tomato soup can floats down as we widen to reveal
mother in his wheelchair pulling the curtain cord
i much prefer a womb with view dont you mrs
a delicate clock on the mantel chimes four
mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle
shall i be mother
he pours presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web known as the ministry a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels
catches emmas wandering lock i expect youre wondering where you are
an atmosphere of a gentlemans club reigns in the subterranean bureau emma takes her tea
dont tell me youre the shadow secret service
youre so hushhush even the legit secret service knows nothing about it
am i right
bodyguard brenda a glam leather moneypenny wheels a trolley brimming with fancies over to emma and steed
were so hush hush even we know nothing about it
before emma can make sense of this now lets see theres coconut cake date and walnut i recommend the rum baba
looks like rain steed
showers followed by sunny periods
looks up from trolley were not here to talk about the weather surely
oh yes we are
to emma cunning macaroon
emma hesitates takes a cake
about to take a bite when mother switches off lights
a screen drops covering the water window as the mood changes from coziness to terror an ancient projector rattles on
emma watches on the wall an official ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the english countryside weve had a series of bizarre weather reports
we kept them hush hush and sent agents into the field for data
case number one april p
special agent simkins investigating mysterious fires in corn circles
a field outside the village of little snoring one of the hottest days of the year
trapped by a sudden blizzard
found frozen to death in a giant ice cube like a mammoth in perma frost
the picture changes case two pilot raymond shaw may a
took off from a deserted airstrip near stoke poges investigating bizarre atmospheric reports
a freak rainstorm downed him
knocked unconscious by a flying fish falling from feet
twenty five inches of rain in eight minutes over an area the size of a cricket pitch
the picture changes case three june p
defense chief major courtnay
remains discovered in a turnip field near ashby de la zouche
our boffins recorded a sudden blast of heat
scorched earth temperature of degrees
not much of him left
the lights go back on
emma notices a new arrival a tall striking older woman dark glasses
my number two
shes let me guess father
all happy families here mrs
fathers dark glasses turn to emma like a hawk
runs her fingers over emmas face
gets the outline
emma realizes youre blind
god youre quick
have a look at these mrs
peel he passes round a box of evidence related to the screen events steed investigates a pair of black shoes and bowler emma a fish
the shoes have agent simkins name in them
unimpressed a kipper
or a red herring
what were they investigating
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns
jungle plants in the arctic
a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland
blizzards in summer
something strange is happening
and whoever knows about it doesnt want us to find out
to steed your mission is simple
find out how and why these agents died
im no spy where do i fit in
your research into climate engineering was state of the art
your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming had they succeeded
we need your expertise
perhaps id better start calling you doctor again mrs
peel emma hesitates unsure for the first time
im not sure im ready to return to work
ive been out of action for some time
ill consider your proposal
she gets up ready to go
one moment mrs
theres another special reason we wanted you to join our happy family rather curious actually
mother hits the lights
he flicks the video into slow mo
file thru image clarification identikit sketches
eye witness reports
strangers in the area
one description tallied in all three places
on the screen comes emma peel
me isnt it
emma stares at the screen incredible
like a twin sister
think of it as special assignment mrs
with a twist
youre our chief suspect
youre saying i have no choice
father will be your controller
steed here will show you the ropes
very arch ropes
a life size target of a man with blank face bowler hat and umbrella flips up and blam
is riddled with holes by emma who works at reloading as looking on mother with steed
think she really killed those agents
she may not know
theory goes she may be very ill
darling is right you should watch out
she may try to kill you
emma swiftly turns aims and blam
fires with dead eye precision
all on target
perhaps i ought to talk with dr
a gallery of portraits of emma peel projected on the wall based on warhols jackie poignant inscrutable fascinating iconic blown up dissected analyzed
the swirling newspaper dots cover mother and steed like bubbles from a light show
darling head of the ministrys psychological operations psy ops a kind of spy version of timothy leary briefs them
in his thick dark glasses and beard darlings obsessive interest in emma adds a sinister air
one key point mrs
peel is a widow shes obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist peter peel
you may find her a little
images of peter peel on the wall
of emma with him
they were a team
met at cambridge
working on a top secret research mission into weather conditions code name the prospero project when peel died
steed looks meaningfully at mother
something went wrong
peel had a narrow escape
file still open
how come you took so much interest in her dr
her husband was one of ours
eyes peels photo then mother peel
did she know
better safe than sorry
she was in a dangerous game steed
she may prove to be a risk
if she is theres only one solution
anyone particular in mind
off steeds reaction
clashing blades over
steed and emma new outfit cross swords
like everything else she does emma is a champion
steed is hard put
both fence attached to cables very high tech dueling
steed is in white emma natch in black
yin and yang
youre a lady of hidden talents mrs
ive no intention of hiding them
tic tac marksman
tic tac swordsman
tic tac to what do you attribute your overachievements
tic tac tic tac tic
steeds good too
my father always wanted a boy
i fail to see the connection
i had a feeling you would
she lunges her foil tips right into the heart on steeds chest
steed removes his mask holds her foil tip
i take your point
emma takes off her mask
i need protection
trubshaws of jermyn street since
steeds jag parked in front of course theres a space
getting out i thought we were on our way
oh absolutely but trubshaws a man worth meeting
no point setting out half shod
dry or half cocked
slips steeds hand made shoes an
the lasts shapes of shoes beside him bear steeds name
i couldnt agree more
thank you trubshaw
significantly very good mr
widen to reveal a bull mooses antlers
a horned rhino
then next to them in a wall of hunting trophies emma paces impatiently beneath them
shop assistants attend in tails and wing collars very old school tie
steed emerges helped into a new flashy waistcoat
gags at the waistcoat steed we really must be relishing his shoes ahh
the luxury of a hand made shoe
as unique as a face or a fingerprint
or should i say dna
eyes watching emma and steed rise
you can but i wish you wouldnt
thank you trubshaw
a youngish man in black polo neck beatle cut mop pauting lips smart suit druggy high pitched giggle
bailey a cocky cool psychopath
he watches steed and emma leave
and saunters after them
car roar over
as the jag races through them heading for the country
that place is so absurd so out of date
do you really think so
another car follows them
as they pass buckingham palace now painted pink and guarded by female grenadiers
reading scotland with an arrow as steed and emma zoom past in the jag
press that button would you
opens revealing a tea service a samovar of tea feeding into a pre warmed pot pouring into two china cups
widen to reveal emma reacts pours from the samovar
didnt mean to interrupt your flow of oratory
steeds jag backfires again as at the beginning
you know what i mean
this car and you
nobody walks around like that
not all tradition is bad mrs
no thank you
she hands over a cup
whats the point
a gentleman has to have a code
this is part of mine
think of it as my suit of shining armor
and i suppose youre the knight
the most unpredictable piece on the board
and always ready to protect his queen
when i find a queen in need of protection ill let you know
steed looks in the mirror
behind them a car
im hoping you will
he puts his foot down
towards picturesque scotland
the jag roars by then the other car
emma consults a list reads sir august merryweather
why are we seeing him first
as per mothers instructions
do we always follow mothers instructions
for a man in my position just what is your position if you dont mind my asking
how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work
smiles they call me in when theyve reached a dead end
i have no choice
why should you risk your life
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking
i meant me
emma takes in steeds evasive answers
sighing she pours
the jag winds around loch ness followed by the car
according to mother sir august owns half of the highlands
former head of special projects at the ministry
an eccentric recluse
not so much eccentric
more barking mad
he has a wife called june
and a daughter somewhere julie
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
any other vices
all of a piece really
a fanatical weatherman
chairman of brolly
off her look british royal organisation for lasting liquid years
thinks british weather has been tampered with by
emma takes this in
i distract him while you snoop around
try the weather
steed and emma speed up to the huge open main gates signs private no admittance
guards in hunting gear and plus fours with loaded rifles
they start up the drive
several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails
one of them a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes click with the whir of a the other car pulls in behind
inside reveal bailey watching them
on a tartan carpet a scottie barks furiously at a set of expiring bagpipes on the floor
pan up to reveal a butler leading emma down the corridor where she admires the eccentric fixtures pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit with tartan trimmings instead of
the usual suit of armor
this way miss
he opens the double doors admitting emma into of semi tropical climate
jungle plants parakeets snakes
walls lined with display cabinets and bell jars stuffed birds butterflies spiders
a thermometer reads degrees with high humidity
the butler leaves
emma fans herself
nobody in the roam
but hears a sound of rainfall from a smoked glass conservatory
emma follows the sound steps cautiously forward
beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs
emma stays cool
ive come to apply for membership in brolly shouts above the tempest you dont get rain like you used to in england
a good shower thats the ticket
stiffens resolve puckers the spirit quells the namby pamby in a man
sir august steps out of the shower and wind machine
a belted rubber macintosh flippers goggles
he starts to disrobe the noise dies down i so agree
how did you acquire a taste for it
out in india
so character forming for the british
not the heat
good lord no
the rain dash it
a good monsoon
fifteen inches overnight
a whole week of lovely rain
i remember one summer in jaipur
sir august removes his goggles recognizes her
you have we met
you mean you dont recall
before emma can reply the door opens
ah lady june
emmas attention switches to lady june a buxom lady in a souwester and galoshes who wheels in a tray of scones
loves his showers
like a baby
beat scones mrs
thank you lady june
emma sees sir august gazing wistfully out of the window which is rapidly darkening
just as he promised
emma looks sees rain start to pitter patter on the windows
emma exchanges looks with june as the rain starts pouring
imagine being caught out in a blow like that
thunder and lightning steed is caught out in it puts up his umbrella wanders over the brow of a hill past a big sign no trespassers
turns to a tempest as i say this is a bit much
lashed by rain steed carries on to the brow of the hill
he looks over peers through the mist at a deep purple cloud
mushrooming towards him
steed cant escape it
it envelops him
starts to blink
footsteps less sure
surrounded by thick purple haze steed stumbles and falls down a hill
tumbles to the bottom
he knocks his head on a rock
steed blinks shakes his head
he sees sun shining down on yellow sand a barren vista
suddenly steeds in the sahara
a heat haze shimmers
steed blinks thinks hes dreaming when he sees
steed heads towards it
the phone box seems further away
like an optical illusion
then hears ringing
steed still bowler hatted
takes off bowler wipes brow
adjusts rose in buttonhole
he arrives at the phone box
opens the door
steed picks up the ringing phone listens to a scratchy orchestral recording of the merry widow
the merry widow
over the music a strange filtered hello
who the hell
who is this
you must leave the test area
i repeat leave the area
help is on the way
the line goes dead
steed is baffled
steps out sees a shimmering heat haze
a figure on a camel moving towards them
steed watches amazed as the camel pads closer
the mirage arrives
the rider dismounts
a woman in yashmak and veils
she draws closer
drops the veils to reveal emma peel
in her black leather catsuit
good of you to drop by
and i see youre wearing your riding outfit
emma moves closer
steed smiles at her
emma closer and chop
gives a kung fu jab to the throat a kick to the balls a jab to the stomach
as steed lies on the ground manners mrs
emma takes out a
gun points at his heart fires the bullets strike his chest
round his heart
steed slumps back on the sands
moves over him
drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers
blows a good bye kiss
clouds roll by
the camel peers down at him
sound of clacking
a hospital ward
empty apart from one bed
a nurse brenda in her red leather her spiked heels clacking on the floor brings over a cup of tea to steed in a hospital bed
who wakes surprised to see emma
peering over him
eating his grapes
as she leaves mrs
you should be dead
how do you feel
eyes her strange
you were very lucky
four shots to the heart
i found you after i slipped away from sir august
mother brought you here
not me you should thank
i wasnt about to
i mean your man trubshaw
your bullet proof waistcoat
i thought you were just overdressed
i might say the same
mother with dr
darling taking notes
emma looks up at them
drops to a whisper
but they both are wearing headphones
mother and dr
darling have me under observation
they think i tried to kill you
why should they think that
you told them
you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times
left you for dead
frankly thats how i remember it
but thats absurd
i may not be over fond of you steed but its not my style
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs
conceding thats possible
sir august was convinced hed met me before
but id never met him
another odd thing
when it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
did he say who
but he must know
incidentally my double left you with this
emma shows steed the toy snow scene
a winter wonderland snow scene
he looks puzzlingly at it
on its underneath
the wonderland corporation followed by an invitation
to a formal picnic
did you say formal
i must dress
the sporty jag pulls up outside a tall swanky building
steed gets out opens her door
irritated emma steps out of the car clad in her leather suit hitting the street
pan up to steed admiring i must say you look more your old self you mean my other self
may i ask why you dress in that fashion
i should have thought that was obvious
off his smirk im in mourning
she moves off
stay on his poker face
i cant wait to see afternoon
he joins her they survey the building
wheres the picnic
they look up to a boardroom suite overlooking london
lights twinkling around a conference table
twelve teddy bears
each six feet tall
ridiculous and sinister
in pink turquoise brown black white green
furry giant paws and ears swivel eyes
one teddy sports a familiar tartan
on the table childrens party food jellies hundreds and thousands birthday cakes
and wrapped presents before each
each bear has a name badge bobby bobo bruno bibi betty binky etc
pinned to their fur
a childrens tune the teddy bears picnic plays
followed by a gavel rapping order
a distinctively chilling voice eerily familiar and seductive which echoes through our story filtered ladies gentlemen and bears
the teddy bears look round
cant hear whos talking
filtered today is history
the first day of the future
i welcome you to the first general meeting of the wonderland corporation now allied with our colleagues from brolly
murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears
filtered you have all given time money and expertise to achieve our goal
but we are reaching a new phase of our operation
from today many of you will no longer be needed
i have to warn you
dismay from the teddy bears
as a cuckoo clock rings out filtered a cuckoo
the first sign of spring and
a cuckoo in our nest
our organization is no longer secret
agents are investigating us
their names are john steed and emma peel
i believe we have a traitor among us perhaps more than one
uproar from the teddy bears
shouts of who
ps one of the teddys is a giant rabbit who seems especially alarmed
filtered that remains to be seen
when we find the traitors they will be dealt with severely
teddy bear l these agents
where are they
in this building
by our estimate they will enter this room in thirty five point five seconds precisely
the bears scramble to go bumping into each other
filtered i am sorry the party is over
but we shall meet again
to each of you a gift
a token of my appreciation
in front of the teddy bears each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink and silver bow
the tartan teddy opens his up a snow scene
up and inside fire staircase emma and steed run up open the door to the conference room
the cuckoo rings on their entry
to find an empty room
only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat the teddy bear picnic music playing again over
one snow shaker left
steed picks it up inside it in black leather
for you mrs
emma stares at it
turns it over an address
inside number a deserted eastern bloc embassy
a dilapidated hammer and sickle tapestry in tatters
old spy techno junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms
steed and emma open the door rush inside
they search for clues
a cigar left in an ashtray
steed picks it up with distaste
then moves over to the wine rack picks up a vintage bottle of champagne admiringly hm
a veuve cliquot
then puzzled but he bites the end of his monte cristos
frowning clearly were dealing with a maniac
meanwhile emma goes into the where she sees a blob of bubbling gunk like radioactive chewing gum
a few pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit
steed enters behind her examines the gunk
international satellite systems
formerly of the ministry
how on earth can you tell
steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe the name
trubshaw isnt the only shoemaker still practicing his trade
very good steed
leaving steed to ponder the remains emma goes into dark
switches on the light
looks up as emma emerges with a leopard cub
steed raises his brolly
what on earth
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society
is that written in his shoe
smug common knowledge mrs
shrugs she had this in her mouth
cooing to the cub emma tosses to steed another snowshaker
inside another address cadogan place
theres got to be another
way to go about this
down a sheer wall emma peel abseils with rope and crampons
before gliding through an open french window emma investigates
she looks round
busts of napoleon and charlemagne
looks inside drawers
meanwhile steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard who is a handful
licking pawing him
sings i cant give you anything but love baby
a key in lock
finds a snowshaker
about to look underneath
hears a noise
looks up in front of her in the mirror sees a giant teddy behind her
ready to strike emma swivels round a fluid balletic motion and bam
a kick to the teddys stomach
then off balance emma hurls him over her shoulder darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as the teddy grabs emmas legs flings her off balance
teddy grabs a military sabre from the wall and woosh
slices through air at emmas head
the sabre skims her hair
emma grabs another sabre the fight is on
slashes with the sabre and the teddys head goes flying off
the torso stands unsteadily
emmas eyes widen as a mans head emerges from the teddy torso
emmas so surprised he can slug her
so is steed and the leopard both asleep
a little milk dribbles down steeds chin
the man goes to the other room
starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume
throws clothes into a suitcase
terrified the man picks it up
filtered naughty teddy
filtered ask not for whom the telephone rings it rings for thee
but ive got rid of her
filtered go to the window
to the window
teddy moves to the open window
teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another bolt
the teddy slumps to the ground
soggy waterlogged very dead
kinda like the other guy
meanwhile emma wakes up
turns the corner
towards the other room sees dead teddy
reads the label on his suitcase
from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another emma lets call her bad emma coming straight for emma
she makes a noise
emma turns just in time to see
if it isnt me
emma starts towards her double who hesitates then turns leaping out the window
she wears the same black catsuit
the real emma rushes follows her double clambers outside to rappel up the line to emma looks
beneath a starlit sky criss crossed by wires a rooftop maze of buildings flanked by giant gargoyles goblins lions griffins over twinkling lights
emma searches the roof no sign only shadows
then turns a corner to see above the city fairy lights on the rooftops of harrods lit by a million bulbs
giant neon signs
several floors below emma sees the streets
a twinge of vertigo
then she looks up hears a noise from she sees her double run
emma gives chase
past neon signs high over the city
gains on the double who pushes faster
gliding between rooftop buildings
but emma gains more
sleek limbs muscular perfect body machine until as she sees her double leap over a yawning chasm
and stumble on the other side for a footing
as emmas adrenaline surges
she cannot stop she jumps
hangs in the air
limbs pushing out for the edge
and only just she lands perfectly gaining closing until emma gains up close
a final burst of acceleration
then without warning her double turns emma catches up and wham
a kick a chop to emmas body double scissorkick emma reacts swiftly surges into overdrive in a lightning fast kung fu duel crack of bone crunch of blows a flurry
of kicks as emma lands on her back
the double attacks
emma retaliates kicks up her leg flings the double over her head she lands awkwardly a metallic crunch in a blow to her head but picks herself up without pausing
and vanishes into the rooftop maze
shes lost her double
she stands alone silhouetted against the night sky
caught in the moonlight
above sparks of neon
daunting muscular poised for action as ears listening to distant noises
flutter of bird wing
hum of wind through wires
then an audible snap above her a spam as a steel cable wire of an aerial is snapped
slowly wound tightly round bent back coiled ready to spring looks round
sees nothing hears the sound of the whiplash coming seconds before through the air a flashing line like a bolt of lightning but cannot move quickly enough as as a
cable wire whips across coils round emma lashing her tight crushing air from her as the wire sweeps emma off her feet whiplashes her back like a spring hoists her and dangles her over the city
she looks down
a long way
emma grabs hold of the wire which pulls her back
she drops down to the rooftop
slithers down the roof
slips emma hangs on with fingertips
overlooking city with foot neon sign above her for wonderland weather with a repeated loop of a foot high bikini clad emma throwing head back in holiday fun sign coming
soon the emma hangs on looks up stares at herself
the surreal repetition of the loop
overlooking the whole city
dizzy emma threatens to pass out
just when from an unseen hand from bad emma winds down another cable for her to hold
it uncoils down past the windows telltale sparks flare up as it hits metal emma tries to grab for it
misses then grabs hold and a live cable a thousand volts surge through her body a shock emma plummets down to on a lower ledge
she hangs precariously
catching her breath
about to redouble her efforts
when beside her from a an umbrella extended
steed reaches out reels emma in
they are back in teddys flat
emma collapses in steeds arms
he helps her up hands her a phone
for you mrs
dry i see what you mean about letting me do the risking
its sir august
brollys been betrayed
ill tell you everything
the weathers getting worse and worse
theyre after me
coming for me
to steed what now
sound over ring ring
sir august gripped with terror stares at the phone
the scotty dog barks
finally sir august answers
filtered ask not for whom the telephone rings
i beg you
filtered walk over to the window
let it be rain please let it be filtered stay by the window
by the window
mesmerized sir august goes to the window
looks lady june arrives too late
a purple cloud of cyclone force rages towards him
a luminous glow
then a lightning strike
an explosion blasts the windows
a wind rushes in
past obscure imperial statues a tiny micro messerschmidt bubble car tootles down deserted streets
a cyclone hit banffshire last night
in a blue funk
cant take chances
im looking after things while hes hiding out
father drives like a maniac
she senses their unease
youre probably wondering how i can drive blind
a new prototype from the boys in x division
micro sensors in the system read signals and road information
converts the info into miles per hour
father jumps a red light
cars screech together in a huge pile up
not that smart
steed holds onto his hat
we know one thing
that suspect was not mrs
so you say
you dont believe him
its mother you have to convince
hes very agitated
father screeches to a halt on holland park avenue steed and emma get out
father takes off
but dont bother
heres a bus
a red london number bus drives up
as it arrives in a conductors cap is the bodyguard brenda
fares please steed and emma board the bus
destination not in service
they pay brenda the conductor
is mothers temporary mobile hq
he squats in a corner
metal hooks on electronic panels
all the upper windows have been blacked out
welcome to mobile h
weathers turning quite nasty
sir august was blown to smithereens
along with half of banffshire
the ministrys worried
he tried to warn us
we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late
someone tipped them off
too late anyway
todays escapade was only for starters
this is no ordinary weather
a kind of weather bomb
this is my field
is there anything that isnt
ignores the prospero project was started by my husband
it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming
in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible
we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite
a quick fix
filling in mother natures blind spots
thered been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea
propane gas mostly
in small quantities it captures chlorine
protects the ozone layer
but it proved impractical
but if someone miniaturized the process
thats what we were working on
sounds as if someones hijacked your research
would it be possible to use it for military purposes
directed by laser
bounced by satellite
where would they aim for
mother thinks gets out of his wheelchair takes a turn about the bus sits down again
no one pays any attention
the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence
if you can control the weather you control the world
after the cold war
the hot and cold war
sign grand opening soon
widen to reveal
steed looks around picks the lock
hi tech style
a kind of space age travel agency
at the reception desk the receptionist has her back turned
steed sneaks in moves behind a screen overhears a man bailey giving orders to the receptionist new orders
the penultimate phase
now fully operational
steed moves away from them pushes a set of double doors open arrives inside a long corridor surrounded by a presentation of virtual reality weather clouds sunny vistas lush meadows
and slogans be natural
the natural beauty of wonderland weather
steed reacts the model is the same as emma on the big neon sign near harrods
steed finds a desk
sees a postcard of a large stately home
he pockets it
then looks round to see bailey before him
we recognize him as the young dandy trailing steed
neither gives away the other
were not yet open for business im afraid
i was recommended
by a friend
sir august merryweather
i was looking for something relaxing
say a tuscan hillside in june
normally wed be eager to oblige seriously
natural weather delivered to your door on demand
down your phoneline
for limited periods
you dont say
how real does it feel
as real as you wish
hot or cold
humid or dry
anything you like
there are limits
the technology is brand new
soon it will be more powerful
we anticipate a huge demand
leave us your number
well be in touch
ill call again
steed raises his bowler
bailey watches him go
steed emerges stares at his postcard the stately home and headquarters wonderland weather ltd
as my car
emmas lotus elan whizzes by
a day in the country
three agents killed by bad weather
and by you mrs
ignores then a mad millionaire
head of a secret defense establishment
a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather
and by you mrs
everything points to you
no undiscovered twin
not that i know of
according to dr
darling youre a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of anti social and violent behavior
steed lets it sink in
emma looks a little hurt
is that what you think
beat just my type mrs
the lotus races round blind corners
across a train at a level crossing which just misses them emma sees steed hold on for dear life
she smirks do you always drive this fast
have i trespassed on a male prerogative
before his reply were being followed
i saw him at trubshaws
steed looks into the mirror sees a car behind them
pulling up trying to catch up
emma glances in the mirror and hold on
puts foot down
steeds head pinned back to his seat
emmas hair tossed in the wind
the lotus twisting and turning
the car behind always catches up
emma tries to shake it
shaking round corners as
before emma pushes foot down
the car behind struggles to keep up
emma coasts ahead turns a corner and suddenly sees in front of her crossing directly in their path
swerves plunging the car into a haystack where it is completely hidden as clears in time for the following car which keeps going
as steed emerges brushing off straw
an old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears
are you alright young man
i think so thank you so much
a squeal of tires as the following car swerves back stops and bailey emerges gun drawn as steed and the old lady react
relishing reach for the sky pardner
steed raises his hands
oh dear to steeds surprise she pulls an uzi from her basket and bangbangbangbang
sprays bullets into bailey who crumples gun spinning along the tarmac
cute and sweetlooking the old lady is unfazed
cocky little bastard
i hope he was a baddy
i feel sure of it
mother said youd be on your way
peel with you
looks around she was
they start pulling away hay from the haystack
you with mother or father
glad to see theyre together at last
they dont get along
quite a fuss at the ministry
not paying attention you dont say
mumbles like looking for a needle in a
then emma sputtering straw as steeds face appears
he tries to conceal his relief at seeing her
what lady disdain
are you yet breathing
you will let me know if you find that queen whos in need of protection wont you
he pulls her out
emma brushes herself off pulls off a piece of straw
holding it ruefully this must be the last straw
takes one off her back heres the one that broke the camels back
someone didnt want us to get to the party
i expect well have to gatecrash
i may be able to help you
comes to life
steed emma and the old lady survey
checks postcard wonderland weather ltd
on a lawn a peacock flares its thousand eye tail
a mechanical click its eyes conceal hidden cameras recording emma steed and the old lady whove landed inside the walled grounds
they move stealthily forward unaware
the old lady waves them on
they enter a tunnel into tall hedges surround steed and emma and the old lady on all sides
they follow the path slopes round curves turns into hairpin bends and u turns
at first intrigued
emma leads the way steed following
the old lady slips out of view
steed stops to pick a rose puts it in his lapel
emma rushes ahead
its clear now
a trapezoid shape dictated by twin diagonal paths and a single curving path
a late seventeenth century design originally for king william of orange copied
steed sees emma slip round a corner
he pursues her
then loses her
sees her thru hedges then seemingly thru the other side of the hedge
in two places at once
i think im seeing double again
out of sight emma rushes on
around her the hedges grow taller
she seems to grow smaller
emma begins to realize things are not what they seem
as she pushes her way thru the maze as a formal patter n
three tiny figures dart round
a pattern on a screen
the lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines
steed emma and the old lady as three flashing dots
someone somewhere is watching them
laughter then a familiar voice now this is more like it
steed searches for an exit
emma sees a statue of a butler
which springs to life
she follows down a path strewn with leaves
as emma steps on the leaves she falls down a giant rabbit hole
emma spins through darkness like alice in wonderland
the identical face of emma on a marble statue as steed studies the classical statue
steed hears a noise turns to see emma walking towards him
she picks the rose from his lapel slowly coils an arm around his neck
pulls steed towards her closes her eyes kisses him full an the mouth
more kiss mrs
the kiss ends
steed recovers his composure lips coated with her lipstick
his tongue traces his lips smarts
he goes dizzy
steed collapses to the ground
inside the house a grand hall
a cobweb hangs from ceiling
a velvet curtain tattered and torn
a cuckoo clock rings the hour
ahead the real emma sees a giant staircase
there on the stairs a glass eye
she picks it up
puts it in a pocket
emma goes sees a series of family portraits an the staircase
one of herself in ornate aristocratic regalia
rooms on either side
emma goes down the hall pushes doors
a mad childs collections of
glass eyes staring at her from the blackness
then emma turns into a whole room of
a wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils
emma picks up one snow scene
she shakes it
as if in response a storm gathers
shadowy clouds roll in
a drop of rain starts to fall
steeds eyes flicker open
re rain not again
he rises looks down reacts alice the old lady lies near him in the maze her neck snapped
steed kneels next to her in the rain its a trap
tell mother beware
she dies in his arms
wind picks up too
steed looks about frowning with discouragement thunder and lightning outside
inside the room of snow shakers a childhood tune plays
emma shakes the snow scene
the weather seems to grow darker
emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice i wouldnt shake that too hard
the weather might turn nasty
from the shadows
behind a distorting lens
his shape and face unclear
emma puts down the shaker
quite a collection
if nature gives a man a collectors mind it doesnt matter what he collects
a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass
outside the big window the weather is turning nasty
your voice its so familiar
we have met
from the shadows a man moves out revealing peter peel emmas husband
instinctively emma moves towards him
a long pause
i must be dreaming
emma pulls back
before she can turn peter takes her hand places it over his heart
very much alive
peter touches her hand
emma looks into his eyes
intrigued but alarmed disbelief
peter raises her hand to his lips
darling its me
emma shudders battles with herself
emma is tempted yet filled with terror
inside her pupil his face as he kissed her his ring on her finger the visor cracking the glass obscuring his face
peter smiles disarmingly
as if the answer was obvious
all for you
peter comes over folds her in his arms
takes her head between his hands
emma leans over to him about to kiss him both closing their eyes until lips parted
before they kiss emma pulls back dont be afraid darling
she turns runs to the door
like a trapped bird
she tries the door locked
another door locked
a window locked
dont run away
i forgive you emma
i know you left me
but i still love you
do you still have my ring
i need it
peter grabs hold of emma
she pulls away
emma sees his face before her pleading with her
seductive yet nightmarish
as if hallucinating emma runs away towards the big window overlooking the gardens
she runs leaps and in slow motion crashes thru the glass shards and splinters shattering all round her as she somersaults through the window down to the ground
lands with a thud on the wet ground
looks up to see steed above her the storm raging
she struggles to her feet comes towards him upset
first time shame on you
third time shame on me
he slugs her and the screen goes black
peel is suffering from delusions and hallucinations
an extreme personality disorder
she imagines her husband peter peel has come back to her
close on emmas face
a classic syndrome to overcome her subconscious guilt at her other crimes
weve attached her to the dreamscape machine
well soon see what her unconscious looks like
emmas eyes flicker
steed comes into focus sitting by emmas bed
this time hes eating her grapes
emma looks around
a steady pulse drone
tugs at leather straps
widen to reveal emma strapped to a special couch her head surrounded by a plastic dome terminals and wires leading out into a dreamscape machine
where am i
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists
im so sorry i struck you mrs
please forgive me
i thought you were someone else
no smile i expect thats for you to know and me to find out
it was peter i saw him
drugged emmas eyes drop
focus changes to a giant spiral hypnodisc whirrs creating trippy black and white zig zag op art effects a la bridget riley
steed is gone
darling leans over her
emma stares at the hypnodisc
closes her eyes
thousand rems per sec a tiny chip next to her eyes transmitting out via wires to a dreamscape apparatus like a liquid tv screen flicks thru random images from emmas
peter peel teddy bears post card views childhood snaps dr
darling furls his hand over emmas his fingers resting upon her ring
during the interrogation he soothingly strokes her hand tries to remove the ring without arousing her suspicion
pulls gently on it
in his wheelchair mother sits beside steed
this man did you see him
her husband she says
alice tried to warn us
tell mother beware
tell father thats all
darling leans forward to interrogate emma
he looks and sounds sinister
from a corner of her eye she sees a clip of keys hanging from his pocket
i want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when i say these words
do you understand
as she nods blue
steed watching listening
the exchange speeds up
unknown to dr
darling emma picks his keys unlocks her straps
as emma talks the dreamscape plucks images from her unconscious in trippy psychedelic rush faces colors patterns flash past
piper picked a peck of pickled peppers how many pecks of pickled peppers did peter peel
quietly unclicks a lock
she stops in mid gabble
how long have i been here
emma unlocks her straps
do you get paid by the hour
darling is shocked indignant
emma rips wires from her body
the dreamscape machine winds down
up in the gallery bam
mother bashes his metal cane on the railings filtered you are here under observation mrs
you must answer dr
darlings questions pushes dr
filtered you need treatment mrs
you cant resign
mother looks at steed
who snaps himself out of staring at the hypnodisc
emma heads for the airlock door marked dont open that mrs
she goes in
emma floats in the air as mother dr
darling and steed all follow
and float helplessly turning around madly
trying to gain on emma
mothers wheelchair steeds umbrella and bowler all tumble thru the air as steed tries to reach the off switch echoing what are you trying to do to me
flailing we want to help
i thought i was a widow
the only man i ever loved
for the rest of my life i have to live with that
the death of peter peel was a great loss
to us all
mother looks at emma
hes let the cat out the bag
steed finds the off switch
they all tumble to the floor mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella
he moves to mother i think you owe mrs
peel an explanation
steed stares mother out
who delivers his revelations
peter peel was a first class agent
a senior operative
x department special operations
he was engaged in top secret research
beat im sorry
a turning moment for emma
a life lived on a lie
so all that time
our work our research was for you
and the accident it was no accident
the official investigation
was written by me
beat it was sabotage mrs
deadly serious emma walks over to him
it could have been you
emma looks away shocked
steed intervenes youre accusing mrs
peel of killing her own husband
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation
on the day he died he was setting a test
to prove to himself to us that his wife was beyond suspicion
he had to be certain
he said he was going to give mrs
emma keeps staring at mother fingers her diamond ring
i want you to remember
did peter give you anything on that day
touches her ring
emma looks up at mother
a barefaced lie
steed notices emma touch her ring nervously
he said if it vanished hed know it was
you who betrayed him
he took a huge risk
the ultimate test
so im still
everyone died in the explosion mrs
you were the only survivor
emma turns round
looks fiercely at him
mother shifts uneasily as emma walks past him to the airlock
this is an official matter mrs
no need to take it personally
where are you going
to find out who killed my husband
the doors and walls are monitored mrs
this is a very secure establishment
so am i
emma pushes open the doors
down a corridor
darling grabs mother as he exits with steed she must remain here
shes highly dangerous
mother exits with steed they watch emma going
i was growing fond of mrs
unfortunately guilty until proven innocent
mother and father know best
mother wheels himself off
then stops over his shoulder something quick
car roar over as emma drives a hot wired morris minor out the open gates of the manor house past a sign which reads winslow home for retired lepidoptorists butterfly
logo in the b
a couple of old timers race around with butterfly nets as steeds jag pulls past them in hot pursuit
emma speeds down lanes
followed at a safe distance by steed in his ss
steed looks a bleep on his radar screen tracks the on emmas shoulder as she drives
the cars whiz past
keeping an eye on his radar and the road steed switches on the radio
the weather forecast filtered
sunny intervals leading to sudden storms and gale warnings for all areas
as he frowns outbursts of rain scattered hailstorms and freezing fog greeted the world council of ministers as they arrived in london for their conference
emma drives into a churchyard
steed follows her
a medieval country church
sunlight streams through stained glass illumining emma as steed watches her lay a red rose by an altar tomb an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of eternal
sleep peter peel
emma pauses as in the b
choirboys sing hymn practice
steed watches emma move away toward the door
he drops a hymn book
emma swivels round sees steed
you followed me
to kill me
fractional pause nothing personal
then turns and runs
steed follows emma through a door to steed enters glimpses emma above
he follows her
hears her footsteps
trip trapping up the spiral staircase
steed listens follows
from below steed hears a bell ring
a flutter of birds
as debris falls down steed runs up stairs reaches bell still ringing
at the top a sheer drop
steed edges closer to the ledge
a long way down
from behind a long way down
sees emma blocking his path
steed steps away from the edge emma circles him
you might fall
emma steps to the edge
emma locks down
feet resting on the ledge
rocking to and fro
i could save you the trouble
because you always obey orders
steed nears her
emma pushes herself right to the edge
when i dont
it comes down to one thing mrs
steed reaches out for her
holds out his hand
and do you trust me
i could be convinced if
i knew who poisoned me in the maze
it wasnt me you have my word
steed snatches her from the edge holds her in his arms
i need proof
looks at him
their eyes lock
she hesitates then pecks him on the cheek
it was longer
on the lips
then a kiss on the lips
but not much
steed grabs her hand pulls her back
emma harumphs exasperated
moves closer to him
emma leans forward
a full kiss
at first reticent
emma looks at her watch
warmer more relenting
edging towards passionate
they stay embracing for fifteen seconds
what are you doing
keeping a stiff upper lip
is that all
the kiss continues couple of seconds longer
before emma withdraws
with an effort she regains her composure
a long silence
so im in the clear
steed savors the kiss
his smile says it all
but you did suspect me
not for a moment
youre playing games
arent we all mrs
i thought you played by the rules
i thought you didnt
im playing to win
winning isnt everything
please dont tell me its how you play the game
smiles stands aside after you mrs
steed motions down the stairs
its close to the edge
no after you
back to square one you dont trust me
as far as you trust me
steed goes down passes close to the edge and swivels round nervously
emma reads his thoughts
when it happens steed youll be the first to know
with this comforting thought steed descends first
as steed and emma exit from the tower they see a tranquil village scene
choirboys walk out from the church
nearby in the deserted village street
a red phone box
starts to ring
who could that be
a roll of thunder
steed looks up a clear sky
as emma moves to the phone
no dont answer it
he pulls her back
emma looks at him
the phones trigger the explosions ring ring
another roll of thunder
steed connects the two as an angelic choirboy walks towards the phone
a louder roll of thunder
as the choirboy nears the phone steed shouts dont dont answer it
ring ring the phone in the f
as the choirboy closes in opens the door the door shuts
the choirboy cant hear steed and emmas shouted warnings as he lifts his hand up and steed sees him reach out warns the vicar and choirboys
get down get down its going to explode
steed and emma all the choirboys hit the dirt as the choirboy grabs the phone and lifts it up and silence
a few seconds pass
steed and everyone are down on the ground
as they see the choirboy leaves the phone hanging
he gets out scans the crowd
then walks calmly over to steed whos still prone
its your mother
the vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically as steed dusts himself off
emma and everyone gets up
steed goes to the phone box takes the call
how did you find me
his expression changes as he listens
emma goes to the phone box as steed rings off
he emerges from the box
i told mother i took care of you
but youre not their big worry at present
darling hes disappeared
off emmas reaction to this news inside the upper room in front of a mirror with his back turned to us
darling holds something in his hand and waits as bad emma walks over
she stands in front of him
darling hardly even looks up
with her hair up we recognize on her neck a tattoo z
we are in the final phase
i shall require you to be especially obedient
there must be no failures
which he grips tightly
as a metamorphosis
his features melt and bubble a mask of plastic surgery and its slipping around like michael jacksons face under kleig lights
he adjusts it then
shakes the snowshaker
thunder as the sky darkens pan down to reveal steeds jag zooming through country lanes
steed driving winces with the drizzle
someone wants to implicate you in this affair mrs
any idea who
no idea who
no idea why
thinks teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all childrens things
or grown ups who still like to be children
any childhood friends
not to speak of
peter and i were both loners
there was nobody
steed thinks sighs
i have a friend who might be of assistance
hes at the ministry
wed better be careful
im a wanted woman i know
through a door marked information counter espionage walks steed with another man in identical clothes dapper savile row suit umbrella and bowler
which is emma peel in disguise
steed furtively checks passers by
his names jones
whys he called invisible
youll find out
at a door marked information col
steed knocks opens the door for her
arent you coming
ill catch you up
dont worry hes expecting you
emma goes in as steed walks down the corridor
a room full of archives and files
emma walks through tall corridors stacks of cabinets full of old paper
dusty musty and mildewing
suddenly emma hears she follows them
round stacks round corners
the footsteps get louder
shes closing in
the footsteps get louder until up ahead of her a filing cabinet drawer opens up
on its own
emma watches as a file pops up floats through air
the drawer slams shut
still nobody there
emma follows the file to a desk
emma watches as the chair swivels round
the file pages open up
then the phone lifts up by itself a voice tell miss proudfoot no calls
beat colonel jones at your service mrs
just a moment emma looks ahead of her
to the chair
as a desk drawer opens up a pipe is whisked through the air a match is struck
the pipe lights smoke belches forth
talk to the pipe mrs
that usually helps
dont worry about me being invisible
other than that im perfectly normal
or rather you dont
learnt the tricks in camouflage
till this accident made a prang of things
how can i help you mrs
steed on the phone
i say trubshaw steed here
barometers falling fast
peel and i find ourselves in need of foul weather gear
beat yes id say gentlemens snuff for starters
and then file pages flip through the air as jones goes through them
ah here we are
steed asked me to play a hunch valentine peel
but half brother to be precise
emma is surprised
now lets see
research into robotics and plastics
overtaken by peters work on the physics of climate change
i know all this
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother in law was under surveillance
she gave him an all clear after a security test by dr
whos now vanished
makes two of us
are you suggesting that dr
darling and valentine were somehow in this together
but thats absurd
steed enters behind them on the run we must hurry mrs
im just now you didnt tell her
testy i was getting to it
getting to what
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative i fail to see theres a reception this evening
colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend
have we been invited
poker voiced under the circumstances mother didnt see fit but i think i can get you in
surveys her male outfit well i cant possibly go like this
i had a feeling
thats why were in a hurry
steed proffers an arm to emma
may i have the honor mrs
she decides takes his arm
you may mr
the a team is born
steed and emma tip their hats to jones
troops rushing in to take up defense positions
searchlights pierce the cloudy sky
a protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall
at the controls brenda looks on
she hands a bag of jelly babies to mother
who picks out his favorites as he gives a briefing to father and others sitting in passenger seats orders barked outside as inside that hall are some of the most
powerful figures in the world
our only option
ill see to it personally
brenda glances over at fathers imperturbable face
as wind picking up
outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the world council of ministers guards stand on duty
barriers flashing lights
nobody gets past except up in the gallery steed and emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting
he with bowler and umbrella
she in black leather and boots
they find themselves in a niche and freeze very close to one another
steed sniff s
whats that youre wearing
its called black leather
here have one of these
he fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket what is it
small very compact
hocks it on belt when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
she leads the way through marble halls arched galleries red velvet carpets glittering chandeliers
from the hall a speech echoes in the uncertain climate that threatens this global initiative no magic umbrella can shield us
steed checks out his own
only our own vigilance
security and stability are our watchwords
steed pauses offers emma a small silver box
off emmas lock i must insist you try some
steed takes some emma follows his example
does it make you high
they walk on open doors to an empty gallery
steed and emma peer down at a a black and white floor
butlers move across like surreal chess pieces
a chamber ensemble plays the merry widow waltz which floats through empty halls
theyre playing your song mrs
annoyed the merry widow
i might have known
wheres the reception
they move cautiously forward as outside snow begins to fall
trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white
a christmassy glow even troops play with snowflakes until the wind rises
the snow falls harder
down in the hallway steed and emma search for the ministers
they head down a corridor then hear a noise
they hide behind pillers
as butlers walk past in military file carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats
steed steals a chicken leg
nibbles on it
suddenly another door opens emma hides
steed looks up to see father staring at him
we want mrs
dead im afraid
emma in hiding listens as you disobeyed an order steed
peel is dangerous she cannot be trusted
emma looks out the window behind her eyes widen
back to i think she can
beat can you
emma is deeply affected by steeds choice
fathers face meantime has turned to stone
i shall summon security
she turns almost walks into the door as she slips away
emma returns as the alarm is raised bad news
fathers looking for you
where are those bloody ministers
have a look at this
she leads him to the window sure enough heavy snow
steed reacts eyes wide
its almost may for heaven sake
the blizzard rages through streets now impassable
snow drifts block roads
white mountains of snow start to climb up shop fronts
and amid the sky filled with snowflakes up round the roofs a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting troops steed returns rushes across the marble halls to emma
but up ahead sees a purple fog seeping into the hallway billowing through the corridors as inside an anteroom like a roman arena marble pillars red carpet golden walls ceiling
murals the world council ministers assemble slick pin striped suits or african robes chinese mao suits indian nehru jackets all distinguished men and women surrounded by fussing officials minor dignitaries and butlers bowing and weaving a web of diplomatic protocol interrupted by the sight of emma peel in black leather
she strides into the room
picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler
all stare emma raises her glass gentlemen ladies
forgive the breach of protocol
an emergency from the hallway boom
the door bursts open emma is blown over by the blast as the purple cloud races inside
as the smoke furls around the ministers they choke fall
from the doors steed leaps in gives emma another snort of snuff quick itll protect you emma inhales
now immune to the gas steed and emma hear crash
they see through thick cloud a mysterious man in a white lab coat wearing a gas mask leading a group of butlers all in gas masks heads like black flies
in formation round the ministers helpless on the floor
a kidnapping the man and butlers haul away several ministers and escape from the rear doors
the butlers form a guard to protect the man
steed and emma run after them
more butlers pursue
as troops roll helplessly in the snow covered purple haze the butlers load the ministers onto waiting choppers as mother brenda et al choke on purple smoke in the bus
behind pillars steed and emma hide as butlers in gas masks patrol the halls
a butler passes them without noticing
they try to emerge
but another patrols steed trips the butler with his umbrella then chops him down on the ground
he rises but emma kicks him into as behind them steed sees the lab coated man escape up the stairs protected by a posse of butlers
he shouts after him mrs
a whole posse of butlers then advances
steed faces them
then turns heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator
she bangs the button gets inside doors shut as the bullets from machine gunning gas masked butlers strike the brass door as steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and
duels with the butlers
to give emma time he uses every trick and prop at his disposal plus brute force to kick chop punch and impale them into submission as the posse of butlers
fan out on to keep pace with emma
they head upstairs pressing elevator call buttons on every floor as emma waits inside
until she reaches doors open
a hail of bullets hit the lift as emma hides to one side until the doors close
emma sighs with relief
cool hum as the elevator rises
steed gaining on the butlers heading for the stairs as at the next floor the doors open two butlers rush inside
emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow punch then punches kicks stabs the other butler a more brutish type who recovers enough to grab emma by the throat
she chokes breaks his stranglehold swerves him round gains a nelson hold on his arms and throat and a knee in his back in time for ping
the bell rings at rd floor where emma spins her captive butler round in time to face whooomph
a blast of fire from a flamethrower launched in the hall
the butler gets fried but shields emma from the worst of the blast
she hurls him clear of the doors which slam shut
steed continues his one sided duel with the other butlers skewering madly trying to get upstairs to help emma
up emma goes
looks for an escape route
bangs on the walls
no trap doors
no secret panels
the floor light flickers between floors
the doors open
a grenade is hurled inside the doors it rolls to one corner emma dives to the other side then scrambles for the grenade
picks it up
it slips out of her hands
it slips out
just beyond the elevator doors
which start to shut
emma leans out a foot kicks the grenade towards the butlers and as her elevator doors close boom
it explodes among the butlers one of whom rushes to where he waits for the elevator
the light pings
about to throw it inside when no emma
the butler hesitates
still no emma
he wonders what to do and the doors shut he jams his foot
the doors open again
he moves in and looks round
until as we pull back up to reveal from above spread eagled like an x on the elevator roof limbs flexed against the walls is emma who drops down and
scissors the butlers head between her legs
the grenade rolls free
emma twists around grabs his ears and sits on his face
buries his head in her crotch
a muffled sound from the guy until emma scissor kicks breaking his neck
she drags his head out
leaving his neck between the doors
so as she leaps out heads up for the stairs the elevators doors
his grenade rocks the elevator which breaks from its ropes and plummets down the elevator shaft shaking the building as it crashes everything shakes with the impact of the elevator
as steed battles his way up step by step throwing gas masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles
up the winding staircase at the top a skylight which flips open
the man leaps out throwing back inside a smoke grenade and locks the skylight
as the grenade boom
explodes in the narrow staircase fills it with purple smoke
emma rushes thru smoke choking
she gets to the skylight tries to open it locked
a moments panic
then emma punches a hole in the glass flicks the switch flips the skylight up and emerges into the night air
snowflakes tumble around her
amid the blizzard the man ready to escape in a super fab streamlined whirly chopper
another assassin attacks emma pins her on her back overlooking the city
stands up before her emma held back over gargoyle over now snow white city
knees assassin in balls
flicks him backwards
as his body hurtles down into the snow covered streets emma rushes forward
but too late sees the chopper about to take off
the gas masked man in the white lab coat goodbye mrs
the chopper rises slowly
a fifteen foot leap
a farewell wave from the gas masked man
contemplating the jump beneath falling snowflakes as the distance grows
the rope chain ladder coils into the choppers belly
above london rooftops after dark the man still wears gas mask the pilot co pilot and a butler ditto
from the chopper a giddy look down thru a glass command module
a fairy tale snow white city
over the radio interference
a changing of stations
then a crackly broadcast of the merry widow
as the waltz serenades them high above the city a knocking from outside on the door surprised reactions
the butler opens the door sees emma hanging onto the helicopter struts
the butler is too dumbstruck to say anything
shouts re the gas mask anyone ever tell you you look like a housefly
emma grabs his epauletted shoulder yanks him up flicks him out the butler is jerked out flies into the open air
emma watches him fall
anyone else need a lift
the white coated man moves forward but emma is out slamming the door still clinging
to pilot intercom cant you throw her off
the pilot nods works controls the chopper dips as blam
a kinky leather boot crashes into the pilots face as emma kicks in the glass from the front of the chopper smashes so the pilots cant see a sudden rush
of cold air the instrument panels whirr round as the pilots struggle for control intercom whered she go
with the blades whirling directly over her head emma crawls over the top of the chopper and lets herself down the other side as londons lights twinkle beneath
as the co pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit emma grabs him with one hand hoists him up into the air the co pilot dangles over the city
slithers back onto the cockpit
pistol whips her
emma crunches back onto the metal
blades whirring close
the co pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask happy landings mrs
he raises his hand ready to hit her again emma yanks him up where his head get sliced off by the blades body and head fall away separately
as emma reacts her legs are grabbed from below and the white coated man pulls her down the side of the chopper emma falls but manages a flying handhold hangs
onto the chain wire below the chopper
as the pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings
trying to dislodge emma
thru the blizzard zooming down streets landmark buildings looming up topped in snow feet up
shinnying up the chain wire
the merry widow waltz no longer heard as old record or ensemble arrangement but enormous for full orchestra
grimly hoists herself up along the struts again hand over hand coming up to the cockpit from behind with a sudden movement she yanks the pilot out from behind and
he goes flying towards eternity on his own
the chopper out of control as the white coated man is left to fly it himself
the merry widow booms the chopper lurches spinning round up and down over spiraling corkscrews an insane waltz
the white coated man gets control
zig zags down a narrow street trying to smash emma into sides of windows
as emma bounces of buildings holding on for dear life
the chopper dips down dragging emma through icy water
a firework display going on
rockets and lights in the sky thru snowflakes
emma sees the bridge coming reaches down and detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit
the bridge looms up chopper rising to cross it as emma leaps onto the bridge
the man sees the bomb
also flings himself onto the bridge as against b
of the fireworks display boom
the chopper explodes
ball of flames
the crowd roars in appreciation
emma picks herself up sees the man in the white lab coat and runs for him
he runs too towards which unloads a rope ladder as emma puts on every ounce of steam
the man reaches for the dangling ladder but stuck wedged between narrow battlements
the man looks at his shoe at emma charging towards him at the rope ladder
he pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder sailing off in the second chopper leaving emma panting behind
shes soaked frozen gasping for breath bending over when she sees emma pulls it from its wedge looks at the inside trubshaws of jermyn street
i thought it was cinderella who lost her slipper
on jermyn street snow lies waist high
pa announcements urge citizens to stay indoors
pull back to reveal a fire glows a clock ticks calmly
emma sits with her shoe surrounded by a pile of shoes
steed trubshaw beside her
this time the shoes on the other foot
you said a hand made shoe was as good as a photo fit or d
well all we have to do is find the shoe that fits
it should be easy
a trubshaw client has his shoes delivered personally
the ministry should be able to confirm our delivery
ill be back
where are you going
laying in supplies mrs
peel weather may get very nasty and ive no umbrella
you neednt bother
i cant drag you further into this
after all i am still the chief suspect
mother and father think ive joined you
i might as well
but comes back oh and by the way i think its about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
if youd been through what i have you wouldnt steed reaches and pulls off the micro bug from her shoulder
one of mothers little toys
there you are
free at last
he tips his bowler off her surprised reaction
steed stands before racks of umbrellas displayed like ceremonial swords ivory handles duck handles you name it
steed hefts a few as picky as a samurai
emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes
triumphantly she holds up a pair of shoe lasts
prince charming i presume
your name is
with the name darling
oh my god
steed selects his umbrella and we follow up to he sees only trubshaw
she just left sir
in a hurry
she said youd understand
ah here we are
widen to reveal inside the archives among leather volumes
a file goes through the air passed to emma
as she reads
a map is opened across a desk from her
x marks the spot
the shoes were delivered to
an island in hyde park
surrounded by the serpentine
on the site of a former ministry installation
privately owned by
let me guess wonderland weather
very good mrs
i shall need a small plane
youre not venturing alone surely
im going to find out who killed my husband
will you take these documents to steed
tell him i said
below the thames as at the beginning
in darkest paranoia mother lies at the heart of his labyrinth
controls around him flash emergency
cakes piled up beside him uneaten
beside him father
brenda hands a phone
steed for you
mother grabs the phone furious
he signals frantically for father to trace the call but being blind father just sits there
filtered i was hoping you could tell me
youre getting yourself into terrible trouble my son
weathers turning very nasty and so am i
filtered im going to follow up on a hunch of my own
if im right mrs
peel is innocent and you have a mole
grabs mirror searches his face where
filtered in your operation
im warning you for the last time steed whoevers behind all this looks like mrs
peel walks like mrs
peel and kills like mrs
the line goes dead
to father find mrs
brenda smiles at the thought
father rises grim
through mist an ultralight plane zooms down from the plane emma leaps in parachute
down down down through the mist
over parkland the parachute floats down
to an island in the middle of the serpentine river
emma lands buries her parachute
walks towards a thick jungle then a stream
emma hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again
where a peacock fans its tail of a thousand eyes
a click of cameras
in the midst of the jungle emma sees a red phone box
emma frowns in recognition goes inside
picks up the phone
presses button b and the floor goes down
emma goes down with it into formerly a ministry installation
the elevator stops
remembering as from a dream emma steps out into a guard patrols
emma pushes herself against a wall
the wall gives way to flip round and emma swivels into the door locks behind
alone emma stands warily
from nowhere a chilling disembodied voice
you have been a worthy opponent
you have tracked us down
you are within an ace of winning
this isnt a game
quite right but we still make the rules
rules are made to be broken
then who wins
you and i
but first you must confront your greatest enemy
who could that be mrs
the answer is obvious
emma is in a hall of mirrors
in every direction emma turns a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her splintered into fragments as emma spins freaked and confused by the multiple images
emma turns into herself only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the lips
bad emma whose eyes stare into emmas startled ones as emma pulls her mouth away staggers back realizes too late
the hallucinogenic lip poison
emma crumples to her knees as sees herself above her before she falls unconscious
steeds jag races skids in bad weather
behind the wheel steed his face grim concentrates on the slippery road
on the seat next to him the snow shaker with little emma inside as if in a dream emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage a life size snow shaker
emma swims in viscous air suspended like a mermaid
thru glass she sees a face peering in father
filtered emma in wonderland
filtered weve been expecting you
we hope youll enjoy your stay with us
decontamination is almost complete
and youve a new wardrobe
he does want you to look attractive
beat he tells me youre very beautiful
emma pounds the glass in frustration
were hundreds of feet below ground
the ministry made it impregnable
no one can save you
as steed drives towards it
bathed in candlelight
a romantic supper for two
a door opens admitting emma
dressed coiffed super glamorous
she locks around sees another door
in search of escape she hastens to open it only to reveal a giant rabbit the one we saw at the teddy bear meeting
emma gasps in surprise moves back into the room as he advances removing the head its dr
emma my dear
how lovely you look
he steps out of the rest of his costume
would that i could say the same
ah but you havent see the real me
he pulls at his face which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her emmas horrified expression eyes widening as dr
darling turns into
darling emma it was you
all the time
im afraid you still dont see
again he claws at his face pulling twisting
emma winces at the sight her eyes popping out of her head
beneath gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails
yes i remember him quite well
pull back through windows to reveal steed and an old teacher in the beautiful library
this is where he used to spend his days
we have an old photograph somewhere
hes flipping through yearbooks then shows steed of valentine peel on stage in wizards garb
made up as an old man
absolute wizard with makeup
his favorite roll from shakespeare
the prospero project
from the tempest
a banished duke ousted by his brother marooned on a magic island
who controlled the weather
o brave new world that hath such people in it
emma frozen sinks into a chair staring
darling emma yes we the true genius behind the prospero project
he walks around the dinner table as he talks
but you died in the explosion
twisting the dial
pan up the arm to reveal valentine
i arranged the explosion
a slight miscalculation my face was burned beyond recognition
fortunately my research into plastics came in handy
an unholy trinity
stands you killed my husband
of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well
too many cooks spoil the majority shareholders
in wonderland weather
i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you
but i found you
all the clues led me here
i planned that too
you disappoint me emma
cant you guess
moves toward her for you
it was all for you
cold our revels now are ended
oh no emma
theyve only just begun
the phone hangs in the air with the smoking pipe
the shoes were delivered to an island in the serpentine former ministry installation
she said to tell you goodbye
i said its not goodbye yet
listen im going to need some help
in a hurry
indicates supper think of this as your second wedding feast
im already married
come come youre a widow a most attractive widow
now i think of it well need a bridesmaid
he pushes a button
bad emma enters
my latest model
a compound of plastics and sensor chips
a big improvement on the old x s
the poor thing is quite fond of me
emma say hello to emma
bad emma hisses a strange mix of static and feedback
you know i believe shes actually jealous
valentine listen to me
now what have i left out
oh yes i know the ring
covers her hand ring
he stands very near her shes terrified then how silly of me let me make you comfortable first
as he advances zoom in extreme closeup emmas eye another ball widen to reveal from the lake an odd eight foot high plastic ball emerges the ball lands on the
from the inside a zip peels away the plastic layer to reveal steed like an urban dandy in suit and bowler
a rose in his lapel
he steps out and poking with his umbrella deflates the inflatable plastic submarine
steed heads off camera eyes the peacock swivel towards him as he heads into the jungle where he sees the steed picks up the phone
presses all the buttons until he hits button b
as the floor lowers his eyes widen in surprise
carved in emmas likeness
lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into as valentine descends spiral steps to join it
valentine opens the coffin to reveal emma strapped within
i say isnt this where you came in
its impenetrable by the way
on the other hand he advances towards her smiling mad people get things done
let me show you steed stealing down a corridor and hides as a posse of guards rushes past alerted by the peacock cameras
he waits till they pass then reaches out his umbrella and nabs father around the neck who was feeling her way after them
brings her down
steed how did you guess
you reek of mrs
peels black leather
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance
youre the mole who betrayed the ministry
mother betrayed me
she was going to replace me with a younger father
errand boy thats all i was
well you found me
have a sniff of this why dont you
careful the scent can be overpowering
holding father securely steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere squeezes the rubber tube sprays a mist
father passes out
steed rises locks around
sees a grille and removes it climbs in and replaces it before the guards return
he turns and crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing until he hears a voice valentines
steed reaches another grille through which he can see emmas coffin standing on end like the iron maiden faces a wall of tv monitors as valentine explains
people expect weather to be free
theyre used to it
i call that a denial of freedom
no freedom of choice
an abuse of human rights
they buy water electricity gas
why shouldnt they be able to buy their own weather if they want to
if they have a little incentive
emma reacts also steed unseen behind her
destruction of their local weather systems
i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
the result would be
frostbite or sunburn
on a massive scale
youve seen a few samples
then whats stopping you
one very small thing
a diamond cyclone chip
a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size
if i possess that my powers would be unlimited
my dear half brother was developing it
but he suspected sabotage
he gave the chip to
i want you
but also your ring
valentine takes her by the hand
kisses a diamond
in the light a patterned imprint
zoom in a complex fractal equation of circuits
the missing piece of the jigsaw
i tried to get you to give it to me as peter i tried to steal it from you as dr
as myself ill be a bit less subtle
he slips it off her finger holds it up with this ring my plan will be complete
do you mean to say youve waited all these years because you couldnt create a chip on your own
that would have amused peter
speaking of peter theres more good news you wont even have to change your last name
youll always be mrs
what are my choices
ill never marry you
valentine is philosophical
he spins the sarcophagus on an axis lying it flat emma lying in her coffin as he looks down at her one out of two isnt bad
ill keep you alive darling emma
in a year or five you may change your mind
if youre still in it
valentine presses a button
from the ceiling a surgical laser
moves down to within inches of her face
this little toy gave me back my face
it can replace yours
what do you think
he marks an imaginary line round emmas face
an alarm bell rings
darling this is father
we have an intruder
i repeat valentine switches off the pa
that will be steed
he followed you
please excuse me
i have work to do
my most spectacular performance
a ballet of clouds
it was made for you
i want to give you a heart emma
i want all of london to see it
and now with this
flourishes ring they will
leans close and for an encore the biggest cyclone in history will wipe the city from the face of the earth
winks shape of things to come my darling
he stuffs a gag into emmas mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests
immediately steed tries to force his way through the grille
no such luck
what to do
he doesnt dare say her name too loud and theres no telling if she could hear him in that thing anyway
he turns around in the tunnel heads the other way
dark clouds approach like an army spreading shadows
moisture spits and crackles static energy waiting to explode
in the sky clouds join together like a genie from a lamp forming over the city a strange dark sensuous figure half human half dreamlike
that stalks the city
a rat runs over him
the things i do for england
pitch dark then emmas coffin is opened and we see bad emma looking down
bad emma stares at her human double emma who looks imploringly at her to undo the gag
bad emma removes it she runs a finger down emmas body inside a hole torn in the leather warm human flesh
you must let me go
bad emma listens
gently lays her head on emmas breast listens to the heartbeat
dont you understand
if he has me hell have no use for you
hell destroy you
the words jolt bad emma back remembering her mission
she goes to the laser aims it at emmas face
bad emma hesitates looks strangely human as the grille pops off and steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him oh dear
he takes off his bowler deftly removes a strip from its brim aims it at the guards and hurls it
a glinting razors edge which swoosh
slices into the closest guard before returning like a boomerang to steed
he taps twice hard steel as
run towards him steed swivels gracefully and slams the bowler in their faces a sartorial knuckleduster wham
one drops bam
the other collapses slump to the ground
steed stoops down picks up his hat sees a dent in its steel top
for the first time steed loses his cool
someones going to pay for this
stepping over the nearest body steed moves on his way as places a ring inside a control module filled with identical looking diamond chips
widen to reveal
masses of dials and switches
off to one side on a wall a rack of rapiers
valentine hits a switch
start the countdown
the countdown starts red digitals going backwards colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts
a computerized voice starts to count
the clock ticks
father enters behind him
the clouds are on course
london will be ashes
they havent heard our terms
father tries to hit the switch
valentine yanks her off
are you insane
stop the program and you activate the auto destruct
but all those people
valentine strikes her hard my cloud ballet
father slides to the floor
valentine ignores her
concentrates on the control panel red lights as up in the sky more white clouds darken into boiling black
they move and billow
bubbling with gases and energy swirling with motion a life of their own
from river a scarlet fog floats upwards
it gains mass and weight slowly forming as it rolls then rises above them into a weird pulsating red shape
a love heart
mother at the controls
rings the alarm
panic stations as sirens blare
warnings ring out over tv and radio dense cloud formation moving south west
on course for the center of the city
a fog floating in from the river
the prediction is
unstable chemical reaction
enforce the curfew
emergency stand by
bad storm clouds advance over london
black and furious
as shadows in a whirl of chemical matter
an airborne cyclone of belching static electricity
the black shape now forming a sensuous female shape
like a dream wisp of
emma peel with an hourglass figure
while the heart shaped cloud seems to move towards the black genie shape trying to connect to form the cyclone
air raid sirens
like a re run blitz
streets now eerily empty and dark
through deserted streets troops race to positions in gas masks
searchlights illuminate clouds
worried faces watch the skies as fly
chaos on all tv monitors as
valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens emmas coffin
what will he find
emmas there still gagged
pulls the gag kisses her i wouldnt want you to miss the grand finale
emma opens her eyes
valentine looks down at her until a tell tale sign z
bad emma is unmistakable
he strikes her yanks her out of the coffin
he races back upstairs as
emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place crawling high on a girder over some burbling liquid below
she hears noise in the distance
suddenly steed battles more guards
no time to lose
now moving with deadly earnest steed downs all oncomers closing in on steed rushes in bolts the airlock behind
pounding on door
he sees the timer racing backwards stands over the controls trying to figure out how to stop the program
looks for the chip amongst all the rest its like trying to find a contact lens in water
valentine emerges drops the hatch cover with a thud
i see youve gone back to using your original face
the last one youll ever see
perish the thought
valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall
did they tell you at eton that i was fencing champion too
steed unsheathes his umbrella revealing ditto
they said you were a very naughty boy
the fight is on as the numbers grow smaller
youre better than i expected
i was at harrow
but did they teach you this
valentine whacks the blade off steeds umbrella handle
a diminished phallic symbol
valentine advances towards steed who points the umbrella at him
he moves to close in when
from the muzzle as a bullet zips out and recoils
blood streams from his shoulder
he looks up devastated
steed blows smoke away from the muzzle
one shot for emergencies
clutches wound thats not playing by the rules
rules are made to be broken
pulls his own gun if you say so
he fires again
to the heart
valentine spins to the floor
steed turns to the console tries to figure out how to stop the countdown when behind the hatch opens again revealing emma
valentine pulls her up grabs her as hostage i wouldnt do that if i were you
valentine has emma a knife to her throat stands over the hatch
bullet proof waistcoats just the thing
i get mine from trubshaws
well be off now wont we darling
to steed we wouldnt want to miss the fireworks
figure it out if you can steed
valentine drags emma bolting the hatch
hes torn briefly but there are thousands of lives at stake steed goes to the control module and starts pulling out chips looking
the biggest cyclone youve ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city gathering momentum
going down down down as
valentine drags emma backwards
the cyclone picking up force
pull up a chip
the red numbers freeze
widen to reveal
the sirens cease
steed allows himself a smile of relief
the giant cyclone begins to break apart
troops pulling off gas masks as
steed sees the breakup of the cyclone
then behind him an ominous click clicking as the program reconfigures
a different alarm buzzer sounds and the words start flashing
a different set of numbers start running backwards
you must be joking
valentine dragging emma reacts to the new alarms
in his hesitation emma suddenly makes her move
a struggle emma takes a bad fall down a landing below
that will do
hes materialized across the girder from valentine
who pulls his revolver
arent you forgetting about something
you are and its behind you
you dont really expect me to fall for bad emmas arms go round valentine in a lethal embrace
let go you
she holds him in a vice like grip
i think she really likes you
as the life is squeezed out of him bad emma finally smiles
cradled together she chokes valentine who gasps for breath as one last desperate move on his part and bad emma tumbles backwards valentine locked in her arms in a dying
they fall into the mists and liquid below
steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support
looks down sees
he has said her name
he scrambles down to her body
emma lying sprawled out on the ground
steed picks up her limp body in his arms like sleeping beauty
his eyes fill with tears
he lays her down
he produces peters ring
slips it onto her finger and
a chaste kiss on the lips
but with the force and passion of a lover
he closes his eyes looks away in grief
the alarm still sounds but steed doesnt give a damn
behind emma opens her eyes
as if revived by the kiss
or the ring
looks up at him
steed looks back at her surprise delight
what kept you
realizing hello we must be going
racing backwards as
steed pulls emma through the catwalks and corridors of valentines labyrinth
racing to zero nothing to stop them
steed and emma race in she sees the sarcophagus
emma scrambles in and steed leaps on top of her bringing down the lid as
and a blast like a nuclear explosion as the underground hq is fragmented to smithereens emmas coffin goes flying
as the screen whites beneath the clear moonlight all bulbs on like xmas
it floats the coffin which opens revealing
steed and emma squashed together gasping for breath
the owl and the pussycat went to sea
in a beautiful pea green boat
a fine night mrs
still a bit chilly
you know after all weve been through i should say we deserve a long holiday
have you any place in mind
as a matter of fact i have
the coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight
a few weeks later
across snowy wastes a pack of huskies drag a sled behind them whip cracked by a frozen fur clad siberian peasant
as he turns a corner dogs stumble from ice and snow into the peasant stops stares
sun beats down
a tropical beach
a warm sea
a butler trubshaw
pops a champagne cork
from a tent he brings two glasses down the beach to where steed and emma toast in the sun
steed in a smoking jacket emma in a bikini
i dont recall siberia being this warm steed
its the latest thing mrs
our little paradise just made for two
looks frowns not quite
on cue from the water mother emerges snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption with brenda
he waves to our chaperon
pity your mother came too
steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with emma is spoiled
trubshaw pours glasses of champagne
still a little warm trubshaw
is this the
a little more ice i think
trubshaw trots off dutifully
a large ice bucket appears
mother moves in
absorbed by emma now his new protegee
about your next assignment mrs
steed gives his champagne to the siberian peasant
he presses a switch an umbrella shoots up between them opens up twirls
pull back to reveal the strip of beach like a tiny bubble of tropical weather
against a siberian b
as we widen we reveal a giant glass bubble hearing ah
sun tan lotion
any shops nearby
ill send mother
pull back to reveal no shop for miles around
as i was saying perhaps another macaroon
thank you steed
thank you mrs
behind the umbrella laughter
chink of glasses
