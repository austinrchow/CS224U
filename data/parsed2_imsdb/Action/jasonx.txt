href b b jason x revised rough draft a scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we shock cut into montage of fast moving clips
death destruction fear
all images taken from the previous ten friday the ths
the year is
the place is old earth
barren void of life a hazardous and violent planet
the sky is blood red with spiked clouds of dark gray
it is beautiful but frighteningly foreign
blue lightning crackles as several figures rush through a dust storm below
small groups of people wearing thick dusters goggles and masks work nearby
some dig in the cracked earth others take assorted readings with strange devices
this is an archeological expedition
the dust storm rages outside
two figures are looking closely at a small object buried in the dirt
one of them pulls a device out of their pouch and slowly gently picks up the object
the other uses a magnetic tool to remove the dirt
they take off their masks and goggles
they are both young
adrienne female watches as stoney male studies the object closely
reading not guaranteed if used after
close up of the object
its an unopened condom
smiles you thinking what im thinking
stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as adrienne rips her clothes off
they are in a half buried mini van
it rocks violently from the raging storm outside and from the raging lust inside
breathless what about kkinsa
stoney is desperately trying to take off her bra
its over between us
youre the only one for me
they fall some ten feet rubble raining down on top of them
a rusty metal ladder
half inch layers of dust cover everything
adrienne sits up shines her light down the long metal corridor
she turns her light on stoney then sees something over his shoulder
we pull back out of the tunnel through the van as the sounds of the storm drown out adriennes scream
the digging and readings have stopped
a group approaches a time scarred shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly
fat lou rail thin possible female pilot appears at the top of the shuttle ramp
yelling over the wind lets go
time to load up
yllo a professor of archaeology lowers his veil
yelling im missing two
we should have left this rock an hour ago
eyes a device north three clicks
yllo and the rest of the group run into view
boeman husky physical holds out a device and checks the reading
he points to the rusted out mini van sitting on its belly
kicker bulky short on temper rushes up wearing futuristic military garb yo teach what the fuck
were missing two of the kids
get your ass back to the shuttle
ill check it out
kicker moves past the group and into the van
not without me
the rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the van
yllo and the others climb down a rusted ladder
metallic walls graffiti cluttered floors
no stoney or adrienne
a sign from the ceiling states they all take off the goggles and masks
the rest of the group consists of delongpre good looking smart ass janessa sexual scheming azrael small cocky kkinsa insecure problematic thorgan a nerd but doesnt know it
ive been coming here for ten years
we never picked this up on our
kay em a cybernetics science droid removes her veil
shes gorgeous but theres something off about her look
the airs laced with type two ozone it reads as a solid
somebody wanted the place to stay hidden
in twenty eighty two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape
all right all right enough with the history lesson
lets find these two quick
so i can kick some little punk ass
kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel
i have an idea why dont you go find them and well get the hell out of here
kkinsa turns and finds herself face to face with a corpse
easily two hundred years old it hangs from the wall impaled through the forehead by an iron spike
kicker yanks a weapon from his back locks and loads as janessa falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse
kay em screams at the top of her lungs
everyone looks at the droid
was that out loud
thorgan have you been screwing with
thorgan grabs the head off the corpse with the spike through its head
this is an automatic a
azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground an old boot some cds and an ancient box of playtex
starts shoving the corpse into his pack
ive got my project
what are you losers gonna do
back to the shuttle
all of you
ill find them
relax soldier boy this is amazing
these remains are two hundred years old
yllos light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling
okay im outta here
kay em any thoughts
girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved scrotum during oral sex
yllo glares a thorgan
im trying to give her some personality
well stop messing with her
i dont want a science droid with a personality
now lets find them and get back
i want to get clearance to stay back and study this
im not staying here any longer
i have a life you know
a radio crackles
this rocks starting to freeze
get your ass back hre
into radio keep your shirt on
im working on it
you wont believe what we found
calls out adrienne
yllo rushes past the corpse
the others reluctantly follow
they pass another hanging sign danger they pass another corpse lying on the floor its torso separated from its legs
and this is just the beginning
as they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere
there was a hall of a battle down here
s they move further they break a laser beam
a warning voice sounds
do not enter er
but the group keeps moving
i feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that
a corpse lies on the floor before them its skeletal hand beneath a warning written in ancient blood
suddenly another corpse leaps at them screaming like a banshee
everyone screams it lands on kkinsa who totally freaks trying to get the corpse off her
delongpree and yllo help kkinsa fight the rotting corpse
they hear hysterical laughter and look up to see adrienne and stoney
emerge from the shadows laughing uncontrollably
what the hell are you two doing
kkinsa eyes adrienne then glares at stoney
youre toast mister
youre both toast
you gotta see this
they turn down the right corridor passing beneath ceiling consisting of a jumbled mess of jagged metal
re ceiling thats a strange design dont you think
we dont have time for this shit
as they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and squeeze together
that cant be a good thing
stoney and adrienne stop at a huge metal door
above the door
adrienne points to a small window in the door
i had cryo last year
check it out
with a smirk adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door
drawn from the inside in blood is a final warning so dont open the door
look beyond it yesterdays news
yllo pushes his way to the window
inside the blue tinted room we see a huge domed cryo cylinder
its massive but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room
curled up into a ball is a body female young
the rooms still operational
shes perfectly preserved
yllos face lights up grabs his radio
into radio fat lou bring the ship to the following coordinates
call grendel have them power up the labs were bringing in the find of the century
now wait a minute
i dont think you should open that door
this is a science excursion corporal
just stay out of the way
yllo turns to the kids
hes very excited
okay no screwing around
this is the real thing
do exactly what i say
okay thorgan open it up
thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget
youre opening the door
what about the
she points to the skull and crossbones
im thinking we should call in some experts
this is your find people
you want to give your credit away
i was just saying
the cryo unit leaked
the computers sealed the room
no airborne viruses no hazardous materials
ive shut down the until
alright stand back
hold your breath
initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious
knock you on your ass pal
they don their face masks as
the metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft
the freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas
ice crystals crack and fall to the floor
kay moves into the room ahead of the others
they are not human
mechanical digital but alluring
they dilate open up
colored lasers shoot forth slicing through the gas scanning the body
which itself is slumped over
an icicle of frozen blood from the wound in her shoulder props the body up
the other enter the icy chamber
i speak on behalf of the group when i say
female nineteen years old eight months
bitch is built like a brick shit house
ill fix her when we get back
time of hibernation
crystallization at seventeen percent
suggest extensive nanotech
chances of rejuvenation eight one percent
whats going on
bitch looks dead to me
the radio crackles
yllo sergeant brodski
get your ass back to the shuttle
into radio keep your shirt on sergeant
we have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime
get them the hell out of there
janessa removes a metallic cube from her backpack clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground
kicker grabs yllo
were outta here
yllo pulls away leans over the frozen girl grabs the frozen string of blood and crack breaks it off
fine grab that end
kicker sighs and helps yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher
as thorgan stands at the massive cryo unit hey check this out
protruding from the door is the tip of a machete
this caused the leak and theres an occupant
thorgan yanks the door open
dont touch that
gas rolls out
suddenly alarms sound and lights strobe
this is bad no
relax its only a glitch in the system
first field trip and you think youre a scientist
move out of the way geek
janessa moves to look inside the chamber
as the gas and steam clear we hear the sound of cracking ice see a jagged mass of frozen crystals
and within it
a chunk of ice cracks and falls tot he floor then the mask of jason voorhees looms forward
janessa screams as jasons body stiff as a board crashes to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere
jesus used to make the suckers big didnt they
again kay ems eyes scan the frozen body
subject was dead prior to incubation
yllo moves to get a good look at jason
my god look at him
why would they freeze a dead body
a beat alright load him up and lets get out of here
a pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor
one of boemans gadgets starts to beep
im picking up some movement
azrael screams as a laser slices into the room
his left arm falls to the ground
kay em rushes to him
her finger pops open
a needle appears
she injects him
the drugs take immediate effect
check out my arm
the metallic spiders lasers attached to their bodies clank towards our heroes
im on it
kicker slams the cryo door shut as lasers slice into it
there goes prom night
kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm
theyre only class two
i can handle this
not a problem
kay em injects him again
im missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr re shot oh thats dreamy
the lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges
okay rent a cop do your shit
i gotta date tonight
he pulls a gadget from his pack punches in a series of buttons
we have to get these two back in one piece
kay em turns to the frozen girl
subject is critical
needs nano stabilization immediately
i wish it would stop doing that
at her feet azraels arm twitches spastically
drugged up that is soooo cool
kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget
kicker throws open the door and starts blasting
yllo and the kids follow him into the hall the two stretches in tow
they disappear around the bend towards the exit
a beat then
they run back into view
behind them a dozen laser wielding spiders make chase
some are old and rusty other slump over and short out but those that work
kicker is running backwards blasting with his weapon
lasers flashing all around our group
have i told you guys how much i hate this class
we need another exit
ill hold em off
teach find a way out
im on it
sorry kid leave this to the pros
re gadget left at the end of the hall
a laser strikes the body of jason voorhees breaking off a chunk of ice
reading from device theyre not after us
their sensors are locked in on
thorgan points to jasons stretcher
leave him behind
hes coming with us
they round a corner
were one meter from the surface
he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling
rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above
its too high
kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting
make it happen
theyre just subclass b droids
im so not impressed
stoney you catch
stonet leaps grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very acrobatic move
boeman kneels cups his hands to make a step
he begins tossing his friends up to stoney as kicker makes war in the hall
soon boeman and kicker are the only two left
boeman leaps up grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety
he spins around and holds his arm out for kicker
kicker leaps grabs boemans hand
boeman strains to pull him up as spiders cover the floor below them then a spider crawls up kickers leg a spike shoots out into kickers thigh
theyve got me
boeman roars and pulls harder
kickers pack rips from his body the spiders falling with the pack
the sand storm is raging on the surface
kicker lands on top of boeman
that wasnt so bad
kicker bites the pin from a grenade tosses it into the hole
yells this will be
the others dive for the ground as kafoom
a fireball rises up out of the hole
and you said high school was boring
our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle
fat lou is waiting at the ramp
he looks at the two stretchers
oh my god
what the hell is
just get us to the ship
azrael stops in a panic
oh shit i forgot my arm
she hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp
the door closed the shuttle lifts off the ground and soars into the sky
the shuttle maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit
old satellites the front quarter of a space shuttle etc
navigating through the debris fat lou grabs a radio mike
this is beowulf approaching from sector fifteen
through the front windshield we see grendel a class iv catamaran transport
it looks like two huge torpedoes attached by three thin walkways
not new but by no means old
ive got you beowulf
proceed with docking
and by the way brodskis pissed
the shuttle doors open revealing sergeant brodski and six e x grunts standing with weapons at the ready
as the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two stretchers brodski stepsi n front of yllo
what the hell were you thinking
yllo ignores him turns to his team
get them in the lab
not so fast yllo
theres a protocol here
the e x grunts step in front of kids
to the grunts back off
back to the kids get them to the labs
the team moves through the grunts
what the hell are you doing
brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young womans body on it
this is way over your head pal
we need to call some experts and
i am an expert
youre a teacher
brodski ill talk slow so you can understand me
if we dont get her to the lab shell die and that will be on your bald fucking head
what if theyre carrying
did you even check
subjects scan virus clean
brodski attempts to shove kay em out of his way
but she stands her ground
grabs his crotch
mmm you like the rough stuff dont you big boy
brodski and yllo look at thorgan
ill fix her
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesnt carry something metal tits cant detect
well when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her
i dont like it
i dont give a shit
this ones prime for decryonization
were brining her back
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists
i am a scientist you asshole
this could be the most important discovery in years
do you have any idea what a find like this could mean
right now i care only for the safety of this crew
you dont know anything about these two the stretcher with jason moves by them
brodski looks down
jesus what the hell is that
thats exactly what we need to find out
check your orders sergeant
i out rank you where discovery is concerned
now step aside
i have a medical emergency to deal with
reluctantly brodski steps aside
as the kids follow azrael bumps into dallas one of the e x grunts
azrael glares at him brandishing the severed limb
watch it punk im armed
dallas slaps azrael across the back of the head as he passes
youll pay for that
dallas and the grunts laugh
fat lou and bernie a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in his pilots chair set course for home
into radio grendel to grendels mother we are enroute
copy that grendel
computer ovverides deployed
see you in two days
dark quiet until the lights glare on
lab one doubles as a medical research center and sick bay
glass jars filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back wall
yllo and the students bring the girl in
their movements are hurried and economical
but theyre excited
get her prepped for the soup
to adrienne take the other one to lab two
yllo this is my find
i want to be in here
i know dear but this is too big a discovery
i need you to prep the second body
but i want
this is a discovery that we will all share
we have to work as a team
stoney go with her
thorgan and delongpre lift the girl onto the rejuvenation table
stoney whispers something to kkinsa before he exits with adrienne
kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge scanning maching over to the girl
she starts the scan as delongpree and thorgan cut the clothes off their find
have i told you guys how much i love this class
delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face
thorgan cuts her shirt off
talk about your hard nipples
adrienne and stoney push jason into the lab
lab two is smaller and less high tech than lab one
they shove jasons body onto the exam table
thinks he can push me aside
this is my find
she removes chucks of ice from jasons face
you know even though we both found this guy ill let you take the credits
you can take it from here
its just another dissection
youll only get in my way
besides youre into this shit
stoney leaves adrienne alone with jason
and he is thawing
yllo walks around the room overseeing all the action
hes excited and cocky
hands on training is rare
you should consider yourself lucky
azrael sits in a large machine
the nano tech
it can repair non fatal injuries with the use of nano technology
azrael is scanned by the nt and so is his injury
it goes into action as articulated mechanics begin to re attach his arm
another hour and id have lost the arm
oh was that the hand you beat off with
i better get extra credit for this shit
how you doing
delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his shoulder
swallows hard im okay
well shes definitely a blond
oh thats scientific
you think all girls from the past looked this good
shes not that great
i bet shell be horny
okay people we need to learn everything there is to learn about our two guests
and if all goes well ill mention each one of you when i make my nobel prize speech
underbreath yeah right
delongpre presses a button on the table
the edges of the table rise up to create a clear dome around the table
a hot gel like substance shoots out of small tubes
the frozen body is covered in the nano gel
thorgan checks a monitor
everything looks good
yllo smiles gushing self satisfaction
turn up the heat
adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen
crystallization remains seventeen percent
adrienne scans jason with a machine identical to the one kkinsa was using in lab one
crystallization at sixty percent subject classification
put it on the screen
a monitor lights up with a scan of jasons body
the internal organs are distorted and bloated
she keys into the next lab
back to lab one
over speaker guys check out beef cakes scan
jasons d scan appears on one of the big monitors
look at the brain
within jasons skull is a brain the size of a golf ball
its just like thorgans
what do you think this means
thorgan grabs his crotch
this is what it means right here
small brains make your balls itch
and whats with the headgear
the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty twelve
a medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks
what do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources
she eyes stoney
he smiles knowingly
this bores me
this is so cool
prep defib and start the cell reconstruction
kay em presses a series of buttons
a long needle punctures the girls neck
jasons scan is replaced by the girls
we see nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells
kkinsa and stoney back out of the room unnoticed
is she stable
subject is stable and cell reconstruction has begun
i need about fifteen
call me if there are any changes
if she farts i want a full report
dont i deserve a sick day or some shit like that
the door swishes open
stoney enters with kkinsa close behind
kkinsa raises her hand
of all people
stoney moves back
kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head
its over between us
youre the one i want
kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head
a bed slides out from the wall hitting stoney in the back of the legs causing him to fall on the bed
kkinsa straddles him
stoney grabs her
the two fall into a feverish kiss
adrienne is prepping various medical tools
jasons body is laying on an autopsy table
steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his thawing flesh
she turns on a computer monitor
prepare organ vats
two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows
okay big boy
she picks up a long sharp chrome tool and walks over to jasons body
continuing lets see what youre made of
yllo enters and approaches a computer console
the door behind him opens
all this science shit makes me horny
removes her shirt take off your cloths we dont have much time
she drops her shirt to the floor
yllo retrieves it hands it back
youre quicker than usual
you prefer an apple
he forces her into the hall closes the door locks it
he returns to the console
to console secure line
perez joshua solaras space lab
a huge cylindrical ship floats quietly
we hear a beeping sound
joshua perez rolls over clicks on a light
he fumbles for a button presses it
a wall monitor lights up revealing yllos face
you son of a bitch you know what time it is
we just left old earth
youll never believe what we found
yllo inserts a disk into the console
im sending you the files
testy yeah yeah if this is another ancient farrari
im bypassing regular channels
see what kind of payday were looking at
begins download alright im
reacts to file no way
is this a joke
adrienne leans over jasons thawing body
oozing goo drips from the slab
she is inches away from his steaming mask
she taps it with her tool
she begins working at the straps of the mask cutting the overgrown flesh away
yllo studies a monitor
on screen a document entitled exclusive rights of discovery
he talks on the secure line
hypothetically how much are we talking
if youre for real youre looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone
doesnt include touring and guest lectures
when can you get them here
ill reset our course
see you then
yllos face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune
janessa has hooked up a small device to the door
shes heard every word
kkinsa rips off stoneys shirt
stoney grab her and rolls on top of her
close on jasons hand it curls the frozen joints crackle
adrienne turns from jasons mask
a large wad of goo hits the floor
she turns back to her work
slicing flesh away from the mask
stoney and kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each others pants off
adrienne tries to pry the mask off
but it holds firm
she stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole
we hear disgusting noises as she probes jasons eye socket
she removes the tool and on the end is jasons eye
holding it close she looks at it
it is bloated and distorted
she drops it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station
kkinsa rolls on top of stoney
she holds his arms down as she whispers in his ear
how bad do you want it
stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her
adrienne turns again then approaches
thawing has caused possible muscle spasms
she frowns at the disgusting ooze
a mixture of swamp waters blood and other thawing bodily fluids puddle around jasons body
she moves back to her work station and picks up jasons bloated eye
she takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye
the laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out of the eye
adrienne stares into a microscope
this is all very interesting
stoney lies on top of kkinsa
a moment then both gasp as he enters her
jason sits up
close on adrienne as she studies the dripping eye
she puts the laser down and turns to the slab and freezes
she spins around only to find jason standing behind her
he grabs her by the throat
she cant scream
she kicks wildly as he studies her
delongpre boemen kay em and thorgan wait and watch girl in the nano gel
thorgan is getting impatient
he cant find something
anybody seen the reticulator
adrienne is thrown into a work light
the room goes dark
try next door there was one there yesterday
the lights go
thorgan looks around
through the thick glass where jason is killing adrienne is blackness
wakey wakey love birds
yllos gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working
thorgan roots through a drawer his back to the glass
through the glass beside him we see adrienne screaming
but no sound
all rooms are air tight
her head is smashed on the glass
still screaming her face recedes back into the darkness as thorgan looks over his shoulder
stoney you dog
as he dunks adriennes head into one of the metal sinks
her body goes limp
he pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head eyes open mouth locked in a scream
he thumps the head against a wall
jason drops the body with a thud then turns to the dissection tools
he chooses a long silver cleaver
jason walks into the corridor from lab two steam still rising from his cold body
he heads away from lab one as soon as hes out of sight yllo appears
delongpre wakes as yllo enters
all right lets do this
thorgan begin the defib program delongpre ready the drainage units
boerman get the others in here
boeman grabs a wall mike
kkinsa straddles stoney
weve got a heartbeat
her back arches in ecstasy
no shit weve got a heart beat
stoney you copy
hell yeah im coming
yes right now
stoney put your pants on and get your ass down here
they jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door
stoney hits the door release and the door swishes open revealing standing in the hall
he swings the silver cleaver
stoney sidesteps as kkinsa screams
stoney slams his palm into the door panel
the door swishes to close but jasons hand reaches out and stops it
engines wine as jason struggles to force the door open
stoney keeps pounding the panel trying to make the door close but jasons too strong
jason grabs stoney by the arm jerks him into the doorway and releases the door
the door closes
splitting stoney from forehead to crotch
splashed with blood kkinsa falls to the floor cowering
yllo janessa thorgan boemen and delongpre anxiously huddle around the frozen girls body
probes dangle in the gel
what about the others
shouldnt we wait
ive waited long enough
you know what to do
kay presses buttons
we hear the whine of something powering up
brodski enters the lab
what the hell are you doing
fine just stay out of my way
turns to kay hit it
an electrical noise flares the screen to white running freshly killed bodies at our feet
small fists beat against a door
the door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their forties
we recognize her as the frozen girl
her name rizzo pretty
standing at the end of the corridor back lit and ominous is jason voorhees
he marches towards her
snatches a headset from a wall mount
somebody help me
static from the radio
she reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead security guard
jason keeps coming
as she rounds a corner we see she opens the door and enters the cold room
slips on the wet frozen ground nearly falls
on jason as he rounds the corner sees the open door
jason enters his machete held ready
he stares at the huge cryo unit
otherwise the room is empty
rizzo is standing in the hall the shotgun ready
you son of a bitch
jason slides backwards on the slick floor
further he nearly falls
he stumbles falls backwards into the cryo unit
rizzo slams her palm onto a console the cryo unit door closes jason rizzo tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad
steam hisses engines hum to life
the cryo unit bucks violently
cryo unit activated
slowly the unit goes silent still
rizzo stares at it approaches slowly staring at the fogging glass the machete bursts through the glass slicing into rizzos shoulder
the cryo labs main door slams shut
cryo unit leak
lock down in progress
security measures on line
she rushes toward the door
it wont budge
gas filters into the room from the leak in the cryo unit
subject in computer unit has reached full incubation
rizzo begins to fade
cryo gas rolls along the floor
as blood pours from her wound she reaches her bloody hand to the glass window and draws then passes out
rizzos eyes pop open
she gasps for breath
coughing and splitting the gel like substance
shes sitting in a foot of gel naked yllo brodski and the kids around her
that one did it
yllo moves close to rizzo
we should expect a moment of disorientation
rizzo punches yllo in the nose
she broke my fucking nose
again proving that your ancestors were savages
i like her already
live signs full strength
heart rate above normal rizzos disoriented confused
gel slops all around her
shock im alive
you brought me back
rubbing his nose obviously so
rizzo looks down at her body gel dripping off her naked flesh
what the hell is this shit
delongpre gives her a blanket
she covers herself
how did i get here how did you bring me back
but nanotechnology is impossible
weve had nano tech for the last years
how long was i out
rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is
something is very wrong in her world
the year is
youve been frozen for the past four hundred years
rizzo gasps a shocking revelation
now lay back we need to do some tests and i have some questions
the hockey player
he a friend of yours
hes not a
old earth is dead
we need to do some tests
id like to ask you a few questions
thats right now if you could
delongpre frowns at yllo and moves to rizzo
it can wait
lets get you cleaned up
delongpre helps rizzo off the table
wait a minute
give it a rest yllo
she needs some time
rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space
cleaned up she is quite beautiful
rizzo is startled
she looks around
delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food
i thought that after hundred years you just might have a little bit of an appetite
he puts the food on a small table and moves to the window
youre on grendel a class iv catamaran transport
its basically a school bus
were on our way back to earth ii
its finals week
she turns back to the window
youre telling me im a friggen class project
delongpre flinches expecting to be hit
a beat sort of
i mean no not really
she collapses onto the bed
ill give you a moment alone
do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection
shes lost everyone and everything
shes lot years
delongpre backs out of the room closing the door behind him
rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes
she reaches into the pocket of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys
the key chain holds a picture
a picture of her parents
she sits on the bed and starts to cry
as delongpre enters all eyes turn to him
she needs a little time
shit shes had years
yllo laughs at his own joke
thats really funny
id want her statements before we reach porch
yeah like youd be a rock after everything she went through
rizzo approaches delongpre and yllo
hes on this ship
of course he is
hes the most relevant find in years
except for you of course
look if youre worried about pr dont be
youre walking and talking
hes a stiff
youll get the publicity
glares are you finished
yllo nods then rizzo punches him again
will you stop doing that
oh i like her a lot
im with you kid
where is he
points lab two relax
whats the matter
no youre dead
youre all dead
she shoves delongpre out of the way and out the door
the others enter to find rizzo leaning over adriennes headless body
oh my god
what have you done
what have i done
thorgan throws up
into a mike brodski
get to lab two
we have an emergency
wheres the hockey player
ill tell you where he is
hes walking around this ship killing anything that moves
maybe she tripped
brodski and kicker burst into lab two they react to the carnage
oh man what the hell happened
cant you see
he did this
he was dead before he entered cryo statis
there is no possible way he could be alive
i didnt say he was alive
azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes
stea hisses lights hes dressed in full military garb a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder
something watching azrael his back to us
the stalker closes in
suddenly azrael hits rolls and comes up blasting right at us
a huge alien creature fangs claws and so on leaps at him
the big blaster hits home
the alien disintergrates
sitting on the floor azrael sighs and wipes his brow
suddenly another alien rises up behind him with a hideos screech
theres nothing azrael can do
hes a goner
a blast from elsewhere disintergrates the creature
move to dallas the grunt azreael had words with earlier
thats nine to four geek boy
you got lucky
you got lucky
i could have waited until he ate your head
speaking of which duck
dallas hits the deck as azrael fires disintegrating another
beyond it lunge a half dozen more
dallas and azrael scramble to their feet take aim when green goo squirts from its body
slashes through another alien splitting it down the middle
azrael smiles knowingly
he takes aim and lets loose a blast at jason
aliens scatter as the blasts hits jason dead on
dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror
their assault has no effect on jason whatsoever
why wont he go down
suddenly the aliens freeze in place
jason stares at them then turns to dallas and azrael
hes not part of the program
they brought ancient hockey guy back to life
jason walks up to them
titls his head like a dog hearing a high pitched whistle
why arent they running
were playing a game here
get off the court
jason raises his silver blade high
no were playing a game
not you numbnuts
the blade slices through azraels shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage
blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body
azrael does not seem hurt only pissed
asshole that does not count as a kill
yes it does
oh come on
jason is confused
he spins and slashed taking dallas head clean off
the head falls to the ground then dallas speaks
okay enough of this shit
the sound of an engine shutting down
jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court all white sterile
no creatures no dallas or azrael
a both ends of the white garganuan room we see a small tinted glass
azraels voice booms over a loud speaker
clear off the court asshole
azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit
dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth
i dont have all day kid
yeah yeah i better call the labs see what the hell is going on
jason stares at the tinted glass of azraels booth
into mike lab
this is az in the game grid
your guy got out and runined our game
the reaction to the broadcast
azrael can you repeat that
get him out of there
into mike i said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game
jason starts to close in on azraels pod
continuing send someone to the grid to pick him up
he looks lost
i told you
get them out of there
grabs mike get out of there
get out of there now
into mike all right fine well head back suddenly jason shoves his fist through the glass
the sounds of azraels death broadcast over the lab
when jason retrieves his hand he holds a bloody mass of azraels insides
in the lab brodski takes charge
into mike sarge
get the fuck down here
we got a real shitstorm in the dallas fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself into combat mode
jason hears the movement
turns flings his silver blade
it flies across the room throught the glass and impales dallas throat to his chair
the blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to black
as the connection goes to static
into mike dallas
do you copy
theyre both dead
you dont understand what is on this ship
this is a being that kills
thats what he does
thats all he does
and he is very good at it
get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on
she gets up and heads for the door
where are you going
we have to get off this ship
yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again
why dont you get it
hes going to kill us all
i doubt that
i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us
just get everyone together get off the ship
and then blow it to kingdom fucking come
thats the only way youre going to live
you just need to relax
rizzo tis the future
we have soldiers on board e x grunts the baddest of the bad
and their weapons
im sure are slightly more advanced than what youre used to
i hope so
sven and kicker approach the door
casually weapons slung low
the doors hiss open the black maw of the game grid on the other side
are they playing
their combat sense perks up a bit
somethings not right
they turn on their lights and ready their weapons
wide hard beams of light search for anything
sven as his beam hits azraels pod
from inside pod as sven and kicker approach
the blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights
kicker breaks off to inspect the other pod sven tries to hold down his lunch
sarge this is bad
the kids his guts are ripped out
over radio dead
kicker reaches the other pod
the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend
into radio sarge this is kicker
dallas got it to
real slice and dice
what should we do
everyone is in shock except brodski
hes a pro
report to weapons
were going on a hunt
to himself time to kick some ass
from behind him a shape materializes
a hand reaches out of the darkness
spins around with his weapon at the ready
dont friggen do that
brodski is in assault mode
yllo whats your head count
looks like were missing two
stone and kkinsa
you know stoneys done everyone on this trip but me
whats up with that
brodski scans the room a tactical assessment
this place should be safe
get them back here
i dont want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident
as much as ive dreamed of doing that
brodski goes to rizzo while yllo buzzes stoneys cabin
i need to know what you know about this guy
dont go out there
you cant win
we need to get off this ship
thats all there is to it
not an option
im going to hunt this son of a bitch down
rizzo shakes her head
she cant get through to this guy
ive been a grunt for fifteen years
theres not a problem i cant fix with enough ammunition
yllo is getting no response
stoney if you can hear me get your ass down to the lab immediately
beat im going to see if i can find them
yllo opens the door and kkinsa is there
half naked covered in blood
janessa screams and the others gasp
kkinsa falls to the floor
whimpering in shock
boeman rushes over to her with a blanket
they all look to each other searching for what to say or do
rizzo puts her head in her hands
brodski double checks his sidearm as yllo follows him down the hall
all im saying is dock with space lab couple of hours no more
let them take a look at our friends
not a chance
just dont go in there half cocked
you guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later
you got that right
they arrive at the door of the weapons room
this thing could be worth a great deal
not to mention what the fat cats on earth ii would pay for it
look ill split it with you
the door opens
the e x grunts are all there
weapons in a rack on one wall
they are in various states of battle dresss
yllo follows brodski in
brodski turns and faces him his men behind
on my watch
that thing is out there its dead
you got it
now get out of our way
get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats
weve got a job to do
yllo enters pissed off
the others are standing around not sure what to do
boemen turn on the tracking monitors
rizzo walks over to kay em
thorgon is working on her
barbie from hell
cybernetics science droid fluent in over six
yeah cpo i saw star wars now how about you help me get out of this coffin barbie
im afraid i cannot assist
rizzo is very frustrated
im surrounded by idiots
you need to get laid
thorgon looks up from his work
sorry im working on it

hell kill us all
you know that dont you
re monitor theres been an unauthorized entrance to the cargo bay
lets move out girls
yllo go to lab two and cover out backs
into the mic at least try to get him alive
will ya brodski
kicker sven condor briggs and geko are locked and loaded
dressed in full armor packing massive high tech weaponry they are a sight to see
jason may have met his match
alright the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees
i say shoot to kill
the boys fidget with excitment
bout time they see some action
so after youve killed him put one in his knee so we can say we tried
the men laugh and high five
go to infrared stay in radio contact
into headset teach you there
yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors
through one we see the team standing at the cargo doors
yeah i got ya
i dont see anything inside though
you just keep an eye out
yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console
he has his own agenda
lets move out
the doors hiss open
a massive room
boxes stacked hihg some to the ceilin g creating a maze
two teams port starboard
they split up
the kids are standing at a schematic of the ship
several small blips are entering the cargo area
rizzo stands over thorgan to see the monitor
each blip represents a trained killer
its men like that fought off the pirates on earth ii battled jauntuns on the solar moons
for the moment rizzo looks distantly hopeful
so youre saying thse guys have like lasers and stuff
they could hack him to pieces
briggs and geko move side by side
condor brings up the rear
suddenly he is jerked out of view
close on condors face jasons hand around his throat
the eyes go dead the neck broken
rizzo sees something
her hopes fade
all eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips flickers and fades
e x grunt condor has flatlined
into mic sergeant this is boemen
sergeant brodski stops
youve lost condor
briggs geko talk to me
briggs and geko stare at each other
he was right here
damnit to hell
were coming to you
a blip flashes for a second on the screen
you see that
briggs geko movement beyond the boxed fuselage
briggs and geko split up moving around a large metallic tank
gun ready he moves around the crated fuselage slowly
i dont see anything
the blip flashes again
hes right there
in front of you
infarred pov reveal geko moving toward him
maybe you kids should stay out of this
briggs removes his gogles only to find jason standing before him holding gekos body
impaled onto his silver blade
he doesnt show up on
painful gurgles then two more blips disappear
turns jesus is this what it was like on your
rizzo is cowering on the floor her hands over her ears
shes sweating convulsing
sergeant youve lost two more men
cargo bay portside brodski and his remaining men double time it to the slaughter
briggs and geko lie dead jesus sarge what is this thing
where the hell are you
wheres our visuals
yllo is talking on aseparate mike
unwaakre of the slaughteri n the next room
fat lou were changing courses for the solaras space lab
ill need the sergeants okay on that
weve got a situation here
just do as youre told
soon as weve passed taras rings well make the course correction
yllo disconnects and turns to the other console
into mic ok sarge whats your status
whats my status
ive lost three men and your worthless fuck
after i kill this asshole im coming your yllo
but i didnt see
i got him
i got him
cheers from everyone except rizzo who knows better
she shakes her head
listen up duck fuckers you cant kill this thing
hes either unconcious or playing dead whichever he aint really dead
okay you know thats it for me
im outta here
isnt there an escape pod on this ship
theres a shuttle
alright been nice knowing you
whos with me
yllo said stay here
they got him
youre not leaving
sven is kneeling over jasons body
big sucker too
suddenly jason reaches up grabs the back of svens head and slams it into his mask
svens forehead shatters
as he races around a crate
svens body is within sight
his killer nowhere to be seen
where are you
elsewhere we hear gunfire followed closely by a scream
kicker crawls across the floor blood spews from his mouth
hes been split in half at the wait
his entrails dragging behind him
a machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his misery
dont look at me
im in high school
twisting and turning in every direction
set up an ion field around the cargo bay
well torch the sucker
youre a dead man
brodski races toward the cargo exit
we see brodski racing towards us
we also see jason lying in wait hidden by one of the crates
yllo considers then
on the monitor we see brodski move forward
he never saw jason coming
yllo turns his head
the kids stand in shock silently staring at one another listening to the static of the dead communications
boeman reaches over and clicks off the radio
rizzo leaps to her feet
lesson number one kiddies
you wanna get home safely then we get off this boat
kkinsa starts t cry
i dont understand
what does he want
he wants to kill you
and everyone on this ship
rizzo looks at everyone
a side door hisses open
youre not going anywhere
you wanna die
ignores her are we locked down
that doors the only way in or out and it wont open without the code
then we wait
were docking with space lab in less than an hour
what good will that do
they can deal with this sort of thing
very intellegent men
i bet theyll kick jasons ass at a spelling bee
look ice chip why dont you just chill out and let us handle this
try to calm down
just think youre going to be famous
to kids guys please come with me
youre not going anywhere
rizzo starts for the door but yllo grabs her arms holds them behind her
now hold on
we should hear her out
shes obviously dealt with this guy before
she just wants this thing dead
i got no problem with that
janessa readies a hypo
maybe if we knew a little bit more about what were delaing with here
janessa moves behind rizzo with the sedative
suddenly rizzo throws her head back salmming it into yllos nose
he cries out in pain
janessa lunges with the syringe but rizzo snatches her wrist grabbing the hypo burying it into janessas left breast
yllo rushes rizzo again but this time boeman stands blocks his path
leave her be
ok who do i gotta fuck to get off this boat
thorgan timidly raises his hand
listen to me
lets get off thsi ship
come with me
rizzo a shuttle out in the middle of space
well die oout there
rizzo rushes the door
theres a code box on the wall
how do you open the damn door
kkinsa punches in the code
the door hisses open
rizzo hes out there
yeah and hell be here soon enough
looks at delongpre last chance
the others stare at her
she and kkinsa exit the door swishes closed behind them
favoring his nose pack your shit
well disembark in an hour
the guys at space lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it
but the kids arent so sure
yllo enters makes sure he wasnt followed then approaches a console
computer on line
a series of beeps
what are you doing
cant you knock
back to console diminish power to shutttle beowulf
power to beowulf disengaged
to janessa shes too valuable
shes not leaving this ship
fat lou and bernie prepare for course corrections
disengage auto pilot
new course seven eighty one
she banks slowly to the right
eta minutes seconds
engage auto pilot
suddenly bernie is ripped from his chair
electricity shoots through the console as bernies dialog becomes jibberish
en en en en
fat lou stares up in shock just before jason slams bernies torso ontop of her
fat lous upper body has disappeared
in other words bernie now has legs
little good theyll do him
far in the distance we see a tiny space station space lab
a monitor reads
space lab eta and counting
rizzon and kkinsa enter
they head in that direction
then rizzo suddenly stops
rizzo pulls kkinsa close to one of the crates
hes in here
kkinsa opens her mouth to scream
rizzo slaps her hand over kkinsas mouth
you scream ill snap your neck
rizzo releases her
whispers how do you know
dread i just know
the crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with space lab
yll is standing before the others holding jasons machete
we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey
im thinking rizzo was right
thinking with your dick again delongpre
maybe we should go with them
like you said your space lab connections can deal with this thing
at least well be safe
they are not going anywhere
i cut power to the shuttle
the kids and crutch stare at him
rizzo and kkinsa approach
open the doors
kkinsa punches in a series of buttons
yllo grabs a mike from a console
fat lou whats the eta
bernie wheres lou
boeman moves to one of the consoles clicks a few buttons
we see the view from the bridge security camera
lots of blood and the mangled combination of lou and bernie
the ship doesnt need pilots to dock
well disembark and youll see
everything will be fine
thats gonna be a problem
the ships not on auto pilot
were flying blind
a beat thirty minutes till impact
all eyes turn to yllo for guidance his back to the outer door
well have to go to the bridge
jason is out there
then the outer door bucks and dents
over the headsets rizzo and kkinsa hear the screams
damnit hes got them
kkinsa keeps trying the code box
rizzo i think yllo must have done something
the door wont open
he cant get in here
but the door is starting to give
through the confusion crutch moves to one of the consoles
clicks away at the keyboard
the shuttle hums to life
the powers back up
then open the doors
what do we do
help me up
boeman helps crutch to the top of a table
crutch goes to work on a ceiling vent removing screws
okay im guessing you should hurry
the top corner of the door bends
jason peers through
jesus tell this asshole i dont play hockey
our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space
will that take us to the bridge
its a maze up there but yes
well engage auto pilot
everythingll be fine
with that the door gives
boeman heaves crutch into the crawl space then follows himself
jason pauses staring at kay em heart beat irregular
no blood flow
does not make sense
jasons heard enough
he swings his cleaver but kay em ducks
turns and leaps through the hole in the celing
yllo grips the ledge
move it people
then yllo screams
jason has him from below
boeman grabs his arms
delongpre grabs hold and pulls
suddenly yllo is jerked out of their grasp
they fall onto their backs breathing heavily
yllo leaps to his feet
jason looms over him
now hold on
have you considered how valuable you are
credit fame you can have it all
i mean how long has it been
jason stands there but his attention isnt on yllo
its on the machete sticking through yllos belt
jason reaches for it
yllo backs into a wall
jason slowly removes the machete from yllos belt and stares at it
he drops the cleaver to the ground
chuckles thats all you wanted
the shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset its okay he just wanted his machete
yllos screams turn to gurgles
all eyes stare at the opening in the walkway then now thats just gross
they race down the walkway over huge pipes and through electrical wires crutch in the lead
kkinsa enters the shuttle turns to rizzo
rizzo come on
but rizzo hesitates
we can still hear the panicked screams over the headset
go go go go go
hes right behind us
to kkinsa close the door
ill be right back
i gotta go back
rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving kkinsa nearly insane
im quite sure i wasnt designed for this
crutch comes to a fork in the walkway
okay we need to
you forgot didnt you you old fart
at the back of the line delongpre turns as jason rounds the bend behind him
delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of janessa and thorgan go
racing forward the group stays just out of jasons grasp
leaping over and under and through whatever blocks the path
jason swings his machete at delongpre
it just misses him
crutch comes to ascreened panel
boeman kicks it open
they leap down onto a catwalk crossing the they are twenty feet off the ground as rizzo stops stares straight up
the group races across the catwalk as json leaps down behind them
hes right on my ass
then jason grabs delongpre who screams
spots a gun left by one of the marines
she snatches it points it towards jason and delongpre then aims a little high
it slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling
the catwalk jerks
jason loses his grip on delongpre
suddenly metal screeches as the catwalk gives under the weight
it rips in half dumping both heroes and jason
rizzo dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the ground
janessa sits up rubbing her head
that was fun
kay em sits up sings
i got a brand new pair of roller skates you got a brand new key
i didnt do it
the fall scattered her programming
hes lying on top of jason
he scrambles to his feet
but jason doesnt move
hey i think the fall killed him
the group slowly gathers around
jason sits up and swings at thorgan
boeman pulls him out of the way just in time
jason starts to stand when rizzo comes up behind him
she brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of jasons head
the surrounded faces look happily suprised
trust me its temporary
boeman takes the gun from rizzo
better let me
whered you get the gun
rizzo gestures at whats left of gekos body
the bridge is this way
they take off running
everyone stops turns theres not enough time
rizzo catches up
forget the bridge the shuttles waiting
to kay em what do you mean not enough time
switches voice you know what you get if you shove two bananas up your ass
two shit covered bananas
i think your metal lovers losing it
normal voice impact in ten minutes
it will take fifteen to reach the bridge
switches voices sings mammas little baby love shortnin shortnin mammas little baby love shotnin bread
well im not hanging out here with ms
the kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius
crutch again leads them through the maze
delongpre stops at another grunt body removes a chain gun
thorgan takes a high tech laser from another
i feel better
now how do you fire this damn thing
ive a feeling hes right behind us
jokingly just around this bend
jason steps out in front of crutch his machete held poised in front of him
crutch runs right up onto the blade
alrhoguh hes meat on a stick crutch doesnt give up
he slams his fists into jasons torso
thorgan turns to fire boeman knocks the barrel high
youll hit crutch
boeman tosses his weapon to janessa and leaps on jasons back locking his arms around his neck
what are you doing
you cant save him
delongpre smashes the back of jasons knee with the chaingun
jason topples on top of boeman
crutch is thrown free
janessa and thorgan help crutch to his feet as jason sees rizzo for the first time in hundred years
its either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge
he leaps to his feet and races towards her
dont just stand there
to jason no you dont
the chaingun dances jason backwards
he crashes through the side of one of the cargo boxes
she jerks the gun from delongpre and races to the crate
you never stop when hes down
but the crate is empty
they spin around searching
weak forget him
carrying crutch they move toward the shuttle bay
panel clicks some buttons then uh oh
open the doors
kkinsa sits in the pilots seat
open the doors
delongpre shoves boeman out of the way
kkinsa open the goddamn door
yeah thats it scare the hell out of here thatll work
calming kkinsa its me rizzo
hes not out here right now so please let us in
kkinsa doesnt move
kkinsa crutch is hurt
we need access to the shuttles med kit or hell die
she reaches for a button marked shuttle doors
were going to be okay kkinsa
kay em steps forward
im trained in all aspects of the human psyche
rizzo backs away as kay em nears the mike
kkinsa dear it is i kay em
open the fucking door you silly bitch
rizzo shoves kay em out of the way
i didnt say i was good at it
there he is
jason is standing at the entrance to the cargo shuttle bay
kkinsa leans forward and presses the shuttle roars to life and begins pulling away from the ship
the shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position
rizzo opens fire
thorgan and delongpre join in
as boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire
its impossible to see where jason is
rizzo stops firing
but they dont let up
boxes explode crates collapse until thorgans gun clicks empty
the smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble
did we get him
suddenly jason again steps into the cargo entrance
years in the future and these pea shooters are the best you can do
they are trapped
jason blocks the only exit
he slowly moves towards them
just make a break for the door
hell get some of us but thats the breaks
were not leaving crutch
we dont have time to argue
but jason has locked in on rizzo
he moves towards her
okay tell you what
you die well run
rizzo and the others back into a corner
jason has them
theres nothing they can do
rizzo holds the gun steady waiting for point blank range
space lab which was only a dot the last time we saw it suddenly looms toward us
the left side of grendel smashes into the side of space lab
suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge
boxes cargo kids and jason
grendel slides along space lab ripping huge chunks of metal from both
there are interior explosions on space lab then space lab explodes
the entire ship shifts upwards
cargo crew and jason fly into the air
electrical fires sprout up all over
cargo boxes shatter contents rizzo loses her gun
debris from space lab tears into the side of the ship and beyond
one huge chunk heads right towards the shuttle
kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her
everything piled and in tatters
our heroes slowly regain their bearings
i think i broke my arm
i seem to have misplaced mine
kay em s right arm is missing wires sticking out of the stump
you geeks wanna gimmie a hand
janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble
boeman helps her to her feet
quiet we lost crutch
rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around crutchs body
its battered and twisted all out of place
boeman falls next to the body
goodbye old friend
okay he was a great guy now lets move out
snaps could you show a little compassion
rizzo stares at boeman
look im sorry
i really am but arent you forgetting about
suddenly a pile of rubble explodes
jason rises his back to them
back to the labs
but jason has other plans
seemingly unfazed by the past events he rushes after them
dam damage port side percent
gravity y rotors failing
our kids race toward the door jason right behind them thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm
the door wont open
they turn as jason looms toward them then cargo and debris
the loss of gravity and jasons steamrollering momentum slams him into the cargo doors breaking them open and sending him tumbling backwards
this is just great
kay em s left hand magnetically locks to the cargo frame a jason grabs rizzos ankle
boeman floating close punches jason in the back of the head
still holding rizzos ankle jason topples spinning the two out of frame
the force of the punch sends boeman in the opposite direction
this is crazy we cant do anything like this
rizzo kicks jason in the top of the head sending him slamming into the ceiling
floats past delongpre
theres a chain gun still clutched by the hand
delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on jason
jason is sent further back but the force of the chaingun slams delongpre into a back wall
hes knocked unconcious
as thorgan manages to grab kay em around the neck
grab my hand
janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious delongpres foot
boeman can you reach delongpre
well push you in
jason is floating toward the other end of the cargo bay unable to stop himself
reaches for delongpre
finally he grabs delongpre by the locks of his hair pulls himself closer
rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling
she manages to grab hold of a hanging piece of busted catwalk
to rizzo push off toward us
forget her shes a pain in the ass
let her hang there
crutchs body floats into our heroes his intestines spilling from his open gut tangling around our heroes
im gonna spew
that oughta help the situation
do it rizzo
well catch you
rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of thorgan janessa boeman and delongpre
what if you miss
what if we dont
as jason steadies himself against a wall focuses in one rizzo then pushes off with his feet
he rockets toward her
hes coming right at you
rizzo spots jason and pushes off
but her aim was hurried
shes gonna miss them
boeman flips in the air
to delongpre grab my feet
delongpre does and boeman reaches out and snags rizzo
the momentum spins the human chain into a near wall kafwam nearly breaking it apart
okay that hurt
thorgan pull us in
jason slams into the ceiling then careens off of the wall as thorgan pulls the group out of the cargo bay
they watch as jason grabs a hold of the walkway
hes gonna send himself right at us
jason takes aim
system repair activated
back up power on line
jason again rockets through the air when he drops to the cargo floor like a rock
falling cargo huge crates gargantuan machines a forklift buries him
our heroes tumble to the ground
to rizzo get off of me
they stand slowly eyeing the rubble
rubbing his arm you think it killed
off rizzos stare yeah i guess not
lets just get out of here
the ships in bad shape
back to the labs
lets check out status
our group makes their way back toward the labs
electrical fires are everywhere
systems are shorting out all over the ship
rizzo in the lead enters the lab when the ship bucks and quakes
a portion of the hall collapses behind her
boeman and the others dive back out of the way
the hulls imploding
can you hear me
are you guys okay
boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull
theres a red lever on the wall beside you
rizzo turns spots the red lever
emergency pressurization stabilizer
then break it
if you dont pull it the ships going to depressurize
rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table
bashes the bolt with it until it breaks
you have to reverse the pressurization
she grabs the lever
what are you doing
if the ship goes so does jaso
rizzo pull the fucking lever
its better this way
if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship
you want him on your precious earth ii
boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way
shes lost it
so what else is new
boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble
he grabs the lever
you know im right
are you crazy
pull the lever
boeman yanks the lever
as the others climb into the lab depressurization inconclusive
weve lost too much pressure
an hour tops
to rizzo you happy
youve killed us all
thorgan rushes over to the big nano tech machine
places his broken arm on the slab
the machine quickly goes to work
a schematic of his arm appears on the wall
janessa stares at him
whats the point
so thats it then
it seems it is
janessa stands over yllos decapitated body
its obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher student
there is a loud metallic whine from the ships hull
thats the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship
signing thats the sound of the men working on the chain gang
are there any other shuttles
some way to beam us the hell out of dodge
you read a lot of science fiction didnt you
a little late to be thinking about escape isnt it
ill never experience my fantasy of three sex droids two humans and a knofflapod
am i in there
thats a good fantasy though
kinky but good
all heads turn to rizzo
shes staring at a schematic of the ship
the left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures
rizzo points to the right hull
its the engine reactors audiometers its the stuff that makes the ship go zoom
rizzo points at the thin walk ways connecting the two hulls
can we get through these
sure but what good will that do
when the left hull goes so will the right
what if we blow the walkways first
leave jason over here to go up with the ship
they stare at her
you know yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive well hed be worth millions
the others stare at her as if she were crazy
any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental
im just saying
to others come on
you got all these gadgets and shit
why cant we get inside the right hull seal up the doors and blow the walkways
wed need charges
we could convert fission transistors
were not supposed to do that
what are you gonna do tell me
the engine room will have molecular welders
we could seal up the hull
a moment of consideration
could this actually work
yeah great idea
and ill keep the big guy distracted with a blow job
now this is getting exciting
remember to roll his balls around a bit
you got a better plan
obviously they dont
they got to work
boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet
ill need system four converters
theyre back here
bring em all
thorgans still hooked up to the nano tech machine
im not ready
then you better hurry
ill blow alley one delongpre you and rizzo take there
janessa you ready two and well meet up there
youre so bossy
youre leaving me here alone
delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him
dont blow your foot off
they climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear
its just you and me then
come here might as well fix that arm
boeman janessa delongpre and rizzo slowly move through the piles of debris
still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows
they move toward the rubble that had buried jason before
close on the rubble
there is an obvious hole dug out from the middle
i think i speak on behalf of the group when i say this is bad news
into headset thorgan
thorgan is fooling around in the back of kay em s head
the nano tech maching is doing a full diagnostics
into headset almost done
i disengaged your pain programming
sometimes i just wish i had a kitten
boeman enters throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a device to the wall of the huge glass connector
janessa enters and goes through the same motions
delongpre and rizzo attach a device to the wall
put your finger here
she does so
delongpre connects several wires
rizzo looks nervous
my father wanted me to be a businessman
thats why im here
so you thought youd be cool
go against your fathers wishes
yeah thats grown up
delongpre looks at her like shes crazy
my fathers company imports and exports
archaeology is part of the business
we happen to get along just fine smartass
look why dont you bust somebody elses balls for a change
i thought you meant
you thought i meant
too tough to apologize huh
you must have been a very lonely girl
thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall
it crashes to the floor
who are you apologizing to
boeman attaches another charge
keeps looking over his shoulder
standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy sight
janessa stops working listens
ka thump theres anoise in the cargo bay
she covers the mike on her headset and calls out
thorgan you little shit is that you
she quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of tranquillizer and a monster syring
e she fills this rhino syringe with a massive dosage
enough to bring down a rhino
or jason maybe
she starts moving down the walkway toward the cargo bay
surely shes not that stupid
rizzo is staring at delongpre as he works on another device
then when i was four the ocean quit producing life
too many pollutants
nuclear testing the occasional terrorist bombing
the atmosphere was shit by the time i was eight
we moved underground when i was twelve
delongpre stares at her
he doesnt want to speak and screw up this rare moment of sharing
the cargo bay is dark and looming
emergency lights strobe
its hard to make anything out
we hear rizzo speaking off screen
my father was an army scientist
the army thought they could develop humans able to survive the earth we had created janessa moves through the debris
we see janessa come into view
jason seemed to have the right stuff
radiation cell damage didnt matter
he just kept going
were you close to your father
thorgan interrupts over the headset
what did you do with the chain gun
into mike its on the table where i left it
what the hell are you doing
im on my way
thorgan quit screwing around and come on
im coming im coming
sorry you were saying
janessa approaches the pile of debris where jason was buried
i got along great with my father my mother too
dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years
janessa moves the debris around with her foot
they were all wrong
they couldnt control him
and what happend to
rizzo begins to tear up
i couldnt save them
well wed be dead without you
you know that dont you
she stares at him
chuckles you caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious
of course this is the first field trip i went on that had a body count
she gives him a half smile
im not much but i promise i wont let this guy get you
another half smile
its a sweet gesture but what can this guy really do
he watches janessa from a distance
moving slowly and silently toward her
she stands and turns as sergeant brodski grabs her
hes covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut
where is everybody
you scared the hell out of me
give me a break
hes what happened
then grendel hit space lab
waitll i get my hands on yllo
we thought you were too
takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down
jason s machete thrusts though brodskis gut
jason spins brodski around and tosses him to the floor
yup that oughta do it
jason turns on janessa
she stands frozen in fear
jason raises his machete and lights a flare blinding jason for the moment
then she sinks the rhino syringe into his chest
falls hard on his ass and sits there staring at her
well go on
jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside
jason starts to climb to his feet
janessa turns to run
weak he help me
he holds his hand out to her
then im blowing walkway one
the ship bucks
janessa runs leaving the sergeant behind
delongpre closes the door then were blowing three
he throws a switch
boeman vaults over a pile of rubble
janessa were on our way to you
holding hands delongpre and rizzo enter
the walkway is empty
janessa is gone
boeman rushes up behind them
you tell me
shes only set one charge
and its not finished
with that janessa tears into the walkway
shes out of breath
she can barely speak
where have you been
jason moves through the debris
hes coming straight for them
they race down the length of the walkway
jason right behind them
we cant lead him into the other hull
we dont have a choice
boeman slams the door panel
the door slowly rises
jason approaches stops stares at his future victims
if he could smile with anticipation
he raises his machete then stops
he turns his back on our heroes
they crane their necks to see what has pulled his attention
thorgan marches down the walkway with kay em
the new and imporved where her severed arm had once been a chain gun is now attached
a laser cannon is mounted over her shoulder
her body has been reinforced with steel from around the lab
sinks trays you name it
shes the junk yard mans terminator
then do i have to
yes ive reprogrammed you
you are very brave
we see a somewhat computerized image of jason through kay ems personal scan
one the display we see come on boy
lets see if we can open up cana whoop ass
the chain gun rings
jason is slammed into the hull doors
jason jumps up and rushes at kay em who catches him and tosses him down the walkway braaaattt
kay em opens up again
kay ems weaponry shoves jason out into the cargo bay witha blur of bullets
what are we waiting for
our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay
boeman and delongpre go to work setting the charges
to janessa where the hell were you
he came for me i had to run
into mike kay em you okay
dont worry about me
i live for this shit
and with that kay em blows the now standing jason into another wall with the laser cannon
toss me a chip
delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to boeman
thorgan youre brilliant
have i told you that lately
thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo bay
he looks sad
quietly see you around
kay em marches toward the downed jason and starts singing an old sea shanty
shes the yellow rose of taegu the girl that i adore
her cunt it smells like cock juice shes a good two dollar whore
you may talk to me of seoul girls or whores from tokyo but the yellow rose of taegu beats them all id you know
kay em blows jason into she kicks him down the long corridor
the hull screams from the exterior pressure
the ship rumbles
id say we have about ten minutes tops
then stop talking and work faster
jason bursts through the debris that had been blocking the lab
kay em enters behind him
still singing she was a young and charming girl her age was scarce sixteen
jason rushes kay em
she took me in and she kicked out a sailor and marine
his machete bounces off of kay ems new armor
she had no titties on her chest that didnt bother me kay em back hands jason across the room
he crashes into the glass speciments
goo and formaldehyde covering him
for what she had between her legs was big enough for three
boeman and delongpre are finishing up
okay janessa give me your last charge
janessa looks around then i
i dont know what i did
you lost the charge
he was chasing me
can we blow it with just two
if we dont sever the hull completely shell drag us down with her
then what do we do
i dont know
kay em stands over jason
and for the first time in ten films jason is in bad shape
but still climbs to his feet
why you low life scum sucking rat dick blowing sum bitch
your mamma musta had some huge balls
of course as anyone knows you dont diss jasons mother
jason leaps tacking kay em
they roll into another glass case
glass formaldehyde and specimens rain down on top of them
having lost his machete jason bashes at kay em with his fists
over and over
he catches a rhythm
kay em is trapped below
well it was a good plan
they look at one another hopless
then you stupid bitch
everyone jumps as sergeant brodski leans against the walkway door frame
hes bound his wounds with a make shift tourniquet wrapped around his mid section
damnit to hell you left me back there to die
we thought you were
to janessa well what have you got to say for yourself
i dont know
sergeant we could use a big bomb
were blowing the walkway
the sergeant tosses his pack to the ground
how much you need
a rain of firststaking on this droid from the future
finally jason stops
straddling kay em he stares at his kill
until condescending that was very good
you should feel very good about yourself right now
tough voice how could you hit a girl you sumbitch
kay em places the chaingun over jasons chest
jason is blown across the room
okay dip shit
time to finish you off so i can go home and boink your momma with a corndog
the kinky bitch
chaingun and laser cannon unleash a massive display on the fleshly body of the top portion of jasons mask shatters
his right leg is turned into a pile of meat then blown clean off for good measure
jason falls on his ass
he raises his machete arm
a last ditch effort
could he be that lucky
to throw a machete and stop this onslaught
singing bang bang maxewells silver hammer came down upon his head
doo pee do do
bang bang maxewells silver hammer made sure that he was dead
jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim for kay em
the laser cannon blows jasons left arm to hell
two more blasts send jason flying through the back wall and sliding across the floor
this time jasons body doesnt move
what have i done
kay em turns and races down the hall
thorgan im a murderer
boeman and delongpre hustle to set the final charge
blowing the walkway
you come up with that yourself
kay em steps into the walkway
shes covered in blood
what are you doing back
sad sumbitch wont be giving us anymore trouble
you killed him
regret blew half his skull away one leg one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab
and look at me
im covered in his filthy blood
you did good kay em
im proud of you
a real mammas boy that one
dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum
little good it did him
i dont know
suddenly the ships hull screams
the ship bucks
hurry up people
were running out of time
jasons body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw it before
this mass of torn flesh doesnt move
the ship bucks again
the machine hums to life
buzzing and beeping
suddenly a laser scans jasons body
jason is leaned up against the nano tech machine
thorgan runs wire to each device
as long as theyre connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance
two more charges to go
we see a schematic of jasons battered body on the monitor
nano technology is already at work
hoses and wires now encircle jasons body
we follow one of the hoses until it ends over nside we see pile of bullets
stuff falls from the hose
bullets from the chaingun bullets from every previous jason movie
a broken machete blade drops to the pile
the tip of an arrow
a couple of knives
a pair of pliers
an ink pen
the skeleton of a fish
the scanning lasers move to the stump at jasons shoulder
we see the image as a new arm fuzzy adn distorted is being constructed
on the schematic we see jasons internal organs being repaired
by now weve figured out
nothing good can come of this
kay em hits a button
the door begins to slide down slowly
lets move out
kid you ever thought about the marine corp
delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway welder in his hand
i need another minute
suddenly there is a grinding sound
engines whine from behind them
the group stops and turns
the cargo door is starting to smoke
it squeals as it slowly opens
well fuck me
no fuck me
the door opens and jason steps into the walkway
but hes no jason weve ever seen before
his leg and arm are now shiny metal
his clothes are black no longer tattered
his mask is we cant see them but we know
his insides are in better shape than ever
re engage killer instinct
kay em firs
but this time it doesnt seem to faze jason
sparks fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs
jason swings his new improved machete
it clangs off of kay ems armor removing a hunk of metal
jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway
one of the wires connecting two charges severs
kay em does a back flip kicking jason in the chest
hes shoved backwards
boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues
intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic killer
then kay em does a round house kick but jason uses his machete as a shield
kay ems leg is nearly sliced off at the knee
falls to the ground
boeman splices the wires together
then turns to see jason approaching
but jasons too close
he grabs boeman
as her body separates from her legs mid thigh
thrusters ignite from her lower thighs
as jason raises his machete to do boeman in ka fwam
kay em slams into him
knocking boeman free
jason and the now hovering kay em go at it again
metal against metal
kay em hovers up the walls over jasons head
but jason has come into his own with these new body parts
shes no match
finally jason rears back and shoves his fist though kay ems chestplate
his fist from kay ems chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat
thorgan moves toward his robotic love but boeman grabs him and pulls him down the hall
thats the best you can do
jason yanks his machete from the side of kay ems neck
severing her head from her body
it flies down the hallway behind the kids
is that it
come back and fight like a man
turns his glare on our heroes racing toward delongpre at the other end
delongpre lifts his welders mask to call to the others when he sees shit hurry
run toward the door
but thorgan stops
thorgan turns runs back toward jason
what are you doing
thorgan is running to retrieve kay em s head
it lies between he and jason
hell never make it
thorgan hits the floor slides and scoops up the head
i think im going to throw up
jason raises his machete from his belt and hey dickhead
rizzo nails him with a metal ar
to thorgan go
jason stumbles backwards then whirls on rizzo
oh yeah you remember me
he sure does
she turnsa dn runs
as the others race into the engien room they turn to watch
dont we have another gun
rizzo catches up to thorgan but they have a long way to go and jason is gaining
theyre not gonna make it
close the door before he gets us all
theyll make it
close the fucking door
janessa leaps forward and hits the switch
the door begins sliding slowly shut
boeman hits the button again
glares at janessa forget it
i had to rewire it
once its started it wont stop
get ready to blow it
rizzo dives slides under the closing door
thorgan follows her lead but his slide doesnt have the same force
he stops with the door coming down on his lower back
luckily delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through
the door closes
boeman turns the switch
the charges blow
a fireball rushes toward the running jason
the walkway explodes severing grendel into two separate hulls
the left damaged hull sinks out of view as the engine side begins to pull away
then grendels left hull finallay explodes
they barely amde it
the right hull bucks from the force of the blast
our heroes are aireborne for a moment then crash to the floor
boeman climbs to a console
we made it
i think maybe we did
thorgan looks into kay em s severed head
kay em we made it
im so pleased
id clap if i could
boeman clicks on a console keyboard
ive changed the course for earth ii
and i sent a distress signal
whats the problem
into mike our ship has been damaged most of the crew dead
we need evac
copy that grendel
you should hit earth ii orbit in fifteen minutes
rescue eta twenty minutes
were going home people
rizzo turns to find delonpre staring at her
big smile see
were not so bad
not so bad
theres that moment when we think the two might kiss
she takes a step toward him
yes they are going to kiss warning lights
the sound of sucking wind
as jason still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his metal hand
as he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to hold on to anything
the hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space
boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door
he pulls sergeant brodski through the door as fights his way through the opening in the hull
the engines buck and begin to smoke
the pressures cause the engines to overheat
delongpre helps rizzo and thorgan to safety
janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh
lying in the doors threshold reaches out and snags her hand
pull me in
im pulling damnit
but jason grabs janessas ankle and jerks
shes pulled from the sergeants grasp
she flops around in the sucking wind as jason watches
he lets go
she flies toward the hole slams into it
everything goes quiet for a moment
as he body has sealed the hole then shes sucked into space in a most grotesque manner
well thats a shame
hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room
they hum quietly as our group enters
we need weapons
all this technology and what good has it done
it bought us some time
and now were all out of it
everyone stares at boeman
hes standing at another console
the ships depressurizing the engines overheating
when it reaches the core were done
why am i not surprised
thorgan still clutches kay em s severed head
you must shut down the engines
then do it
the rescue ship can find us here right
cant shut em down from here
somebodys gonna have to go back to the engine room
you aint catching my ass in there again
brodski still bleeding pale struggling to stand ill go
the kids give him the are you crazy
youre too weak
everyone jumps but this time its only rizzo
she broke a metal stand and has yanked one of the legs free
you know this future shit sucks
ill fucking do it
mumbling wait around on your asses all day
turns to thorgan ill need a distraction
what kind of a distraction
jason is pounding on the reactor room door
a difficult act with the continued pressure trying to suck him into space
jason turns to find rizzo standing in the doorway behind him
you want some of me
jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he goes
rizzo backs slowly as jason closes in
as he reaches the corridor she turns and runs
come on keep up
jason barrels toward her
you want some of me or not
she stops at a door but doesnt attmept ot open it
jason comes closer
but rizzo doesnt move jason moves in for the kill raises his machete and take your best shot laughs im melting
her arm falls to the ground
see now that was stupid
persistent yes but stupid
jason shoves his fist through her chest and into the wall
not this time asshole
this time im gonna watch you burn in hell
the real rizzo rips off her virtual reality helmet
make it fast
delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad
both are wearing headsets
almost got it
as jason returns to the engine room none too pleased at being tricked
hurry up guys
weve got the rescue ship on radar
out of time
rizzo jersk delonpre and both spill into the reactor corridor
rizzo slaps the panel
the door closes
shutting out jasons image
damn that was close
the engine room door rips in half
jason climbs through
into radio guys hes right behind us
just come on ive got an idea
they race down the long corridor toward the reactor room
thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard
boeman stares out the docking bay window
theres damage lots of it
into radio the docking bay was damaged after the explosion
meet us at the airlock
reactor room corridor
to rizzo you ever space walked
oh sure all the time
they leap through a door closing it behind them then keep running
jason barrels right through the door
into headset damit thorgan whatever youre doing
youd better hurry
growls i hate the future
rizzo and delongpre enter in a mad rush
delongpre closes the door
little good itll do
jason kicks the door with his metallic leg
the door shatters and he stumlbes into forest cabins the lake
everything as we and jason remember
but somehow distroted
a strange hue covers everything
no on second look its not exactly the way we remember
the trees are strange looking
not the pines and oaks of connecticut but something foreign
the cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a camp
but the image will do
thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away
boeman is wearing a space suit
hes helping sergeatn brodski into his
at the other end of the huge room jason wanders
he cant see us
rizzo glances out the docking bay window
we see a planet much the same color as earth but the continents are wrong
delongpre leads rizzo to a suit
ill help you in
into headset kay em youve saved our lives you know that dont you
kay em s head sits on the floor in the center of room
it was my pleasure my love
perhaps if all works for the best you can rebuild me and we can try that doggie style thing again
the others stare at thorgan
he looks embarrassed to say the least
i knew you were a little sick but geez
singing happily i get no kick from champaign mere alcohol doesnt faze me at all but i get a kick out of you
under his breath goodbye my love
thorgan suit up
to rizzo this is gonna work
if he sticks to the program
stick to the program
his mother was killed before his eyes
thats what drove him insane
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit
she smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand
jason slowly walks beside kay em
jason is walking along the lake when he sees a campfire off in the distance
he takes off toward the campfire then hears he turns
within the distorted lake someone is drowning
could it be a little boy
a little jason from many years ago
gurgles jason help me
moves toward the beach
steps partly into the water
he turns toward the campfire back to his mother
what to do
then help me jason please
help your mother
jason moves closer
dont let me die again
as he draws near she reaches out her hands to him
pauses staring at the please for help
he stares into her pleading face
after all these years
he places his hand over her face gently then he holds her there
thats not a part of the program
thorgan weve got a problem
camp cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade
everyone is suited up
delongpre the last is adjusting his helmet
hes going to see us
well do something
thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away
suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game grid appear
but jasons seen these guys before
he tears through them
boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay
it begins to slowly rise
just a little more time
jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange conan in space
the image flickers
he catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo the room
he starts toward them
then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him
sings deep african american voice ima big fluffy bunny
a big white fluffy bunny
the bunnys head is severed
the image distortss
again we see our heroes
jason is closer
the door is halway open
our heroes start ducking under
jason is almost on them
hes clicking away like a mad man
a rock band appears playing some futuristic metal
then cheerleaders in scantily clad outfits
then a midgit in a cowboy hat riding by on a tricycle
we have now entered thorgans twisted streams of conciousness
jason tears through the aboe
his goal now clear
the distractions no longer fool him
a volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around
a fat man wearing only a spiked leather speedo
a huge turtle
a couple of goats
nothing is stopping jason
boeman reaches out and jerks thorgan into the inner air lock
the image finally disintergrates
jason finds himself staring at our heroes
he lunges for the air lock but sergeant brodski dives hitting jason in the chest and knocking him to the floor
get out of here
sergeant brodski still in jasons clutches kicks at the door panel
the door starts to close as jason begins hacking with his machete
that all you got
jason hacks and hack stabbing through the space suit until finally the tough old leather neck is silent for good
the door is sealed
he saved our lives
boemen hits another button and the outer door begins to open
boeman the ships not here
use the thrusters and youll be fine
well huddle together out there
hey easy now
he points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve
you wanna release your air tanks
nervous okay good tip
youll be fine
remember stay calm use your thrusters
well be fine
why wouldnt we be
i mean look around
so far so good
jason starts pounding from the other side
he cant get through that door
this isnt some thin interior door or some walkway door reinforced by a high school kid
this is an air lock door
built to withstand laser cannons and meteors
our group enters deep space
rizzo thorgan boeman and delongpre look tiny next to the massive right hull
they thrust slowly into space
rizzo you okay
no im not okay
i dont know what the hell im doing
youre doing fine
i wont let anything happen to you remember
jason finally gives up with the massive pounding
he steps back
turns stares at the sergeants dead body then looks at he preses the button the ari lock door begins to open
air is suddenly sucked out of the room
sergeant brodskis body flies out into space
everything not tied down races out along with him
as it skitters across the floor ahhhhh
and right out the air lock holds onto a machine until the door is open then lets go
he shoots out into space
jason flies out of the air lock
hes rocketing right toward one of the space suits
rizzo did they have chinese food in your time
i think i had some when i was eight
did you like it
i think so why
hes trying to ask you out on a date
shut up thorgan
delongpre you dont even know me
i know you
suddenly rizzo is slammed from behind
she and jason go spinning away from the others
grapples with jason but jason is just too strong
jason holds her with his good hand and rears his metallic hand back
hes going to punch a hole right through her helmet most likely throat her head when delongpre rockets into jason but jasons got one of his arms sticking through one
of rizzos harnesses
the three go tumbling
delongpre clings to jasons back
rizzo pull away
jason reaches back grabs delongpre and jersk him over his head until hes holding delongpre around the thoat
hell pop his helmet like a cork
as thorgan and boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass
were too far away
as he tightens his grip around delongpres neck
he cant fight back
rizzo is fighting to untangle her harness
we can hear delongpre choking over the radio
the three are spinning even closer and closer towards earth ii
then rizzo reaches down
she grabs delongpres leg and clicks a button on her sleeve
but hes still tangled in rizzos hoses
and now she has no air
grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself toward rizzo and delongpre
he has them
when still barely alive barrels into jason vlinging to his back
he turns slashes with his knife and severs the hoses
jason and brodski tumble towards earth ii
rizzos turning blue
shes about to pass out when delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank
rizzo takes a big gasp
breathing steadily oh great
yeah having a great time and you
no thank you you crazy old woman
well i mean technically you are old enough to be my great great great
i get it
suddenly boeman and thorgan grab them
the four survivors huddle together
a little assistance here
they turn to see kay ems head floating close by
thorgan graps at her and pulls her head into his arms
kay em you okay
i am now
i missed you thorgan
i missed you too
i love you
those two arent the only two
their glass face masks are touching
they stare into each others eyes
they laugh and turn to stare toward earth ii
suddenly jasons body comes into view
its racing toward earth ii
brodski riding it like slim pickens
slowly they begin entering the atmosphere
immediately brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone
he was a good man
stay to the end to make sure the job was done right
spread eagle and alone facing the planet below jason continues his descent
his fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up
it begins to glow
his metallic arm and leg glow
flames build as he rockets towards earth ii
flesh bubbles and oozes
his legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his body
four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion campfire
check that out
they look up and see a blaze shooting towards earth ii
a falling star
its a meteor dickhead
its still cool
it lights up the night then cool
from the explosion one small smoldering chunk falls toward earth ii
as the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome hockey mask
it hits the water with a sssss
it his the reservoir
lets go check it out
the others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what could be a wonderful new discovery
the hockey mask washes down the stream comes to a halt at a pair of grusomely charred hands
twitch curl around the mask lifting it off camera
