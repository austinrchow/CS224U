written by robert rodriguez aerial over the city flying down into a federale car tearing through the slums
piles of garbage scatter stray dogs scramble
machete mexican federale officer cruz drives with rookie officer erhman riding shotgun
a rosary swings back and forth on the rearview mirror
chief torrezs yells crackle through the police radio
do not attempt to take the safehouse alone
you hear me
torrez sounds mad
you going to answer him
erhman nervously picks up the radio
on route to target no need for assistance
machete you son of a bitch
i told you to wait
set up a perimeter and wait for further orders
you hear me pendejo
machete slowly takes the radio from erhman
he hangs up
fleapit motel sits derelict at end of the street
dead cars on the lawn chickens scratching in the dirt
machete guns the engine
rnewman endeavor draft
what are you doing
were going to set up a perimeter right
you heard the boss
machete pulls his machete sticks it up to erhmans face
this is the boss
ehrman crosses himself
a phalanx of armed guards emerge from the dead cars
they narrow their weapons at machetes barrelling patrolcar
hijo de puta
machete floors it directly through the dead cars and right through the front wall of the fleapit
erhman flies through the windshield into the far wall
the car stops in front of the check in desk
machete steps out
the dust clears
more armed men stream from the office
machete sideswipes the first thug with his machete swinging him around to face the fire of the others
thug ragdolls around like a marionette long enough for machete to slash one of the mens wrists sending his aim wild and taking out the others
machete kicks open a door
naked girl on the bed
as if she was expecting him
he checks the windows
rnewman endeavor draft
its too hot for clothes
checks her eyes
shes been drugged
he lifts her ass over his shoulder
whats your name
she tries to read the nametag on his uniform upside down
a thug with an uzi runs out spraying bullets
machete spins and impales his face into the wall
thugs uzi falls into the girls hands
more thugs emerge from the end of the hallway
she absently pulls the trigger ripping into the pursuing men
blood sprays the walls like jackson pollock
new thugs emerge from the front of the hallway
machete spins around and the girl unloads another spray
the uzis out of ammo
the girl frowns and drops it
the fucked up patrolcar blocks the way out for now
machete resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants
girl arches her back her crotch in machetes face then slides down his front her breasts brushing his eyes nose mouth
we need to go
the patrolcar isnt going anywhere
she rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo
rnewman endeavor draft
that looks like me
she reaches into his pants
whats this long hard thing
is it sharp
machete looks into her eyes
she smiles drunkenly
she yanks it drawing it into his femoral artery
he falls to the ground
he didnt see this coming
she kicks him backwards
he feels life escaping him
his point of view as she reaches down between her legs
fumbles with her crotch
pulls out a small cell phone from her snatch
i got him
more life escapes him
hes ready to give up
chief torrez steps in
sub howd i do
pero no tanto
but not that good
he shoots her once she drops then he empties the gun into her body making her do a spider dance on the floor
rnewman endeavor draft
you had to stick your neck where it didnt belong amigo
torrezs boot connects with machetes face and he goes backwards onto the floor
a second man enters
this is druglord
no not torrez
el santo muerte pendejo
im saint death pendejo
druglord draws a samurai sword and slices machete like carving meat
we dont see it
sub burn it
burn it all
druglord walks out
through machetes blurred vision we see torrez and other officers lighting rags dipped in bottles of tequila and throwing them into the corners of the room
the place goes up as they run out
machete crawls and collapses as the flames rise around him a group of illegals hunker down in the brush creeping in the moonlight
one of them coughs and seizes obviously sick
another points at a water station up ahead pulling the sick man along
headlights of a large truck appear over a ridge
a spotlight scans the brush catches them
armed men ride in the bed of the truck
rnewman endeavor draft
i see em
the burly driver von shifts into gear and barrels down
shots from the truck hit them
one keeps running
they corner the last illegal
hes lit in the spotlight like christ on the cross arms wide in surrender

he pulls over
the officer walks up
his flashlight blinds him
whats the problem officer
the officer just stands there silent his flashlight blinding in machetes eyes
let me give you my id
machete reaches for his knife then he sees the cops shoes red stilettos its elektra
whats your name
i called in some favors
look at this
all the right papers a real identity
you could start over be a real person
she puts the green card in his hand
machete looks at it then crumbles it and drops it
why do i want to be a real person
when im already a myth
where will you go
torrez was just an errand boy
im going to find the man who sent the message
elektra steps into the headlights
shes dressed in hot cop ill ride with you
rnewman endeavor draft
machete and elektra drive away on the gun bike
the cop car abandoned on the side of the road lights still flashing
a family of illegals crossing the border in the desert see a water station up ahead
they make for it opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply
a bullet brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but theres someone out there shooting at them
mother hushes the younger ones
say a prayer to el machete to protect you
the younger ones start to pray
a jeep patrols the area and we see its minutemen taking potshots at the illegals
did you get em
i dont know
theyre like brown jackrabbits
lets see if theyll show their little white tails
flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the the light is on long enough to illuminate a machete blade coming straight for them
his words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from his body
nd minuteman freaks and makes a run for it
rnewman endeavor draft
stumbles in the dark in the dust
scrambles but cant get to his feet as he sees the outline of a dark figure above him
young illegals prayers continue as the machete comes down on nd minuteman
sounds of struggle slaughter
light a candle
say a prayer
young illegal opens eyes
theres a glass candle in his hands but no one else around
instead of christ or a virgin on the candle is a silhouette of machete
