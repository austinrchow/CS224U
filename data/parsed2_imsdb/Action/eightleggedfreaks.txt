eight legged freaks by jesse alexander ellory elkayem july draft a rabbit hops across rough terrain
three trucks from chemical technologies carry barrels of toxic waste
they pass a sign prosperity nevada pop
a sleepy trucker called pig pen drives the third truck
i will be self assured and confident around women
i will be self assured and confident around women
the rabbit stops at the edge of the road
the first truck speeds past
then the second
the rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third
i will not fear the unexpected
i will not fear the unexpected
the rabbit appears in the road frozen by headlights
pig pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny
the truck slews crazily
missing the bunny by a whisker
pig pen sees a bridge ahead
if he doesnt regain control he will crash
at the last second he gets the rig together
the rim of a wheel tags the curb
one of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below
a biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface
glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side
spreading through the pool like neon ink
the ditch is littered with garbage
the drone of insects
no visible traces of toxic waste
a butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly
joshua taft s scrutinizes the bug
this old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people
check this one out
mike palmer steps over for a look
puberty hit hard and fast for this bright little nerd
theyve been like this all week
must be something extra tasty in the water
back in the nam wed eat python with a dash of habanero sauce
you ate snake
when youre thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase
humpin through the wake up with your finger on the trigger
charlie doesnt give you time to stop for cutlet
as mike skims his own net over the water he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool
the brightly colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible
two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of nowhere
the decor is an odd mix of vietnam era war relics and homegrown scientist
charlie the parrot sits on a perch
charlie dont surf
mike and joshua stand near the spider tanks
a dozen aquariums on low shelves
each glass tank replicates a specific environment jungle desert cavern pond etc
dims tank lights the sun is going down my nocturnal hunters
its time to come out and feed
mike watches joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank
theyre definitely getting bigger
ive calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty eight hours
but that seems to be accelerating
all from eating these bugs
maybe i should try some
mike pauses at the desert tank watching a cricket search for food
a trap door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack in the box
the arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond
mike looks in another tank where ogre eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects
run little guys
they cant outrun the food chain
i could get away
imagine yourself the size of that fly
a scytodes spitter would be as big as a cadillac
youd be spider chow kid
mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets
he moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel
are the new tarantulas in here
took me forever to get a breeding set of chilean reds
i must have bribed every customs agent from vegas to santiago
joshua unveils the tank
several burrow entrances
joshua pours in the bugs
a large male tarantula comes out of a burrow
it pounces on a bug then wraps its prey in webbing turning the insect into a mummy like bundle
that is too cool
male tarantulas compete for the females attention
each one tries to bring her the best present
bugs rats even the occasional parrot
the prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest
you know how women love breakfast in bed
joshua leads mike to the back of the tank
a network of subterranean tunnels is revealed
the male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings
take a look the female of the species is three times as big as the male
mike peers into a large den
the female tarantula steps out of the shadows
this is consuela the chilean red tarantula
say hello to consuela
mike watches consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles
she begins to eat the paralyzed insect within
she fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs
shell drink her victim from the inside out
while its still alive
looks queasy and you wonder why my mom doesnt like me hanging out with you
arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years
and theyll be here long after the human race is dead and buried
suddenly consuela lunges at the glass
consuela backs up apparently she can be intimidated
the multi eyed spiders panoramic vision
mike looms large at the edge of the glass wagging his finger
mike stares into the many eyes of consuela
do that again and i feed you to the parrot
charlie squawks hungrily
the sound of a car horn
theres your mom
see you tomorrow joshua
mike heads for the door
the entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside
a pickup truck is parked nearby
the faded logo on the door reads mccormick and son mining company rotten beams
a generator powers a string of lightbulbs
a lone figure works at the end of the tunnel
chris mccormick s has rugged good looks
dirt stained face
chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe
as it makes contact the occasional spark flies up
chris pauses to scrutinize the target area with his helmet light
something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him
chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker
he chips away a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals
reflections of silver and gold splash across his face
his smile fades
chris bends over reaching for a bottle of water
a large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away chriss sack lunch
chris grabs his pick axe and goes after the rat
the rodent dodges every hit
sparks fly when the axe strikes rock
these ignite a vent of methane gas
a brief explosion knocks chris off his feet
he notices a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a stove
chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away with lunch
hope you like bologna
a police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the trunk
samantha sam palmer s is the sheriff of prosperity and a confident single mother
mike is seated beside her
you should see them mom
each one has a unique feeding behavior
the spitters fire poisonous snot
the tarantulas mummify their prey
the jumpers can
why does he have all those things
he studies them
nasa uses spider webs in outer space
and for medicine
theyve been here forever and theyll be here long after were all dead
youre givin me nightmares
nightmares are cool
brought this to the station
sam hands mike a small package
its from dad
he didnt forget my birthday
i told you he wouldnt
better late than never
mike tears open the box to reveal a cassiopeia pda
is that the one you wanted
cassiopeia with megs of ram
voice recording capability
this baby is tight
mike cant turn on the gizmo
he forgot to send the batteries
annoyed i told him to send batteries
the roar of two off road motorcycles tearing up the desert
bret hale leads the way
a kid rock punk with good looks and fu attitude
seated behind him is ashley palmer
this milk fed desert honey is a wannabe britney spears
larry is the wiseacre on the other bike
hang on babydoll
they gun their bikes onto the highway
slalom the yellow lines
wheelie for days
ashley peeks over brets shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite lane
sheriff sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past
the police car does an impressive bootlegger
the bikes pull over to the shoulder
the motorcycles stop with the cop car behind
sams voice barks over the pa
partys over gentlemen
off the bikes
sam exits the car and approaches
the bikers dismount
there is something very sexy about an older woman in uniform
her nine millimeter gives me a stiffy
dont antagonize her you guys
i told you not to act like kamikazes
especially with ashley riding behind
that is unacceptable bret
i could always ride her from behind
sam steels her rage
you just bought yourself a reckless
sam begins to write up the ticket
cant you give em a break
get in the car ashley
sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance
no sweat babydoll
well hook up later
threatening over my dead body
mike grins from the front seat as ashley climbs in back
you have the right to remain silent
anything you say can and will be used
shut up dork
sam hands bret the ticket
larry do we know anybody at city hall who can mark this go away
your dad is the mayor
to sam he signs your paycheck
the next time you put my daughters life in danger ill show you exactly how little that means to me
bret and larry feel her resolve
relax bee otch
its all good
the punks remount their bikes
i want both wheels on the ground
the punks rev their bikes and defiantly wheelie toward town
sam climbs behind the wheel
i read her her rights
i can always count on you mike
sam starts the car and drives toward town
do you get off on humiliating me
this bad girl act doesnt suit you ash
im just trying to have fun
dont you remember what its like to grow up here
thats what scares me
sam reaches over and opens the glove box
she pulls out a stun gun
mike passes it through the bars to ashley
i told you to keep this with you
ashley slides the zapper into her backpack
you are so over protective
mike and ashley lip sync along with sams response
a mothers job is to protect her children
you need to start trusting me
id like to
but you keep skipping classes to go to the dunes with bret
why do you hate him so much
i dont hate him
i just want you to have a future
i thought you wanted to get out of town
go to med school
maybe i want to stay
i could get pregnant by nineteen
then divorce with a couple of kids i cant handle
slap on a badge and be a trailer trash sheriff
deeply hurt thanks for the flashback
they drive on in painful silence
mike turns on the listening to w
weve put aside the u
s and conspiracy theories
chris drives into town with the radio on
for some down home talk back with our own mayor wade hale
as i was saying chemical technologies has been looking for viable storage sites
and prosperity is lucky enough to be on that list
i think most of us are insulted that some outsiders think our town is a perfect place to dump toxic waste
chriss pickup approaches
the entire town is not much bigger than a few football fields
the kind of place where everybody has known each other since childhood
some buildings date back to the s gold rush
isnt this just your latest get rich quick scheme
at one end is the prosperity mall
a huge windowless rectangle in the sand
permanent signs tout the many outlet stores inside victorias secret home and garden supplies sport chalet etc
hand painted signs reveal close out
on the roof of the mall is a very tall radio antenna
your mall has more employees than customers
chris smiles as he listens to the radio
i may have overestimated the need for square feet of outlet shopping
beverly s is tending to her garden as she listens to a transistor radio
and your ostrich ranch
if the government subsidies hadnt dried up id still be rolling in cash
an airstream at the far end of town
signs identify it as freedom radio
a brand new humvee is parked out front
walls decorated with clippings about aliens monsters and conspiracies
two men sit at a home built transmitter
harlan griffith s wears an aliens go home
he eats from a box of frosted flakes and drinks jolt cola
wade hale s is the mayor of prosperity
a slick haired dandy who looks more like a vegas lounge singer than a mayor
with one phone call i could put together a deal that would make us all very rich
they say money doesnt buy happiness
they probably dont have any
sam and her kids listen to the radio
money pays for kids to go to college
it pays the mortgage
an attractive waitress on roller skates
a harried chef
locals chow down
the radio blares in the b
it puts food on the table
havent the people of this town lived hand to mouth for long enough
floyd and leroy are the jurassic era barbers
floyd cuts leroys hair
the two men listen to the radio
were all gonna die in this hell hole
yeah of boredom
deputy pete sits with his feet up on the desk reading playstation magazine
he listens to the radio
wouldnt it be nice not to worry about surviving retirement
or taking a shot at that life long dream
think about it harlan you could buy a commercial transmitter and start broadcasting to a national audience
it would be nice to get the message out
let people know the aliens walk among us
chris slows to a stop in front of the mccormick and son mining company
this stately edifice was once the driving force behind the local economy
if chris mccormick refuses to sell his mines
the rest of us are out of luck
i dont think its fair for one person to wield that much power
but hes just like his father
and more than a little bit nuts
sam flips on the siren and accelerates
the locals stop eating and look toward the radio
that family has been digging in those tunnels since the twenties
if there was something down there dont you think they would have found it by now
floyd and leroy stare at the radio
common sense does not apply to crazy people
might as well be chasing a leprechauns pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
chris is furious as he peels out and speeds toward harlans
the locals watch chriss pickup speed by
floyd and leroy watch chris speed by
as sam pulls into town
she sees chris skid to a stop in front of harlans trailer
he leaps out of his pickup
at the very least
chris yanks the door open in time to hear
those mccormicks are just plain old dumb
wade stands up to protest
but its too late
chris punches him in the nose
the mayor tumbles back
ive warned you not to talk about my family
we have a surprise guest in the studio
chris drags wade to his feet shoving him against the wall
my family built this town
am i supposed to be grateful
chris draws back his fist for another shot
sam runs in and grabs him from behind
stay out of this sam
she manhandles chris toward the door
practically the entire town has gathered outside
sam drags chris through the door
wade and harlan are close behind
did you hear what he said
i want him locked up
lets all calm down
wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience
we have no economy
people are barely scraping by
and now weve been offered the deal of a lifetime
you dont have the right to stand in our way
those mines are full of gas
one spark in the wrong place could blow this entire valley sky high
do you really want to load that gun with toxic waste
chem tech did seismic analysis vapor checks groundwater reads soil sampling
they found isolated methane pockets but no benzene or hydrogen sulfide
how could they run tests
i didnt give them permission to go into the mines
wade retreats toward his shiny new hummer
i asked you a question you greedy son of a bitch
youre the one keeping us down so you can search for gold
chris tries to go after wade
sam holds him back
dont take another step
chris stares at her
youre taking his side
im trying to keep the peace
just like your father
wade drives off in his humvee
the crowd begins to disperse
sotto he wasnt crazy
chris heads off to his truck
sam watches him go
her eyes drifting down his body
ashley steps up beside her mom
maybe youre not gay after all
what are you talking about
you cant take your eyes off his butt
where did you learn that its okay to talk to me like this
hes hot for an old guy
i can admit it
why cant you
sam watches chris get into his truck
he gives her one last look before pulling out
sam smiles with her daughter
vintage mining gear
walls covered with sepia tone photos chronicling the history of the mccormick mines
gladys lauderback s sits at a desk
she blows smoke from her kool into the breeze of an air conditioner
ignoring the signs behind her head no smoking
as chris enters gladys hides her lit cigarette in a drawer
did you pop him one
he had it comin
but sam palmer
that woman abuses her power
because she stopped you from givin wade another pop
im not proud of it
chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that honeycomb beneath the town
many of them are marked explored
chris checks another tunnel off the list
he sniffs the air and glares at gladys
smoke rises out of her desk drawer
gladys yanks it open and puts out the flame
i thought you were trying the patch
she raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches
chris exits through a door at the back of the museum
chris enters the family living quarters
the furniture was new in
he continues to the adjacent kitchen
chris takes a beer out of the fridge
then he notices an odd clicking
he tracks the sound to a stove burner permanently on light
chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway
he removes the fuse for the stove
the sparking stops
chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer
gladys enters with a stack of bills
that burners on the fritz again
oh somethings broken
what else is new
lays bills on table you need to pay these by the end of the month
looks at bills today
for a split second
i actually thought i had it
another vein of iron pyrite
then a rat stole my lunch
i practically blew myself up trying to get it back
im glad you like my bologna sandwiches
beat maybe you should talk to wade
what are you saying
honey if he really does have a buyer
you of all people know how much my dad wanted to find that mother lode
your daddy wanted to get rich
i dont think he cared how that happened
if he was still alive maybe hed sell those mines
chris takes umbrage
and maybe you didnt know him so well after all
a tense beat
im just worried about how were going to pay these bills
dont give up on me gladys
i promised him id find the gold
and i will
gladys steels her fear patting chris on the hand
the sun rises
the town slowly comes to life
good morning prosperity nevada
its another beautiful day on the frontier
locals prepare their stores for business
no charges have been filed in yesterdays fracas between chris mccormick and wade hale
and weve got
joshua turns the radio down
he holds a tape measure to a glass spider tank recording the size of an unseen arac
an exponential growth rate
me so horny
me love you long time
joshua doesnt look back at the parrot sitting on its perch
be quiet bird
charlie looks over at the tarantula tank
watching curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly
as if one of the spiders is escaping
charlie flies over to investigate
he lands on the counter and peers around the back of the tank
charlies in the wire
something yanks the parrot o
stop screwing around
joshua looks back in search of the parrot
he notices several feathers floating down to the floor
he heads over to investigate
joshua pulls the blanket clear to reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside
no sign of any tarantulas
joshua checks the back side of the tank
whered you go
shes nowhere to be seen
joshua spots something sticking out from under the table
two parrot feet
joshua pulls charlie out from under the table
its a horrible sight
the bird is wrapped in spider webbing
his body desiccated
joshua sees charlie is attached to a web
he tugs on the webline
something tugs back
joshua leans down to look under the table
his eyes go wide at what he sees
then a shadow looms over his head
joshua looks up and
screams and the sounds of breaking glass come from within
cop car in front
chriss pickup cruises by
chris drives past
he catches sight of a figure in a window
sam is brushing her teeth at the window as chris drives by
they make eye contact
chris moves on
sam looks at herself in the mirror
mouth full of toothpaste
work it babe
sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform
its all yours
ashley and mike exit their rooms
mike is dressed for the day
ashley in a robe
they race for the bathroom
mike is first
then ashley hip checks him out of the way slamming the door in his face
whats your excuse
sam sticks her head out of a room at the end of the hall
you still want a ride mike
im just going to the mall
mike heads down the hallway and out of the house
ashley turns on the shower drops her robe and climbs in
ashley is surrounded by steam
she sings an edgy gangsta rap tune by nwa
tres bizarre non
shampoo lather cascades down her face
her eyes close
she is oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of her
the spider gets clear as ashley rinses off the soap
ashley rubs conditioner into her hair
the lather builds
covering her face
forcing her eyes closed once more
the spider returns across its web right in front of her eyes
the water stops
ashley reaches for the showerhead blindly knocking the spider off its web
she feels no water coming out and fumbles for a washcloth
reaching with eyes closed she cant see the little spider has landed on top of the cloth
as ashley retrieves it the spider scurries onto its opposite side
ashley wipes the soap off her face
the spider rides the washcloth and moves toward her hand
before it can strike ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth
the cloth lands on the floor atop the spider
as the beast stares out from under it barefoot ashley steps on the cloth
crushing the spider without ever knowing it was there
ashley turns her attention to the showerhead
she cranks the water handles trying to get the water flowing again
the handles suddenly pop off
dozens of tiny spiders pour from the holes onto the floor
ashley shrieks in horror
sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower door
she drags ashley out and looks at all the little spiders
ashley just screams
the scream of a sawzall
a house in the midst of remodeling
sections of wall are exposed
sheets cover furniture
hank s is the bob villa poseur
a cat sits near an open section of wall
watching something intently
the cat charges into the wall after unseen prey
emma s comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe
she clutches her ears in pain screaming for hank to stop
he cant hear
she grabs his shoulder and he stops why do you need to do that as six in the morning
do you hate me that much
i want to finish before i go to work
youve been saying that for six months
i cant finish if you keep interrupting
hanks restarts the saw as emma staggers into the kitchen
emma makes herself a hangover helper
egg tabasco lemon juice and a shot of vodka
all of it goes into the blender
she fires it up
competing with the noise of hanks saw
then emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat food
emma comes back in and unplugs the noisy saw
if youre gonna keep pulling the plug
have you seen zeke this morning
he was chasing something earlier
if he got into the wall again its your balls in the blender
they hear faint meowing
hank traces the source
its coming from behind a partially dismantled wall
breakfast is ready
ill get the tuna
emma heads back into the kitchen
hank listens at the wall
after a beat he hears the cat rustling around inside
emma re enters with a can of tuna
she hears zeke hiss
whats wrong with him
hank shakes his head
the cat noises become more aggressive
the panicked couple tries to follow the cats progress
they tracks the sounds of battle along the wall
the noises become frantic
howls of kitty pain
they follow the cats frenzied movement up the wall across the ceiling and down the other wall
hank hurries over
he can feel his cat thrashing maniacally on the other side
a feline scream
and then deafening silence
hank tears open the drywall reaching for his cat
ive got him by the tail
he withdraws all that remains of the zeker
a bloody tail
mike hops off his bike before it stops moving
letting it crash in the dirt
he enters the mall through glass doors
mike passes norman a janitor polishing the floors
norman listens to loud death rock tunes on a sony conspiratorial hey dude
mike comes over to this goateed rascal
wanna buy some smoke
a pack of cigarettes
smoke to get high not to die
my stuff is hydroponically grown in a top secret location
no artificial flavors
just percent homegrown
wheres this secret location
i could have a dime bag for you toot sweet
but if i tell you where exactly id have to kill you
norman you know my moms the sheriff
considers this does she get high
mike walks away deeper into the mall
a dozen stores line the hallway victorias secret electronic boutique sport chalet
most of the stores are closed for good
a large atrium features a fountain and jungle gym
skylights cover the ceiling
mike enters the home and garden store
mike goes up to the counter
the clerk snaps at him
the bug spray is on aisle five
you want mousetraps
is that it
mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter
i thought you wanted
an old lady walks past
excuse me young man
where can i find the bug spray
the clerk grabs the pas microphone
over pa speakers all bug spray rodent traps ant poison and fly paper is on aisle five
he returns his attention to mike
thatll be three fifty two
mike pays the man
wheres aisle five
the annoyed clerk points
mike heads over
he sees the aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few remaining cans of raid black flag and off
beverly uncoils a hose cranks a spigot
she sprays her vegetable garden with water
after a beat a solid object is coughed up through the hose
beverly continues watering
two more unidentified objects are spewed from the hose
she reacts by cranking the spigot on full
the water sprays harder
then inexplicably stops
beverly checks the spigot
she looks into the opening of the hose
puts it to her ear and listens
now she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks deeply trying to siphon away the blockage
beverly removes the hose
a faint rumbling sound
she puts it back in her mouth and sucks
a solid object comes through the hose and into her mouth
a dozen things pump through the hose and into her mouth
beverly yanks it out
water spews from her mouth and out of the hose
apparently the blockage has cleared
beverly falls to her knees
she vomits forth a stomach full of water
and small spiders
eyes wide in horror
she watches them scurry into the garden
beverly tries to scream
but can only retch
mike palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water
he sees beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden
mike it thoroughly grossed out
mike rides his bike into joshuas front yard
he dismounts before the bike stops
mike heads inside
mike stops short in the doorway
an off hook telephone beeps incessantly
wind moans through shattered windows
furniture is tipped over
mike moves through the chaos
the spider tanks are shattered
no trace of their occupants
mike pulls out his cassiopeia pda and starts recording
into pda captains log
stops recording plays it back listens to his voice
records again the house is deserted
no sign of joshua taft or his bird
the spider tanks are shattered
there is broken glass everywhere
mike moves toward the back door of the cabin
it swings open and shut in the wind
mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin sized footprints
he follows these tracks to a cluster of wooden barricades labeled mccormick and sons mining company
mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind the barriers
into pda animal tracks
definitely too big to be spiders
could be rats
mike slips past the barricades
following the tracks to the edge of the abyss
he cant see anything
its too dark
mike turns away and returns to the yard
several feet down the shaft
hidden under a rock
the shriveled and desiccated corpse of joshua taft
it hangs from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing
suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper into the shaft by some unseen creature
chriss pickup is parked outside another mine shaft
chris works with his pick axe
he pauses listening to a disturbing noise somewhere down the tunnel
chris isn t so sure
and then a new sound
the noise grows louder
chris shines his light into the darkness
trying to see whats causing the unsettling crescendo
suddenly dozens of rats burst from the darkness
chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel
the rat stampede is on his tail
he leaps into the back of his pickup
the manic rodents continue off into the desert
chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel
what am i the pied piper
mike rides his bike
floyd the barber stands out front chatting with an elderly couple
they hold a dogs leash in their hand
i havent seen him
mike rides on
he notices a guy taping a flyer to a lamp post
mike glances over
its a sign for a missing dog
mike arrives at the local police station
several cars are parked out front
the door is ajar
locals are crowded inside
mike lets his bike crash as he enters
sam is behind her desk
the place is swarming with locals
the mob is not listening
they were clogging up my house
i want to know what killed zeke
he was a good dog
he wouldnt just get up and go
deputy pete whistles at top volume
everybody shuts up
i had spiders at my house too
we need an exterminator not a sheriff
what about my dog
i dont know travis
were gonna keep an eye out
but were not gettin anywhere like this
you should go back out there and look for your animals
if they havent shown up by tonight
ill call fish and game
pete ushers the grumbling mob out of the office
mike avoids the crush and manages to stay inside
all joshs spiders are gone
i cant do this right now mike
everyones having pest problems
but joshua is gone
maybe hes out looking for his spiders
mom im serious
youre not listening
ive got missing pets
spiders in the plumbing
rats and mice coming out of basements
and your sisters about to end up on a milk carton
i cant have you losing
the phone rings
sam answers it
wait a second
off mikes look
prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away
the police car drives down a long road lined with fences
wades new hummer is in the driveway
a cattle dog barks as wade leads sam and mike around the side of the house
came out to feed my birds this morning
the trio steps to the fence
only three mangy ostriches are there to greet them
my flock had fifty birds
whered they go dammit
who the hell steals fifty birds that cant even fly
all this happened last night
and we didnt hear a thing
sam gestures toward the barking dog
what about him
not a peep
mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground
he heads over for a closer look
the dog watches his progress
sam talks to wade
hows the ostrich business
not so good lately
youve got that new hummer
you must be makin enough to pay for it
annoyed you like it
ill take you for a ride
these birds are insured
i didnt kill my birds sam
is that what you think
mike looks back to see his mom confronting wade
in the distance reject
mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks that he found at joshuas
but this time they are larger into pda ive found more tracks
even larger now
mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance
this one is plugged with concrete
the tracks dont go there
they stop at what appears to be a normal patch of ground
several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby
mike takes a closer look
something doesnt seem right
an odd demarcation in the soil
his fingers trace the edge of a thin film of material
it is a lid of sorts
a sheath of sticky webbing coated with dirt
mike is able to lift it
mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide
twenty feet down the shaft
a shape moves
a multi eyed spiders view of mike at the top of the burrow
mike squints into the burrow but cant see anything
a dark shape inches up the burrow toward mike
mike is oblivious as he peers into the dark
the barking cattle dog snaps its tether and charges mike
sam and wade see this and run after it
mike doesnt see the dog
hes too busy looking in the hole
the kid is framed in the burrow opening just a few feet away
mike senses something approaching in the darkness
suddenly hes grabbed from behind
sam drags him away as clyde the cattle dog continues barking
to clyde now youre on the job
what the hell were you doin last night
come on mike
lets hit it
sam leads her son toward the house
mike glances back
mike and sam are in the cop car
wade is at sams window
i need to know what happened to my birds
if i find anything ill let you know
a beat so you can fill out that insurance form
sam drives down the driveway
wade takes off his hat and wipes his brow
he watches clyde run parallel to the accelerating police car
sam eyes the road ahead
mike is lost in thought
we have to go back
that was a trapdoor spiders burrow
what are you talking about
joshua was feeding his spiders bugs from the creek
and they were getting bigger
mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby
agitated what if they didnt stop growing
what if they broke out of their tanks
and went into the mines
sam looks at him like hes out of his mind
that could be why the other species are coming out into the open
theyre trying to get away from the giant spiders
a beat the ecosystem is out of balance
have you been overdosing your ritalin
she checks him for a fever
clyde runs next to the car
suddenly he disappears underground with a yelp
only still frame on a dvd player will capture the trapdoor spiders lunge from a camouflaged den
the dogs empty collar rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust
mike turns from his mother and looks out the window
he is confused when he doesnt see any sign of the dog
maybe i am losing it
he checks himself for a fever
a dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and rock
the structures have boarded windows
graffiti on the walls
teenagers hang out
off road motorcycles parked nearby
bret hales monster truck does donuts in the parking lot
ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with glee
bret smokes a phillies blunt as he donuts his truck
ashley laughs hysterically
bret steers them around to the back of the truck stop
he skids to a stop
bret offers his stogie
bret puffs away
havent you had enough of that
no such thing
normans bud is dakine
he coughs and they both laugh
when i medal at the x games honda will give me full sponsorship
then ill take you with me on the supercross tour
ashley is silent
are you still thinking about going away
i dont know
i want to do something with my life bret
maybe med school is still an option
not if you keep hanging out with me
things head toward a serious level of get down
bret slides his hand up ashleys shirt
ashley gets into it
but then bret slides his hand toward the buttons of her s
ashley removes his hand
ashley climbs off of him
i thought you loved me
then whats the problem
you want to leave town
you dont want to make out
i dont feel
i dont want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a monster truck
why didnt you say so
we can go outside
ive got a blanket in the back
im just not ready
tammy and larry do it every night
then call them
have a menage a trois
come on ashley
mommys not around
you dont have to play the good girl
let daddy give you what you really want
bret goes after her once more
ashleys not into it
but bret wont listen
ashley isnt strong enough to fight him
she reaches into her purse and pulls out her stun gun
she rams it up in brets crotch and pulls the trigger
bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper
he spasmodically jerks off of ashley and tumbles out the drivers side door
bret twitches on the ground
looks down i pissed myself
damn bee otch
ashley watches from the truck
i told you to back off
ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the windows
bret is dazed as he gets to his feet
then his eyes rack focus to a nearby dune
a rottweiler sized jumping spider stands atop it
two large eyes surrounded by six smaller orbs
orange and black designs on its abdomen
dagger sized fangs
bret cant quite believe what he sees
ashley starts the truck
this snaps bret back to reality
screw you bret
im going home
bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune
he runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open it
open the door
i cant believe my mom was right about you
do you know how embarrassing that is
ashley starts to pull away
bret keeps banging on the glass
open the door baby
i love you
i want to marry you
have my children
ashley flips him the bird and burns rubber
as the truck moves out of the way bret finds himself staring at several more jumping spiders that are methodically approaching
bret sprints around to the other side of the truck stop
bret runs from behind the building
larry witzer and a bunch of other kids see him coming
dude did you piss in your pants
bret pissed his pants
all the kids start laughing and pointing at bret
none of them see the approaching jumping spiders
get out of here
the only one coming is you dude
larry and randy high five
a jumping spider lands on randys back piercing him with its fangs throwing him to the ground
the kids have a front row seat as the spiders pincers mash their buddy into an edible pulp
bret leaps onto his motorcycle and fires it up
several more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot
the kids scramble leaping onto their bikes
one rider is picked off by a spider
the others kick up rooster tails as they accelerate away
the spiders chase them into the dunes
a wasteland on the outskirts of town
the sandy waves are surfed by the noisy motorcycles
the jumping spiders keep after them leaping a dozen feet in a single bound
a biker is ripped off a motorcycle
the bike crashes
larry ends up with a jumper on his bike
another biker tries to kick it off managing to knock the critter into the motorcycles spokes
the spider gets munched
but then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a hungry jumper
larry continues riding
but a spider lands on his back and sinks fangs into his spine
larry yells bloody murder
bret sees larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand
bret is the only human left
a jumper comes after him in mid air
bret does an x games style rocket air kicking backward with booted legs
he knocks the spider away and keeps on riding
three familiar trucks cruise down the highway
this time they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo
pig pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him
i will live every moment of my life as if it were my last
i will live every moment of my life as if it were my last
suddenly bret hale wheelies across the road
a jumping spider explodes against the windshield
spider guts splatter everywhere
pig pen screams as he jams on the the truck jack knifes into a line of telephone poles
knocking them over and rolling multiple times before exploding
several jumping spiders are caught in the blast
bret hale rides on with several more jumpers behind
the black and white classic tarantula plays over an old tv and vcr
mike is at his computer downloading a spider encyclopedia into his pda
a message flashes across the screen connection lost
mike picks up the telephone
the line is dead
bret rides into a dead end canyon with the spiders very close behind
bret steers for the mouth of a hillside mine shaft
bret speeds inside
he looks over his shoulder to check for his pursuers theyre gone
bret looks relieved
he faces forward as
a support beam knocks him from his bike
the bike continues on into the tunnel alone
from the sound of things it travels pretty far before crashing
bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face
he looks up at a support beam which begins to crack
bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in sealing him in the mine
several locals put up more signs for missing pets
harlan is kibitzing with travis
pete and emma console each other over dessert
wade sits alone at a table for two
the attractive waitress on roller skates give him a fresh beer
the phones went down for some reason
maybe thats why bret didnt call
did you want to go ahead and order
just give me the usual
one ostrich steak comin up
wade reacts glumly to the word ostrich
gladys smokes as she puts together the fixings for a large meal
she has a cookbook out
pots and pans
gladys quickly drops her cigarette in the disposal
what are you doing home
need some rat traps
try the basement
what is all this
i wanted to surprise you with a special dinner
turkey de la gladys
ill have mine without nicotine
not as good that way
chris goes through a nearby door to the basement
chris comes downstairs
he rummages through some junk
comes up with several rat traps
he turns around to discover an odd hole in the wall
he ventures over for a look
chris leans into the hole his jacket restricts his entry
chris pulls out of the hole standing to reveal a large male tarantula on his back
chris is oblivious as he takes off his jacket
the coat lands in a heap atop the spider
chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in the hole
he doesnt notice the jacket moving behind him
chris backs out of the hole
he picks up his jacket
the spider is gone
he grabs his traps and heads upstairs
chris passes through the kitchen
he eyes gladys warily
have you been smoking
smoke pours out of her nostrils
get back to work
ill see you tonight
chris starts out
sam called for you
she wants you to come by the station
she really has it in for me
you two should just sleep together and get it over with
me and sam
i may be older than electricity but i used to be a nice looking piece of tail
too much information
im not kidding
i got more action than those chicks on vip
so when i tell you sam thinks your butt is u
this is where i throw up
dont tell me you dont think shes a fox
chris mulls this over
testing his own feelings
he opens his mouth to ask another question
and then heads out
see you for dinner
gladys doesnt notice the basement door creak open slightly
sam is on the phone at her desk
were still trying to get
let me call you back
hangs up this has been one crazy day
weve got missing pets dead ostriches
god only knows whats next
im sorry about yesterday
he knows how to push my buttons
i wanted to ask you
on a date
sam freezes for a second
what did you want to ask
have you noticed anything strange in the mines
i had spiders in my house
hector had roaches in his basement
how about stampeding rats
were they running away from something
could have been
never saw them do that before
i guess it qualifies as strange
sam thinks this over
do you want to go out sometime
taken aback are you asking me out on a date
only if youre going to say yes
sam smiles slightly
the basement door is wide open
gladys mixes food in a bowl
a cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip
a male tarantula moves across the ceiling
the creature is the size of a pit bull
two quivering palps flank dart sized fangs
multiple eyes the size of quarters
hair all over
gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her
as she works the spider shadows her
every time the spider is about to strike she goes another direction to get spices utensils a pan
gladys places her bowl on the stove
suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her
the tarantula lashes out at her
gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward
the spider reels striking the burner knobs turning on the gas
gladys registers the sound of escaping gas
she looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it
as she goes the tarantula fires a webline at her
gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box but the webline prevents her from slotting it home
gladys strains with all her might finally slots the fuse
she turns toward the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark to life
the gas ignites
the tarantula is engulfed in flame
gladys is knocked down by the blast
she lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline
gladys screams as shes dragged across the floor toward the basement door
the fire grows more intense spreading quickly
so thats a no
my kids are the world to me chris
when their dad left
it really took a toll
on all of us
i cant go through that again
i dont know what i was thinking
laughs gladys has some crazy ideas
im gonna kill her
deputy pete throws open the door
the museums on fire
off chriss look
the museum burns
the volunteer fire department attacks the conflagration
all the locals are there to help
sams cop car skids to a stop
chris leaps out
stares at the fire for a beat
and then he charges toward the inferno
sam tackles him from behind
pinning him to the ground
let me go
let me go
the museum collapses
chris watches it burn to the ground
the fire is out
the once proud building is now a smoldering pile of rubble
locals stand in small groups
chris wanders through the ruins as firemen mop up
he picks something out of the char
the map of the mines
almost completely burned
soaked with water
he stares at it for a heavy beat
all that remains of his legacy
sam steps up
maybe she got out
sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
devastated she was cooking
the stove was broken
why dont you come home with me
well get you cleaned up
chris hesitates for a moment
and then he lets the map fall
he walks out of the ruins with sam
mike stands off to the side
he spots something near the edge of the ruins
he goes over to pick it up
its a piece of arachnid exoskeleton
a spiders leg
travis the fire chief warns him away
get away from there mike
mike hurries clear with his prize
he puts it on the ground sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale of the leg
mike looks around for his mom
he sees her driving off in the cop car with chris
the sun hangs low in the sky
sams cop car parks beside brets monster truck
ashley watches tv
a doctor resuscitates a dying patient with cpr
the doctor counts as he pumps the mans chest
ashley watches intently
the patient is revived
helping people never gets old
ashley hears keys in the front door
she quickly switches channels to mtv
sam enters with chris
is bret here
then why is his truck out front
dont worry about it
what do you mean
ashley starts crying
sam goes to comfort her daughter
chris stands by in shock
nothing happened alright
ashley runs off to her room
chris stands alone for a beat
he walks to the kitchen and pulls a bottle of vodka from the freezer
he puts the cold bottle against his head and neck
trying to cool off
mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of exoskeleton
he sees chris opening the bottle of vodka
spiders shed their skins when they grow
chris looks at mike for a moment
gladys is dead
chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle
that got chriss attention
this is a tarantulas leg
or it was
its an exoskeleton to be scientific
its a little large
chris has another gulp of vodka as mike holds up his cassiopeia full of spider data
he shows chris a video of a male tarantula mummifying its food
chris watches in amazement
male tarantulas wrap their prey in webbing
tight like a mummy
the food stays alive so they can eat it later
sam enters the room in time to overhear this
now isnt the time
chris looks up at sam
they keep their food alive
mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton
what is this
a spiders leg
sam flinches dropping the object to the floor
thats a piece of cactus
its covered with spines
those are quills
tarantulas can flick them at you like darts
mike does an odd flicking motion
kind of like a dog scratching a flea
joshua had a ton of exotics
if there were giant spiders roaming the desert dont you think somebody wouldve seen them by now
the jumpers hunt in daylight
but not the others
they only come out when the sun goes down
the group looks to the window the sun hangs low in the sky
prosperity is bathed in sunset
the mine shaft entrances are clearly visible
like black holes of malevolent promise
the garage is cluttered
old station wagon
sam leads chris to a bag full of her ex husbands clothes
i guess i should watch more oprah
it must be a textbook no dad kind of thing
chris shifts awkwardly
sam holds up a flannel shirt
that one looks kind of scratchy
sam holds up a shirt that chris approves of
he takes it and proceeds to take off his old soot stained shirt
all jason cared about was getting out and starting over
i guess that included buying a new wardrobe
sam turns to pass chris a pair of levis
hes buttoning up the new shirt
chris takes the pants
he doesnt register sam ogling his exposed chest
gladys thought i should sell
but you know
i never wanted to get rich
if it was about the money i would have sold out to wade a long time ago
chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants
i think i just wanted to prove the gold was down there
that my family wasnt crazy to keep looking
even after wed lost so much
shes gone too
im sorry chris
do you know what im trying to say
it wasnt about spending the gold it was about finding it
thats exactly right
sam glimpses chris through car windows
the poor guys struggling to pull on some s
sam turns away but catches sight of him in a propped up glass door
remind me never to let you do my laundry
she turns only to see him in a mirror
he steps out from behind the car
sam stares at him
they look great
a melancholy nsync ballad plays over a boom box
ashley sits on her bed with her back to the open window
the sun setting in the distance
she rips up the photographs of bret
ashley doesnt notice the great dane sized spitting spider crawling in through her window
it is striped like a jungle predator
it comes all the way into the room and then lingers among ashleys stuffed animal collection
mike checks the phone
he types at his computer entering the specification of the piece of exoskeleton
a digital representation of a spider grows on his monitor screen
showing mike exactly how big the spider would be after shedding this skin
mike is distracted by the loud music coming from ashleys room
cant you turn that down
im doing spider research
ashley stops ripping
she goes to the pile of animals oblivious to the spider
the beast doesnt move
ashley grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly
she returns to bed and cuts the bears heart out with scissors
the spitting spider sneaks up behind ashley
as it moves so does ashley
she scoops up the torn photos and mutilated bear dumping them in the trash
she turns around to find the giant spider on her bed
she freezes momentarily
ashley sees her stun gun is on the dresser
she lunges for it
shes almost got it
the spider squirts two lines of gummy web at ashley
the glop hits her int he chest carries her backward
glues her to the wall
chris finishes dressing
he faces sam
there is an odd moment as they find themselves standing close
if the circumstances were different theyd probably end up kissing
and then they hear ashleys bloodcurdling
mike pops out of his door
sam and chris run down the hallway
sam yanks open the door to ashleys room
sam chris and mike stand in the doorway staring at a giant spider menacing ashley
the spitter fires another webby blast sticking the girls legs to the wall
a scytodes spitter
chris pushes past sam and mike
he grabs a chair and shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer
the spider backs off
sam takes off running down the hallway
where are you going
sam runs up to find a gun case
she tries to get a shotgun but finds it locked
she doesnt have the key
sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to pieces
chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider
with the other hand he tries to get ashley out of the webbing
mike stands nearby reading from his cassiopeia
the scytodes spits a gooey discharge to immobilize their prey
the spider hits chriss chair with a blast of webbing
the chair is blown from his hand and stuck to the wall
chris stands weaponless before the spider
use my stun g
ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo
mouth sealed shut
chris reaches under the bed and pushes it over on to the spitter
the spider leaps clear onto the wall
reads watch its fangs
the spitters fangs move from side to side as it fires
ill keep that in mind
chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the wall
the spider turns to fight
chris wrestles it to the ground
he sees the fangs begin to move from side to side and rolls clear of a point blank web shot
sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its binding
she grabs the bang stick and runs from the room
chris puts himself between ashley and the spider
he looks for a weapon
lunges for the scissors but the spitter nails him with a blast of glue
chris is flung across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of his shirt
he shrugs out of it and makes another grab for his scissors
he gets them
get under it
stab it in the abdomen
they dont have any armor down there
how am i supposed to do that
the spider leaps at chris
and explodes in midair
bits of gore shower chris
he stands to see sam in the door with her shotgun
chris is covered in spider guts
im gonna need some new pants
sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then pops a fresh clip into her mm
chris comes out of the garage wearing clean clothes
sam chucks him the pistol
ever used one of these
im a fast learner
chris tries to put the gun in his pocket
and then his waistband
but these damn pants are too tight
ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair
i told you
i told you all
but nobody ever listens to mike
still think im crazy mom
im sorry i didnt believe you
ashley is about to hyperventilate
calm down baby
there arent enough wine coolers in the world to calm me down
i wont let anything happen to you
sam ka chacks a fresh round into her shotgun
what other spiders did joshua have
spitters jumpers orb weavers tarantulas
why couldnt he keep goldfish like a normal person
sam checks the phone
we need to warn people
how about the radio station
well go to harlans
you want to go outside
chris and sam open the front door of the house
sam looks one way
chris the other
no giant spiders lurking about
chris and sam continue onto the lawn
mike and ashley watch from the safety of the doorway
they listen to the comforting sounds of a its okay
mike and ashley move out of the doorway
joining the adults
they move toward the cop car
the cop car cruises
the occupants peer out the windows
everything appears normal
although no people are visible
sam chris and the kids move away from the cop car to the door
they are at the far end of town
all appears to be normal
harlan is broadcasting
im saying the invasion has already occurred
the aliens are among us
but theyve taken common forms
they hide in plain sight
harlan is startled as sam and the others enter with guns
we need to make an emergency broadcast
giant spider invasion
harlans jaw drops
sam takes the microphone
what are you going to say
you cant tell them the truth
into microphone is this thing on
this is sam palmer
we have an emergency situation
a pack of rabid coyotes is loose in town
wolf spiders crawl across rooftops
spitters scale buildings tarantulas lurk in the shadows
jumpers scuttle out of the mineshafts
trapdoors prepare their burrows
this funky old couple relaxes in their lazee boys
they are extremely dangerous
the forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the mans recliner yanking him clean out
the woman is oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the floor
emma bursts out of the front door screaming hysterically
hank is behind her with the sawzall
a wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house
arm yourselves with any weapons you can find
hank raises the saw overextending the power cable
he loses power
drops the saw and runs for his life
floyd and leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf spiders
stay together and head for the mall
a spider eats the chef
the waitress roller skates away from an arachnid
she jumps through the window into the street
a family piles into their mini van
oblivious to the jumper hiding in the way back
they close the door and drive off
harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads
the walls are concrete and the exits have steel gates
we could hold an entire army of giant spiders from inside
you just said giant spider on the air
sam sees the microphone is keyed
now thats great radio
not giant spiders
i meant to say
harlan notices long spider legs passing the window
sam and the others spill out of the trailer
they head for the cop car
as they get closer a wolf spider climbs onto the cars roof and gnaws on the light bar
sam raises her gun to blast it
the noise will attract more of them
lets try for the mall
sam leads the others toward town
chris and sam hang onto the panicked kids
harlan brings up the rear
the place is chaos
people are chased by spiders
dragged by spiders
killed by spiders
eaten by spiders
my trucks at the museum
in my other pants
the group flees a trio of goo firing spitters
suddenly a familiar mini van races past
take us with you
harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees
the vans occupants are locked in combat with a jumper
the beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to pieces
the van crashes
a group of orb weavers scurry across power lines
they hit a transformer shorting it out
the entire town is suddenly plunged into darkness
spotty illumination for the arachnids feeding frenzy
the lid rises slightly
wade hale peers out from within
he lifts the lid higher oblivious to the wolf spider on top of it
the spider reaches down at him
the spider is suddenly blown away by sam and chris
wade climbs out of the dumpster
chris and sam move on with the kids
wade runs after them
mike looks at garbage covered wade
to ashley have you seen bret
he was out at the dunes
ive got your butt
ive got your back
chris gives sam a funny look
maybe gladys was right
sam leads her group down toward the mall
other groups of survivors do likewise
as they get closer to the mall the groups coalesce into one large pack
we recognize deputy pete
the roller skating waitress
and many other locals
sam and chris are at the front of the mob with their kids
suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground
it grabs travis the fire chief and pulls him under quickly replacing the roof of its den
travis screams underground
theyre all around us
how can we spot them
mike consults his cassiopeia
i didnt download that part
the group wheels at the muffled sounds
they see nothing
they hear another muffled scream and the top of the spiders den pops up
travis drags himself out of it
he is dragged back underground
the group continues toward the mall entrance
suddenly a gun toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor
he goes cyclic madly firing his gun into the air as hes dragged under
more beasts rise out of their dens
reaching for the humans
chris and the others flee toward the mall
some of them shoot at the spiders as they run
leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor
floyd tries to help but the spider plunges its fangs into poor leroy dragging him under
the group clears the trapdoor minefield
but some of the spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after them
chris and sam and the kids lead just fifteen other survivors to the glass doors
the doors are locked
wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them desperately
theres someone inside
the group sees norman the dope dealer janitor approaching out of the gloom
hes staring at them all curiously
sam points her gun at him
norman raise his hands in shock
i have a prescription
its for my glaucoma
open this goddamn door
norman unlocks the door and lets the group in
the survivors hustle inside
they lock the glass doors behind them
the spiders are still coming
get away from the doors
be cool little dude
glass wont stop them
the spiders begin smashing through the glass doors
chris and sam shoot to keep them back
people flee into the mall
close the gates
wade and norman proceed to lower the slotted steel security gates
only problem is sam and chris are on the other side
sam and chris see the gate coming down
they run for it and slide underneath just as the gate comes down
a massive trapdoor slams up against the metal
but the metal holds
shut the other entrances
norman and chris run toward the opposite end of the mall
chris and norman arrive
spiders are smashing through the glass
chris and norman bring the gate down
they back away as more spiders slam against the steel
trick or treat
chris and norman head back to join the others
the survivors gather makeshift weapons
floyd take a chainsaw off the wall
norman practices swinging a heavy sledgehammer accidentally toppling a stack of paint cans
hank stands before a display of circular buzz saws
chris goes to where sam doles out the few firearms
were sealed up at both ends
sam hands chris a shotgun
he tries to get the feel of it
you pump the slide to jack in a fresh round
point at your target and squeeze
chris tries it out pumping the slide
a shell flies out the slide of the weapon and hits wade in the head
sam shakes her head and takes the gun back
she pulls a machete off the wall and hands it to chris
try not to cut yourself
the place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege
separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the entrances to watch the spiders every move
why didnt we see them earlier
for the last time
they cant handle the sunlight
they were waiting in the mines for the sun to go down
then at daybreak theyll go back inside
we can walk out the front door
we wont make it that long
theyre gonna come in after us
theyre growing very fast
they need food to sustain that kind of development
someone should go out and get help
you go sam
youre the sheriff
i dont have that many handcuffs
what about the police radio
youre not goin back out there pete
none of us are
radio shack is full of cell phones
but the signal wont get out of the valley
thats why we couldnt sell any of the damn things
the group looks up
the moon cast shadow of the antenna is visible on the skylights that run the length of the mall
i could climb up to the top
i bet i could get a signal out
you should do that
ill cover you harlan
wade leads chris and harlan toward an access door
sam stands with her kids
chris looks over his shoulder for one last look
sam runs up to him gives him the shotgun
are you sure you can handle this
re pants while im gone do you think you could find me a size
ill do my best
a beat uhh
do you want to go out sometime
maybe a movie
chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her lips
wade holds open the nearby access door
youve got a town to save
chris and harlan head out
sam watches them disappear through the door and then returns to the survivors
youre not really going to get him bigger pants are you
wade leads chris and harlan up a tight staircase
the door at the top is identified as roof access
wade reaches the door
the others bunch up behind him
dont even think about locking this door
ill be right here waiting
wade slowly opens the roof door
chris and harlan step onto the roof with their gear
no sign of any spiders
wade closes the door behind them and locks it
chris and harlan arent happy to hear that lock turn
they sneak across the roof toward the base of the antenna
it looks clear
harlan starts climbing
chris stands guard at the bottom
neither of them sees the horde of spiders climbing up the side of the building toward the roof
mike collects perfume
packing it into his pockets like grenades
ashley is nearby checking out the lingerie
i didnt know you wore cologne
its spider repellent
sam steps in through the door
lets stay together guys
holds up a teddy can i get this
the kids run out to join their mom
after they go
the grill of an air vent is pushed open
a huge spitting spider pushes its way through
dropping to the floor
another spider follows
harlan is high up on the antenna
he has a cell phone in hand
it still indicates no service
he keeps climbing
chris sees spiders flood onto the roof
weve got company
he tries to cock the shotgun
ejecting a shell out the side
this always looks so easy on tv
chris gets it figured out just in time to blast an attacking spider
he fades back toward the antenna
harlan checks the phone
ive got a signal
chris is surrounded by spiders
he starts climbing up the antenna
harlan is on the phone
im calling from prosperity nevada
were being attacked by giant spiders
the entire town has been overrun
chris yells up to him
dont say that
this is emergency services
not dial a joke
the line goes dead
chris climbs up beside him
he fires several blasts at the approaching spiders
they didnt believe me
what a shock
the spiders are closing in as harlan re dials
there was a massive explosion
sir your number has been flagged as a source of a crank call
im afraid i must terminate this conversation
she hung up on me
chris fires the shotgun
the spiders are closing in
sam gazes up at the skylight
she can see the silhouette of chris and harlan climbing the antenna
pursued by spiders
sotto oh my god
ashley screams in horror nearby
sam whirls to see ashley pointing at several spiders coming out of victorias secret
sam runs over to fight them
he faces off against more spiders coming through the home and garden store
harlan is at the top
chris is a bit lower
the spiders are still coming
chris shoots at them
his gun runs dry
he flips it around and butt strokes an approaching arac
a spider fires a web at harlan
nails the poor guy
and drags him off the antenna
harlan falls off the antenna back toward the spiders
chris reaches out and grabs him
holding harlans hand
ive got you
harlan makes eye contact with chris
theyre both about to be killed unless
defend the human race
harlan jerks away from chriss hand
he cannonballs down into the horde of spiders
splattering several of the beasts along with himself
chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac and climbs even higher
he pulls out his machete and begins hacking at the guide wires that hold the antenna upright
the spiders close in
chris slices one wire
the antenna quivers
chris slices another wire
the antenna shakes
deputy pete is standing with sam and the kids when hes jerked off his feet and hauled into the maw of an arachnid
she sees mike and ashley avoid an arac by taking refuge inside the tunnels of the jungle gym
sam fires the guns like annie oakley putting spiders down left and right trying to reach her kids
floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain saw
having a bad hair day
the spider charges
floyd slices its legs off
how about a little off the top
he slices another arac
chris dodges a spiders webline
several more come at him
youre going down
chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight
the antenna keels over
chris hangs tight as he drops toward the glass
sam looks up to see chris come crashing down through the skylight on the antenna
the antenna tilts in at a sixty degree angle
chris hangs off the end
orb weavers ride their weblines down to the floor of the mall
mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym
he sees a hundred spiders coming in on webs
flooding out of the stores
the devil spawned monsters are everywhere
chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web
he slides down it like a pole squashing the orb weaver at the bottom
sam runs to his side
did you get help
is anybody coming
were on our own
sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym
the waitress roller skates away from the spiders
she slaloms clear of several spitters
but gets tackled by a jumper
ashley and mike are hiding
i cant stay in here
ashley starts to move out of the tube
she discovers the end has been covered with web
she pushes it
something on the other side pushes back
ashley scrambles back
mike is already moving
the kids flee through the tubes to get away
what are they doing
checks cassiopeia theyre trapping us like ants in a log
once they have all the exits blocked theyll come in through the last one
they see a way out head for that exit only to find a spider coming through it
mike tosses one of his perfume grenades at the spider covering their retreat
another spider comes after them through one of the tubes
mike chucks another perfume bottle
the spider cowers
weve gotta go
ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide
she starts down with mike close behind
a large spider looms at the end
ashley tries to arrest her slide
but its no use
at the last second sams boot kicks the arachnid clear
ashley and mike pour out of the slide
chris and sam finish off the spider and then run with the kids
emma runs parallel to them across the playgrounds sandbox
only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider
hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his tools
getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand
its tool time
floyd is still going crazy slicing spiders with his chain saw he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry spider descends on him from above and knocks him to
chris passes a clothing store displaying levi s
he stops for a moment to look at the jeans
chris continues on
all of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and prepare for custers last stand
spiders charge from all directions
mike throws his perfume grenades
sam and chris shoot
others use their make shift weapons
norman pulls out a joint and sparks it
mike sees this and gets an idea
where do you grow your weed
dude if i tell you i have to kill you
norman takes a hit on his reefer
theyre going to kill us you stoner
norman sees the army of spiders closing in
norman opens an access door
sam and the other survivors run over and crowd through it
norman shuts the door behind them
the groups of pursuing spiders collide and begin ripping each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy
norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway
where are you taking us
to shangri la
norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of pot paraphernalia
weed growing in hydroponic units under battery powered lights
you arent going to arrest me for this are you
the group can hear spiders bashing at the upstairs door
to norman oh great
now youve trapped us
chris moves to the bottom of the stairs
we should be able to hold them off for a little while
suddenly a loud banging erupts on the wall behind them
theyre coming through the wall
the group tightens up
back to back
ready for the end
suddenly a human hand punches through the wall
what the hell
bret hale rips through the drywall
filthy but alive
standing in a horizontal mine shaft
he sees sams gun pointed right at him
i didnt touch her
sam looks at ashley
dont waste your bullets
wade embraces his son
i thought you were a goner boy
chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine
we can get out this way
arent the spiders in there
not until daylight
the banging on the upper door gets more intense
norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered grow lights from his weed farm
he passes them out to the group
chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the mine shaft
bret is shocked as the others follow him
the group uses the grow lights and flashlights
youre going back in there
are you all crazy
come on bret
im not going
bret is alone in the room as the upper door implodes and spiders flood downstairs
bret dives through the opening
bret runs past sam and chris
sam fires her shotgun at the first spider that enters the tunnel
her gun clicks dry
she un holsters her pistols and fires
what are you going to do
chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnels upper support beam
more spiders come into the tunnel
sam fires desperately
chris keeps on hacking
sams guns click dry
chris swings the machete hard
the roof collapses onto the attacking spiders
chris and sam leap back
landing in a heap
clouds of dust swirl around them
they are tangled up for an awkward beat
their faces just inches from each other
hold that thought
they manage to disengage and move on
chris and sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few remaining survivors
were trapped again
at least they cant follow us
which way do we go
i think were in one of the old tunnels
can you get us out of here
dont worry sam
chris takes point with the others following nervously
a boarded up shaft entrance
suddenly the wood splinters
chris and the others bash through
they file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels
the place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste
i dont believe it
mike recognizes the biohazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch
ive seen one of these before
what are they
where did you see it mike
the creek where joshua gets his spider food
there was one in the water
chris starts toward the sloping tunnel
we can get out this way
no we cant
turns to wade isnt that tunnel blocked off dad
chris and the others look at wade
we cant get out that way
you did this
i knew youd never sell
were under my property so
you put all of us at risk
i didnt have a choice
i was broke
they gave me a hundred grand
sam punches him
knocking wade to the ground
i think our lives are worth a little more than that
were wasting time
chris heads toward the only exit available
the others follow
wade staggers to his feet
stumbling after them
chris leads the group down a tunnel
they come across bits of vintage mining gear
a string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels
one end of these lights should be connected to a generator
thatll be near the entrance
they continue down the tunnel
a large cavern
animal carcasses litter the ground
some human remains
you see sam
i wasnt lying
thats what i can put on the insurance form
whats that smell
the others are reacting strongly
this cavern is full of gas
what does that mean
one spark and were all dead
norman swallows his glowing joint
chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles
thats what i was talking about chris
presents from the male tarantula to the female
so the females around here
bret looks around nervously
the group moves closer
they sine their lights on a horrifying sight
joshuas corpse is a deflated flesh balloon
yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull
hes completely desiccated
every ounce of liquid drained away
mike hides his eyes
ashley comforts him
that one just moved
chris runs over and slices it open with his machete
the web comes away to reveal a human hand
theres somebody in here
chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help
they finally reveal gladys
the womans body begins to spasm
to the others can anybody help her
suddenly ashley pushes her way forward
her breathing is shallow
shes going into arrest
ashley proceeds with cpr
just like she saw on tv
suddenly gladys snaps out of it
gasping for air
gladys starts to get a grip
trying to focus on chris
from this angle chris look like he has a golden halo
im not in heaven
then whats with all the gold
gladys points behind chriss head to the wall of the cavern
the group turns their lights on it
the reflection is dazzling
veins of gold criss cross the cavern walls
is it real
chris checks it out
its the mother lode
he was right
my dad was right
chris helps gladys to her feet
they share an emotional look of recognition
so were you
wade chips away at the gold
get as much as you can
bret looks at ashley
nice work doc
ashley acknowledges him
bret chips gold with wade
sam puts her hand on ashleys shoulder
you saved my life
gladys leans over to norman
have you got a smoke kid
the man says this cavern is full of highly flammable methane gas
i smoke to get high not to die
the group sees a cluster of normal sized tarantulas scuttling out of the shadows
whats the big deal
norman steps on the closest one grinding it under his boot
he stomps around crushing as many as he can
mike watches this curiously
taking a look at one of the squashed bodies
i think you should stop
they dont have hair
they arent fully grown tarantulas
chris and sam look over
theyre giant babies
he hears something moving around in the dark
and then a spine chilling
chris reacts to the noise
he can guess whats coming
the female tarantula steps out of the shadows
consuela has grown to be as big as a volkswagen microbus
by far the largest spider weve seen yet
covered in hair
her two fangs are the size of machetes
mikes eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis
the fur on consuelas back seems to undulate
there is something weird there
a lot of weird things
her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas
as consuela advances she flicks several dart sized quills off her belly right into norman
a dark stain spreads across the drug dealers shirt
consuela pierces norman with her fangs holding him tight
babies flood of her back and onto the doper chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas
the group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern
a male tarantula drops down to block their escape
sam blows it away
wade and bret are still chipping away bits of gold
so you can keep it all
wade gets a nugget off the wall
he only has a nanosecond to admire it before consuela suddenly looms behind him
bret reaches out toward his father
wade reaches for him
consuelas fangs suddenly protrude from wades chest and hes hauled backward
the tarantula flings wade into the cave
bret come on
bret runs after the others
but he sees consuela firing more quills at the group
directly at ashley
bret leaps into harms way
hes turned into a pin cushion
ashley goes to his side
im sorry i
sam drags ashley away from him
the survivors flee along the tunnel
chris jumps up to rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling
we have to get out
this is our chance to kill them all
chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand
when the power comes on the bulb will ignite the methane and torch them
where did you get an idea like that
chris looks at gladys
i blew up the kitchen
keep going up the tunnel
there should be a generator at the exit
start it up and await for my signal to throw the switch
and the toxic waste
will be buried under tons of rock
what about you
i need to set the fuse as close to the spiders as i can
that should give us time to get clear
sam and chris share a brief beat
and then chris pulls down the lights dragging them back toward the tarantulas den
he has a cute butt
dont you think
chris comes through with his light bulb fuse
consuela and her babies are feasting on the bodies of bret and wade hale
chris finds a vent in the ground
he sprinkles dust over it to identify a faint draft
he positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas jet
mike helps gladys up the tunnel
sam and ashley are behind
suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the shadows separating the groups
sam and ashley flee down another tunnel
chris finishes preparing the booby trap
he gets up to leave
only to find consuela coming toward him
i hate spiders
chris runs out of the cavern
chris bails out of the cavern and starts running
sam and ashley flee the male tarantula
sam stumbles over something on the ground
its bret hales lost motorcycle
ashley looks back and sees the tarantula coming after them
sam lifts the motorcycle upright and climbs on
she starts it and revs the engine
ashley leaps aboard
sam accelerates along the shaft away from the spider
the bikes headlight illuminates their path
the male tarantula scurries after the bike
sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft
ashley hangs on tight
theyve put some distance between themselves and the male tarantula
a dead end looms before them
ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a
sam rides back the way they came heading straight toward the male tarantula
ashley looks over her mothers shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite direction
sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears
with perfect timing she brings the front wheel down hard onto the tarantulas back
the spider is roadkill
sam steers them down another tunnel
mike and gladys gather at a generator just shy of the tunnel exit
mike tries to start the generator
it wont catch
it needs gas
theres a ranch
gladys heads over toward wades ranch
chris runs along the tunnel
consuela charges after him chris reaches up smashing more light bulbs as he runs
mike is at the generator as sam and ashley ride up on the motorcycle
it needs gas
sam tips over the motorcycle trying to get gas out of the tank
its clear this is not going to work
smashing light bulbs
consuela close behind
start the generator
sam has dumped some fuel into the generator
she tries to start it
it wont turn over
chris ducks as consuela fires quills at him
he keeps going
sam sees chris at the bottom of the tunnel
she tries to start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate
throw the switch
i dont have any power
sam turns as ashley throws her the stun gun
sam catches it and brings it down to the light bulb cable
as chris runs the light bulbs illuminate sequentially traveling past him into the cavern
a broken light bulb sparks
the filament ignites the gas filled tunnel
a ball of flame spreads throughout the mines
a huge column of flame blasts into the chamber
all the gold is illuminated
consuelas babies are burned like popcorn
sam looks back to see chris running toward her
consuela is on his heels
the glow of a fireball is right behind them
chris looks over his shoulder at consuela and the flames
chris makes it to sam just ahead of the conflagration
sam and chris dive out of the mine opening
a pillar of flame shoots out behind them
ashley and mike are nearby
the town is visible just a mile away
the spiders retreat from daylight
scuttling back into the buildings
heading down into the mine shafts
the chain reaction spreads through the mines
jets of flame blast up tunnels
torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home
rupturing the very earth around them
the earth begins to shake violently
its a chain reaction
the whole valley is going to blow
well never get out in time
gladys drives up in wades humvee
cigar in mouth
lets get the fuck out of here
the survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to blow up in the distance
chris is just about to climb aboard when
a webline shoots out of the nearby mine shaft
the spider is charred and bloody
but shes primed for revenge
chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her
he fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline
cutting himself free just before getting impaled on consuelas fangs
consuela knocks away chriss machete and lunges down at him
chris kicks her belly with both his feet
consuela begins to shudder
jagged cracks appear in her charred carapace
chris kicks and tears at the failing armor
he thinks hes harming the tarantula but hes actually helping it
mike and the others watch from the humvee
consuelas blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the damaged skin away from her body
chris is amazed to see the spider has grown a full size larger and become totally rejuvenated
consuela comes after chris
he defends himself with the machete
shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs
once again consuela punts away the machete
she prepares the death blow
it looks like curtains for chris
the massive spider stops in shock
chris looks back to see mike has returned
the familiar multi perspective spider vision
the tarantula seems to recognize mike
he throws his cassiopeia pda at the spiders face
chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete and drive it deep into the spiders unprotected abdomen
the tarantula screams
chris leaps up and runs scooping up mike
they dive into the back of the humvee
consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded
she collapses in the dust
the town explodes in the b
the earth itself begins to collapse
gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance
jets of flame burst upward
the mall is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth
the humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling desert
the humvee reaches open road
the survivors watch out the back as prosperity disappears into a massive sinkhole
the group sits in a long beat of abject shock
and then chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally ripped
i really need some pants that fit
the group smiles
happy to be alive
everyone looks to the road ahead
a familiar bunny rabbit hops across the highway
gladys honks and swerves to avoid it
the bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward safety
the rabbit continues its trek for a moment and then is grabbed by a large trap door spider
