href b b written by barry cohen and ted newson and james cameron nd revision by joseph goldmari and james cameron and john brancato third revision by james cameron based
on screenplays by ted newsom john brancato barney cohen and joseph goldman a mighty warning klaxon assaults our ears
a flashing red warning light stabs our eyes
several dials go into the red
a hand pushes aside a yellow thermos and pushes forward a red power throttle
we hear the whining up of a cyclotron
a digital dial climbs to power
a spider crawls across a dial
begin opening credits
the cyclotron room is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with tape
leaks are here and there
cobwebs are all around
doctor otto octavius ock is a strong but strange featured man in his mid fifties
his assistant weiner hovers nearby looking on
hes open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity
weiner is a local small time hood hired by ock to circumvent the school administration and to procure whatever ock needs for his experiments
he shades his eyes against a searing blue white beam that erupts from the window
the room is whoa whoa whoa
with a whoosh the window explodes showering the two with shards of glass and throwing them to the floor
rising we begin again
lets kick in that new transducer
see if we can double the power output
rising more slowly whoa doc
wait a minute
but ock is already at the throttle
the cyclotron whirls up
the lights go on
louder brighter than before
ock looks through the broken window into the experimental chamber
the power dial inches upward eight nine
the blue white light is blinding now
the whine pitch is shattering
the power dial hits ten
as students go to class the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the science center onto the grounds of empire state university
we see peter parker a pleasant faced senior whos among the top in his class
sincere and serious he has yet to develop a way with women
falling in step hiya peter
liz allen is also a senior
shes beautiful and intelligent
ardent but uncomfortable hiya liz
howre you doing
teasing softly howm i doing what
harry is the school nerd
a quirky kid who like peter can be a little backward around girls especially pretty ones like liz
to liz would you uh
excuse us for a minute
despite peters protesting body language harry pulls him away like a conspirator
what is it
did the astro physics journal really accept your paper
laughs embarrassed yeah
all i gots the data but theyve agreed to publish it when its finished
its my calculation on the planetary conjunction
and its influence on the anti force
look harry i am busy with
indicates liz standing there yeah you and the rest of the class
every one is busy with liz
growing impatient peter
a hand reaches in and smacks her bottom
elbowing him affectionately flash
they kiss and walk away
sneering and flash is the busiest of them all
disappointed come on harry
well be late for octavius
harry makes a gesture dismissing ock as crazy
ock is nuts dont you agree
ock is a genius harry
but a genius misunderstood and unappreciated
it is a basement hallway full of lockers which students are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out
in their midst a man is banging on the door marked cyclotron room authorized personnel only
professor rosomorf sixtish respectable a good old fashioned professor hes the head of the physics dept
with him is alexander thorkel a ish waspish school administrator
for a scientist as crazily focused as ock thorkel is a natural enemy
knocking furiously doctor octavius
you are late for your lecture
the students are waiting
your friend is impossible professor rosomorf i told the board we should let him go
the light above thorkels head explodes
then all the lights behind him explode in succession
thorkel and roz look amazed
whats he doing in there not his crazy experiment again
you mean his anti force theory
one day theyll give him the nobel prize for it
meanwhile he is demolishing our university
knocks open the door
the anti force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety
therefore weiner you will disconnect the overload safety device
four waldos three fingered snake like mechanical arms suddenly thrust themselves into the chamber and begin working each at a different task
ock is an acknowledged master at manipulating these waldos
he flicks a switch and a searing blue white beam lances down from a focusing cone and strikes a gram weight marked illuminating it and filling our ears with a
splitting buzz tone
the knock on the door grows louder
weiner comes up behind ock
someones at the door
ignoring world class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron
insert the dial marked relative gravity reads but suddenly it snaps to
the weight begins to jiggle and for an instant it appears to lift ever so slightly
this is an enormous room lab tables
the yellowing smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air
a huge american flag dominates the back wall
peter harry and liz set up their tables
flash reads the daily bugle sports section
peter cant take his eyes off liz
when she looks back he looks down at his gear
softly what is it peter
embarrassed its nothing
weiner opens the door and sees roz and thorkel waiting impatient
yes gentleman can i help you
tell your boss that his class is waiting
looks you better tell him yourself
thorkel looks at roz who waves his shoulder then the both call
professor ock turns and looks at the bewildered men
gentlemen come you must see this
but your students
the imbeciles can wait
i have better things to do than teach introductory physics rosomorf
undergrads are kindless adolescence
you see he is impossible
thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had
thorkel turns to go dont go thorkel
he starts to play his machines handles and buttons
the university pays you to teach something to your students
well do you mean nothing
or do you mean something but you wont tell me what it is
regaining i mean plain nothing
well i guess thats about as nothing as you can get
ahh it is something
the equipment on her table is starting to vibrate
they look at it curiously
we hear the cyclotrons whine begin to build
everything is shaking like in an earthquake
roz and thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise
the whine is deafening
the light is blinding
weiner has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears
i am going for percent power
dont do that
ock i warn you
weiner crosses himself
the console erupts in sparks
we follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the wires and cables inside the walls and floors
it is making its way up to the lab
all the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment
the charge crackles up a wire and erupts at lizs table
a breaker explodes in flames
there is an outburst of ad libs fire
thorkel comes running he is shabby and bewildered seeing liz trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second
keep calm everybody keep calm
use the front door
everybody out the front
he wades into the fire but is beaten back by the flames
his sleeve is on fire
he pats it out
flash appears and tries to help but thorkel stops him
get back you idiots
you cant go in there
liz smashes at the window but this is an inner city school and the windows are covered by steel gates
liz wraps her fingers in the gate
out at the street help
outside the window the air is clear and people come and go
some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams but they cant hear of course down at them as the flames close in behind
peter comes flying in with a fire extinguisher
he fumbles with it
flash pushes thorkel grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain
liz turns to face the flames
suddenly there is an eruption of co clouds and the roar of a fire the flames are beaten down enough for her to leap out
flash is there holding the extinguisher
thanks for your help flash
no problem wimp
our hero has a real way with words
oh why dont you grow up
peter is stung insulted turns away
rosomorf peeps in worried faces thorkel
this man will bring a disaster upon this university
ock comes in starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened
the universe is made up of forces
and counter forces
science is the study of the forces
flash hands the extinguisher to peter
liz embraces flash throwing a glimpse at peter who tried so bravely
he looks away and turns the last of the extinguisher on the last of the fire
continues without a hitch but i
professor otto octavius
have devoted my life to the study of the counter forces
good job peter
taking place at lab table thanks professor
thorkel has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge lab
he simply cannot believe ocks behavior
i dont believe it i simply dont
can we carry on mr
i dont believe
oh all right carry on professor
this week my dear students i have made a stunning breakthrough
wait a minute wait a minute
youve got fire forms to fill out dr
i have no time for forms or administrators who persist in interrupting me mr
thorkel steams out and bangs shut the door
i now believe its possible that these counter forces can be
the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight
and focused into a hard beam i call
weiner backs away from the blackboard to reveal a word that ock has scrawled in large letters
it says anti force
i call it the anti force
ock is plugging a huge cable into a small lucite box with a silver ball inside it
continues as he works this anti force once harnessed is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed
looks up maniacally gravity
liz scribbles down a note and mouths the word gravity
then she turns to peter
whispers im sorry
ock is playing his computer like the phantom of the opera at the organ
we patch in the cyclotron
the lights flicker and go dim
pay no attention to the lights
i of course steal its energy and it looses power
we patch in the cyclotron
and we gradually apply power
the power that i am stealing
as the whine builds in the lab
ock peers through the lucite box at us distorted by it
the box is a miniature version of the cyclotrons experimental chamber and now the blue white glow begins
it crackles round the silver ball
and so we stand four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe
which is holding down this goddamn ball
the lights go totally dark
the kids react with whoops and catcalls
what a crock
shut up harry
this is very interesting
have you some
interesting observation youd like to share with the class
then shut up
and pay some attention to the experiment
ock peers at us through the lucite box as the silver ball begins to rise
ocks face is ecstatic
the silver ball suddenly shoots up shattering the top of the box
it flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a the shards rain down on ock who reaches out and catches the falling ball and scales it in a raised
now thats what i call an experiment
the cyclotron whine cuts out and ock wheels to the computer
he hits a key and several colored projection beams lance out of the back of the room
they pierce the smoke and light a projection display in the front
two colored spheres one yellow one blue touch where their circumferences meet
behind them is a black depiction of space
you are looking at a representation of two universes
our blue one
our real universe
something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about
this is us
the yellow universe
this is something else
some other dimension
on the other side
ock hits another computer key and a hole appears where the two spheres touch
the blue and the yellow marbleize with each other
the colors swirl until both spheres are if it were possible to generate enough power behind it the anti force could wipe out not just gravity
but all our universal forces at the same time
it would blast a hole between this universe and the next
indicates green spheres would flow into each other
no blue universe
end finished over
with a students ear that sounds like a scenario for the end of the world
my girl it is
it would mean wiping out everything thats known
and letting in everything thats unknown
isnt that a little dangerous
dont worry yourself true inter dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical but one day
maybe very near
maybe in the st century
peter liz flash and harry all take books from their whispers to peter look its just
i dont know
when you and flash go after each other like that
whispers hes not my type
he doesnt have to be
and besides hes not all bad
peter looks at flash whos a few lockers down
flash has taken a football from his locker and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration
you dont get nicknamed flash because youre a rocket scientist liz
give it up parker
youd die for a nickname like flash
yeah of embarrassment
kim comes by and leans seductively by her locker
kim is a ripe one and hot hot hot
teasing hey flash
im scalping a pair of the midnight madness wrestling match tomorrow night
id kill for that
would you pay
well uh i
can i tell you tomorrow
moving on you snooze you lose
kim you know peter and harry
this is my new roommate
kim is pulling her pet a foot long salamander out of her locker
she wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys
they go bug eyed
interested hellooo peter
were going to the student reunion meeting
peter looks at kim
then he looks at liz whos adjusting herself in a small mirror
harry jabs him in the ribs
frustrated i cant
i gotta go over to the daily bugle
im trying to sell some photos
soooh a photographer
just an amateur
nice meeting you kim
i bet it would be
can i be your date for the reunion shooshoo
she turns to go what did i say
its not what you said its how you say it shooshoo
everybody leaves and harry is left alone he throws his bag down
peter turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking peter doc ock wants to see you
about my data i bet
i dont know
he knows about my work on the planetary conjunction doesnt he
lies i dont know
peter enters wide eyed behind weiner
this place is a far cry from the experiment in the lab room
its a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance
no one but peter
ock is sitting in a swivel chair with his back to peter
he has the look of captain nemo in his nautilus
this is ocks domain
hello professor octavius
no response i really admired your experiment
back to peter we have a lot of interests in common peter
perhaps we should put our heads together if you know what i mean
flattered that would be
turns with a smile now you take the planetary conjunction
this saturday night we will witness saturn jupiter the moon the earth the sun
all in a row
never seen within the memory of man or measured for its effect
the total gravitational force must be quite exceptional
isnt that the subject of your paper
yes sir ive worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect
im a busy man mr
but i think i could find the time to go over it with you
make sure it all
im sort of working with professor rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us
he thinks that my theory is
well i dont know
to himself the scoundrel
turns angry i want to see that data peter
but professor octavius
if i knew you were interested
sorry ive already given it to
professor rosomorf and he is after all the head of our physics department
and i couldnt
ock turns sweet again
he smiles too broadly
well im certain something can be worked out
run along young man
peter begins to leave
just a minute
how about if i show you my discoveries
something i never showed to any other student
as a matter of fact to anybody at all
well i am really flattered i mean id love to
very well shall we say if you come here tonight
but professor i dont now if i should
make it eight sharp
ill be waiting for you
peter looks worried then leaves
ock turns to weiner who slouches against the wall smiling
the same academic world thats so keen to embrace that boys undergraduate work ridicules my anti force theory as quackery
i ask you weiner
what is our society coming to
they are all a bunch of brainless assholes thats what i say
go get me that boys data
cost you fifty bucks
weiner hissing just get it
well negotiate your fee when you have the data alright weiner
establish as art deco building well beyond its prime
a sign says the daily bugle
peter enters the building
very forties very messy
jameson scans some photos as peter stands helplessly by
i hate bag ladies
jameson is ish grey at the temples brush cut on top
he too is forties
his chewed up cigar is forties
this guy is a hard case
looks at the other photos little kids
i hate little kids
this is a daily newspaper
we need news value photographs not artsy fartsy shit
jameson comes to a picture of a business suited man with a mohawk
peter smiles in anticipation
you want a pros assessment
handing photos back your photos suck
cigar for emphasis parker my readers are morons
i gotta grab them by the eyes
every time you press the button of that nikon of yours it costs you fifty five cents
so the next time youre about to take the plunge ask yourself am i taking dog bites man
because if you are
i know i know
you want man bites dog
parker this is the post modern th century
i want man eats dog
a seedy east village walk up
peter takes his camera and takes various shots of a wino
he climbs the stairs to his building looks through the mail he collects from a beaten down mailbox
rent more bills rent
a one room shabby roof apartment a chaos of books and papers
a photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots x s tacked to the walls a spare camera and lenses
self consciously wacky kitsch plastic dinosaurs wind up toys a stuffed carp
an unmade bed and a s dinette set are the only furniture
a grimy skylight leads to the roof
its not a pretty place but it has personality
a voice from the kitchen a shadow of an intruder is sneaking around
theres nothing in there worth stealing
from within the kitchen thats the understatement of the year
aunt may youre trespassing
comes in i was just so desperately bored
i thought id come over and make you dinner
i am old enough to
to make my own but i didnt feel like getting to know your roaches
ill introduce you
and those foul chemicals in the pots
i take pictures remember
anyway ive decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills
she grabs her coat crosses back to peter and tugs on his shoulder
its friday night
do you have a date
then come on
it is dark and empty except for computers
sitting at it lit by the glow of its screen is solomon rosomorf roz
as he works a door opens behind him
someone walks quietly through the lab
rosomorf keeps working
the intruder approaches
at his ear professor rosomorf what happened here
someone tried to rob me of some paper
i suspect they were looking for that one
what is it
unruffled award winning stuff
turning slightly peter parkers data on the planetary conjunction
damn lucky i hid it in my computer under another title
my god whats going on in our school
first professor octavius almost blows up the physics lab
you report it in triplicate of course
thorkel be careful when you talk to octavius
the man is a very fragile genius
one day hell bring us all the noble prize
rosomorf the man is a very dangerous crackpot
off screen the voice of the cyclotron whine begins to build
thats him again
hes working day and night
i tell you the man is very dangerous
the whine grows louder come on rosomorf lets stop him before this building will explode
ock and weiner are at work as before
ock takes no notice of the two men who come in nor the worker who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a big lock to the door
shut it down octavius
ock ignores him
weiner touches ocks shoulder
ock ignores him too
youve blown half the circuits in the science center
call an electrician
i have called the locksmith
what is he doing
he points toward the worker whos working on the lock on the main door
we have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines
please otto we must lock it up
to thorkel youre denying me access to my cyclotron
ock glares back and forth between the two men the worker and weiner
then he pulls back the red power throttle
the whine descends
the waldos pull back and dangle from their panel
the whine dies
contemplating okey dokey
just give me till tomorrow
i want to clean up my papers
tomorrow you can have this room
few more hours wont make a difference
he signals to the worker to stop
mets are playing baseball on t
peter watches with his uncle ben a paunchy years old in polyester slacks and a comfy old sweater
mets cap is perched on bens head
a beer can is in his hand
a cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them
no im fine uncle ben
way to do it
to peter you dont follow the mets like you used to do you pete
no not so much anymore
when your mom and dad uh passed away
i had this idea
i wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was
geez what ever happened to that
soft and warm yeah
babe ruth you wasnt
aunt may enters
its on the table
turn off the tv
ben nods rises sluggishly and slowly and turns the sound off only
peter moves toward his aunt in the doorway
hows that girl you told us about peter
but she has a boyfriend
peter passes aunt may and takes his seat
a boy your age should have a girlfriend
she has a steady boyfriend
peter any girl thats worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend
but if she really gets to know what you have to offer shell
you get my drift
look just leave him alone okay
when hes ready for girls hell be a holy terror
winks its in the blood
now serious business lookit how are you fixed for money pete
maybe i can help you out a little
lying to them no im alright
my scholarship covers almost everything and i sell some photos here and there
today my physics professor asked for some of my work
he wants to study my data
they might publish my work in the science magazine
thatll bring me some money
practically cheering publish your work
you hear that may
embarrassed laughs yeah in fact i have to leave a little early tonight to meet professor octavius
he offered me to be his assistant
did you hear that may
oh peter you promised youd spend the night
i cant aunt may
professor octavius wants to discuss my new findings
disappointed peter what you should be finding
is a nice girlfriend
weiner is eating a large sandwich and a drinking a coke
ill show them
closing the cyclotron on me
where is he
its ten past eight oclock
with mouth full that must be him
he opens the door
you are late
to weiner weiner go outside and get us something to eat
and dont steal it
just buy it
ill reimburse you
to peter do you want anything parker
no thank you i just had dinner at my aunts
piss off weiner
peter wanders around
he goes into the experimental chamber he overlooks the spider which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open window
and into the chamber
okey dokey parker
how would you like to take weiners place
i mean be my assistant
well professor that would be a great honor but im already working with
dont you understand kid that i am about to uncover the greatest discovery since einstein came up with his theory of relativity
the anti force
the theory of the anti force
you should go for the noble prize professor
noble shmoble i am going for a much bigger prize kid
let me show you kid what i got here
ock begins the experiment
we move in past the shattered window
we see the spider crawling on the chambers gear
present maximum anti force power to date is percent of theoretical limit
i have patched in the variable particle wave accelerator
shrugs i will now try to reach power
big breath and if your paper has any value
i can use it to get the power im missing to create the anti force to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other
sorry professor i cant do it
i gave my word to professor rosomorf
ock is angry
ock now sees the spider
he shoots out a waldo to try and crush it but the spider is too fast
the waldo slams against the wall of the chamber
he starts to push every button or switch in sight
a deafening whining starts
an urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the relative gravity dial
it is at
kg but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly
insert the glowing kg weight
insert the power dial inches toward power
thats all im missing
parker we can be rich together
id better go now
really angry now youll be sorry parker
another urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the monitor screen
on it flashing red is the word overload
ock pushes the red power throttle forward
the whine increases to a pulse and throb
incredibly lit the spider is dropping on its shimmering web strand down toward the kg weight which now glows in time with the throb and pulse
the monitor is flashing maximum overload shut down
ock continues with the experiment
and then he sees the you
get out of there you creeping
he tries to shove the spider with his hand
through the blue white we can barely make out ock on the other side if the shattered window
he sends two waldos after the spider
the spider evades him and jumps onto the professors back
it then climbs onto the professors neck and bites him
the gravity dial goes to
then pops back up as ocks tiny world goes berserk
dials spin crack explode or droop liquidly
wires dance on the console which erupts like the th of july
ock begins to float
his shirt begins to tear away
a dial floats by with its pulled wires undulating like a medusa
waldos smash through the walls and flail like snakes
ocks yellow thermos distorts and explodes
ock his hair wild face locked in a multi g grimace is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with ecstasy above the din its an energy
we see clearly the spider still stuck to his neck
the big beast buffets and shakes
tubes junctions valves and whatnot fall off crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own
then an enormous explosion rips a large hole in the cyclotrons side sending debris and a hundred micro streams of electronic particles lancing in our direction
the pulsing blue white light penetrates first the door of the cyclotron room and then the very walls
lockers bang lamps pop the ceiling sags in a surreal rubbery way
the walls sag too
the cyclotron sign pivots and embeds itself in a wall
a ladder sinks in the wall
the blue white light dances wildly about in pulses
then suddenly it stops
weiner comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of pepsi
weiner enters ocks lab singing not at first noticing whats going on
suddenly he stops dead
a scene out of dalis surrealistic canvas
there are things inside of other things
dials look like dali watches
this place has been rippled to the max
ock lays face up unconscious on the floor a waldo across his chest
the spider is weaving its web
camera slowly down to see ock
pipes and wires are stuck to his body
the waldo seems to be wrapping him
he wakes up to see those mechanical arms buried in his body
they weave around him as if they are looking for prey
he tries to tear them out but they seem to be a part of his body like his other limbs
suddenly weiner sees professor
what happened to you
what did you do
suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor
oh my god
what happened here
he hears the police sirens approaching he runs away
i better get out of here
the long scream segues to a police siren
a cop car pulls to a halt in front of the college
many nypd cars are already there along with a nuclear regulatory van some ambulances a van from the environmental protection agency and two tv vans
roz runs across the lawn
police struggle to hold back the crowd of press students and general gawkers
jameson pushes to the front of the mob in time to see two cops hustle a bugle photographer back into it
the man shakes his head
jameson throws down his cigar stomps it and pulls out a fresh one
thorkel arrives to address the crowd
through bull horn there is no danger
please go back to your dorms
i repeat there is no danger
approaches him spill it out professor
the public wants to know
the crowd closes on thorkel
who are you
jameson daily bugle chief editor now what really happened here
there will be a press announcement in the morning mr
now if youll excuse me
this elicits a flood of ad libs i heard a terrible explosion
are you guys making mutants in there
i have nothing to say
there will be an announcement
now please go home
we must clear the grounds
in the back of the crowd are peter harry liz flash and you think theyll cancel classes
the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas
how about nuclear contaminations
lets beat it
but nobody moves
more interested in other things could anyone be in there peter
concerned i dont know
maybe professor octavius
he usually works late
that nut i bet it was all his doing
seeing peter hey parker
peter pushes forward
what are you doing here
whats going on
thats for them to know and for you to find out
but sir they wouldnt tell us
you heard thorkel
a press announcement tomorrow
but we must know tonight parker
this is your university right
you got your camera
sure but i cant a hundred dollars says you can
get inside and get pictures fifty bucks
you just said a hundred
seventy but i want blood and gore
calling back seeya guys
he dashes off
flash shakes his head in dismay at this guy
where is he going
to make fifty bucks
peter approaches a cyclone fence keeping low and out of sight
he leaps it like a skirmisher but fails ignominiously in a heap
hes torn his pants and cut his leg
he moves to the side of the building
a dumpster sits next to a fire door
as peter mulls over his next move the lock clicks and the door slowly opens
peter leaps on the dumpster
and falls in
peter lays in the garbage a pained look on his face
he rolls over and comes face to face with a wet daily bugle
the headline reads wave of violence rips city
he pulls himself up and peers out
he sees a uniformed guard hold the door open for three men in radiation suits who remove some weirdly fused objects
when they let the door swing closed peter stops it by inserting the newspaper in the top
peter squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the newspaper
the door closes behind him
skewed strange surreal peter stares at the weirdness and fumbles with his camera
he snaps off a few shots then freezes when he hears a familiar voice
filtered through face mask take it easy
take it easy with him
take him away and never bring him back
now we see roz and thorkel following guards carrying ock in a stretcher
they all wear radiation suits
a waldo sneaks out from under the sheet and hits thorkel as fast as lightning
he falls back
hes covered with a sheet and attached to life support equipment
what was that
what was what
what hit me
what hit you
i dont know
it was so fast
youre going to be fine otto
peter gets off a shot and ducks into the mens room leaving the door ajar for a peak
a waldo slips down from the sheet
peters eyes go wide at the sight
what in the hell has happened here
the urinals are twisted in bizarre shapes
pipes are exposed and spout water
the mirrors look like something out of a funhouse
peter hears the stretcher go by
peter goes to the door of ocks lab and cracks it
pan up to the spider glowing softly dangling from a shimmering strand above peter
as peter looks out at the stretcher the spider drops on his neck
he reacts by swatting it away
the glowing spider now squats malevolently on the back of peters hand
he stares at it transfixed
peter throws the spider to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door
sweat starts to bead on peters face
he shakes his head to clear it
his vision becomes uncertain
he lurches against a weird sink
peters pov is not just uncertain not just fuzzy not just moving in and out anamorphically
its all of that
heavily distorted hey
what are you doing here kid
peter turns to see a uniformed guard distorted by his crazy vision
i feel a little funny
heavily distorted yeah
well i aint laughing
just get out of here
it bangs open
the guard throws peter out and then throws his back pack at him
still distorted you get yourself over to the police lines
ultra wooz right
peter melds into the crowd
as in a dream jameson appears at his side
distorted okay scoop whaddaya got
got pictures of the professor
its so strange in there
winks good job kid
bizarre is what we need
pick this up in the morning
holding up his camera therell be two crisp twenties tucked inside
he hurries off
peter peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus
the sweat is gone
he makes his way through the crowd to the street
we track with peter as the madding throng recedes behind him
he turns a corner
he hears a siren
an ambulance screeches around the corner
it nearly hits peter who leaps to avoid it
peters cheek is pressed against the brick
he opens his eyes and sees that hes hanging onto the side of the building like a spider
and hes three stories up
he looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him
and the ambulance which he jumped over is driving away
he tries a downward step but a brick dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk
he takes an upward step
and then another
tentatively at first and then with growing confidence he crawls to the roof of the building
at the top he gropes for a railing and slips
he dangles eight stories above the street
then with a grunt he vaults to the roof one handed
peter is flat on his back staring at the stars
he sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands
on the back of his right hand are two puncture wounds surrounded by a faint blue white pulsing glow
the glow disappears
mutters to himself this is weird
my god i feel so weird
he leaps to his feet
in fact great weird
he tries a couple of jumping jacks and on the third jump he soars into the air
exhilarated very weird
the great bespangled new york city is his backdrop as peter jumps and turns and does loops in the air
with the agility and tactility of a spider peter leaps from the railing to a wall to a flag pole to another wall where he lands sideways and sticks
sideways very very weird
he leaps off the wall and lands at the edge of the roof
he looks down
no ones looking back
so he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof
peter lands on it
the next roof is seven stories up and across the street
peter bites his lip
well what the hell
backlit by a full moon peter somersaults to the roof of the taller building and misses the top
he sticks to the brick facade upside down
he laughs with the moment
a window opens below him and a pretty blonde in a towel sticks her head out
she looks this way and that and all she sees is a man in a loud sportcoat down the street
never thinking to look up she withdraws into the room
the man in the loud sportcoat leans against a lamp post and lights a cigarette with a beat up silver plated in the lighter he sees a reflection of peter
leaping off the taller building
he snaps around and looks up in time to see peter make it to the next facade
with the uptown skyline behind him peter casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop
watching from the street the man in the loud sportcoat follows peters progress
peter leaps to a brownstone and lands amid the wash
he leaps up to a tenement and lands on a billboard across which he does a bug crawl and leaps again
he touches down on a pigeon coop and bounds up and out of frame again
the coop owner a latino in an undershirt and a yankees cap comes running out of the coop
hes so surprised that he leaves the door open and twenty white morning doves fly away in a furious flapping free at last
the latino lets out a stream of hispanic expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene gestures
peter slides down a cable to a lamp post and swirls down the pole to a phone booth
peter comes face to face with the man in the loud sportcoat
he gives peter his card

reading card max reiss models strip dancers escort girls blue movies

peter pulls out a quarter
and enters a phone booth
what time is it

well no i mean yeah im fine but listen
aunti the craziest thing happened to me tonight
as uncle ben stirs fitfully lovingly does this have to do with a certain girl we talked about at dinner

he bangs the phone booth
goes out and jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof
ock is prepped for surgery
gowned personnel hurry about with a feverish urgency
the chief surgeon checks the sensors attached to ocks head
these seasoned professionals are astonished and frightened
whispers look at these brainwave readings
the mental activity is ten times of any normal man
whispers equipment malfunction
whispers hell yeah
checks ocks chest my god
i thought id seen everything
whispers but this is beyond medicine
this is madness
ock lays bare chested face up all four waldos splayed
he is a true cyborg
part man part machine
part organic part molybdenum steel
leaning in blitzed it is so freaky
stern for the staffs sake okay lets stop yakking and get cracking
i want to go in at the upper thoracic
then well work our way around
slaps ocks shoulder hang in there man
insert the waldo nearest the slap moves ever so slightly
the triangular claw rotates a quarter turn and then turns back
the nurse sees it and screams
number seven scalpel
arthroscope stand by
read out parameters in progress
lets go in
yes of course
a larger one
the largest we have
she slaps a huge one into his palm
he takes a deep breath and goes to work
masked heads gather round him
the scalpel is poised at the line where skin meets steel
we make an incision
the instruments go crazy
warning bells and buzzers sound
kill the alarms
hes going off the chart
a waldo flashes around the steel leg of the operating table and clanks tight
sutures and clamps
were losing him
a heart machine is rushed in
they work frantically
stabilizing alpha waves
surgeon applies the cardiac shock pads
you have a visitor doctor
she leaves ock and thorkel alone
enjoying this octavius im afraid i have bad news for you
the cyclotron is damaged
what used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon
but my work
your work is a disaster
look at yourself
i dont matter
nobody matters anymore
to enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own
what are you saying
ock gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his waldos and arms
bags of sleepy sluggish flesh
what would you say
oh my god what are those horrible things sticking from your body
gets more and more excited thorkel if i told you that for one moment in time i broke all the laws
for one brief glorious moment i broke through to the other side
i became creation
what on earth are you rambling about
i see it all so clearly now
universal destruction yes
all i need is the power
then i can destroy this illusion you call life
it is my destiny to lead us to the light
youre a madman
and you are a fool
i will end the universe as you know it
and in that final moment
ill laugh my ass off while youre kissing yours goodbye
excited goodbye is right octavius
you are history doctor octavius
and i couldnt be more pleased to be the first to tell you this good news
a waldo shoots up and grabs thorkel by the throat
he gasps and screams silently as the telescoping waldo lifts him off his feet
he rises until his head is just inches from the ceiling
his last words let me down ock
let me down
then ock smiles and slams thorkels head through the ceiling
plaster rains down
thorkels legs scissor and kick and then go limp
ock throws his dead body on to the bed and covers him with the white sheets
through the window of the taxi we see madison square as it pulls up a sign reads midnight madness
mtvs rock and wrestling slammy awards
the taxi come to a stop
looking up at the sign mtv wrestling
getting out thats the place
pay the man
max reiss gets out he is carrying a box
im not real interested in watching a wrestling match
who said anything about watching a wrestling match
youre here to win a wrestling match
you must be kidding
reiss hustles peter inside
you hop around
you know the way you did last night
your opponent gets tired
he falls down
the ref counts to three you win and we pick up a thousand bucks
we can hear the crowd screaming at something in the background as reiss leads peter to an employee washroom and shows him the box
youre really gonna love this
look really i dont know
you dont have to know
i know enough for both of us
pause change in there
what is this
something that fits your talent
go put it on

he slaps the box against peters chest and all but pushes him inside
peter takes the suit out of the box
it is the spider man suit
he looks at it and shrugs
then he begins to struggle into it
peter is looking at himself in the mirror
he is dressed in all but the mask
and he looks terrific
he smoothes his hair
hes starting to get into it
crusher cole is destroying an opponent
reiss winces as the crowd cheers and boos
comes out how does it look
i feel like its halloween
cover your face with the mask
mystery my friend
nobody should know who you are
crusher cole is doing a big flexing number and the crowd is going wild
there are mtv cameras and signs and banners proclaiming the slammies everywhere
and now a new challenger for the thousand dollar fight weighing in at one hundred and fifty pounds
from parts unknown
here is the amazing
snorts from ringside hating the name no not superman
the crowd boos the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly through the ropes
rock music blares
twin redheads in red bikinis ring a bell
crusher cole and spider man circle
cole is twice spideys size
spidey spots a tv camera for the first time
he momentarily freezes
crusher sneers the crusher sneer
then he charges
with the agility of a spider spidey leaps out of the way
crusher comes back at him
spidey leaps again bigger
the acrobatics get more and more dramatic as crusher cole works himself up into a theatrical rage
taunts erupt from the crowd
kill the sucker crusher
spidey really getting into it now begins playing for the between two blondes whatsamatter crusher cant you crush that bug

the match continues in an increasingly spectacular choreography
crusher bellows at the screaming crowd
but theres a gleam in his eye
this is it
spidey playing the cameras for all hes worth leaps way way up
but this time crusher stops dead in his tracks
spider man comes back down into a forearm smash that sends him reeling into a corner
crusher does a flying pin
the air leaves spidey in a rush as crusher covers him smothering him
the crowd goes wild
not realizing his own strength and panicky about being squashed spider man throws crusher cole off him and up into the air
spider man comes down and knocks crusher for the first time
crusher flies away and out of the arena eight rows back
the hipster sees crusher coming at him and bolts from his seat
crusher lands on it in between the two blondes who break into utter hysterics
spidey surprised at his own strength watches crusher land
whispers to himself wow
ladies and gentlemen history is made today we have here the first man to win a thousand dollars against the mighty crusher
the ref raises his hand in victory
the crowd boos and debris rains down
but some in the crowd cheer wildly recognizing the new sensation
spider man steps down from the right as reiss leads the max

we are going to get a thousand peter turns with reiss and comes face to face with crusher cole
two ominous beats

the nurse leads peter and liz and harry into the room

we hold for a beat
when liz takes a step forward to look around we expect the worst
but nothing grabs her
peter sees a pile of plaster on the floor
he looks up and sees the hole in the ceiling
liz and harry look up too
ock is not there
ock is not here
my god what happened
id better call the doctor
youd better call the police
ock hiding his waldos under a white hospital robe
he stalls until he reaches the door
then one of his waldos peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door
ock in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal debris
two waldos reach out and sense the ripples on opposite walls
he runs a hand through his hair
what a wreck
what a useless wasted wreck
we rebuild you my damaged darling
bigger better hotter
a world class super cyclotron
he hears a noise behind him and reacts
and here comes weiner
bedraggled shuffling through the control room door
he eyeballs the incredible wreckage
there you are doc

whoa this place is messed up
ock turns waldos writhing
weiner sees them and kind of ducks remembering how he was hit by them once

a camera is mounted on a tripod facing us
a timer winds down and it clicks
spider man is clinging to the side of a wall
and one like this
changing pose and one looking real sincere
the white eyes narrow to a slit
suddenly he spots weiner climbing onto his roof
weiner tiptoes into the roof apartment
spider man jumps in and grabs him
what are you doing here

spider man throws him back onto the roof so that he almost slides over the edge
weiner turns facing spider man

spider man jumps and reaches weiner

spider man picks up weiner throws him up to an antenna above the building to which weiner clings desperately
spider man circles the antenna

spider man jumps to the chimney picks weiner up in his arms and whispers to him
and by the way peter parker does not live here anymore
spider man jumps with weiner in his arms to the edge of the roof
and tell the professor he cant have peters data
spider man drops weiner off the roof three floors straight down into heavy bushes below
a sign tells us so
a clerk is double checking a long list of items ock has ordered

two guards open the banks doors
suddenly a waldo smashes through the drivers side window of the armored truck wrapping around the drivers neck and pulling him through the window
the shotgun goes for his weapon but a waldo smashes in and pulls the gun out through his window
two waldos shoot out and attach themselves to the rear whats going on here

peter is left alone peter leaves toward the entrance
at the rear door a big lizard passes a note to a dallas cowgirl who passes it to a kangaroo
the kangaroo hops across the dance floor to the stage where he hands the note to a young woman in a baseball uniform
she climbs the stage where she is bathed in a spotlight
she gets a drum roll from the band

they do a short simple number
spidey returns liz to flash

the real spider man slides to center floor
the crowd backs away as spidey spins out the greatest dance number in film history

he breaks the place up
then drops in a pose
liz stops breathless very near to spider mans face
whispers breathless who are you

ben is flicking through the channels of his tv aggravated as usual

goddamn rock and rolls screwed up the whole tv
he flicks off the set and turns to may whos asleep on the couch
he gently nudges her

it enters the east river drive
as the city rolls by

the taxi skids and swerves like crazy bumping into everything in sight
a glass shatters
aunt may sits up in bed with a start
go back to sleep
another crash oh ill go look
go back to sleep
weiner is going through the drawers
he finds a nice bone handle knife and pockets it
ben descends the stairs from the bedroom
he peers off into the darkness and pulls his robe tight around him as if to ward off some unacknowledged danger
taxi driving fast through street
some crazy kinda town huh
you hear about that hold up
the guy with the six arms
hey i see it all on this job
a beat what kinda outfit is that anyway
panicked look im really in a hurry
a blow out
the cabbie fights the wheel to the side of the road
then he turns to spidey
sly you said the magic words we have a flat boychick
ben comes in and looks around
a long beat
then a noise
a very scared weiner hides eyes widening
weiner takes the bone handle knife from his pocket
it glints in the moonlight
he moves off
ben is looking for mice
he opens a closet
he shifts around
he moves off
the cabbie slowly changes the tire
fearing the worst spidey gets out looking for a ride
a truck approaches
spidey looks down at the cabbie and then up at the truck
you wanna hand me that lug wrench
he looks up to see spidey go by stuck to the side of the truck like a spider
some crazy kinda town
spidey stares at the lettering on the side of the truck
it says victory sporting goods
a thought sporting goods
ben comes in quietly
he looks around
he opens a closet
he hears a crash
a shadowy figure runs by a doorway
ben takes off like a shot
ben runs through the rooms
ben flies in and goes right to the rifle on the wall
we hear weiner clattering around the house in the background as ben goes to a drawer and pulls out a box of bullets
he begins to fight the bullets into the rifle
weiner comes flying in and tackles him
they fall to the floor four hands on the rifle
all i want it the kids computer crap
let go before i blow your brains out
the truck pulls away leaving peter in a pool of street lamp light
hes wearing a football jersey and shorts and carrying a sports bag
he begins to run
may hears a crash
she pulls the covers up around her chin in fear
you let go
peter runs up and hears a shot
he runs inside
peter runs in
he sees weiner standing there with the rifle
they face off across the room
the moment hits peter like a punch in the chest
a wheeze peter
peter rushes to ben
oh my god
peter tries to revive ben while weiner runs out
plastic furniture garish lighting cigarettes in the a brave but fragile front ben gets through everything
hell be alright
the doctors are
aunt may and peter embrace leaning on each other for support
compassionate excuse me
you the nephew
peter rises nods
as aunt may wipes away a sniffle
your uncles a brave man
apparently the perpetrator was after something of yours
your uncle didnt know what it was but he stood up to him anyway
you ought to be proud of him
how is he
a grim faced doctor walks slowly across the room to them
may stands up slowly
ask the doctor
hows my husband doing
parker im sorry
the detective pulls peter gently away
the staff works on let the medics handle it
pause look if it makes you feel any better
were gonna nail this guy
he crashed his getaway car
we got him trapped in a warehouse on jackson
to peter shes alright
she just fainted
well have to check her for symptoms of shock
if you want to wait you can get some coffee on the third floor
i think i wanna go out for some fresh air
cop cars cops searchlights playing their beams against the acme chemical storage building
gunfire flashes from one of the windows
elite cops in baseball caps are plotting strategy
that place is loaded with solvents and chemicals
if we blast our way in its gonna go up like a roman candle
we could go in through the fifth floor wash room
whats that up there
throw a light on that
cop directs the beam of the searchlight
spider man is climbing it trapped in the glare of the searchlight
hes got a partner
every cops weapon is trained upward at spider man
on radio we got an accomplice up there
and we got a clear shot
do we have a go
filtered thats a go
gunshots erupt around spider man and he skitters around to evade them
thinking theyre shooting at him weiner shoots back
in the corner of his eye he sees spider man at a side window
he aims his rifle and spidey ducks out of the way
the frightened weiner moves to the side window to blow spidey away
as he moves past the front windows he is lit by the searchlights that play on his face darkly
spidey leaps in at front window and drops neatly behind weiner landing a pose
cold hard say your prayers weiner
weiner whips around and fires
spidey leaps to avoid it and lands on a stack of paint cans
you aint takin me
who ever you are
spidey gathers himself tighter
a second gun burst comes in behind him several paint cans erupt in cascades of color
hanging on ceiling hey creep
weiner aims and fires several times
he is emptying his rifle
spidey leaps away and lands on the top of a cask marked caution flammable solvent
taunting try again
the cask gives way and spidey is plunged into the flammable solvent
weiner smiles his stupid grin and takes aim
spidey leaps out of the cask and sticks to the roof beam
hes sopping wet
his hand slips down the beam as the solvent works against his sticking power
he falls to the floor and scrambles behind some paint cans
weiner crazed fires wildly
one of the cans explodes
paint flows from it
spidey peeks out and sees a yellow river of flame creeping toward him
he sniffs his solvent soaked outfit
he backs down a corridor of paint cans
the yellow fire follows now joined by a river of blue fire from another can
theyre following the trail of solvent hes dripping
on bullhorn this is your last chance you two
either youre coming out or were coming in
spideys against the wall
paint cans to his right and left and a river of red flame joins the yellow and blue as they creep toward him
he climbs backwards up the wall face toward the blaze
the colored fires join and follow him up the wall
theyre licking at his feet
at the window stay back
gun burst whoa
stay back down there
spidey is inches from being torched
he sees a pipe
he reaches out and grabs it
he swings out above the flames
but the pipe begins to bend
the pipe bends down
and then breaks
spidey hangs precariously as water cascades out of the pipe and puts out the fire
spidey drops down and rest his head in his hands to collect himself
then looks up
the gun is at his head
stand up you
you have thirty seconds to come out
youre my ticket outa here
gimme that stupid mask
spider man hesitates
then he begins to raise the mask but stops and shakes his head no
then ill take it myself
he reaches for the mask and spider man flips him across the room
weiner lands in a cargo net and becomes ensnared
well look what weve caught in our web
dont hurt me man
please dont hurt me
cops are poised at the door
they crash inside
hold your fire
weiner is hanging from the ceiling in the the cargo net
get me out of this madhouse
he falls down immediately encircled by the police officers
spider man flies above their heads crashing through the window and disappears into the dark of night
a weird flickering blue light dances around the hole in the cyclotron
then it cuts out
a helmeted man pulls himself out of a hatch
he flips up the helmet
ock is finishing putting together his new equipment
smiling okey dokey
ock goes about checking out the cyclotron
it looks good
ock starts flicking switches and reading dials doing a mission countdown for his next experiment
this place has been hot rodded to the max
reading dials and numbers amperage okay
negative variable differential
he shuts it down
the whine whirs down
now all i need is parkers data
where the hell is weiner
i cant trust anybody
throws his waldo in the air only you my babies
only you can i trust
if i have to do everything myself
im going to do it
to his equipment ill be back
my new babies
ock hides the waldos under his coat and leaves the room
there is more equipment than before
peter is deep at work
his spider man uniform hangs on the wall
there is a knock at the door
are you finished with my computer yet
i got a paper too you know
panicked oh my god
oh its you liz
i didnt expect you
give me a minute
he hides his spider man costume
liz waits impatiently
opening the door hi liz
come on in
liz enters looking around
peter covers for this and that
what were you doing in here
looking around cleaning up
ill get your computer
wheres flash parked
he picks up the computer and turns to her but shes already looking around the apartment
flash didnt come
holding it oh
how are you going to get it home
liz walks into the room
she discovers the prints of spidey that peter has taped up around the apartment
you must spend a lot of time with this spider man guy
dont you think you ought to unplug that
peter looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall
embarrassed he puts the computer back down
embarrassed i uh ill go down to the corner
see it i can hail that taxi
she likes peter
why is he so
a shadow of a man can be seen hiding
peter does not notice him
theres a knock at the door
crossing to it wondering peter
she is about to open the door when four waldos smash through it obliterating it
ock stands in the shattered doorway waldos writhing
finds the words youre so weird
what do you call those
did you hear about spider man
moving waldos like spiders legs thats me
the real spider man
now tell me where is that jerky friend of yours
hes not here
i dont think hell be back for awhile
running his waldo in her hair you wouldnt lie to your professor now would you
of course not
why would i lie about a thing like that
ock grabs lizs hair with his waldos
what are you doing
let me go
take those things out of my hair
my waldos you mean
whatever you call them
ock shoots out two waldos
simultaneously each grabs a chair from different parts of the room and brings them to the table
he does too and folds his waldos across his chest
chatty hes a nice boy
a little nerdy maybe but nice wouldnt you say
oh i dont know
hes very inexperienced
one of ocks waldos rests on the table curled around the computer
liz lets her hand rest on it
ock warms immediately
you know youre a fascinating young lady
youre so refreshing
gone to far oh i wouldnt say shocking
she sticks his waldo in the electric wall socket behind the computer
the current sizzles through him and he leaps up waldos akimbo like the cartoon cat
liz runs out the door
ock extricates himself from the current and gives chase
liz burst from the door
she looks both ways for peter doesnt see him and takes off
ock bursts from the doorway and runs off after liz
liz running as fast as she can but ock is gaining quickly
a taxi drives up and disgorges peter
he walks in
its empty liz
screaming from the street peter
peter springs into action
he grabs his spidey suit out of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes
liz looks back and sees ock cartwheeling toward her
she cant outrun him
she must hide
theres a construction site on the right
she ducks down the alley next to it
liz runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides by a high cyclone fence
behind her ocks waldos stretch out like waterbug legs
he bug walks into the alley and laughs down at her from his perch atop the waldos
peter parker has something i want
and im going to have something he wants
she dashes past him and runs into the outboard cargo she looks for the up button and finds nothing
ock on his feet now is on the wire mesh elevator cage in a flash
he tears the outer door away
liz starts pressing knobs and levers in panic
the light goes on
a warning bell clangs
she finally finds the switch and the car leaps up just as ock tears off its front door
liz safe for the moment watches ock recede below shaking the torn off door in a rage
extending waldo over waldo ock climbs the elevator housing chasing the rising car inside
the car arrives and liz jumps out
shes on nothing but a narrow girder
she tightropes on the girder
ock gets to the top
he looks across at her
shes stuck between two unfastened girders at a dead end
he slowly telescopes a waldo toward her
shes got no place to run no place to hide
he grabs her by the blouse and lifts her off the put her down ock
ock looks across the street
there on the top of a tall building is spider man
i know whats happening to you ock
ive been through a lot of changes myself lately
you have to listen to me
holding liz who the hell are you
seeing spidey spider man
thats a lot of crap clown
i am spider man not you
points to liz ask you girlfriend
to liz tell him
im a good friend of peter parkers ock
just like that girl youre holding
now let her go
ock thinks for a moment then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming liz out over the street ten stories up
let her go
what an excellent idea
if you do not deliver your friend mr
spider man yes
yes of course ill let her go
put me down you mechanical mutant
liz is having none of this
she kicks she fights
she flails around making things a little worse
the ground is yawning death beneath her
part of her blouse tears away and liz plummets
spider man swoops down on a web strand in his characteristic compound curve
he reaches out for the falling liz and misses her cleanly
the web is too short
falling away you jerk
he thwips her with a second web and together they swing to a high girder where he deposits her safe and sound
straightening herself tell your friend peter next time ill get the taxi myself
you phony spider man
prepare to meet your death bug
spidey thwips a beam and swings across toward ock
whispers actually im rather fond of living
he looks at liz he lands on ocks girder and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time ten stories above the street
a last appeal to reason octavius
just stop and think
i am thinking insect
im thinking about exterminating you
okay if thats the way you want it
lets see what those chrome knuckles can do doc
a waldo lances out and catches spidey flush on the jaw
it knocks him to another girder
spidey hangs on and rolls over
he rubs his jaw
spidey gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above
now i must kill you you cretinous clown
ock throws a roundhouse waldo that nearly knocks spidey off the girder
hes just barely hanging on
but spider mans not done yet
he thwips a high beam and swings into a better attack position
the two super adversaries engage in battle
with ock swinging from his waldos like a metal monkey and spidey swinging from his webs like well like spidey they clang and bang through the girders of the once
i dispose of you spider man no one will be able to stop me
stop you from what
ock throws his biggest punch yet
sirens can now be heard in the street
spidey avoids waldo strike after waldo strike
ock eludes web after web
but spideys agility soon has him turning circles
over here octopus
thats professor octopus to you spider jerk
give it up professor
youll never catch me
ock takes three steps and soars through the air
ock misjudging the leap soars right past spidey and into an alley
screaming all the way
ock and two waldos pressed against each of the opposing walls
its a tenuous grip
then very slowly sparks flying from his waldos ock slides down into the alley
so long sucker
cop cars pull up
cops leap from them
ock makes it down sees the cops ducks out of sight
the searchlights go on
spider man swings back across the street to the construction site
there he is
its that spider man
spidey lands next to liz in a pose
lit by the flashing billboard hes weirder looking than ever
spidey puts an arm around liz and extends a web shooter
what do you think youre doing
im rescuing you
with that spidey leaps way out and he and liz swoop away on a web strand
thanks but nooooooooooo
all weapons point upward at spideys movement
he wont get away this time
hold your fire
hes got a girl
looks like hes got a hostage
spidey sees the weapons aimed upward
he shoots out another web and swings off in a different direction
liz whoops with the g force
wait a minute
where are you taking me
spidey hounded by the police rejected by the girl
i better just take you back where you belong
he shoots out another web
hold on tight
times square where are we
open your eyes
they are standing on the roof of the central tower of the empire university building
liz opens her eyes
its an extraordinary sight
the empire state building if youre trying to impress me spidey i want you to know im not easy
okay im impressed
now put me down spidey
put me down
i like the way you say spidey
nobody calls me spidey
now we go
they swoop down
stopping on one of the buildings sills actually right in front of a window in the dormitory building
tavern on the green wow
look this is our dormitory
i can get to my room
hey wait a minute
theres flash if im not mistaken
you know my name
liz listen to me
theres something i have to tell you
okay put me down and we can talk alright
do you know who i am
all i know is youre the amazing spider man
or better youre spidey the good guy on the block
youre a weirdo in a clown spider suit
and thats all you know about me
a beat a sigh okay lets get your boyfriend
how many do you have
i meant flash
well flash is not exactly my boyfriend
then who is
theres someone i like but hes too shy to notice
flash appears flash
a beat to spider man you know everybody
flash we have to call peter
flash rushes right past liz to the window
theres a newspaper in his hand
hey they wont let up man
shows daily bugle they keep calling you an accomplice in that burglary murder
but thats a crock aint it
im with you spidey thanks
realizing by the way what are you doing with
she needed a lift
this calls for a beer
a lot of beer
thanks but i have some business to take care of
take care of that later
ill get the beer
liz comes tentatively to the window where spidey squats desire and passion in his white eyes
accusatory howd you know this was flashs place
peter parker told me all about it
peter told you all about flash
he told me all about you
see you later
he jumps away flash comes in with more beer than a man ought to carry
hey whered he go
hey spider man
but spider man has disappeared
distracted peter told your hero all about me
he would wouldnt he
spider man lands on it
he drops in the skylight
he drops into the room and pulls off his mask
the place has been ransacked
computer discs are all over the floor
peter pulls a file marked planetary conjunction
he opens it
a piece of paper falls out
it says kiss it goodbye wall crawler
whispers angrily octavius
peter is hurrying along
kim in sunning herself wonderfully
hurrying by kim
have you seen harry
sure lots of times
what a brainiac
have you seen him today
no un unh
catching up peter
keeps walking hi
have you seen harry
what a night huh
laughs yeah that was some ride home
must have been pretty exciting
look i got two tickets to les miserables
im really busy
i mean not tonight
see you later
thinking hey peter
how did you know about last night
what about last night
my exciting ride with spider man
i gotta hurry
i have to find harry
ill see you later
peter runs off
he sees a car approach and flags it
can i get a lift downtown
take your shoes for a walk dork
flash gets out of his car and crosses the lawn toward ock is hard at work
the room still rippled has been hot rodded to the max
lots of jerry rigged stuff has been added
ock takes a sip from the thermos and flicks on the small we are new inserting peter parkers data on tonights planetary conjunction
insert the computer screen displays peter parkers name and id number and the title the planetary conjunction and its effect on earth gravity
insert number sequences appear on the screen
then a graphic of the earth moving into line with saturn jupiter the sun and the moon
in the corner a number rises
to recorder the parker calculations add gravitational force at the moment of full planetary conjunction
hits some keys adding this to present maximum power potential i get
he looks up and sees the screen a graphic hole opening up right through the earth
the widening hole is swallowing everything
i knew it
i knew it
i am putting a countdown clock on the planetary conjunction now
a large digital display reads
the last seconds count down to
playing the computer okey dokey
now lets see if i have enough power to drive this beast
he starts hitting keys on his computer
peter is working on lizs computer
there is a knock at his brand new unpainted door
he hurries to it and pulls the knob so quickly forgetting his own strength that the whole assembly comes off in his hand
pulling harry aside i gotta remember to have that fixed
opens the door there you are ive been looking for you all over town
where were you
i went to the wrestling wanted to see that amazing spider man but he didnt show up
listen harry something terrible happened
my planetary conjunction papers
they were stolen
oh my god
are you sure
who would do such a thing
we have to find out sit down
indicates computer i want to access dr
octavius main program
i want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron
can you do it
starts hacking i can try
i could access the system in the dorm
and through that i could crack the main line
now if we can just disrupt the octavius file
okay lets try
harry cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to the task
the phone rings
peter hits his jerry rigged speaker phone
harry keeps hacking
this is j
looking over harrys shoulder mr
jameson you got me at a bad time
i need pictures of your friend the amazing spider man
but i need bad guy shots you got it
lots of bad guy shots
were gonna pin that insect to the wall
peter hangs up
the dial tone cuts off jameson
only he and the photo assistant are there
what about that kid
on the job already
ock is pacing around the hot rodded room
he checks this and that
he looks at the countdown clock and throws himself down in his chair
he resumes his check down
a long beat acceptable
another beat lets fly
he starts flicking on switches and dials
the whine whirs up
he throws the red power throttle
the power dial goes to
peter and harry are at a computer
the lights flicker and dim
then they go back on
peter and harry look at each other and shrug
insert digital clock display what is it
let me see
its some kind of countdown clock
countdown to what
i dont know but whatever it is its only six hours away
the planetary conjunction
or doc ocks end of the world experiment
wait a minute
youre not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight
you want to wait around till midnight to find out
lets see what else weve got
another set of numbers roll up on the screen
they are accompanied by electrical symbols
it might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti force
thats a lot of energy
what could generate power like that
the closest you could come is the new york city subway system
again the lights flicker and then dim and they return
together we gotta talk to professor rosomorf
roz boards and takes a seat
there are the usual subway types
a fat woman
a pimply teenager and his date a tall skinny girl in a party dress
roz making notations in a pad takes no notice of them
he sits down closes his pad and taps a pencil against his chin
taxis go by
two lovers stroll
we hear a familiar whine
the walk and dont walk signs flash at the same time
make up your mind
the signs explode
the couple stops in their tracks
the boy looks at the girl
whats going on
an arc of electricity now shoots between the light pillars of the subway station on the corner
sparks fly by the window
roz oblivious at first is now stunned by the show
the arcs of electricity continue to rise
the street lights buckle and bend into weird shapes
oh my god
two taxis roar through the intersection and collide
the ethnic drivers leap out and begin arguing
people scream and fall back as the train seems to change angles
a building roar rises from the subway entrance
then the sound of a train whistle
the boy looks down the stairs and has to leap out of the way as the broadway express comes highballing up the steps and blasts through the subway entrance
the train sails through the air
the train crashes into the building in a storm of cyclotron generated dali physics
the throb and pulse recede
screams honks sirens can be heard
a splendidly turned out middle aged woman wakes from her satin sleep to see that a subway train is in the middle of her bedroom
the wall through which the train has come sags and ripples like it has melted and partially resolidified
several passengers climb out of the windows of the train or pry open the doors
what are you doing here
get out of here
get out of here
a crowd has gathered to gawk and point
they look up and we see their pov
the middle car of the train is simply embedded in the high rise its rear sticking out of the building fifteen stories up
from its coupling dangles the last car
the car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and glass of the wall of the building
passengers on the outside of the wall press their faces to the glass and pound for help
roz comes to the aid of a mother with two children
the crowd sees something else
swinging high in the sky is your friendly neighborhood spider man
the couple and two drivers argue about what this means
its spider man
get outa here you bum
hey what are you talking about
back at woman whats the matter lady dont you read the papers
this is the driver of a daily bugle truck carrying the historically famous bugle headline spider man threat or menace
its nearly vertical
people are tumbled over each other
the scared teenager is tearing at the door
the skinny girl screams in a mechanical way
the door opens
he nearly falls
the skinny girl screams again
he manages to get back inside
she looks at him safe now
but she screams again anyway
roz struggles to right himself against a pole
a bag of groceries goes sliding past him
it continues downward and out the open door
insert the bag tumbles down through the air
down down and down
spideys face appears in the window upside down
he slides the window down and flips inside
he walks through the parting passengers to the building wall
he feels it
okay everyone stand back and stay cool
he hurls himself at the fused glass portion and bounces back onto the floor
he rolls over flexing his shoulder
whining is that the real spider man
spidey does a triple flip to his feet
he reaches up for the overhead railing and pulls it down easily
oohs and aahs
spider man points it at the glass and hefts it
somebody wanna give me a hand with this
first the woman and then all of them take up positions on the battering ram
they ram the glass and it shatters
henry stands at the open door of the train in his bedroom as they all come rushing through into the room
step lively now
henry the rugs
oh shut up
have a nice evening maam
and you too henry
the fire trucks arrive and begin assembling a ladder
spidey arrives at the door at the top of the car
he sees roz at the bottom
three people are between them
the skinny girl sees spidey
okay folks just hang on
he scampers down the grab handles to the people below
four passengers cling to seats and bars
okay one at a time
you first maam
a fat woman makes a who me
spidey throws her over his shoulder
insert the coupling which holds the two cars at right angles begins to bend open
spider man the fat woman over his shoulder goes hand over hand to the top and the woman is dumped into the insert the coupling bends open a little more
spidey helps the teenager and the skinny girl out of the car
she takes the dreadful step between cars
she looks down
she steps across
the fire ladder is up
but it is about ten feet short of where its aimed at
the end of the car
a fireman stands at its apex
into walkie gimme more ladder
i need more ladder
negative on that youre at full extension
now only roz is left
spidey approaches him
he clings to a pole
insert the coupling bends open
the car is hanging there from memory
this is doctor otto octavius work
i must get back to my university
i must stop ock
hes gone crazy
can you help me
sure thing just dont take the train
give me your hand
listen to me
if he can do this with the train if hes come this far then i can pretty well predict his next step
hell go to plutonium sl for the power
he must be stopped
or else hell destroy our world
the coupling shrieks and the car lurches
lets get you out of here first professor
wait spider man
i dont think i can make it
you mustnt waste time saving me
you must save the world
you must go and stop ock
where can i find him
he is looking for plutonium sl im sure
the car lurches on its side and roz flies out of the door
spidey thwips out a web that girdles rozs waist
think rosomorf think where one can find plutonium
where could he find sl
roz is hanging in mid air on the web
shouting theres only one place he can get the plutonium sl
any toxic dump would have sl
spidey swings roz in an arc to the fireman
he misses roz on the first pass
roz looks up at spidey who stands in the doorway manipulating the web
the fireman grabs roz
then with an awful screech of steel the car pulls loose from the coupling
with spider man inside it the car plunges ten stories to the street below
cops firemen press the works
the crowd gasps
camera strobes pop as the last car crashes to the sidewalk
we hold several beats on the incredible rubble
then a webbed hand
spider man groggily pulls himself from the wreckage
put your hands up spider man
youre making a big mistake
and youre looking at twenty years
spider man shoots a wad of web goo onto the cops gun and leaps up onto the luxury condo
and swings up out of the frame
the cop aims and shoots
the bullet makes a thwump noise
the web goo stretches out about three feet and falls limp
what the hell
spider man swings painfully one handed and limp at the end of a web strand
after falling ten stories he is groggy and weak
he cant think
he cant focus
he can barely hold onto his wrist gizmos
this bug is spent
must go on
must find ock
must get that crazy old loony
before he gets to the plutonium
where are the toxic dumps
he hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks
he shoots a web up diagonally and swings across on it
this time he catches on and holds but barely
liz is standing
aunt may is seated on the couch she looks weak pale and alone
youre as lovely as peter said you were
embarrassed thank you
he really wanted so badly to come see you
he called me up out of the blue
great concern tell me about peter
whats he been up to
he seems so preoccupied
oh you know peter
hes all caught up in some kind of study hes doing
things are really crazy at the university now
things are crazy
i guess peters just
well you know
pulled into his shell
reminiscing when peter was little he loved to hide
in the closets
under the sink
he always needed a secret place
but when id look for him hed always laugh
he wanted to be found
i dont think he wants me to find him
well id better be going
my friend flash is picking me up
he isnt your boyfriend is he
i think you can guess why
they smile knowingly at each other
liz goes toward the door
finders keepers losers weepers
thats what i used to say to peter when i found him
spider man swings high above it
this is not the confident swinger with liz in his arms
this is a guy whos making it by the narrowest of margins
there is a traffic jam below
got to find ock
got to find the toxic dumps
grabs his head oh
he looks down at the traffic
we pan across the many cars until we come to a non descript green car
ock is honking the horn
something lands on his roof
then spidey sticks his head upside down in the windshield
whats up ock
a waldo smashes through the windshield but misses spidey
ock leaps from the car
on the run youre a doomed bug wall crawler
ive no time to waste on you now
ock runs through honking traffic
spider man leaps from car to car
ock turns to see spider man leap to a limo at the curb
ock turns tail and runs down an alley
a female cop pops out of a doorway
her partner a big young cop pulls his gun
gun poised alright
up against the wall and spread em ock complies
he raises his hands
and spreads the waldos to full extension
the big cop screams and faints
the little female cops eyes pop
ock swats the gun from her hand
he starts to choke her
spidey comes swinging to the rescue
he lands on the roof nearby
hey you big ock why dont you pick on someone your own size
alright spider bug
here ive come for you
ock leaves the cop and attacks spider man shooting his iron fist at him
ock runs to the end of the alley
spidey staggers to his feet and resumes the chase
ock breaks into a red corvette convertible starting it with a waldo
spider man comes out in time to see the vette drive away
a chinese laundry truck is passing
spidey thwips it and is whipped away
he crawls over to the window
could you follow that red vette for me
the surprised chinaman lets loose a stream of chinese expletives complete with appropriate suggestive gestures
spider man crawls to the top of the truck and surveys the situation
he sees a sea of moving traffic
he thwips up a web and swings away
spidey swings along from building to building
the red vette is making headway
suddenly spider man spots a blue mg with its top up
swinging flash thompson
i never thought id be happy to see you
spidey swoops down on the blue mg
spidey wedges down into the car right between flash and liz
flash is thrilled
sorry about that
this is unbelievable
flash i need your help
you got it
you any good with this thing
im the best
catch that vette
roger wilco over and out
spidey falls all over liz
they begin to careen through traffic three peas in a very small pod
with spidey jammed in between liz and flash the mg chases the vette
since neither ock nor flash is any good at this both cars quickly careen into poles fences hot dog cars and begin falling apart
on riverside drive the mg begins to lurch and steam
the vette looks eaten away
the george washington bridge looms ahead
the vette roars through the toll booth
they spot ock stuck in traffic
why is he going to new jersey and who is it in that shitty red car
dont you recognize him
new jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world
what does he want with toxic waste
hes looking for plutonium my dear
the car has to slow down
its in a traffic jam
cant do anything about this traffic
spider man jumps out of the car
try to stay with me
i dont want to lose him
speeding along the bridge ock sees no one
but high above spidey swings from tower to tower after him
at the last tower spidey leaps down onto a big truck
the vette weaves and spidey crosses to another big truck
for a moment he is caught between the two trucks but he makes it across
the vette takes an exit
spidey leaps to the next sign
he aims his wrist gizmo and waits for the next car to take the exit but none does
deflated he drops to the ground
he looks up to see a sign on a cyclone fence
it says dump number keep out radioactive material
the landscape has a nightmarish vision weirdly lit by safety lights
vats and drums ooze all kinds of bad stuff
a light is on in a dilapidated shack
ock is tossing away the canisters until he comes to one marked hazard
plutonium sl hazard
open that now and youll spoil christmas
spideys peering in from a hole in the roof
i am going to squash you to death
once i lay my waldos on your skinny bones
ock hurls a drum at spidey
it erupts in a sizzle of liquid and gas
then the six armed fiend runs for the door with his sl
ock comes flying out and spider man grabs a waldo
spidey does a back flip and whips ock so hard the waldo snaps off
ock recoils it and reacts in horror
with a roar ock attacks spider man
they battle as super adversaries
ock gains the upper hand and tosses spidey into a pile of rusting drums
a gas envelopes spider man and he begins coughing
ocks waldos are coiled around spider mans neck as the web slinger is dragged through the dump
his white eyes narrow and blink
there is a capped well behind a warning sign
ock tears off the cap and then hurls the groggy spidey down the well
goodbye spider man
he cannot grab onto the slimy walls
at the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling blue luminescent pool
spidey claws frantically at the walls
he gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the pool
its weird light shines up at him
he looks up at the starry sky
to himself okay now spidey
easy does it
he shoots a web about halfway up the pit
it hits the wall sizzles and drops back down
to himself dont give up spidey
dont give up
the web gizmo squirts out a pathetic patooey of web goo
then it hisses empty
now what do i do
so youve avoided the nuclear pool have you spider man
well so far so good
but i cant hold on much longer
oh come on ock be a good sport
lets talk this over face to face
throw me a line
spidey reaches out
face to face
ock way up at the opening above raises a huge drum above his head
the drum leaks toxic waste in orange tendrils
he is about to drop it down on spider man
dont do it professor
we now see flash and liz in the blue mg
puts down the drum i know you
and you young lady
both of you are in my physic class arent you
you can help me
i need to get some of these drums to my laboratory
and ill give you special grades
whatd you say
suddenly he catches flash with a waldo and starts to choke him
liz screams and tries to help flash
leave him alone
another waldo grabs her
roz now appears on the scene
leave them alone otto
but they wont help me
everybody is trying to destroy my experiment
and so are you rosomorf
another waldo grabs roz by his arm
i was wrong
ive gone over your research
its brilliant otto
its mad but its brilliant
you have much work left to do
i want to help you otto
for the sake of science go and do your experiment
these kids alone and ill help you
both flash and liz shake their heads okey dokey
ock gestures to flash and liz
help me with these drums i need to get them to my laboratory immediately
do as he says
ock pushes flash and liz with his iron arm
gripping liz be her hair he shoves her into the car
drive flash before i flush your girl right down the toilet
professor rosomorf its no good double dealing
why did you help him
rosomorf finds a rope and looks into the well
dont lose your energy screaming
catch this rope and climb up come on
they drive along the highway
spidey is recovering working his neck
ive been through the octavius data
he has enough power with his plutonium
especially if he gets his hands on parkers data there he has enough power to do what he wants to do
and we are not going to stop him in time before the planetary conjunction occurs tonight
stop the car
i have an idea
theyre in the middle of riverside drive but a phone booth is coming up on the right
insert rozs foot stabs the brake
spidey gets out of the car
then he pats himself where his pockets ought to be
do you have a dime
harry is there working on the computer phone rings harry picks up
peter where are you
you must get my paper before ock uses it
your planetary conjunction data
its too late
ocks got your paper its in his computer already
insert the computer screen displays a graphic of the sun earth and moon lining up with jupiter and saturn
but dont worry
he can never use it without plutonium
hes got the plutonium and hes on his way back to the lab
and hes got two prisoners with him
liz and flash
he needs a huge amount of power
thousands of volts of electricity
to get to the anti force
he can get to the power
to the max
and now at the moment of full planetary conjunction
when all the planets line up with the sun
maximum gravitational power
the conjunction is ocks final power source
the conjunction is due at midnight
what are we going to do
the blue mg arrives and comes to a stop
ock looks at his two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself
picks up one drum on each shoulder
have fun young ones
for the last time
liz and flash are tied together in the back seat of the car
still ministering what do we do now
we kiss the world goodbye
if he is right all there is left to do is
i think i can release my right hand
how much time is left
i can find out
the only way we can interfere with ocks plan is to find a computer center
our university has the biggest center in town
yeah but whos gonna work em
professor ock comes for some more drums
he sees that liz and flash have disappeared
ock picks up two drums
harry seeing flash and liz come running to the school grounds
i think i can get some help
i can teach anyone how to work a code in five minutes
then do it
the lights are off but the computers are on
harry looks over lizs shoulder as she cracks through a code
her screen reads out connecticut
fully op line backlog security max level
the last line is flashing
hey this is easy
they all run from computer to computer
hey harry i need help
harry types in karnaky ltd and gets the same response
he looks at his digital wristwatch
becomes as we watch
then a warning buzzer
i got one
i got one
get over here
harry hurries to kims side and elbows her out of the chair
the screen is flashing warning security breach
harrys hands fly over the keys
the kids gather around
line drawings of the cyclotron progressing from large to small detail appear one after the other
finally a pipe
there is a circle around a joint
and the legend a goddamn water leak
hey look at this
empire state university
this is our cyclotron right
serious what does it say
hits two keys it says no information on net
we cant do it
we cant stop loony ock
i mean the world is in danger
we must find peter he knows these computers better than all of us
yes but where the hell is he
mysteriously i bet he is with spider man
suddenly the lights dim
a heavy noise
an earth quake
the earth is moving into line with the other planets of the conjunction
harry and flash and liz and kim the earth is shaking come out running from the building beneath an enormous hanging moon
they are frightened
suddenly it all stops
its quiet the kids look at the sky
look at the moon
i have never seen it so big
what is that
must be the sun
we now see the sky
with the sun on one side and the moon on the other
they watch it shocked frightened out of their wits
suddenly from ocks basement lab a blue beam of light breaks through
a whine starts it moves magically out of the window and pans around a sleepy new york which doesnt know that the end is upon it
the dreaded whine builds throughout
people stop in their tracks look up to the strange looking skyline
camera comes down to a street where roz is driving spider man fast toward the roz looks out over the skyline of new york
lighted buildings flare up and then go dark
the lighted spire of the empire state building flares up and explodes
step on it professor or well never make it
they look across the campus and a strange light is coming out of the science center
see those beams from ocks lab
the conjunction will happen in a few seconds
spider man massages his arm
stop the car
come with me
spider man shoots out a web and flies toward the school building taking roz with him
it is a patchwork of make shift repairs
ock looks in through a window thats been melted out
he is lost in a mad rapture
red power throttle is at power
spider man and roz enter shielding their eyes from the glare
the countdown clock reads
looking back madly aha
you never included the conjunction in your calculations did you
damn the calculations
my god otto you have to hear me
the world we know will collapse
everything we have devoted our lives to
all the patterns all the harmonies
everything will be destroyed
a new world waits
it is my destiny
it is cosmic suicide
you have no right
roz flings himself through the melted window into the experimental chamber
he grabs for the bullet but the waldos grab him and throw him back
roz staggers backward
into the arms of spider man
you have to stop him
spider man you have to stop him
im afraid were too late
spider man attacks ock trying to push him away from the throttle
ock pushes spider man away from him so strongly that spider man is knocked down
ock nudges the power throttle forward and the whine increases to an ear shattering pitch
the countdown clock reads
we are at power
we pan down from the moon to a street full of sirens and shadowy figures running in the night
liz and kim and harry come nearer
a very weird light is emanating from the center
hes in there
i know peter is in there
she breaks into a run
liz come back
liz runs inside
they run after her
a bolt of electricity flashes across the doorway stopping them
the planets are playing on the computer screen
things in the room begin to rise weightless
the energy storm is brewing
my energy storm has started
my anti force is on
history is being made
spider man rosomorf cheer up friends
were on our way to the unknown cosmos
we three are about to visit heaven
real gods heaven
sees the sky through the window spider man
the conjunction is now happening
insert surreal dials spin madly
liz runs into a hallway gone berserk
stuff is flying everywhere
tiles pull from the walls and crash to the ceiling
peter where are you
ock throws the red power throttle to power
the bullet begins to pulse and throb
the dials spin
the countdown clock reads
the full moon hangs over the building
flash and harry and kim stand at the entrance to the center
flash starts to run to the building
liz come on out
they run forward but as they reach the front steps the building lurches upward
the bottom step becomes a wall of stone and dirt six feet high
then the building lurches upward again
this time it pulls free from the ground
the kids take cover as water lines burst and electrical wires spark
liz opens a door
the building lurches throwing her back across the hall where she crashes through another door
all manner of stuff is flying around
liz comes sliding across the floor
she crashes into a cabinet
glassware starts to fall on her but crashes into the ceiling instead
she is dragged up the wall
she kicks and screams against the anti force
flash kim and harry look on as heavy electrical cables stretch upward to the rising center and then snap in showers of sparks
as they fall away the center becomes airborne
the cables wave up at it shooting arcs of electricity directly at the building
liz slides down the wall
she grabs at the window and looks out
the rest of the university recedes beneath her now a hundred feet below
and theyre still rising
flash and harry look up
oh my god
liz is inside there
and professor rosomorf and crazy ock
what about peter
is he there with them
no but i bet spider man is
people look up at the science center
a cyclist riding and looking crashes into a taxi
max reiss leaps out with the beautiful starlet from the taxi
thats some show
if ever i saw one
hes looking out his window seeing the universitys lab building flying by
up and up toward the sky
shouting tear out the front page
change the headline
the biggest news is happening right now
we need photos
get me a camera
a very long shot of the science center rising into the she pulls aside a curtain and watches the science center rise
ock works the computer as the console sends up showers of sparks
he glances at the bullet which now pulses
the countdown clock at
where is it going otto
other worlds roz other times other dimensions who knows
look at it
the new truth
the new way
dont listen to him professor roz
no you dont listen to that clown he cant save you or the world for that matter
a waldo reaches in and rips roz off spidey flinging him back against a wall
roz lands in a heap beneath a fire we see the waldo reach out for spider man
it wraps around his foot and begins to tug slowly
once and for all spider man
once and for all well end the legend of your powers
ock knocks spider man with a real big blow with his waldo
ock is slowly dragging spider man to a huge hole thats been ripped in the floor by the beams of electricity
we see new york a half a mile down through the hole
we see spidey being drawn across the hole
then roz comes flying in with the fire axe
roz hacks away at the waldo and chops it off
the stump withdraws
ock examines it in pain and fury
ultimate betrayal you
you were my teacher
roz doesnt even look back
he and spidey are at the edge of the hole and hes shaking spidey furiously
ock sends out his other waldo and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of roz and spidey
like a child denied he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again
you were my teacher
and you want to destroy my experiment
you are a scientist for heaven sake
dont you want to know whats up there
yes but not on account of our world
we have only one world
only one life
the floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond
spidey comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and roz gives way and falls through
spidey grabs hold of the edge and dangles
he looks down and sees roz falling away beneath him disappearing into the dark
calling back from the dark skies spider man
only you can save us now
turns to ock murderer
forget that old fool insect
my spider man
come join me on my fantastic voyage to the th heaven
the planets are virtually in line
liz comes running through it
a bolt of electricity shoots from the right to the left in front of her
she slams on the brakes and runs the other way
the countdown clock is at
ock throws the power throttle to power
he laughs and a web splats against his glasses
spidey scrambles to his feet
ock still trying to get the web goo off his glasses is slammed into the console by spider man
sparks fly and waldos flail blindly smashing things
ock tears off his glasses and squints through the fire and smoke and glare
spider man thwips the ceiling and swings into a drop kick
he grabs spidey and slam dunks him through the hole in the floor
spider man falls through the air
he shoots up a web and thwips it sticks to the rocky bottom of the foundation
ock appears in the hole
he sees spideys dilemma hanging on a thread of web
a half broken waldo snakes down and clips the web
but the web sticks to the waldo
ock shakes it but he cant get loose
spider man shoots out another web at the rock bottom and with the leverage he pulls ock out
ock swings down in a wide arc and his waldos catch on the rock upside down
he holds on fiercely
ock scrambles out to the side of the center and begins looking for an entry
spider man is right on his tail
the building pitches sideways
ock turns to face spider man his broken waldos out for battle
spidey grabs an exposed pipe and breaks it off brandishing it like a broad sword
lets have it old boy
a bizarre duel takes place
the center pitches this way and that
spidey and ock move from foothold to foothold from window to ledge to parapet
now the center pitches to a degree angle
they duel upside down
a window grate crashes open and liz comes flying out holding onto the grate for dear life
ock seizes the opportunity to whack spidey across the head
spidey loses his footing but the building now lurches back and liz goes flying back inside
spidey ducks inside too and pulls the grate
spider man uses his great strength to move a huge piece of scientific machinery in front of the grate
he must be here somewhere
pulling her ahead hes around dont worry
well find him
the countdown clock is at as spidey comes flying in with liz in tow
this building is flying
im in a goddamn flying building
i think we have to pull some of these cables
try those over there
ill work on these
we gotta slow this thing down somehow
we got helicopters coming
liz looks at some wiring apprehensive about even touching it
she yanks out a cable
the building pitches
but when spidey pulls one out it rights itself
the big beams start cutting out one by one
the center begins to pitch and yaw
the choppers are getting closer
the countdown clock reads as spidey and liz continue to pull wires and cables
two waldos erupt through the floor and grab spidey
they pull spidey to the floor
entangled in these molybdimum pythons spidey struggles valiantly
liz leaps to his aid
oh my god
a third waldo a broken one snakes up from the hole and begins feeling blindly around on the console for the power the power
liz sees the damaged waldos heading for the red throttle
the countdown clock is at
liz leaps and tries to wrestle it away
it whips in her arms and she holds on tight
it bangs her against the wall and then the console
she holds on
the waldo crashes liz against the wall which erupts in sparks
she lets go of it
it heads for the power throttle
spider man cant break the grip of the waldos but he can pull with super human strength
he yanks ock up through the stone floor
ock hits the ceiling of the control room
one waldo grabs on
the other one throws the red spider man
youre end is coming
life in its present form is ending
new dimensions new horizons
the universal bullet begins to glow
the glow sharpens to a point of light
spider man holds on tight against a rushing energy flow thats pulling everything in the room towards the point of light
bracing against the storm what is happening
similarly braced i dont know
liz starts to slip away into the flow
she struggles against it
spidey thwips her and she grabs onto the web
hold tight liz hold tight
ock drops calmly beatifically to the floor of the room
he moves slowly under his own power into the light
spaced out you cut my power
theres too little power
its so tiny
theres only space
but ive done it spider man
i have broken through
ive broken through
dont do it dr
now thats what i call an experiment
as he nears the light he actually becomes a part of it
he radiates light
he shimmers and shines
he fills the room with blinding light
spidey and liz shield their eyes and as the light diminishes the storm subsides
except for the fact that theyre in a floating building feet above the city
against the backdrop of the moon a squadron of helicopters approaches the center
from their pov a huge crack opens across the face of the building
the center begins to drop in pulsing surges
spider man is at the console pulling and putting back wires
liz fascinated looks in at the window where ock disappeared
i cant control her
shes dropping too fast
but what about peter
weve got to find peter
peter will be okay i promise you
lets go before its too late
he grabs her go where
it rotates and drops
the helicopters come in like the cavalry
trying to leave it liz and spidey are confronted with a nightmare
the room is tilted at a angle
pipes are bursting
spidey helps liz through the obstacles
debris rains down
they come face to face with a diagonal maze of pipes
maybe theres another way
a huge crack opens above them
its breaking apart
alright keep moving a step at a time
they scale the maze but as they emerge on the other side half the floor falls away
central park awaits feet below
we have to go back
we cant go back
he looks across at the door
it is midway up a diagonal wall
he shoots a web up at the ceiling between themselves and the door
then he extends a hand to liz
okay have it your way
he swings across and lands on the ledge of the door
then he swings the web back to her like a trapeze
liz catches the web and looks across at spider man furious
shouting across what am i supposed to do with this
shouting back go ahead
its easier than it looks
weve got to try the fire escape
liz swings across like tarzan and spidey gathers her in on the ledge
she does a comic phew and the ledge buckles beneath them but holds
spider man tries to open the door but its stuck
the door is stuck
spider man bends his back to the task
it take all his strength but with a comic aaaaargghh
he bends the door open
they burst out onto the rock foundation of the building
new york is rushing up to meet them
the wind created by their fall buffets them
the helicopters arrive and the falling building plunges right past them
the helicopters look across at each other helpless
it drops like a stone
spidey and liz are falling away from the door sliding along the rock
liz is stopped by a retaining wall
spidey keeps sliding
he thwips the wall and then disappears over the edge
liz fights to her feet and grabs onto the web stand
she pulls on it with all her strength
she pulls and pulls and pulls
we see the web running up between the rocks
she gives one last pull and comes up with an empty web a long long beat
liz up here
liz looks up and sees peter hanging out the window two stories above her
he throws out a rope ladder
liz grabs it
she begins to climb
peter pulls liz through the window
there is no time for an embrace
ive found a way down
at long last love i knew you were going to say that
they run out of the room
we pan down and see crumpled beneath the window the spider man suit
this is the lab we saw in the opening sequence
peter has turned on the lights
hes got a handful of rope
wheres the way out
we are looking at the huge american flag
come on help me with this
liz is already down the rope ladder and is holding it for peter
he comes down with a huge bundle of red white okay stand still
he ties some rope around her waist
is this going to work
how do i know
i just adore confidence in a man
they move to the edge of the rock and look down
central park is still a couple thousand feet down
what is it you say when you jump
they scream as the building lurches again knocking them to the ground
they start to slide across the rock
they reach out for each other but their hands dont quite reach
slowly they inch back together but the foundation cracks between them
it spins and falls beneath us
down down it goes
and then it crashes into the great lawn
a huge cloud of debris shoots upward
there is a beautiful full moon
peter and liz float down into the frame lit by its wonderful light
the american flag which has turned into a huge parachute
they hold each other tight
they can hear sirens below
they begin to laugh with relief
then they stop
the wind billows lizs skirt and plays with peters hair and snaps in the american flag
we have a lot to thank your friend spider man for
somehow i dont think weve seen the last of him
what is it
why do you look like that
i think im in love
even his eyes blush you are
with your friend
youre in love with spider man
you think well see him again
you never know
he kisses her
bittersweet this may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know
they land in the center of the park under the parachute
they stay there and kiss
completely covered by the flag
camera pulls up to show the building floating away
