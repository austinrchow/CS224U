written by david s
goyer based on the marvel comics character first draft april th a coyote lopes through shimmering heat waves
the sky above is a cloudless blue
my father used to say that the only way evil came into your life was if you invited it
im not sure about that at least not anymore
what i clq know is this we are born alone and we die alone and what happens in between is all that matters
the choices we make the people whose paths we cross these are the things that determine our fate
the coyote ducks through a hole in a chain link fence weaves through the rusted ruins of a broken down rides weed clogged machinery sideshow trailers bleached bone white
most stories start with a beginning
his began with an ending
i never knew where he really came from
i guess its not important anymore
all i know is that hed been running his entire life
running for so long that he no longer knew whether he was running away from the coyote reaches a steep ridge looks out over a patchy southwestern town
or towards it
sparks noise metal and grime
john blaze s ruggedly handsome is running late
he sprints across the workshop floor shedding his welders kit as he heads for the time clock
he punches out but little mike s trailer trash fast has caught him in the act
where do you chink youre going blaze
sick cutting out early
the hell you are
blaze jumps on his bike a muscular battered bsa
get back to work or your ass is fired
you say that every time
blaze kicks starts the bike
it roars thunderously
over the noise well i mean it this time
gunning the throttle see you tomorrow little mike
the bike howls hauls up on its back wheel
screams out the shop leaving little mike holding his ears
the other workers whoop and holler especially when blaze snags a pair of bolt cutters from a passing tool rack on the fly
blaze skids out of the yard matching speed with a pickup which is just passing by
coop is driving
jed and murphy are laughing in back
clearly theyre friends with blaze
skin of your teeth man
tapping his watch yeah were on a tight schedule
so what are you waiting for
blaze burns away leaving the pickup for dust
a freight train thunders across the landscape
to the east blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course
blaze reaches the train first climbs the gravel incline to the tracks
matches its speed pulls up alongside a bolted container car
he reaches back pulls the cutters from his saddles bags and skillfully chops the lock with one hand
the heavy iron door slides open pulled back by its own inertia
blaze throws the cutters inside peels away and comes back with a vengeance throttled to the max
he jams the front brake on at the last possible moment the bike cartwheels
tail over head
pulls a complete three sixty up into the car and lands perfectly screeching to a halt
blaze whoops his exhilaration
and if you dont believe this watch extreme motocross as we cut to being wrenched aside revealing coops pickup holding steady alongside the train
jed and murphy ride the cargo bed like surfers
blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck
jed and murphy stack em and rack em
we get glimpses of the loot cd players vcrs personal packages luggage christ mickey was right on the money
car twenty two
candy from a baby
the boxes keep coming like baggage at the airport
some boxes miss the mark fall short get mangled
a box bursts against murphys chest engulfs him in an explosion of paper and polystyrene beads
the others howl with laughter riding high on this great train robbery as
blaze hears something looks over his shoulder
he sees a police cruiser far in the distance burning towards them
thank you gentlemen thats it for today
jed bangs on the cab roof
jed and murphy salute
the pickup peels away
blaze retrieves his bike
stands it back up kicks it alive guns the throttle and cold jumps straight out of the car
seconds later hes powering away ripping up a storm chasing the pickup towards the horizon
far far behind the police are still coming
chuck and rita simpson s are eating chinese food with their daughter roxanne s and blaze
roxanne is beautiful easygoing
shes also seven months pregnant
the simpsons are simple working class folk
judging by the strained atmosphere its evident that they dont care too much for blaze
hon would you pass me the vegetables
chuck obliges takes a drink of his beer nods to blaze
so howre things going at the shop john
scarfing down his food good good
not buying it yeah
cause mike says youve been slacking off horsing around
annoyed protective its okay rox
blaze sets his fork down wipes his mouth with his napkin
conjures up his best earnest look
truth is mr
simpson ive been thinking about clearing out of there
maybe opening up a shop of my own roxanne raises an eyebrow at this
news to her
see ive been saving up
you know for the baby and all
and i doorbell
roxanne rises to get it
you were saying
distracted looking to the right so anyway blaze looks over
two sheriffs deputies lucas cole and rick george are standing in the doorway
roxanne looks pissed like this isnt the first time this has happened
blaze stands approaches
clearly he knows them both
cocky wary lucas
wed like you to come down the station
their demeanor is hard
wont take no for an answer
can i finish eating
blaze squirms feels roxannes eyes on him
he turns to her tries to explain
dont worry hon
its just routine it is by now
just let me know if youre staying overnight
she goes back to her dinner
the apartment is dark tv flickers
roxanne is sleeping on the couch
on the coffee table chinese leftovers fortune cookies
shes sound asleep
he crouches touches her face
roxanne barely stirs deeply groggy
youre going to jail
jed and murph just got a little boisterous at the prairie dog last night
cops wanted to read us the riot act thats all she yawns curls up starts to drift away again
i was worried about you
and i dont like your friends
but blaze wont let her go back to sleep
he jostles her
listen i want to show you something im sure you do
but im half asleep and youre an ass hole
im serious rox
this is important
he drags her up off the couch
makes her stand up
she moans scowls but he gets her on her feet
john i have to go to work tomorrow offers her coat put your coat on
youll be glad you did
itll be an adventure
a mystery tour
this better be good
she stomps to the bathroom
blaze chuckles inwardly
steals a fortune cookie from the left overs snaps it open the fortune is blank
he tosses it away
glittering black watching
alright im here
blaze and roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence making their way to keep going
its just up there
must have been magnificent in its day
im not riding one of those stupid horses
you dont have to ride just climb up
she steps up onto the wooden platform smiles back at him
youre going to have to grow up one day johnny blaze
not if i can help it
he follows her up onto the ride
she weaves through the wooden animals
starting to enjoy this secret adventure
keep going keep going she comes around the other side catches her breath
the whole valley is spread out before her a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet
ever hear of a carnival wedding
roxanne shakes her head
blaze is fiddling with a crisp new dollar bill folding it making something
if a man and a woman walk around a carousel going backwards theyre considered hitched
you made that up
swear to god
he finishes folding the bill
the one is now neatly set on top of an origami wedding band like a paper jewel
you want this
she nods offering her hand
he slips the ring onto her finger and she examines it lit up inside
he smiles at her joy wrestles with what hes about to say
howd i ever find you
i dont believe in fate
maybe it believes in you
they hug each other fiercely
a long soulful embrace
blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more
heres the thing john
were having a baby
you cant keep acting like everythings a game
i need you with me
i need to know ill be able to wake up in the morning and see your face next to mine
not have to worry that you spent the night in jail
thats not a life
at least not one im interested in living
im gonna get my shit together
for leal this time i promise you rox
ill always be there for you
she takes his hand and places it on her belly
dont promise me promise her
thunder from the next scene prelaps as we
blaze enters drenched from head to toe frantic
roxannes arms are filled with laundry
we gotta go
get your stuff together
roxanne follows blaze into the bedroom
what did you do
i fucked up
the police are coming
grab your things
we have to go
she sags clearly been through this before
he tosses a suitcase onto the bed looks back at her
just do it rox
as he storms into the bathroom
reaches behind the high cistern retrieves a hidden handgun
he jumps down
tears the side panel off the old bath tub
theres a stack of flat black boxes hidden within
blaze drags them out drops one it pops open spilling uncut diamonds all over the floor
blaze curses struggles to gather up the loot
jesus johnny standing in the doorway
she sawit all
rain hammers down
blaze shoves roxanne and the suitcase into a beat up el camino
blaze climbs behind the wheel guns the engine even before roxanne has buckled in
he gnashes into reverse grinds the car into a backwards spin
nearly clipping another car pulling in
he jumps the curb and races off into the rain passing a police car coming the other way
roxanne glances at blaze angry and disappointed
the fogging windshield
its a bad time to be johnny blaze
the cop car is turning heading back in their direction
blaze floors the gas
the speedometer leaps
the el camino screams through the rain with the cop car in dogged pursuit
two more police cars fall in behind them
blaze fights to keep it together
the road ahead is dangerously winding
tires squeal as he hauls a sketchy turn
roxanne gasps fearful bracing herself
the police are gaining
flashing lights flood the interior
slow down john another sketchy turn
blaze spins the wheel brakes hard
the car hydroplanes finds purchase lightning flashes and suddenly theres a or the road right in their path
blaze jerks the wheel
the car skids slews off the road crashes through a guard rail it plunges down a washout flips end over end shedding glass and wreckage finally slamming to a dead
stop at the bottom of a rocky arroyo
blaze stirs blood streaming down his face
the windshield is blown open
rain pours in
he struggles to free himself from his seat sees a torn seat belt hanging beside him the passenger seat mr ty
blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield
falls off the wreck onto the steep muddy incline
he tries to stand can barely manage to crawl
terror seizing him lying ten yards away unconscious maybe dead
blaze scrambles to her rolls her over
he hauls her into his arms sobbing the two of them covered in mud and glass and god knows what
are coming down the incline guns drawn flashlights beaming
they descend on blaze crying to pull him free of roxanne
let me see her
i have a right to see her angle on blaze grief struck handcuffed thrashing about as troopers try cc restrain him
get your fucking hands off me
lucas cole the deputy who questioned blaze earlier approaches
blaze sees him and calms down a little
just let me see her
cole nods to his men who ease up on blaze
he guides blaze over to an observation window roxanne lays in a surgery bay doctors and nurses milling around her
blaze turns sees a nervous doctor standing behind him
is she going to make it
blinks stutters mr
blaze i a ch going r make i r
we dont know
her injuries are grave
theres a real chance she wont what about the baby
the doctor hesitates glances at cole
im so sorry
we did everything we could
blazes will shatters as the full realization of what hes done slams into him
tears sting his cheeks
cole gives him space
whatever punishment awaits blaze cant be any worse than the hell hes living through now
close on roxanne on life support hooked up to an array of monitors
sleeping beauty still as death
blaze sits beside her bed
rain streams against a nearby window
tree limbs tap against the glass like ghosts scratching to get in
two state troopers stand guard at a respectable distance murmuring to each other
elsewhere walk purposefully on linoleum
passing bay after bay
beyond the troopers someone is approaching half seen through layers of glass
blaze hears the footsteps lifts his weary head
the shadow keeps coming half glimpsed between partitions as it draws near
flicker and weaken as if some unseen force were sapping their intensity
blaze glances at the machines
still ticking steps into view
a wide brimmed cowboy hat
a smiling stone face
blue eyes flecked with silver grey
he steps between the troopers
they keep talking dont even seem to notice him
you look like you could use some help
blaze glances at the troopers
theyre still completely unaware of starkes presence
its as if starke and blaze have somehow stepped a split second sideways in time
the lights around them continue to dim
the second hand on the wall clock stops
an eerie dreamlike moment the wind the rain the tree branches tapping against the window pane
starke nods places a coin in blazes palm
if i could help her would you be willing co make a deal
blaze looks at the coin gleaming golden embossed with a soaring eagle on one side a coyote on the obverse
what kind of deal
you work for me
something about starkes eyes
commanding and haunting at the same time
what kind of work
starke just keeps smiling
lays a comforting hand on blazes shoulder as we drift towards roxannes beeping eeg
when i was young i was told that our souls wander while we sleep
sometimes they get lost
sometimes they never make it back fade in on john blaze as he switches on the light looks in the mirror
those five years of work have taken their toll
a haggard reflection gazes back at him he stares
right into his pain
but if they dq return they bring messages
and i guess thhats how the dead speak to us in memories that may be dreams and dreams that feel like memories
blaze turns off the light
the store is empty
the clerk prices cigarette packs eyes a suspicious native american woman nomi s as she loads a basket with basics
nomi sets the basket down on the counter
the clerk starts scanning the bar codes
just passing through
nomi nods uneasy
she glances over her shoulder searches out her half breed daughter who is sorting intently through a rack of cheap toys
the kid is quiet soulful old beyond her years
where you headed
where are you headed
late night storm like this what do you care
shrugging defensive just asking
he keeps packing
but he knows shes trouble
i like this
nomi turns sees rain clutching a toy a glow in the dark halloween skeleton
its too much baby
put it back
i dont have enough money for that
rain stares right at nomi and brazenly slips the doll into her coat pocket
nomi glances at the clerk
he didnt notice
its pouring rain
nomi and rain hurry across the muddy lot towards a ratty pickup
yeah i found her
came back to be with her dying grandpappy
billy ray carrigan s paces under an tire bay awning talking on a cell phone
hes handsome charming but theres evil lurking within that slick exterior
a pencil thin scar runs just under one eye
shes got the kid with her
carrigan watches nomi and rain climb into the pickup
the pickup chokes to life carves out of the lot
carrigan nods landsdale s a stone faced criminal who motions to five other thugs lounging nearby fusco albright chudacoff lloyd and odell
listening impatient i remember the deal
just make sure you bring the money
he hangs up follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting nearby a dusty tundra for albright chudacoff odell and lloyd an old bronco for landsdale fusco and carrigan
carrigan pulls a glock from his waistband chambers a round
who wants to be a millionaire
landsdale smiles back an awful smile
some people are born bad
thats just the way they come into the world
something goes wrong
something breaks inside of them the trucks pull away tires ploughing muddy tracks passing two stray dogs fighting over a bloody road kill carcass
blaze sweeps aside a curtain studies the slowly darkening landscape outside with tired resignation
and they spend the rest of their lives trying to make up for it
click blaze curns on the tv watches a weather snippet
pan over blazes belongings on the bureau a duffle bag old photographs of his previous life with roxanne a collection of blank postcards
tucked amidst the photos is a sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child
scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary
damaging winds hail and isolated tornadoes will be possible across the dakotas and upper blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it
the map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city along with all sorts of arcane personal notations
blaze traces his finger down to his present location deadfall
a lonesome service road threads through bleak wild grass prairie
nomis pickup appears on the horizon
nomi glances at rain who clutches her new skeleton toy
rain dutifully fastens herself in
rain shakes her head want to listen to music
off rains sullen shrug look we wont have to keep moving around forever okay
ill figure something out
rain looks at her mother
shes heard it all before wham
somebody rams the truck from behind
blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes lights a match
he stares at the match flame for a moment for the flame is behaving strangely bending towards blaze as if it were drawn o t m
blaze shakes out the match then retrieves
he stares at it ruefully then places it on the map and sets it spinning
we get the sense that this is a ritual he has performed many times before
as we move in on the coin crash
the tundra rams nomis pickup again
nomi fights to keep control
aims for a turn off up ahead
she hauls the truck into the turn fights the roll over barely makes it but its not fast enough
the tundra and the bronco make the turn too
their headlights blaze into the cab
nomi floors the gas
the pickup judders
the road here is bumpier cracked and pocked
the bronco swings out pulls up alongside nomi
she glimpses landsdale laughing urging carrigan on
carrigan cuts right slams the bronco into nomis side
on blaze watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism
but starting to slow now wham
the bronco collides with nomis door again
glass shatters rain wails terrified
wind and rain rush in blowout
front offside tire
nomi loses it careens right carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert smashing over rocks sagebrush fence posts and barbed wire after a few dozen tortured yards the pickup
shudders to a stop
the bronco and the tundra haul up nearby engines chugging like hungry beasts
nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off snatches a revolver from the glove box
she looks to rain stay here
and lock the doors
nomi climbs out into the rain slams the door
rain works the locks but the drivers side is all bent up and twisted
nomi approaches the trucks blinded by halogen high beams
silhouettes are coming towards her
she raises the revolver back the fuck off
landsdale comes from left of nowhere twists the gun from her hands in one unexpected move
she spins sees carrigan approaching and recognizes him instantly
on blaze watching the spinning coin
he shuts his eyes as if he could stave off what he knows is coming next
as if he could contain the thing that is even now clawing its way into his body from some dark circle of hell
nomi falls to her knees dimly aware of her daughter screaming
carrigan stands over her massaging his fist
well if it isnt little miss running bear
he grabs her by her hair shoves the glock beneath her chin
gentlemen you are looking at one of the finest pieces of ass i have ever had the good fortune of defiling
fuck you billy now i might just take you up on that nome
old billy rays been getting a little tired shaking hands with the governor know what im saying
landsdale and his men are trying to get the doors open
rain scoots to the drivers side tries to start the engine
but the drivers door is wrenched open and the men are on her careful with her
rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab
struggling to free herself desperate to help her child
leave her alone
rain fights like a hellion rakes her fingernails across odells face
landsdale back hands the little girl
as she reels he binds her hands with duct tape then picks her up and throws into the bronco
the coin slows
blaze opens his eyes a look of dread washing over his face
he stares at his hands theyre shaking emitting a heat haze
the men gather round to watch carrigan beat nomi unmercifully
he knocks her back into the mud
she tries to crawl away blinded by the rain
the coin comes to a stop coyote side up
blaze screams his body wracked with pain
he begins to violently shake his muscles twisting in unnatural contortions
with a combustive whoosh his face abruptly catches fire and crack
carrigan delivers the coup de grace
pistol whips nomi with the glock
her head snaps back
blood sprays in deep slow motion spatters the broncos headlights
nomi struggles backwards through rivulets of mud
carrigan looms over her
all she can do is stare up at him glassy and unfocused as rain spatters her face
tell you what hon
you want your goddamned divorce so much
he aims the glock at her face about to pull the trigger as you can fucking have it
a gut wrenching howl cuts through the night echoing off the canyon walls
carrigan and his cronies take a beat staring through sheets of rain
just the relentless downpour
the hell was that
the men glance at each other nervous
a thunder quake rumbles so low and gritty itll rattle your fillings
the men look around frightened
rocks fall from the surrounding butte
odell looks down
the sound is deafening vibra tine the very earth
and thats when it happens leaps from atop a wedged outcrop ridden by something that screams and burns
silent slow motion
heat haze glowing manifolds
the bike catches twenty feet of air trailing fire like a comets tail as it passes right over their disbelieving heads
a blast wave of heat and flame billow outward
the men shield themselves stumbling backwards
the bike hauls a deep carving turn peeling mud slides to a dead stop hissing in the driving rain
time stands still
carrigan and his men gape
the monster cycle throbs
a man but not a man an impossible spectre engulfed in fire its skullish head deeply bowed
clinking coils of red hot chain slip link by link through its skeletal flickering fingers
then it lifts his terrible skeletal aflame but somehow still johnny his tortured visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue white
his jaw bone pivots open to unleash an inhuman howl at once predatory and tormented a shriek of eternal damnation
time speeds up again
the men run
the ghost rider accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat
lloyd runs fast as he can
talk about pointless
the ghost rider seizes his head drags him seventy yards burning him black discarding him the other men let rip
bullets punch through the ghost rider coming out his back as red hot slag
the demon hauls a deep curve powers up onto his rear wheel what the fuck
what the fuck
albright fires his shotgun
thundering past like an amtrak train the ghost rider punches a flaming fist right through albright face
thats it for the others
they scramble for the trucks
the ghost rider lashes out with his chains lassos chudacoff
he screams as the metal sears his body falls heavily burning the ghost rider skids to a halt summons something internal and lets it loose a blast of pure hellfire
that courses down the chains and engulfs chudacoff immolating him
the men make the trucks pile in
landsdale slams the tundra into drive
the big truck hauls away
carrigan fights to get the bronco into gear
rain peeks out from the back eyes bugging
as the ghost rider dismounts stalks through the rain towards them
he raising his skeletal hand clenches it and suddenly we are a series of macro shots as we move amongst the pistons cylinders and intake manifolds
the mixture of vaporized fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite but then the miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon themselves and we are with
his truck wont start
host rider has actin uished the flames within his engine
the ghost rider keeps coming his skeletal claws fingers white hot now throbbing with heat
he slices through the broncos door like a human oxy acetylene torch chopping the vehicle apart
carrigan panics drags rain out the passenger door
but fusco is still trapped inside
cant get his seatbelt off
the ghost rider tears open the roof bisects the vehicle and hurls the front away leaving fusco cowering in the melted back seat
the ghost rider looms over fusco extending a skeletal claw oh god please i aint nothing to do with nothin
i aint nothin
please tugging rain away from the horror trying to ignore fuscos terrible screams
he looks back wishes he hadnt the ghost rider has fusco snatched up nose to nose forcing the man to look right into hungry black sockets that suck the fire
from the air
shudders eyes bulging
all he can do is stare into those awful pits fall into them as grisly images from his evil past spark and shred into his melting mind
every act of violence every crime he ever committed beatings murders acts of torture and revenge are now revisited upon fusco tenfold
this is the penance stare and fusco is feeling its full hellish force
the ghost rider and fusco scream in sync
carrigan and rain cant look away
they stand transfixed then its over
the ghost rider drops fusco into the mud
he lies there shuddering glassy eyed burned black but still alive his brain irrevocably overloaded
and the ghost rider is somehow different too
then he looks up past carrigan
r rht at
rain stares back
but its she sees
an abject abyss of pain and shame and torment
and rains terror is forgotten for just that moment replaced with something best described as empathy
to the ghost riders left
he turns the tundra screams out of nowhere slamming into him at sixty plus
landsdale ducks the shattering windshield leaps from the truck as it fills with fire the tundra keeps moving pile drives the howling spectre square into a massive boulder
the truck compresses like an accordion explodes engulfs the rock with fire landsdale picks himself up ready for anything
carrigan tugs rain over
the wreckage burns out of control
did you kill it
fuck if i know
just then nomis pickup backs into view
odell is driving
ca gan snatches rain up like baggage starts forward
dazed in a muddy gully
she scrambles up to the lip sees the burning tundra nearby sees her pickup hauling away into the night
she wails tries to drags herself to her feet creak
the burning wreckage moves
nomi ducks down watches uncomprehending
the crumpled truck is hurled aside
tipped over like a packing crate
nomi slips down into the gully gasping with fear
heavy footsteps and crackling fire draw near nomi dares to look up
the ghost rider stares down at her
like death itself
imagine yourself face to face with a great white an unfathomable impenetrable force of nature then imagine that force turning away sparing you
the world exhales
after a moment nomi dares to look again all she sees is a man in tattered clothes rolling a busted up motorcycle away into the darkness
graveyard shift but the floor is busy
too many accidents too few staff
and the police and paramedics hovering here and there are just getting in the way
stumbling through the crowded ward head down in obvious pain
quinlan s harried struggles to keep up filling out paperwork on the fly
sir you have to tell me your name
i just need to sit down for a moment
and i need some forceps gauze tape ill decide what you need alright
blaze hauls a curtain aside finds an empty surgery bay prepped and ready to go
shouting medics tear past pushing a screaming burn victim on a gurney
blaze ducks into the curtained bay
sir i cant help you if you dont cooperate
beat pointedly are you on something
blaze pulls at his jacket easing it over his battered body
do i look like troub unghhh he grimaces as the jacket comes off
bullet wounds shotgun damage torn flesh and a lot of blood
what happened to you
blaze sits back on the bed sets about cleaning his wounds with tools laid out on a tray nearby
couple abrasions maybe some rib fractures quinlan tries to help just step back ill handle it those are bullet holes
blaze cleans the wounds shes referring to grits his teeth as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh
theyre just gouges
theyll heal up fine
ungh do you have any painkillers
assertive now plainly this was no motorcycle accident
somebody has cauterized your wounds blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound
blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out of his side stifles a scream fights to keep it together
he staunches the blood fixing her with such a stone stare that she involuntarily backs away
im sorry but i need to report this
stay right there
quinlan backs out through the curtain
blaze sighs tapes a thick gauze patch over the wound eyes hunting
he sees a drug cabinet breaks into it
fills his pockets
moments later blaze is stumbling away
he pops the cap of a pill bottle dry swallows a half dozen painkillers to his right a paramedic team works on the shrieking burn victim we saw earlier
blaze stops horrified its fusco eyes rolling wildly charred nearly beyond recognition
flailing and convulsing fingers nothing but exposed blackened bone backing into a quiet corner
he suppresses a sob fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine
he jabs the spike into his leg sags as the drug takes effect
after a moment blaze calms gets his bearings notices that hes leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned helpfully illustrated with a mug shot of blazes own face
blaze tears the poster down stuffs it in his pocket then realizes that someone is watching him
he turns sees sitting on a nearby bed
beaten bruised desolate
a pair of state troopers are questioning her
she stares past them straight at blaze
she recognizes him
ice water floods blazes veins
he hurries away
blaze approaches a mailbox fishes a postcard from his backpack
he writes the date checks the time on his watch and jots that down too
he addresses it drops it in the slot
then he turns around and sees nomi standing behin him ji iorkina his way
you were there last night
when they took my daughter
i dont know what youre talking about yes you do
blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill conjured smile
he pushes past her moving to his battered motorcycle
the ghost rider
it walked right past me
it let me live
a whisper intense i know what you are
blaze stares at nomi shaken
lady you dont know shit
his tone turning lethal now bark the fuck o t of my ii blaze mounts his bike kicks it alive leaves nomi in the dust
blaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white clouds
prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane blacktop
but blazes landscape is deep within and dark dominated by the thunderheads of last nights horror
he notches the throttle up a little cruises at ninety
rolls his head back lets the wind stream over his face
then he hears another motorcycle
blaze looks back pulls alongside blaze riding a monster bike of her own
blaze burns away
but nomis no slouch
she matches his speed and is back beside him moments later
she shouts blaze guns the bike again jinks around an oncoming station wagon that blares its horn but nomis still on him nomi smiles
blaze just slipped up and they both know it
angry with himself blaze throttles his bike to the max howling over the next rise on his back wheel probably hitting one fifteen as he vanishes from view
nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits her engine rumbling
after a long beat blaze reappears
stops far away on the crest of the rise
stares at her
blaze and nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of rusted car hulks and assorted junk heading for a battered airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff
i knew what you were the moment i saw you
i can help you jf youre willing to help mp
i know things
this thing thats riding you the ghost rider
i guess it has a lot of names
but the one i grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice
it means the spirit of vengeance
you actually believe what youre telling me
im pure bred dakota
i can hear the mountains talking to each other
and i saw you light up those pricks like chinese new year last night
they reach the trailer
nomi fixes glaze with a stare
what do you see when you sleep at night
the faces of the people youve taken
j t takes them
nomi nods not sure she believes him
enters the trailer
curtains drawn tightly shut
every corner crammed with bric a brac
on the tv the football game
blaze sits on a collapsing couch
nomi hovers nearby
her grandfather henri laforte s emphysemic rambles on in dakotan pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask
he keeps his eyes on the game the whole time never once looking at blaze
aside to nomi does your grandfather understand english
i nt nle he understands
he just refuses to speak it
laforte continues to ramble intermittently
blaze shifts impatient finally sits forward
listen i dont want to be an ass hole but can we just fast forward the whole yoda routine
the home team scores
laforte whoops wildly loses his mask coughs uncontrollably
hes out of there
feel better old man
rasping in english give me the coin
blaze stops cocks an eyebrow at nomi
blaze hands over the coin
laforte studies it starts speaking in dakota again
nomi translates the man youre looking for goes by lots of names
coyote black dog
in dakota hes waka sica
look at him straight on you might see a human
look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in between times dusk or dawn you might see something else
what does he want
because its his nature
nomi continues to translate
long ago coyote could change his shape chop his body into little pieces causing all sorts of mischief
but eagle he had a clear eye
and he saw coyote for what he really was
so he swooped down scattered those pieces to the winds
beat drawing a breath the first men they found the pieces and not knowing what they were they ate them
and thats how all men came to have a little piece of coyote in their hearts
now coyote hell promise anything to get those pieces back
there it is
he studies laforte those ancient wise eyes
ive been looking for this man for five years now storm chasing pulls out his map tracked him halfway across the country
how do i make him lift the curse

my grandfather says youve been looking in the wrong place
you need to look inward
the ghost rider is starkes weapon
an extension of his rage
but it cant ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place
he thinks he does
laforte hands the coin back returns his attention to the game
but as blaze starts to rise laforte says one final thing wee cha sha nee shee cha hay
nomi pauses deciding how to phrase what the old man said
whatd he say
he wants to know if youre a bad man
if the ghost rider turned its penance stare on you would you burn
darkness has fallen
the sky glitters infinite black
blaze joins nomi at the edge of the bluff
why dont you just go to the police
but im red
they said theyll look into it
truth is ive had a few run ins with them myself
your daughter why does starke want her
nomi takes a beat looks away
because hes her father
and he wants her back
billy ray and the others theyre being paid to take her to him
things are falling into place now
look i believe things happen for a reason
call it fate karma whatever you want but theres no way our paths crossing was just blind luck
i need your help blaze
just so you understand what youre asking this thing inside me i cant control it
it just comes out
and when it does its like im a prisoner in my own body
theres no reasoning with it
it doesnt have a conscience
it doesnt even have a personality
its just a hunger
youre looking for starke
im looking for my kid
we find one well find the other
and then i dont care about the rest
raging full force
blinding dust and debris batter closing store fronts
roof sheeting tears away street lamps rattle hapless locals struggle to get indoors
a lone coyote lopes through the havoc trotting purposefully against the wind dodging cars ducking flying boards and planks
the animal passes under a sign howardsville car lupine
speaking into a payphone handset
is she comfortable
are you feeding her properly
shes alright i guess
running between rows of rental cars
does she know where youre taking her
i think shes figured it out
and how does she feel about that
how the hell should i know
carrigan paces the edge of a billowing wheatfield wired to his cell phone
dawn peeks over the horizon
in the distance we see landsdale and odell waiting with rain
cc i i laced
im not a psychologist
shes a fucking freak alright
always has been
sooner i get her out of my sight the better
approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office
inside the booth the man is half seen
shes the most important thing in your life carrigan
make sure she arrives safely
and be careful
shell kill if she gets the chance
the man hangs up turns to look at the coyote staring up at him
once again we meet same sky blue eyes flecked with metal
starke and coyote stare at each other indifferent to the storm raging around them he starts towards the rental office
the storm howls
a portly rental agent jim petrowsky is closing up shop
he gathers his papers turns out the lights
a tv on the counter is on experiencing extraordinary conditions
tornadoes blanketing much of east texas with reports of extensive damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour as pecrowsky turns off the tv we hear the door
starke enters bringing a strong gust of wind with him
sorry guy im just closing up
starke looks to a clock on the wall its
according to the hours posted outside youre still open
look mister in case you hadnt noticed theres a storm coming tornadoes whatever
im trying to get out of here
starke fixes petrowsky with a stern gaze
i would like to rent a car reading petrowskys name tag jim
something in starkes tone gives petrowsky pause
he glances to the window and the growing storm beyond
we see the coyote out there watching from across the way
okay alright have a seat
petrowsky moves behind his desk
first name ambrose
typing in the name starke okay
what kind of car were you looking for
starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars
what about the cadillac deville
i noticed you had one in your lot outside
sorry already spoken for
how bout a full size car
i can give you a chevy malibu ford taurus starke deliberates
outside the storm seems to grow stronger
petrowsky shifts in his seat trying to mask his impatience
were he observant enough he might also notice that the wall clock has stopped
c i vt
you want the taurus
give you a good deal mid size price
a day cant beat that
i had my heart set on the cadillac jim
now look im trying to be accommodating here but i really am in a hurry
so whats it going to be
another beat as starke stares petrowsky down
gradually the lights in the office begin to dim
the taurus then
can i see a drivers license
starke reaches into his jacket handing over a license
petrowsky types in the required information trying to ignore the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him
how many days do you need it for
two three any other drivers
and youll be paying by
ill need a three hundred dollar deposit
starke nods removing a money clip from his jacket deftly sliding out three crisp brand new hundred dollar bills
what about refueling
off starke s look weve got three options
you can purchase a full tank in advance you can fill it up yourself before you return it or you can have us do it but then we have to
charge you four dollars a gallon
most people go for the tank in advance
ill do it myself
petrowsky enters the final data hits print
as the rental agreement begins feeding out we hear a horn fionk
a mini van has pulled up outside
a mousy woman sits behind the wheel
a boy sits in the back seat
the coyote is still there but it pays no attention to them
petrowsky slides the agreement to starke takes out a pen here you go
just your standard rental agreement
you get up to miles a day for free twenty cents a mile after that
if you want additional personal accident insurance its five dollars a day another nine ninety nine if you want the loss damage waiver
your basic rental rate plus applicable state and local tax
you just need to initial here here and here indicating various items and give me your john hancock on the line right here
petrowsky offers starke a pen
he doesnt take it
instead he pulls out a pair of bifocals
with agonizing slowness starke begins to peruse the rental agreement
is there a o oblem
the price you quoted was the mid size rate
but youve listed the daily rate here as
starke turns the agreement around for petrowsky to see
geez im sorry youre absolutely right
thats the caddy rate
guess i entered it in by mistake starke looks up at petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn
were you trying to cheat me jim
no no not at all then id like a new contract specifying the appropriate rate
petrowsky squirms uncomfortable
for in that pregnant moment without either participant uttering at word the entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed
look cant we just go with the contract weve got here
ill make a note of it and knock a days rental off the total when you return it
what do you say
i say the devils in the details
petrowsky flies through the plate glass window
he lands on the concrete stunned bleeding from multiple lacerations
he tries to sit up but his right arm is broken horribly mangled
gasping in shock jesus jesus
thereve been times in my life when the world seemed so hateful and vindictive that i just wanted to die helen petrowsky bolts from the mini van
the boy watches as his mother rushes to her husbands side
jim what happened
petrowsky clutches at his wifes arm trying to speak
a shard of glass has penetrated his larynx
h helen get a away petrowskys eyes widen in horror
helen follows his gaze certain twists of that fate felt like nothing more than gods spite
strides towards them his face a veil of unmerciful contempt
the dust storm has taken on biblical proportions whipping and roiling around him becoming an extension of his fury
he snatches helen up by the throat snapping her neck with inhuman strength flings her lifeless body to the ground then he brings his boot heel down on petrowskyshead
crushing it like an aashell
it was obvious to me that id done something wrong
broken some secret rule known only to him
and as such would be punished for my sins starke turns now regarding the mini van
the boy is nowhere in sight
he approaches looks inside
the boy has fled
we are low on the ground tracking with the terrified boy as he squirms his way beneath the cars
he pauses nervous
looking right then left
no sign of starke
the boy shudders truing to stifle his sniveling
then c ri nce
but i had it all wrong
and i see that now with such clarity i sometimes feel my heart will break appears creeping along a parallel aisle
it pauses lowering its snout peering at the boy from afar
the boy freezes
he squirms around for a better view we see starkes boot heels a few dozen yards away gradually closing in on the car beneath which the boy hides
the boy shuts his eyes
the footsteps draw closer then stop
the boy opens his eyes
starkes hoots are just an arms length away
theres a world out there thats neither right nor wrong
neither kind nor cruel
fair or unfair
it simply is
existing in all its bliss and pain
slips under the body of the car
butits not a human hand
its the hand of a beast blackandtwisted taloned
with a sudden movement the hand flipsthecar up sending the enter vehicle spiraling into theair
the boy lies there exposed like a bug beneath an upturned rock
he looks up and what seems like cruel fate is really only nature red in tooth and claw
we see a brief flash of starke
no longer a human silhouette but a snarling lupine beast
the black dog
rushing towards us with open jaws as we a hummer races along a desolate stretch of highway passing through an inhospitable landscape of buttes mesas and cacti
landsdale rides shotgun dozing
odell is in back with rain her hands tightly bound
she keeps to herself clutching her skeleton doll stares out at the passing landscape
odell offers her a bag of chips
want some food kid
rain doesnt respond
odell rustles the bag
eat a chip or something
shes not gonna eat odell
just shut up and get some sleep
i cant sleep
every time i close my eyes i see the face of that thing lloyd shaking his head christ
just put it out of your head
if i could put it out of my head i wouldnt be awake now would i
carrigan gestures at the barren landscape
look out there what do you see
miles and miles of nothing
and theres a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing
how many people you know seen a ufo huh
hell its on every goddamn paper at the supermarket
you believe that shit the whole countrys being overrun by those bug eyed motherfuckers
nodding eyes closed probe you in the ass they get the chance
whats your point mr
my point is everybodys seen somethina
ghosts aliens bigfoot whatever this wasnt no freaking bigfoot
you see what it did to albright
punched his head clean off
look i dont know what that thing was
all i know is starkes paying us a butt load of money to deliver the kid to him
we were told wed see things and we were told to look the other way
you want to cut out
ill pull over right here
keep your shirt on b
we didnt come this far just to limp home with nothing
odell settles back into his seat uneasy
but id still like to know what that thing was
hes the ghost rider
everybody looks at her
its the first thing shes said
the ghost rider
get that off the back of an oakridge boys album or something
you think that shit scares me
hes going to kill you all
jt n i
thats what im talking about
fucking chatty cathy sitting back here with me
carrigan glances in the rear view mirror makes eye contact with rain does his level best not to be spooked
one hundred miles per hour plus
whip around to see riding their cycles
up ahead is a postal truck
blaze honks waves to the driver
hes got a postcard in his hand
he hands it to the driver through the open door then decreases his speed falling back alongside nomi
as they scream over a hill we see the white buffalo indian casino and lodge in the distance
i dont like this
i spent the last six years trying to forget this place
you got any idea where billy ray might be headed
then we should start with where hes been
a chiming cacophony
acres of penny slots and video poker
roulette wheels clattering
blackjack tables spinning
blaze and nomi weave their way through the maze
your husband used to work here
billy ray dealt blackjack poker
worked the casino circuit
we met in vegas
things kind of went downhill after that
got a lot of nerve showing your face here again
chief of security vince rodenburg s full or himself storms towards them flanked by two security goons
believe me vince this is the last place i want to be
but we need to find billy ray
he took rain
sorry the deal man hasnt been back in weeks
gesturing for them to leave you have a nice day now
but you mustve talked to him
do you know where hes headed
just tell me that
what am i
i dont know where he is nome and if i did i sure as hell wouldnt be telling you
looking to the other guards show these two ass holes to the door
look this is important
were talking about a kidnapping
sizing blaze up we are
and who is
im just a friend
ri h t
nomi tell you what a blue ribbon slut she was
do anything to support that needle habit of hers
truth bout the only person that hasnt had her around here is me
blaze steps forward now angry threatening
what you gonna get all steven segal on me tough guy
pull a fucking glimmer man
blaze moves twists rodenburgs arm like rope wrenches his thumb backwards slams rodenburg face first into one of those plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars
the goons pull their pieces
blaze just ups the pain
w w wait
in agony grimacing oh fuck just wait a second the goons hesitate
i need you to understand something vince
i am by nature an inherently violent man and theres not much in the way of bad that i havent already inflicted on this miserable world applying even more pressure
so unless the idea of learning to drive a wheelchair with your mouth sounds appealing i suggest you apologize to my friend and tell us where the fuck billy i dont know
i dont know blaze gives rodenburgs thumb a savage twist
h he was ngh up at their old house last night
and im sorry im fucking sorry
blaze releases him
as the goons close in blaze deftly relieving goon of his handgun and turns it back on him
think about it
the goons relent
blaze and nomi exit leaving rodenburg slumped on the floor cradling his mangled hand
a swath of cheap housing part finished mostly abandoned back boning a steep bluff that overlooks the casino
blaze and nomi dismount their bikes
she stares at a particularly ramshackle house
dead leaves blow
a rusting swing set twists and creaks
never thought id be back here
they pass cautiously through the front yard
nomis pickup is parked nearby
the front door bangs back and forth
nomi pulls a revolver from her waist band
i think theyre gone
off nomis look blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt
looks like your old man switched to a hummer
window panes rattle
the lights dont work
blaze and nomi pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus
guess the boys camped out for a while
dead leaves twirling
one whole side of the room is burned open blackened and charred the remaining timbers sealed with plastic sheeting
nomi opens a drawer rifles through singed papers finds an old photo of her and carrigan
listen those things vince said you dont have to explain yourself to me
some of them are true
doesnt make you a bad person
nomi nods but shes clearly agitated
blaze crouches traces his fingers over a stain on the wall
he can feel something
he shuts his eyes opens them the room many years earlier
carrigan backhands nomi across the face
the silent moment is caught in motion so slow its virtually a tableau
he used to hit you
a statement not a question
nomi is reluctant to enter
blaze is inside sees her hesitation shes staring at the bed
you can see the past
just echoes sometimes
tell me about starke
nomi hesitates not wanting to relive this
i was dying
id shot myself full of billys best gear
figured id teach him a lesson and go out in style
blaze nods but he doesnt see nomi now
he sees nomi as she was
an inch away from eternity
she is lying on the bed staring upwards shallow breaths above her a moth flutters by a light casting distorted shadows
but it felt like a mistake
i dont want to die
the lights begin to dim
we hear footsteps approaching muted and distorted a shadow falls across nomi stands above her
there are other shadows drifting in behind him
things better left half glimpsed
he smiled and said as starke starts to speak we hear you look like blaze finishing the phrase knowing the punch line too well
you could use some help
nomi nods hugs herself
and i took it
what else was i going to do
i dont know what happened after that
im not sure i ever want to beat struggling all i know is nine months later rain was born
nomis face terror stricken
starke eyes alight with malice and mischief
nomi turns away trying to banish the memory
billy ray hated her from the moment she was born
he knew she wasnt his knew she was different re the charred timbers if i didnt leave he wouldve killed us both
nomi striking back at billy ray with a broken bottle
setting the house ablaze
nomi pulls out a cigarette nervously lights it
been running ever since
in my heart i guess i knew starke would be coming for her one day
why send billy ray after you
sick irony i guess
billy certainly knew all my haunts shaking her head this was a mistake blaze
were not going to find anything here
blaze glances down a heat haze has engulfed his hand
he clenches his fist looks up guess again
as headlights shine through one of the windows
somebodys driving up to the house
blaze and nomi creep towards the front door
a handful of vehicles are pulling up out front
the men disembark
its rodenburg finger splinted packing heat
hes returned with reinforcements oswalt doyle weingrod and pennebaker
blaze and nomi make their way to the laundry room and the rear entrance but doyle and oswalt have already circled around back
shit theyve got us trapped here
theyre the one who are rang d
blaze reaches for the door handle opens it
and steps out to meet their tormentors
rodenburg and the others are there now too
rodenburg is grinning
talked to billy ray chief
dont know who you a r e but you picked the wrong blaze struggles to contain the ghost rider but his whole body is drenched in sweat now like hes
going to spontaneously combust at any moment
just tell us where they went and leave
theres no reason why you have to die
rodenburg laughs looks at his friends in disbelief
im gonna die
buddy you got your head screwed on bass ackwards
rodenburg fires into blazes chest once twice
blaze stumbles back against the porch
as he falls rodenburg mounts the steps charging in after nomi
nomi runs but weingrod dives through the plastic sheeting in the hall cutting her off
he slams her against the wall twisting her arm behind her back
rodenburg appears behind them
together he and pennebaker drag nomi towards the bedroom
they shove nomi onto the bed
had to come back here didnt you nomi
just couldnt leave well enough alone
nomi struggles to sit up
rodenburg laughs viciously forces her back drags at her jeans
doyle waits on guard duty bored when suddenly
he looks to doyle tears of fire streaming from his eyes
as he stands his chest wounds ignites the flames instantly cauterizing the flesh
hes suddenly engulfed in a heat haze
wood smolders all around him
doyle backs away terrified
he fires his gun again and again but the bullets just punch through blaze creating more flaming holes rodenburg stops mid assault
nomi breathes fearfully held down at gunpoint by pennebaker
we hear screams the whistling wind the crackle of fire
doyle rushes in from the porch looks back blaze keeps on coming unstoppable
he steps burns his way through the screen door leaves a trail of burning footprints in his wake
as he walks down the hall the heat streaming off of him blisters and curls the wallpaper
doyle backs away stumbles and blaze is upon him lifting doyle up gripping him by the throat
soul the fire expanding engulfing doyle
rodenburg buckles his pants goes to the doorway peers cautiously into the passage beyond
flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end
the screams still come sporadic and terrible
rodenburgs mind is racing
he motions to pennebaker who drags nomi off the bed and strong arms her to the door
rodenburg leads gun ready
smoke and crackling noises are building rapidly
the shrieks persist and those burning leaves are everywhere
then movement in the living room
rodenburg draws a bead but its weingrod pushing through the plastic sheeting fearful eyes darting
he speaks in a strained whisper
whats going on man
something hits the house
then more screams more gunfire and a rumble so deep its deadly
pennebaker panics pushing past rodenburg
i want out of here im getting out
keep your fucking voices down
hes burning the house man
hes red hot chains whip viciously around weingrods head and torso
then hes wrenched backwards hauled straight through the plastic sheeting bursts through the melting plastic hauls his red hot monster bike up on its back wheel rodenburg and pennebaker run
for their lives falling into the fire lit passage
the ghost rider screeches across the living room setting the place aflame as he passes through
nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was sees the fiery monster crash straight through the wall rodenburg and pennebaker run through the flames stumbling over
doyles charred body
they burst out the front door clothes alight racing across the yard towards their vehicles
rodenburg looks back the ghost rider explodes through the front of the house skids to a halt flicks out a chain and snags rode burgs ankle
he falls screaming
the chain retracts pennebaker reaches his vehicle struggles with the door theghost rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards clenchesthe air and hauls it back in
like an explosion in reverse fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being
a frozen moment
all terrified eyes on the ghost rider then he lets rip
hurls the energy back out as a torus of white hot fire that expands across the yard blasts rodenburgs shirt from his back smashes pennebaker against his vehicle the vehicles
explode gas tanks rupturing
pennebaker is blown to pieces
rodenburg screams shields his face
fire and debris rain down in every direction
the ghost rider looms over him
more accurately its half man half monster his pitiless skull face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states
where are they taking the girl
ghost blaze grabs rodenburgs hair wrenches his head back
theyre headed north into oregon oh god fuck where
i dont know exactly jesus i dont know
blue white fire floods down blazes arm and engulfs rodenburg
the poor man screams struggles to break free aze simply crrows otte ana ac and the ghost riders evil countenance submerges every trace of blazes humanity
then its over
the flames evaporate
rodenburgs corpse crumbles to dust
the ghost rider is gone
he sees the corpses the burning vehicles tries to deny the horror
but its always the same another swath of destruction left in his wake another righteous atrocity
he told you everything he knew
shes ten yards away shaking
not going to come any closer
told you everything you didnt have to do that
you asked for my help
i warned you what you were getting into
more a statement than an excuse
there are police sirens on the wind
blaze starts walking towards the pickup
a sub par motel
nomis battered pickup is parked outside
we hear blazes tortured moans coming from within
blaze sits in a chair shirt off nomi at his side
shes trying to help him patch up his wounds but the enormity of the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting
i dont i dont know what else to do for you
sokay just need to rest now wounds be healed by morning
nomi stands still shaken
she retrieves a cigarette from her purse lights it
i thought you were dead
considering his wounds i dont even know if its thats an option anymore
every time i get close i feel myself being dragged back breathing through the pain its like being born all over again
like every law in the universe is being broken
blaze sits forward gritting his teeth against the pain
see the ghost rider its drawn to darkness like a bloodhound
if it thinks youve sinned itll find you
what if youre innocent
beat staring at her think about it
everyones done somethincr
me blaze lifts up the coyote coin flipping it over his fingers
every night i spin this fucking coin and it always lands the same side up
i keep thinking ona time one time im going to spin it and ill see the other face
sleep through the night without getting blood on my hands
but it never happens
theres always some sad motherfucker out there that needs retribution vengeance
blaze flings the coin away in disgust
it spins wobbles lands coyote side up
he laughs tiredly then looks away lost suddenly overcome with emotion
im just so fucking tired nomi moves to his side struggles to help him up
here why dont you lie down for a little while
blaze nods too tired to argue
nomi half carries him to the bed lowers him down
blaze settles back exhausted
nomi watches him holding vigil
his eyes grow heavy
he shuts them a moment opens them again and its roxanne who is laying beside him now
she rolls over to face him smiles sleepily
blaze reaches for her touches her face and the moment shatters into violence
the el camino sliding spinning over
rain pattering on broken bloody wreckage
roxannes torn seat belt hanging loosely
climbing out through the blown out windshield
crawling in mud blazes face reflected in broken glass
cradling roxannes body in his arms rocking her and wham
blaze bolts up in bed disoriented shaken
clearly some time has passed
nomi sits across the room now holding blazes tattered photographs in her hands looking a little guilty
shes got the paper wedding band which blaze made for roxanne too
what are you doing
im sorry i just
as blaze stands we see that his wounds have healed
he shrugs on a shirt approaches
nomi nods to the paper wedding band
you mustve loved her a lot
blaze doesnt answer
just takes the photos and wedding band from her shoves them back in his pack
he pulls out one of the postcards scribbles an address on it
what time is it
a little after three
what time exactly
blaze ignores her jots down the time
licks a stamp and puts it on the postcard
leaves it on the dresser
what is it with you and those postcards anyway
theyre just a kind of record
hauling up his pack lets go
blaze and nomi drive
outside the landscape passes bugs twirling and spattering against the windshield like snowflakes
roxanne in the hospital serene and beautiful
starke handing blaze the coin
you made a deal
so what happened
did she live
yeah shes alive
she just doesnt know it
off nomi s look coma
probably never wake up
so he tricked you
a tired laugh thats what he does doesnt he
thats what he does
almost afraid to ask what about the baby
blaze just shakes his head
that kid was supposed to be my second chance
rox and i used to talk about it how thingsd be different after she was born
nomi didnt expect his honest vulnerability
maybe thats why we have them what kids
so we can make amends for all the royal fuck ups weve perpetrated on the world
god knows ive had my share
beat pained i just dont want her to have to pay for the things ive done
he knows all too well
he and nomi drive on in silence for a beat their thoughts turning inwards
can i ask you something
off blazes nod whatre you going to do when you find starke
make him pay somehow i dont know
how do you beat the devil
walk up and bitch slap him
pretend youre schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass
im basically making this up as i go along
im sure youll figure something out
rain looking out through the trucks moon roof watching stars passing overhead
as the sky above slowly brightens in time lapse rains eyes grow lidded
she sleeps clutching her skeleton toy and waking sunlight floods the cabin
rain rides shotgun
carrigan and landsdale are sacked out in back
the radio drones laced with static
no one slept well
carrigan stares out at the passing plains expertly cutting a deck of cards one handed
he sees a scarecrow go by standing ragged in the middle of nowhere
then his cell phone rings
carrigan flips it open yeah
based on his facial expressions the news isnt good
he sighs disconnects the call
landsdale cocks an eyebrow
oswalt weingrod all those other inbred losers too
off landsdales look looks like my ex bitch has hooked up with the fire guy in the rear view mirror odells eyes grow wide
no fucking way carrigan ponders nods to landsdale
were going to need reinforcements some kind of escort to the meet
i know a guy
got some boys given over to wickedness and such
tosses him the phone make the call
hell find me you know
her voice makes odell jump
he thought she was asleep fretful pleading to rain leans forwards hey kiddo youre worrying my boy here
so shut your goddamn mouth you cant tell me what to do
youre not my father
the truck collectively holds its breath
carrigan settles back but hes pissed
you better believe that sweetheart
im just the dumb ass that financed your whole fucking life
you and your mother both
and what did i get for that selfless act of stupidity
she burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by
hes referring to the scar under his eye
rain turns away
huddles against the door
believe me i could care less what starke wants with you
make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to
its not like you came springing out of my loins
only thing i care about now is getting whats mine and thats
counting on his fingers payment and retribution got it
shes not listening
her bound hands are secretly pushed down into the tight gap between the seat and the door
extending towards a pen one inch out of reach caught between the seat mechanism and the door sill
levitates tilts into her outstretched hands
the radio squeals painfully pure strident static
odell punches a new station but the static continues grows rain attacks stabbing the pen into odells thigh
he screams slams the brakes loses control of the truck the hummer barrels off the road slams down hard into a concrete culvert
without missing a beat rain is out and away plunging into the cornfield
carrigan and landsdale bolt after her guns drawn weaving between the stalks
she reaches an old farm implement uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her taped bindings
then shes up again running searching high and low
carrigan sees movement to his right surges forward but rain jigs left and carrigan misses her tripping over the farm implement instead
he cuts himself curses rain continues straight ahead now
carrigan motions to landsdale
the two split up drifting in different directions
theyre gaining on her losing ground
she spies a rock scoops it up and smashes across c rr gans face
carrigan falls dropping the gun
he searches for it desperate
then he sees it
but as he reaches for it rain extends her hand concentrating eyes fluttering whoosh
the gun spins away from carrigan into rains hands
she doesnt hesitate for a second blam
first shot wings carrigan knocks rain on her ass
carrigan dives for cover
she fires wildly click click click but then the gun is spent and landsdale emerges through the corn bagging rain with his coat
as a shaken carrigan gets to his feet landsdale slips his belt out of his pants and binds rain tightly
carrigan and landsdale return to the hummer which is still nose down in the culvert
landsdale carries rain under his arm tightly wrapped no longer struggling
odell sits on the hood daubing the bloody wound in his leg with a handkerchief
he sees carrigans wound
man she shot you
off carrigans nod disbelief jesus
lucky she didnt perforate my ballsack with that fucking pen
whats the damage
mounts are cracked trans axles shot to shaking his head this baby aint goin nowhere
carrigan fumes glances at rain then he just snaps starts angrily kicking at the door
after a few futile moments he stops paces looks to landsdale
were going to need a place where we can hole up til tomorrow
wait for those boys of yours
how bout up there
landsdale points past carrigan at a squat group of buildings and machinery a shut down rock quarry in the distance
from a distance we watch as landsdale approaches a guardhouse with an empty gas can
a guard opens the electric gate steps out to help
landsdale pistol whips him drags his limp body in through the gate
the guard slouches in a corner bound and gagged
landsdale and odell lounge nearby keeping a watchful eye on rain
carrigan paces by a window nervously cutting his deck of cards one handed
hes watching the shadows lengthen outside the setting sun
he looks to rain who matches his gaze creepy eyes penetrating his brain
to landsdale anxious where the fuck are those men of yours
theyre on their way
carrigan nods cuts his cards
he j worried
the abandoned hummer in the culvert
a gang of crows tear a lizard apart
dusk time lapses into night
after a time nomis pickup comes racing past
blaze is driving cranes to see the passing wreck
he pulls over onto the shoulder
blaze and nomi climb out approach the vehicle
nomi shines a flashlight sees blood on the front seat
blaze reaches past her touches the blood stain chaotic and violent
rain attacking odell
the hummer crashing
the desperate race through the cornfield
as blaze steps away from the hummer into the field
how do you know
but blaze isnt listening
his gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry
blaze and nomi crest a rise in the field hunker down we can see the main compound of the quarry from here
landsdale is in view having a smoke by the guardhouse
you think shes in there
then lets go nomi starts forward but blaze pulls her back
dawns less than an hour away
taking out her gun you wait
im heading in
look theyre not going anywhere
you dont know that
this is probably the best chance well get
theyre sitting ducks
we can do this if you if i what
burn them alive
eat their spirits
you still get it do you
the ghost rider whales on whoevers got it coming but its johnny blaze that gets to remember their faces
and i lb remember them
every last one
just then we hear the rumble of approaching motorcycles
lots of them
blaze turns sees a line of bikers chugging up the service road on ratted out harleys
they know were coming dont they
once again fate is royally fucking him
im going in
you with me or not
landsdale opens the main gate
the bikers thunder into the compound low rent hells angel types culled form the shallow end of the gene pool known as the gray gargoyles
arlo skinner the gargoyles ceo climbs off his hog adjusts his nut sack
as he approaches landsdale
gunt and chester pulsifer his identical twin lieutenants fall in behind
i believe you know the pulsifer brothers chester and gunt
blaze and nomi scramble over a fence then drop down crouch running to avoid a security camera
they hug the shadows
at least a dozen of the gargoyles are in view lounging around shooting the shit
ill find her
you stay here
nomi moves to protest but blaze silences her
if things go south and the ghost rider takes over i cant guarantee he wont i know
im on my own
beat more plaintive now just bring her back to me
thats all i care about
start disabling the bikes
last thing we need is a gang of pissed off speed freaks on our tail
rip out all the coil wires blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him
nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out a switchblade deftly slicing through a fuel line
gasoline leaks onto the ground
or you could do that
as blaze creeps away as he turns back whatever happens youre welcome
nomi starts in on the other bikes
arlo enters accompanied by the pulsifer brothers
carrigan and landsdale are waiting to meet them
so you need some contract work
were making a delivery first thing tomorrow morning
and will there be mayhem involved
yeah id say a certain amount of hijinx are likely to ensue
blaze moves around the back of the compound
up ahead two gargoyles are lingering by a side entrance
arlo takes out a nail clipper starts trimming his fingernails
well ill tell you i got nineteen brothers out there willing to go the distance and enough firepower to give a small balkan nation a fucking titty twister
but we dont come cheap
so how many men we going up against
blaze elbows gargoyle in the face
as the biker drops we see that blaze has already disabled gargoyle
blaze quietly slips in through the door
nomi has worked her way through a half dozen bikes now and a fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her
arlo looks at carrigan incredulous
you trying to diddle my nutpurse mister
lemme clarify things
blaze sidles down the hallway moving as quietly as he can
we can hear the men talking in the office just next door
see this guys not really a guy
hes more like a demon or something
what exactly do you mean by demon
blaze winces lifting a hand before his face blue flames dance over his fingertips
he leans against the wall for support
when he removes his hand he leaves a singed palm print on the drywall
arlo puts the clipper away starts arranging the fingernails on the desk before him into a neat little pile
like his heads on fire and shit
arlo laughs the pulsifers follow suit
then arlo turns to landsdale icy now
brotherman what in fucks name is this smooth faggot talking about
blaze exhales a wisp of blue flame totally enveloped in a bubble of heat
more than anything he wants to step inside fully aflame
but he forces himself to simply take a peek the room the men but no rain
hes telling the truth arlo
the guy aint human
saw him torch albright and chudacoff with my own eyes
blaze presses against the wall desperately trying to rein the ghost rider in but footsteps are coming
a gargoyle is round c the corner
gunt rips open his shirt shows a chest covered in tattoos
well i say bring him on
you see this ink
thats a hundred hours under the needle
a motherfucking canvas of pain
he and chester here were not afraid of fuck diddly
the gargoyle passes the doorway lights up a smoke
or tries to
the flame from his zippo is bending sideways
he tries a couple more times
hidden in a dark alcove struggling to contain himself
if the gargoyle turns he will surely see him
the gargoyle studies the flame then notices an open window nearby
he shuts it lights his cigarette turns back b blaze has moved on
arlo settles back in his chair
if this guys as lethal as you say he is i want fifty for me another fifty for the club
only you cant let the boys know were takin a k rake off the top see
how bout sixty and ill throw in a kilo of coke
thats like selling snow to eskimos
you think im some kind of crack smoking foolio or something
arlo reaches into his shoulder holster whipping out a mean looking nickel plated colt anaconda
ninety and not a nickel less you fucking pillow biter
blaze continues agitated
where the fuck is the kid
he looks through a doorway sees brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons
blaze drops back
his snarling face contorts starts to assume that awful skullish quality
the ghost rider wants out
but blaze fights shoves it back down and deep
something moves to blazes right a tiny white figure lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage
nomi slices through another fuel line inadvertently drawing the attention of a gargoyle who was taking a leak
he zips up his jeans starts towards her carrigan grins trying to calm the situation
e a sy gentlemen
no need to get all truculent on me
you get that out of a scrabble dictionary or something
what the fuck does truculent mean
grabbing carrigan by his shirt ill tell you what it means
blaze stares hypnotised his face flickering from skull to flesh and back again
the tiny figure is rains skeleton doll held upright unsteady by some unseen force
extreme mental concentration
her eyes are fluttering rolled to white
as he starts towards the toy skeleton
hes in agony now each breath a cough of fire each footstep igniting the floorboards
he sees a storage room up ahead carrigan smiles seemingly unruffled by the gun
okay alright how about seventy five and well smoke the old peace pipe
cocking the anaconda how bout eighty or youre gonna be smoking my dick
blaze enters sees rain
he extends a hand to her and odell steps out from behind the door where hed been hiding shotgun in hand
nomi tries to fall back into the shadows but its too late
the gargoyle has spotted her
he draws a taurus pistol and we hear a high pitched beeping
what is that
sounds like a smoke alarm
wrinkling his noise smells like somethins burning
what is this fucking charades
its h jm you ass holes
a fireball erupts from the back of the building
the milling gargoyles spring into action
nomi takes advantage of the distraction stabs the gargoyle nearest her in the thigh bolts carrigan and the others race out into the corridor even as odell rushes from the
storage room a wave of fire on his heels
emerges seconds later rain cradled in the crook of his arm safe in a cool bubble of air
she looks to carrigan
the meaning in her gaze is implicit i told you so
appear from every direction
bullets turn to slag vaporizing as they enter the ghost riders aura of hellfire
rain drops from the ghost riders arm runs
the ghost rider advances
the gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol into the ghost rider
the ghost rider reaches for the weapon
at his touch the pistol becomes red hot the gargoyle cries out
the ghost rider takes the pistol and fires back
the gargoyles stumble clawing at their smoking wounds
in seconds the entire weapon turns white hot melting apart in the demons hand sizzling away into nothing the ghost rider keeps coming
men are smashed aside incinerated
bravado turns to terror to chaotic scramble
flames belch from every window
panic stricken gargoyles try to start their bikes and the bikes detonate
one after the other
nomis pickup barrels through the fence
she slaloms through a gauntlet of flames skidding to a halt
she sees rain running towards her throws open the passenger door rain makes for the pickup scrambles inside even as strides from the burning ruins of the compound
with a wave of his hand the wall of flame parts like the red sea
he locks his gaze with nomi points a skeletal finger at her
his meaning is clear you are on the list
nomi floors the gas
the pickup slews and grinds finds purchase leaps away from the monster as emerge from the building burned but howling for blood fueled by a lethal combination of stupidity and
carrigan landsdale and arlo fall in behind
the ghost rider moves whipping his red hot chains
left he lassos a passing gargoyle burns him
right another gargoyle dragged from his bike and reduced to ash
then two more lashes to either side of the brothers
two more victims reeled in charred corpses falling at the ghost riders feet
the whole thing took three seconds
to gunt nerves failing forget it bro live to fight another day
the ghost rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a nearby bike
the bike glows red hot and changes shape getting bigger nastier demonically slouched no fucking way
thats my hog
as the ghost rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle gunt charges forward infuriated
he opens fire with his mini aun
rounds a second
moving with uncanny speed the ghost rider grips gunt by the throat and hauls him off his feet unleashing the full fury of his penance stare
erupts from the ghost riders eye sockets engulfing gunt
gunt shrieks his cries becoming infant like ululations
arlo carrigan chester and the others instinctively shield their faces falling back from the infernal glow gunt
images from his own subjective hell assault him
tears stream down his cheeks as his body ignites
his corneas are burning melting
the ghost rider starts to accelerate now from zero to sixty in an eye blink hauling gunts writhing body along with him straight into the burning building
a juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing wall
the ghost rider skids to a halt hurls gunt to the floor
senses someone behind him blasting the ghost riders head
the ghost rider squeals and for a split second the demons flames are actually snuffed out
the cloud clears
the ghost rider glimpses rushing into another room slamming a steel door behind
odell pauses in the darkness hyperventilating
outside we hear the heavy footfalls of the ghost rider approaching
the ghost rider places a skeletal hand against the steel door
his hand glows white hot like an acetylene torch
the steel door begins to bubble and melt
the door to the storage room liquefies flowing apart like molten lava
the ghost rider steps through and in the light cast by
he demons owing hand
odell realizes that the room is stacked with high explosives
nomis pickup races into the night
a distant fireball erupts hugely engulfing the quarry setting off a chain reaction of smaller explosions ba boom boom b b boooom
rain clutches at nomi frantic looking back
what about the ghost rider
we have to go back for him
are you crazy
then nomi glances in the rearview mirror
is coming after them
howling plowing through the inferno on his hellcycle
nomi floors the gas
but the pickup is already maxed out
the ghost rider easily gains on the truck leaving a wake of burning asphalt
he lashes out with his chains snags the back bumper
the chain links slice deep into the steel bodywork
the ghost rider hauls up onto his back wheel nomi slams on the brakes
the truck fishtails
the ghost rider rear ends the pickup
bike and demon cartwheel crazily into the cargo bed slamming explosively against the back window of the cab
hot glass showers nomi and rain the ghost rider is pinned squealing entangled with his bike
nomi floors it again
the truck leaps ahead but the ghost rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards
he reaches into the cab clutching at nomi
the pickup thunders up a rise
the ghost riders skeletal fingers clamp nomis shoulder
she howls in pain her clothing beginning to smoke
rain tries to help imploring no no no the truck makes the rise and theres the sun dawning huge and white
flaring mightily over the distant horizon
recoils blinded by the dawn
he releases nomi collapses backwards
his fire extinguishes his skull face fades and blaze lies in the pickup bed shaking
nomi glances back through the shattered cab window her face a mask of fear and sympathy
blaze looks to gunts bike which has also reverted to its original state then sees the bad guys coming on battered bikes arlo chester plus four other gargoyles
and bringing up the rear a seven ton mack dumper driven by carrigan
landsdale rides shotgun
blaze looks to nomi shouts over the wind give me your gun
nomi passes it back
the gargoyles open fire
bullets zing and whine
blaze shoves gunts cycle off the pickup bed the heavy wreck crashes and bounces wasting the first gargoyle
the others swerve around the sliding debris nomi runs a stops sign slews across a rural intersection pounds the horn swerving to avoid the crossing cars brakes jack knifes
four gargoyles make it past the fifth is flattened
the mack comes last smashing a passing minivan into a spin
a state trooper hidden from view hits his siren gives gaining riddling the pickup with bullets
blaze is pinned in the bed cant get off a shot hanging back and riding one handed
he hefts a mm laws rocket on his shoulder launches it near miss
but the impact lifts the pickups rear axle into the air
blaze hangs on for dear life
hauling the mack alongside chester yelling from the cab the hell you doing
i need the kid alive
fuck the kid and fuck you
chester aims the launcher again
carrigan swerves crushes chester under the macks mighty wheels
pulls alongside the mack siren wailing
carrigan veers hard forcing it into the opposing lane
up ahead roadworks
the highway narrows to a single lane gaining on the pickup trading shots with blaze at ninety miles and hour
blaze wings one gargoyle then plugs another who loses control cartwheels catastrophically explodes arlo zigzags the debris guns his hog screams closer
blaze fires but click click click hes out
the pickup mows down barricades like dominoes clips a hot tar cooker spins spumes of molten tar in all directions
highway workers run for their lives
nomi smashes through barricades leaps a pile of rough gravel
blaze is nearly hurled out the bed but hangs on shoulder screaming operating a jackhammer fails to notice the careening pickup racing by which is in turn followed by arlo
and ana necx at oofj ann r i t s over end
arlo rides against nomis door lets rip with his uzi
rain and nomi duck arlo tries again sticks his uzi right into the cab
but nomi forces the gun upwards
bullets puncture the roof shell casings ricochet in desperation nomi reaches for the door latch kicks her foot against the door
the door swings outward taking arlo along with it
is a concrete divider
nomi abruptly veers right clipping arlo against the divider killing him instantly
hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as bears down on them
landsdale jumps from the cab landing alongside blaze
the two men struggle in the cargo bed hand to hand exchanging a volley of vicious blows
nomi is desperate doesnt know what to do
landsdalp is getting the upper hand
he grips blaze by the throat forcing him over the side of the pickup bed shoving blazes head towards the churning wheels of the mack
to rain pleading do something
concentrating focusing all her energy on landsdale
she cries out makes a forceful hand gesture and landsdales glasses shatter
he screams blood pouring from his eyes
blaze rolls throws landsdale over his shoulder into the wheels of the mack
barricades bulldozers dozens of state police cars
the pickup and the mack pass over a line of tire spikes
the tires blow
the trucks drop
metal rims spark and grind hold on to something
the pickup fishtails
carrigan also brakes struggling to keep the mack under control
then the mack catches a rim flips rolls the rolling mack plows into the roadblock seven tons of iron crushing cruisers and barricades alike
the pickup careens off the road plunges into a cornfield hits a rut grinds to a halt the aftermath
trooper cars sliding to a halt
carrigan being dragged from the mack at gun point handcuffed
armed troopers plunging into the cornfield yelling
nomi falling out of the cab finding rain unhurt alive
she drags rain into the sea of corn
rain looks back sees being surrounded by troopers wrestled to the ground
a cacophony of noise for the new meat
hardened criminals banging their bars shouting as loud as they can
chained cuffed struggling with two deputies trying to drag him to a cell
further up carrigan is being similarly escorted
blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners dread seizing his body
i have to talk to the warden
you have to put me someplace else shouldve thought of that before you pulled that dukes of hazzard stunt
please just listen to me
put me in solitary anywhere but here
this isnt a fucking hotel chief
you dont understand people will die whack
a baton blow to the knee
blaze cries out staggers easy on the threats big guy shouts to door control the cell door opens
blaze struggles even more violently now
do not put me in here
do not leave me with these men
theyll die if you do this
the deputies force blaze inside using batons boots
a stun gun sparks
the cell door slams
the inmates opposite are laughing waving bashing their bars with every metal implement theyve got as we
a grimy little stop held together with paint
nomi and rain step off a bus each carrying a bag of supplies
simple and clean
rain locks the door goes to the window and opens it wide a beautiful day outside hills rolling down to a busy town a mile distant
nomi drops her bag sits wearily on the bed peels her jacket open revealing a nasty shoulder wound
burned to the bone the impression of fingers clearly evident
rain hurries to help rummages antiseptics and bandages from nomis bag
together they clean the wound
nomis pain is clear but she keeps it quiet
are we safe now
nomi regards her sadly
shes never been one to tell lies
honey i dont know if well ever be safe
rain nods knew the answer instinctively
something about her look far too fatalistic for a child her age
he talks to me sometimes
my father beat hesitant when im dreaming
what does he say
rain starts to cry now suddenly overwhelmed
despite her eerily calm demeanor shes still a child
and a frightened one at that
i dont want to be like him mom
you dont know that
yes i do baby nomi hugs her desperate as if the world were ending
outside across the land the sun shines gloriously bright
yes i do
on blaze immobile
waiting for nightfall
shadows lengthen around him in time lapse as the day begins to die
he starts to shake
tears streak from his eyes burn his cheeks
on carrigan in his cell at the end of the corridor
hes nervous cutting a deck of cards
ants feed on a praying mantis
an owl pulls at a recently killed mouse
day time lapses to dusk
storm fingers scratch at the window
nomi steps out of the shower
checks on rain
she contemplates her sleeping child a moment then taps a pack of camels realizes shes out
nomi quietly closes the door
walks to the far end where the vending machines are humming
a fresh pack of smokes
she tears it open then notices
fluttering by an outdoor light casting distorted shadows on the stucco wall
nomi stares uneasy something tugging at her memory as we see nomi back on the bed oding
the shadow of starke falling over her
the moth fluttering above
as nomi turns to the parking lot sees a coyote slouching out of the gathering darkness
and she knows
ba fucking knows
my father used to say that the only way evil came into your life blaze waiting internal
carrigan manically cutting his deck of cards
over and over
blaze suddenly cries out throwing himself onto the floor
he begins to writhe as the other prisoners jeer at him
was if you invited it
nomi bolts into the room frantic
she shakes rain awake
the child looks up sees the terror in her mothers face
sweety you have to get out of here now
as she drags rain into the bathroom
she tears the shower curtain back
theres a window just above the shower stall barely big enough for someone like rain to squeeze through
im not sure about that
at least not anymore
what i cq know is this
we hear footsteps in the walkway outside
someone is coming nomi tugs open the window lifts rain towards it honey go go
the other prisoners are shouting fed up with blazes antics
he rolls about clutching at sides
fire streams from his mouth his eyes we are born alone and we die alone
terrified backing into the far corner of his cell
pause watching the beginning of blazes transformation their cries taking on an entirely new kind of urgency
its what happens in between that matters
rain squirms through the window drops to the ground outside
the choices we make the people whose paths we cross she stands casts a fearful look to at nomi then runs off into the stormy night
backing out of the bathroom as the front door explodes open
she turns around these are the things that determine our fate
stands in the doorway coyotes slouching in around his heels
the beasts attack growing and changing their gnashing mouths of razored teeth opening wide to consume nomi as
a mushrooming blast wave of hellfire erupts from blazes body expanding beyond his cell and across the rain runs for her life weeping distraught stumbling down a rain slick hillside
she sees spread out below fireballs engulfing a distant building the ghost rider stands in the center of blazes cell a cyclone of hellfire swirling around him for there is
a direct casual relationship between the amplitude of his rage and the number of transgressors in its vicinity
he moves forward melting the cell bars stepping into the prisoners are frantic leaping about like frightened lab animals
the ghost riders heavy footfalls ring out as it strides down the corridor turning his awful gaze on the first cell
the ghost rider extends a hand sending a stream of hellfire coursing over the prisoner within
the ghost rider moves on to the second and third cells swiveling his gaze back and forth burning the occupants within
like shooting fish in a barrel
the ghost rider continues its rampage
murderers rapists malefactors
some curse others plead others simply drop to their knees and pray
for they know instinctively that the universe is not an arbitrary place that their day of judgement has come
the entire jail is ablaze now a roiling extension of the ghost riders fury drowning out the voices of the damned
where carrigan cowers within
the deck of cards in his hands drops scatters
some of them catch fire shrivel up
the ghost rider waves his hand
the bars separating them melt flowing to the floor like liquid
he stares down at carrigan his hollow eve sockets sparking to life
erupts from the ghost riders eyes carrigan reaches for something beneath the bed cell wall
he holds it up
the effect is catastrophic like the medusa having her own deadly gaze turned back upon her
the ghost rider stumbles backwards shrieking assaulted by an onslaught of subjective images
visions horrifying enough to drive even a demon mad
the windows of the jail pulse with hellfire panes of safety glass exploding outwards as a blast wave expands and expands making the world go white
fade in from white
a circus of paramedics police firemen and reporters
every corner is blackened every bar twisted and melted
charred corpses are scattered like matchsticks
weve seen them before
these boots belong to navigating his way through the bedlam
he passes between rushing emergency personnel steps over a writhing victim but no one seems to notice his presence
and as he progresses to the far end of the cell block the cacophony fades leaving only his footsteps as he turns into carrigan is terribly burned but still clinging
frantic paramedics are running an iv struggling to stabilize him
his fear filled eyes grow dim then abruptly snap into focus as he sees you look like you could use some help
starke standing over him his gaze stoic and pitiless
you lost her carrigan
a choking sob you didnt tell us what he was carrigan starts to slip away
the sounds of the outside world begin to intrude once more
starke kneels touching a hand to carrigans chest
the world ebbs away again
the paramedics continue their work oblivious
please i dont want to die starkes arctic eyes gleam bright with mischief
if i could save you would you be willing to make a deal
blaze sits against an old grave marker gun in hand
thousand yard stare in his eyes
he contemplates the gun assault him good times with roxanne happy times making the onrush that much more unbearable
we intercut radiant at the beach
flickering sunshine makes her squint
here and now cocking the gun turning it back on himself
folding clothes seen through a sunny doorway
fingering the trigger of the gun edging closer to the unknown the terrors that the afterlife holds for him
her laughing face loving blaze from across a dinner table
suppressing a sob
the pain is too much
its overwhelming and blaze at the obstetricians
on the sonogram monitor w e see unborn child shifting positions within roxannes womb push in on the eerily beautiful image and fuck it
he presses the barrel against his forehead
squeezes his eyes tightly shut compresses the trigger but he cant do it
he lowers the gun weeping with frustration and freezes head cocked like he heard a voice
he scans the cemetery graves trees nothing
then he spins around stands behind him waif like
big melancholy eyes
they stare at each other for a long time not knowing what to say
my mother is dead
the statement hangs
another failure of blazes part
my father found us just like she knew he would
rain looks down at blazes hand the gun resting there
blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away embarrassed
the wind picks up
rain looks to the graves
what do you think happens when you die
do you think theres a heaven
i dont know
but what do you think
blaze studies rain
this kid is hurting
what she needs now is reassurance
and try as he might blaze just can t seem to harden his heart against her
yeah i think theres something
maybe not angels playing harps and stuff but something
rain wipes her nose with her sleeve wanting to believe it
hell keep coming you know
unless you stop him
i dont know that i can anymore
but youll try right
blaze regards her curiously
even in grief shes a consummate negotiator
i dont have anything left to give kid
blaze stands starts walking
my mother said you were a good man
she said i could trust you
but dont you think theres a reason why all of this is happening
i dont believe in fate
maybe it believes in you
deja vu all over again
he looks back at rain
a battered truck full of migrant farm workers grinds to a halt
blaze and rain jump out in a cloud of dust
mision de sante lupia
high up the mountain an old adobe building perched on stilts precariously overhung
on top of its bell tower a crucifix stands clear and proud
were going to a church
its not a church
its a mission
they take people in
blaze pays the driver
the truck roars away
rain looks back to the mission doubtful
are you going to dump me there
th century spanish adobe
chapel and dormitory currently under renovation
various tough looking men are at work
picks and hoes clink in the dirt
blaze and rain make their way towards the main building
tolbein s hard mistrustful intercepts them
can i help you
our car broke down a few miles back and my daughter and i were wondering if we could crash here for the night
tolbein sizes them up doesnt like what he sees
dont think so
what about a ride then
is there a town somewhere you could take us to
other men have gathered behind tolbein viscott wilson
one of them nunez nods to the south
why dont you head back to dawson
they got motels there
thats not really an option
then id say youre out of luck
look you must have a cot something
the kids hungry im sure we can figure something out
joe rhymer s approaches silences tolbein with a look
hes down to earth capable wearing a black shirt clerics collar oily jeans and muddy work boots
offering his hand joe rhymer
im the padre
this is rain
thats a pretty name
you hungry rain
would you like something to eat
rhymer ushers them inside
as he moves to follow tolbein stops him
bottom line father
theres something wrong with those two
especially the kid
duly noted richard
jutting into frame in the foreground
blaze pauses at the threshold of the chapel looks back uneasy but its just a scarecrow being buffeted about by the wind
rhymer leads blaze down the central aisle
the chapel is dark lit by candle light crowded with scaffolding and drop sheets
as blaze walks the flames of the candles bend in his direction as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force
those men outside most of them are on a work release program
were a halfway house for ex offenders
we try to get people on their feet reintegrate them into society
blaze glances at rain apprehensive
misreading blazes look dont worry youre perfectly safe here
but of course thats not what blaze is thinking
rain sits at the table spooning her soup
tolbein nunez and a few others watch them
blaze watches them back nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility
men carrying provisions
theres a small vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard
rain helps the gardener pull carrots
blaze watches from a distance cleaned up clothes laundered rhymer approaches gestures to the garden
its turned out beautiful hasnt it
we try to be as self sufficient as we can back to the earth and all that
he notices that blaze is staring at the lowering sun
you any good with diesel engines
i know my way around a flywheel housing
well ive got a generator out back thats been on life support the last few weeks
mind helping me try to resuscitate it
blaze looks at him curiously
blaze and rhymer work by flashlight tinkering with the old generator
there are a number of vehicles stored around them including a pair of dusty motorcycles
so how long have you been running
what do you mean
you know what i mean
you spend as much time around lost souls as i have you learn how to read a mans face
you want to hand me that crescent wrench
blaze hands rhymer the wrench who then makes an adjustment
take the girl for instance
shes not your daughter is she
so what happened to her mother
did you kill her
rhymer studies blaze decides he believes him
she doesnt have anyone else
im just trying to protect her
and whos protecting you
blaze and rhymer are cleaning up
listen i appreciate what youre trying to do but ive never really been a come to jesus kind of guy
i wasnt talking about jesus i was talking about a little healthy introspection
working here staying in one place for a while seeing what surfaces
ive found that people tend to arrive on our doorstep for a reason
blaze considers this formidable man a yearning moment then he shakes his head
i cant stay
what about the girl then
whatever youre involved in i cant imagine its good for her well being
beat gentle we can find a home for her
id have to leave tonight rhymer nods understanding he motions towards a beautiful motorcycle parked back in the shadows a norton commando
black with gold pin striping
you can take the norton
i dont have any money
so send us some when you do
blaze is moved by this mans simple humanity but hes also wrestling with the idea of abandoning rain
time lapsing shadows cross the mission buildings and the surrounding wilderness landscape
the lonely scarecrow stares button eyed and blank
blaze gazes into a bathroom mirror
been here so many times before
sounds intrude upon his solitude
he bows his head studies the coin turning it over in his shaking fingers
the malicious coyote the soaring eagle
still the sounds come stronger more insistent cars crashing
police sirens wailing
blaze looks up once more
his eyes are shadowed sockets
this is the real penance stare and blaze is feeling its awful mournful ache
he wants to know if youre a bad man
he wants to know if the ghost rider turned its penance stare on you would you burn
blaze clenches his fist around the coin spins on his heels
blaze pauses in the doorway looking in on rain who sleeps dead to the world
blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed table next to her turns and leaves
we hold on rains sleeping face for a beat then she stirs opening her eyes
she sees the coin nearby sits up
the norton commando roars into life blasting webs from the exhaust
blaze guides the bike up the coal ramp and out through the open cellar doors
a storm front is moving in huge thunderheads gathering and roiling
blaze pulls a dusty skid pauses with the engine rumbling
looks back forlornly at the mission
then he wrings the throttle and hauls away into the night as we rain stands at the glass watching blaze leave
rhymer and leads his wards in prayer
we can hear the wind rising outside gathering in strength
that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word
moving with rain down a moonlit corridor she clutches the coyote coin like a talisman then through a window which startles her only to realize that its just the scarecrow
out in the field flapping wildly
for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his
son jesus christ
and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full
this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light blaze rides like the wind along a snaking road away from
the storm clouds churning behind him
and in him is no darkness at all
the land falls sharply away spilling down into a wide expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of release
rhymer and his men eat
rain is there too
nunez peers out into the darkness
wind and debris are scratching at the window panes
we hear thunder now too
youd better take a look at this
rhymer joins him
sees what he sees coyotes gathering
six or more
they creep malevolently towards the mission
you ever see anything like that before
rhymer shakes his head looks to shes acutely conscious of the men staring at her now still clutching the coin like a rabbits foot
its her shes the one doing this
thats enough richard
im telling you father theres something wrong with crash
one of the windows slams open startling everyone
rhymer moves to it latches it shut again
an eerie howling arises
tolbein and nunez lead some men to the front door
tolbein unbars the door pulls it open cant believe his eyes three dozen howling coyotes approaching the entrance
what is this
a snarling coyote comes out of left field just misses his throat tolbein leaps backward slams the door
the men start shouting
rain backs away
she knows whats happening
an animal rams the door
and another rhymer breaks out a shotgun shells hears the men shouting
rhymer rushes in
the men are confused afraid
growling coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly against the windows cracking the panes
get away from the windows
wilson take rain to the chapel
wilson hesitates eyeing rain with distrust i aint going nowhere with her
all the men are giving rain a wide berth now
another snarling coyote hits the glass
one of you please just take the kid to the chapel
father thats the last place she should be
something strikes the room a massive blow
something much bigger than a coyote
viscott starts praying
more heavy blows
like the fist of god
making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate
something shambles past the window
what in gods name was that
looking at rain accusing i knew we shouldve sent them away
viscott wails praying even more stridently
nunez is losing it shes the one they want im telling you
and the lights abruptly go ou the storm bellows and blusters
the men huddle together fear thick and sour
raainn raaaaiinnn a gastly voice monstrously corrupt but still recognizable as billy ray carrigan
where are you rainnnnnnn
rain shrinks away from the insidious mewling
to rhymer hissing i told you even rhymer is shaken now
he moves to investigate presses up against a cracked window carrigan stands outside lurching between patterns of moonlight and shadow
but the movement is all wrong
and in our momentary glimpses of him we get the sense that hes been horribly changed as if his body had been torn apart then haphazardly reassembled into something else
the wall fractures
rhymer staggers back
a row of impacts moves along the wall tolbein and nunez scramble to reach the dining room door
they close it turning the locks
carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy steel door
again and again and again
the men are terrified shouting at each other
the door is buckling inward the hinges bending and groaning then the pummelling stops
just the sound of breathing halting and phlegmatic
no one moves not a whisper
corrosion starts to spread across the metal door
what the fuck
rhymer edges close to the decaying door peering through a gap in the frame carrigan peers back moonlight illuminating his face
there are buttons where his eyes should p
he bellows the pounding begins anew harder now
the weakened door is surely about to give way
rain is terrified
do what he says
put her out
get back with the others
we dont do what it says that thing outside theres gonna kill us all
rhymer steps in front of rain levels his shotgun at tolbeins chest
god as my witness richard lay a hand on that girl and i will pull this trigger
tolbein hesitates then grabs at the shotgun
he twists it from rhymers hands smashes the butt across rhymers jaw
rhymer sinks to the floor
tolbein grabs rain drags her screaming to the door
he waves the shotgun at the others open the fucking door
nunez fumbles with the lock
rhymer recovers throws himself at nunez tries stop him from opening it
the pounding ceases
all eyes sweep to the door roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor coming to rest at rhymers feet immediately oottina the floorboards beneath
a skin crawling whisper i can see you priest
i can see every last one of you
knocking tolbein rain rhymer and nunez on their asses
all eyes bug as carrigan shoulders his way inside
only hes n
t carrigan anymore
now hes a golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and sodden burlap pieces of insects twine and razor wire
button socket eyes
jagged bone teeth
beetle black chitin for fingers and nails
his very existence is an affront to nature
everything the scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays
floorboards rot metal rusts
every movement every spastic shudder and twitch is a source of incalculable pain
the scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a storm of demonic crows explodes from his chest whirling about like a cyclone of knives
now the coyotes enter too
dozens of them snarling diving at the men sinking their jaws into flesh
the men are trapped
some try to flee
others fight back swinging chairs and planks stalks into their midst snaring victims left and right hurling bodies or pulling them apart he snatches viscott up by his throat
bugs swarm over the screaming parolees face as it rots and decays
in seconds viscotts entire body decomposes putrefies falls apart back up towards the kitchen
a crow thing comes flapping
the creature shrieks and flops nunez claws another from his face sees its not a crow at all but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a deformed razor beak
matted feathers bony talons wilson trapped under a bench beats desperately at a gnashing coyote
lands a real blow
the beast falls back then stands up like a man
as the other coyotes do likewise
the coyotes are changing shape enlarging canine skeletons cracking and re arranging themselves into the same half glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying starke
all muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody ripping claws
blaze rolls the norton to a stop
kills the engine
sits back in the saddle and drinks in the night
the moonlit landscape is profoundly silent the starry sky clear and awesome
not a cricket not a lizard
just the moonlit expanse of ocean below
then we hear thunder like distant artillery
blaze looks back over his shoulder distant thunderheads
close on blaze trying to drive rain from his mind
we can see on his face that its a losing battle for poor cursed johnny blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth
claws and jaws and razor beaks tearing frenziedly through wood and plaster and lathe
rhymer rain nunez and tolbein struggle to repel the monsters beating them back with whatever is at hand but the jaw beasts and razor birds are winning forcing their way
into the kitchen nunz is snagged
slashing claws swarm all over him
the others try to pull him free rhymer wastes two more precious shots but nunez is lost
dragged screaming into the storm of mouths and claws
the survivors fall back as the door gives and pitches through the opening lurching forward
jaw beasts fall in behind him
razor birds whirl around his head
the survivors scramble for the far exit
rain opens every gas burner on the grill as she passes by but the far exit is locked
and rhymer doesnt have the key
rhymer shotguns the lock
the lock fractures but the exit still wont open
tolbein starts kicking
rhymer aims tugging at rhymer shoot the gas
bugs swarm from beneath his tattered feet
every metal implement and surface rusts as he passes
pointing at the grills rhymer hears the ranges hissing and fires
the gas fireballs catches scarecrow full on sideways
he squeals reels
burning jaw beasts writhe and howl
rain falls to the floor dropping the coyote coin
it spins furiously as we blaze
ninety one hundred
wind tears wildly at his hair jacket
the bike shudders
the tachometer edges upwards one twenty
one twenty five
the norton screams
one fifty heat streams off blaze
flames wisp from his nostrils
the tachometer shatters
the engine smokes
the bike shrieks pushing the edge of mechanical reason
flames explode from blazes mouth and eyes
his hands ignite
he cries out in agony
his body alters violently
his face warps
bones crack and shift
flesh shrinks and tightens as the skull visage emerges
the bike changes too red heat spreading throughout
tortured metal screeches
straining machinery pops and bulges
shafts lengthen into skeletal bones
the saddle slouches
the tank distends whoompf
the wheels ignite then the whole bike
hellfire streams an extension of blazes rage
blaze screams from the pit of his soul as the ghost rider claws itself into being more manifest that ever before and thats when the bike really accelerates so fast
that its air wake churns the dust on each side
so fast that molten asphalt spumes from behind like lava
so fast that the goddamn camera can barely catch it and b boom
the hellcycle breaks mach sonic booms rocking the landscape as we the scarecrow savagely burnt by the blast but unstoppable
he rises cocks his head hears something the jaw beasts the razor birds
they know somethings coming
we hear it now too the whine of an approaching engine
wobbling to a stop coyote side up
realizing whats about to happen the scarecrow lets loose a ghastly wail and erupts through the wall in deep slow motion sending forth a majestic tsunami of fire and debris
the monster bike skids carves floorboards like matchwood hurl themselves out of its scorching path the ghost rider vaults from the saddle sends the bike spinning at the scurrying monsters
it ninepins a few takes out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke are vanquished squealing and flopping like living cinders
still aflame but very much alive
if anything they seem emboldened by the fire
they circle the ghost rider more and more of them joining the pack
readies his chains
the jaw beasts attack
three dozen horrors pouncing and gnashing
the ghost rider takes them
chains flames sheer power and force spines snap
lupine skulls burn
the ghost rider tears the monsters limb from limb
the room becomes the seventh circle of hell and at the heart of the inferno the ghost rider exults in the slaughter the whole mission is ablaze now fire and
churning smoke consuming everything in its path
rhymer rain and tolbein run for their lives
rain rhymer and tolbein are trapped
fire has cut them off
they back their way towards the rear of the building peer out the windows a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway
theres no way down from here
the door behind them splinters
the scarecrows found them once again
the ghost rider is having difficulty with the jaw beasts
his fire burns them but they just keep coming blackened skeletal demons possessed of an unstoppable ferocity for every one he throws aside two more seem to take its place
he can wound them sear the flesh from their bones but still they pile on sinking their teeth into his skeletal flesh crunching through his hollow rib cage the ghost
rider shrieks in pain tears one from his back snaps anothers spine punches a fist through a thirds gnashing muzzle
he falls back through a doorway onto and still they attack
and now the ghost rider is weakening
he stumbles on the steps falls to his knees
the fiends pile atop his back
summoning all his power the ghost rider emits a shockwave of flame a heat bomb that blasts the creatures clean off him
the shockwave shakes the room
fire belches through the splintered doorway but the scarecrow scarcely notices
hes flinging dorm beds left and right howling and groaning as he hunts for huddled beneath a flimsy bed frame
the scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds tolbein
he reaches for the man sinking his spindly fingers into tolbeins chest
tolbein screams instantly shrivelling corroding into dust the scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds aiming his shotgun point blank range
the blast takes a chunk out of the scarecrows face
all hell breaks loose
the ghost rider unleashes wave after wave of hellfire incinerating the hounds as they leap towards him fighting his way up and up the steps blam
another blast chews apart the scarecrows neck
the monstrosity staggers then lurches forward grabbing the barrel of the shotgun instantly corroding it the wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards rhymers hands and he drops
the gun rolling away scooping up rain as he runs towards the bathroom recovering his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together
flames kiss his body causing sodden particles on his frame to sizzle and pop but because his decayed flesh is so wet he never ignites
enkindled buzzing bug ember things swirl around the scarecrows head in a halo impossibly alive he stumbles after rhymer and rain into a claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals
rhymer and rain are nowhere to be seen
enraged the scarecrow tears into the stalls ripping them aside one by one the ghost rider advances hurling jaw beasts left and right the scarecrow rends the last stall asunder
finds rain and rhymer cowering like bugs
he looms above rain beetle fingers clutching flashing a rotted rictus grin whip viciously around the scarecrows sodden head and torso
hes wrenched backwards hauled out of the bathroom and slammed across the dormitory into the opposite wall the wall fractures
debris falls tumbling hundreds of feet down to the highway below
the scarecrow recovers sees the room ablaze
sees a swathe of blackened twitching jaw beast skeletons leading from the doorway to at the other end of the chains
more accurately battered and weakened staggering
his flames are barely flickering his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle
hes holding a jaw beast skeleton drops it to the floor the scarecrow attacks
hand to hand combat
massive blows and blocks
the burning room shudders with each impact ghost blaze uses his chains but hes weak and scarecrow turns them back on him smashes him against the walls
more structural fractures more dust the whole mission quakes
a huge hole in the wall falls open the scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling the stilt like support columns bearing the weight of the overhanging mission begin to
creak and bend
some snap the dormitory drops alarmingly ten feet or more the flooring canting precariously
ghost blaze stumbles falls wham
scarecrow grabs ghost blazes neck
a wave of decay and corrosion spreads over ghost blaze
he screams his flesh putrefying but scarecrow will not let go desperate for escape the flames closing in on them
theres nowhere to go
except a small hatch high up in the ceiling ghost blaze howls in agony as the scarecrows superior evil dominates
he feebly extends a hand towards the flames nearby trying to compel the fire to him
the flames twist briefly bend in his direction
the ghost rider howls with frustration
he needs the flames
he will die without them
he tries again reaching reaching surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest now streaming towards ghost blazes bony begging fingertips the scarecrow is oblivious
just keeps pouring more misery into ghost blazes body as the entire mission which was only moments ago completely aflame is now extinguishing itself
an inferno in retrograde roiling inward raging flames bend and draw long
clouds of embers are pulled into coursing streams
roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls floors and ceilings flame and fury funneling thunderously into scorching fire spouts that cyclone up and up and up into ghost blaze from
suddenly scarecrow finds himself at the heart of a back drafting firestorm a sustained implosion feeding straight into ghost blaze
then nuclear silence
an instant in which rhymer shoves rain through the hatch an instant in which scarecrow senses his own doom because the ghost rider is back but now hes more than
the ghost rider
hes a white hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating with volcanic heat
and he detonates
an apocalyptic release that obliterates scarecrow sends rhymer ducking for cover bulges the dormitorys fractured walls and ceiling lifting the attic floor mightily
hurling rain into the air
steamrollers through every room and passage destroying everything in its path consuming itself
ghost blaze lies groaning at blackened ground zero
hes almost human now spent
charred timbers creak and groan around him
the entire structure is on the verge of collapse
emerging from the smouldering bathroom ghostly white
she picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor
kneels alongside ghost blaze
blazes eyes are black pits gaunt and skullish rain casts about finds a burning ember cups it in her hands holds the flame close to his mouth ghost blaze senses
the fire breathes it in like a drowning man
draws the flame deep into his lungs keeps drawing until the ember is gone internalized
their eyes meet
are you going to die
he pushes up on his elbows tiredly rises to his feet and topples
ghost blaze and rain run but theyre not going to make it
the whole room is dropging away at their heels
ghost blaze snatches up rain dives through a widening split in the wall even as the dormitory folds up and slides away from them pitching over the hillside
breaking into tons of plunging debris that crash spectacularly onto the highway far below
clutching precariously to a muddy hillside
ghost blaze looks up sees first light bleeding in over the distant mountains
ghost blaze strides over the smoking ruins
finds what he was looking for back to human hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage
hes barely alive just a face in the rubble
a ragged whisper who the fuck are you anyway
and ghost blaze raises his hand hellfire trickling down the length of his arm swirling around his hand like a building static charge even as terrified yet defiant do it
fucker dq it
appears on a ridge just before them eyes locking onto him
its now or never
ghost blaze hesitates hesitates then abruptly reins the flame back in
metabolizes the fury
pushes it down deep through sheer agony inducing willpower
ghost blaze screams struggles and forces the demon away now hes just blaze weak with exertion but triumphant for the first time in years
he turns away and we blaze and rain walking working their way across the scorched grounds
rain kicks at a carbonized jaw beast skull
it rolls smashes against a tree crumbles to dust
blaze looks up just then hears the sound of it slows to a stop at the end of the drive engine rumbling
dusty and bug begrimed from its cross country journey
blaze braces himself
a silent inhalation of breath
rain stares paralyzed by fear the drivers door opens
a hulking silhouette steps out
the beast backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking over the horizon
sunlight flares outward briefly blinding us
and when it subsides is standing there
he raises a hand shielding his gaze from the light
steps cowards them
blaze moves in front of rain blocking starkes path
they stand there in silence
and starke smiles eyes alight with mischief
looks like weve come to the end of the road havent we
after a long beat give me the girl and ill lift the curse
blaze looks down at rain
this was all he ever wanted
the only thing that has kept him going all these years
he reaches into his jacket retrieving a crumpled pack of cigarettes
plucks one out shes all yours starke and lights it without a match somehow conjuring the flame from within himself
he takes a long drag
in the pits of his eyes something glows there a kind of lambent darkness
but youll have to go through me if you want her
starke stares into blazes eyes
doesnt like what he sees
dont be a fool blaze
im offering you your life back
thats not a life
and least now one im interested in living
you think you can control it
guess im willing to take my chances
starke nods accepting defeat
he looks down at rain a bitter smile creeping across his face
you have your mothers eyes
and walks away
blaze and rain watch him retreat
presently a coyote slips from shadows joining him on the road
it lopes along beside him
we watch them disappear over a rise
then theyre gone
rain studies blaze reaches for his hand
hell be back
we pass broken concrete smouldering timber a rock snake constricting a mouse an industry of beetles dissecting a birds carcass
finally we come to a small deep cavity and there tucked away in the darkness we find and thats how it ended
with another beginning
a kind of balance struck between the flame and the fury
balanced perfectly on its edge
how it fell like that at the heart of the wreckage is a mystery that will probably never be solved
a nurse brings a postcard to a sleeping patients bedside
the patient is roxanne sleeping peacefully bathed in sunlight
the nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with many dozens and dozens of postcards charting blazes journey back and forth across the country
and we realize now that roxanne is the woman who has been narrating our tale
i still sleep
listening to the whispers of the dead
on blaze riding hard as a scorching desert noon time lapses into night
the world turns around without me
there are sharks
and there are doves
and nighttime holds far darker terrors than death
but i am never afraid because i know that he is out there somewhere
and that someday somehow blaze ignites screams hurls back his head he will return to me
and the ghost rider rockets headlong into black
