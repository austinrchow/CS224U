captain jack sparrow

views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night gibbs walks the deck alone at night singing and drinking from a bottle fifteen men on a dead mans
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
drink and the devil had done for the rest
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
ha ha ha ha ha
a bell tolls gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky tolling of bells
camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island pinnacle like island off the coast at night connected to the mainland by thin lighted bridge cages with men inside line the bridge prisoners are being marched across the bridge a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering and is dragged across the bridge by guards a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage the crow attacks and pecks his eye out he screams the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch like door in the ground he also screams rocky shoreline lit with torches men toss caskets into the sea numerous caskets are floating out to sea vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen a crow lands on one casket begins pecking at the top sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away along with much wood hand holding flintlock pistol emerges pans about points it at audience for a moment jack breaks out of the top of the casket puts his captains hat on sorry mate
jack breaks the skeletons leg off mind if we make a little side trip
i didnt think so
jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon jack arrives at the
black pearl in his coffin rowboat gibbs holds out his hand to help jack aboard jack puts the skeleton leg in gibbs hand cotton drapes a coat onto jacks back not quite according to plan
complications arose ensued were overcome
you got what you went in for then
captain i think the crew meaning me as well were expecting something a bit more
what with the isla de muerta going all pear shaped reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it
and the royal navy chasing us all around the atlantic
and the hurricane
all in all its seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating
is that how youre all feeling then
perhaps dear old jack is not serving your best interests as captain
walk the plank
jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird what did the bird say
do not blame the bird
show us what is on that piece of cloth there
the monkey snarls seizes the cloth scampers off with it ohhh
jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol his pistol misfires jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while its on the deck the monkey
drops the cloth but is unharmed and scurries into the rigging know that dont do no good
it does me
marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped its a key
much more better
it is a drawing of a key
jack holds up the cloth the crew crowd forward among the crew chinese man black man with a black beard white bearded man with large black hat gentlemen what do
and whatever this key unlocks inside theres something valuable
so were setting out to find whatever this key unlocks
if we dont have the key we cant open whatever it is we dont have that it unlocks
so what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked which we dont have without first having found the key what unlocks it
so were going after this key
youre not making any sense at all
any more questions
do we have a heading
set sail in a
in that way direction
come on snap to and make sail you know how this works
marty and gibbs gather alone by the railing have you noticed lately
the captain seems to be actin a bit strange
settin sail without knowing his own headin
somethins got jack vexed
mark my words what bodes ill for jack sparrow bodes ill for us all
the black pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map a guard brings will in manacles into
becketts office lord beckett
the prisoner as ordered sir
those wont be necessary
wills manacles are removed beckett pours some liquor the east india trading company has need of your services
we wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend captain sparrow
more acquaintance than friend
how do you know him
weve had dealings in the past
and weve each left our mark
on the other
what mark did he leave on you
by your efforts jack sparrow was set free
i would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession
at the point of a sword
beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it letters of marque
you will offer what amounts to a full pardon
jack will be free a privateer in the employ of england
somehow i doubt jack will consider employment the same as being free
jack sparrow is a dying breed
the world is shrinking the blank pages of the map filled in
jack must find his place in the new world or perish
not unlike you mister turner
you and your fiancee face the hangmans noose
so you get both jack and the black pearl
the black pearl
the property you want that he possesses
the item in questions considerably smaller and far more valuable
something sparrow keeps on his person at all times
ah you know it
bring back that compass or theres no deal
jack is using calipers on a map using his left hand a p brand mark is seen on his right arm an hourglass is in the background jack taps the
compass jack looks in his bottle turns the bottle upside down only a few drops spill out why is the rum always gone
jack rises to his feet staggers jack picks up his hat off the top of a globe oh
jack walks past the crew sleeping on hammocks jack is carrying a lantern some of the crew are snoring and cotton is among those sleeping as you were gents
jack goes downstairs to the hold an animal bleats jack unlocks the door goes in jack sees eerie filter feeder creatures festooning a beam of wood jack spots a rack
of bottles with the bottles stored sideways like in a wine rack ah
jack pulls a sideways bottle from the rack jack pours sand out of the bottle jack drops bottle of rum in fright the bottle breaks on the floor jack walks
over to see who spoke bootstrap
bootstrap looks up from where hes sitting on a barrel crabs scuttle across his face is this a dream
i thought not
if it were thered be rum
bootstrap immediately hands jack a bottle of rum jack pries the bottle from bootstraps hand with a crackling sound i had some help retrieving the pearl by the way
jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers then blows across the top of the bottle your son
jack takes a drink from the bottle and to what do i owe the pleasure of your carbuncle
so its you then
he shanghaied you into service eh
a small hermit crab scuttles by bootstrap on top of the barrel where bootstrap sits bootstrap grabs the hermit crab pops it into his mouth and crunches on it jack
moves his mouth jaw and tongue around in revulsion while watching jack hands the bottle back to bootstrap its funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment jack starts to walk off but bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts jack blocking him technic yes but the flying dutchman already has a captain so theres re any idea when jones might release said terrible beastie
jack looks at the palm of his left hand where a black spot boils into view jack looks up but bootstrap has disappeared jack runs across a wooden deck that
has a shallow covering of water on deck all hands
make fast the bunt gasket
marty i want movement
i want movement
lift the skin up
all on deck
and keep running
run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us
do we have a heading
jack rises from where he was ducked behind the base of the mast sees gibbs again oh
didnt say port
i said land
the monkey in skeleton form swings down grabs jacks hat agh
the monkey snarls at jack jack snarls back at the monkey in imitation the monkey throws jacks hat overboard jacks hat
bring er about
back to your stations
the lot o ya
jack stands stiffly in the shadows under some steps between two lighted windows gibbs walks up to jack jack
for the love of mother and child jack whats coming after us
small fishing vessel jacks hat floats toward a small fishing vessel around sunrise a turkish crewmember pulls jacks hat out of the water with a hook the first sailor tries
the hat on jokingly pretending to be a captain heh heh heh

he cant be here
mister swann jacks compass
what does beckett want with that

will is carried across a rope bridge still hanging underneath the bamboo pole port royal elizabeth sits alone in her prison cell male prisoners in the next cell whistle and
beckon her we dont bite
prisoners where you goin
why dont you tell me whats happening
will has gone to find jack
hes a better man than you give him credit for
a horse and carriage are waiting the governor opens the door to the carriage for elizabeth a fair trial for will ends in a hanging
the horse and carriage quickly ride off the horse and carriage arrive at a dock captain hawkins stands silently on the dock facing out to sea the captains body soon
falls revealing mercer who was standing behind the body long knife in hand evening governor
he was carryin this
its a letter to the king
its from you
horses and soldiers arrive to cut off the governor from fleeing from the dock the carriage door is opened but the carriage is empty elizabeth is gone where is she
mercer grabs the governor by the lapels pushes him up against the side of the carriage eitc headquarters darkened room beckett walks in from the balcony carrying a lantern beckett
walks to a table opens a wooden box finds the letters of marque missing no doubt youve discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm as your father believes
elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door hands held behind her then what is
im afraid that currency is the currency of the realm
i expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding
im here to negotiate
elizabeth pulls a pistol points it at becketts head im listening intently
these letters of marque they are signed by the king
yes and theyre not valid until they bear my signature and my seal
or else i would not still be here
you sent will to get you the compass owned by jack sparrow
it will do you no good
i have been to isla de muerta i have seen the treasure myself
there is something you need to know
ah i see
you think the compass leads only to the isla de muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate
but you mustnt worry
i care not for cursed aztec gold
my desires are not so provincial
theres more than one chest of value in these waters
so perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer
elizabeth cocks her pistol beckett signs the document consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night
so i did
a marriage interrupted
or fate intervenes
you make great efforts to ensure jack sparrows freedom
these arent going to jack
to ensure mister turners freedom then
ill still want that compass
consider that in your calculations
longboat ragetti appears to be reading a bible in the back of the longboat but the bible is upside down well i say it was divine providence what escaped us
and i say
it was me bein clever
aint that right poochie
the dog goes to the bow looking forward keys in its mouth well howdya know it
wasnt divine providence what inspired you to be clever
anyways i aint stealin no ship
it aint stealin
and since when did you care
since were not immortal no more
we gotta take care of our immortal souls
you know you cant read
its the bible
you get credit for trying
pretendin to read the bibles a lie
thats a mark against ya
there it is
the dog jumps overboard and swims toward shore whats got into im
mustve seen a catfish
heh heh heh heh heh heh
both laugh the dog reaches shore and looks back at them stupid mongrel
the dog on shore shakes off water looks back at them still holding keys in its mouth their boat capsizes in a wave they wade ashore beach come on
ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
its ours for the taking
tides comin that should help
well salvagin is saving in a manner of speaking
theres the truth of it
cannibal drums sound suppose we beer
save it as soon as we can
what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all
amen to that
the dog barks throne cannibal drums are pounding jack is on the throne a cannibal hands jack a necklace of human toes thank you
jack looks at the toe bites off part of the nail to trim it jack spits out the piece of nail reexamines the toe cages two spherical cages of six
black pearl crewmen apiece hang from ropes over a deep chasm will is in the same cage with gibbs cotton marty and two others why would he do this to us
if jack is their chief
aye the pelegostos made jack their chief
but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief
so he had no choice
hes a captive then as much as the rest of us
as it turns out
see the pelegostos believe that jack is a god in human form and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison
cotton bites gibbs fingers to illustrate argh
theyll roast him and eat him
wheres the rest of the crew
these cages were in
werent built til after we got here
will was gripping the bars made of human bones but quickly pulls his hand away the feast is about to begin
jacks life will end
when the drums stop
well we cant just sit here and wait then can we
throne cannibal drums are pounding no
i am chief
want big fire
maboogie snickel snickel
tout de suite
the cannibal standing next to jack leaves to put more wood on the fire the cannibals put large pieces of wood on the fire the cannibals turn around to find
that jack is gone jack jack is running across a foot bridge jack runs up to a cliff edge totters at the edge looking down jack examines a length of bamboo pole he finds lying there jack goes into a hut sees various supplies the sound of buzzing flies is heard jack picks up a rope starts to exit halts looks back inside jack goes back in picks up a can of paprika with the eitc logo on the bottom jack walks outside the hut the entire tribe is waiting silently outside staring at him oh bugger
jack drops his coil of rope sprinkles paprika on his armpits little seasoning
jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood cannibals are dancing wildly well done
cages the men begin swinging the cages with increasingly wide arcs both cages finally come within reach of the cliff they grab vines and hang on to the cliff put
your legs through start to climb
come on men
itll take all
the rest to crew the black pearl
actually you wont need everyone
bout six would do
gibbs nods hurry
each cage group begins racing against each other up the cliff come on
give it all you got
a cannibal crosses the rope bridge hey
the cannibal crosses rope bridge shhh
one cage group decides to take the risk of climbing despite the nearby cannibal whats he doing
one of the men in the climbing cage grabs a coral snake from the cliff instead of a vine p
when the man holding the snake lets go their cage falls the rope breaks and their cage falls to the bottom move
throne drums pounding a cannibal crosses a bridge to the bonfire area ahhh
the cannibal from the bridge arrives to tell the tribe of the men in cages escaping da
hay la paka say say
the crowd stands silently not knowing whether to stay or to chase the escapees well go on
go get them
cannibals run off to chase after men who escaped from cages in their haste one cannibal drops a lighted torch need the pile of wood under jack no
the edges of the wood begin to catch fire not good
jack blows futilely at the igniting wood cage the remaining cage reaches the top of the cliff cut it loose
find a rock
will manages to sever the cages cable by hammering it with a rock the men in wills cage are unable to the cage open in time before the cannibals will
reach them roll the cage
the cage rolls down the hill the cage falls over the edge of a tiny cliff the cage rolls down the hill rolls up a coconut palm trunk crashes to
the ground unbroken lift the cage
come on men
lift it like a ladys skirt
the men begin running with their legs protruding from the cage holding up the cage martys short legs make a running motion but are unable to reach the ground come
hut jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back jack encounters the cannibal boy standing silently with a fork and a knife one in each hand
jack grabs the knife from the boy and begins cutting his rope off two cannibal women appear jack charges but the bamboo pole on his back spears a coconut in a pile near the cliff edge jack turns suddenly which flings the coconut off the end of the pole into a cannibals face the cannibal slowly lifts the dripping coconut off his face scowling at jack cage the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river cannibals throw spears and shoot arrows at the men in the water the men swim underwater this way lads
jack the two cannibal women throw numerous fruits at jack while the pole is still on his back several of the fruits become impaled along the pole making jack look
like hes part of a shish ka bob da litozo
jack pole vaults across the chasm barely lands on the other edge safely but the fruit slides down to the end of his pole putting weight on the end over
the chasm jack falls into the chasm screaming jacks pole catches between the two walls of a chasm two native women watch jack fall into the chasm with disinterest a geev nee
the two cannibal women walk off disinterested bugger
jacks pole slips loose he falls into the chasm screaming as jack falls through the first rope bridge the rope comes undone but is still attached to the bamboo pole
and to jack jack is hung upside down in the chasm when the bamboo pole catches jack falls through a total of six rope bridges jack lands on his back on grass bamboo pole comes down at him spears the ground near his head fruits tumble down afterwards beach only ragetti and cottons parrot are aboard the black pearl pintel is on the beach below pull loose
unloose the mooring lines
the mooring lines
the monkey chatters grabs ragettis wooden eye thief
give it back
dont bite it
unloose the mooring lines
hes got me eye
he wont give it back
well howd you get it back last time
works half done
we done it for you
knowin youd be comin back for us
cast off boy
what about jack
i wont leave without him
jack appears at a distance running down the beach toward the crew and ship a crowd of cannibals suddenly run down on the beach behind jack pursuing him time to
cast off those lines
jack screams while running down the beach make ready to cast off
the dog is down the beach with jack barking at him good doggie
jack grabs ahold of rigging on the side of the departing ship alas my children
this is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost big wave splashes jack from behind captain jack
the crowd of cannibals falls silent as the ship leaves the dog barks excitedly at the departing ship all heads in the crowd of cannibals turn toward the dog the
dog falls silent whimpers then flees back down the beach the cannibals chase the dog shouting black pearl lets put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea
yes to the first yes to the second but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible
uh that seems a bit contradictory captain
i have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills master gibbs now where is that monkey
i want to shoot something
the monkey screams drops ragettis eye ragetti grabs his eye spits on it rubs the spit around on it the monkey chatters and climbs into the rigging jack is ready
to shoot the monkey with his pistol jack
elizabeth is in danger
have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on er
maybe just lock her up somewhere
she is locked up in a prison bound to hang for helping you
there comes a time when one must take responsibility for ones mistakes
will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around points it at jack i need that compass of yours jack
i must trade it for her freedom
jack pushes wills sword aside mister gibbs
we have a need to travel upriver
by need dyou mean a
trifling need uh
fleeting as in say in a passing fancy
resolute and unyielding need
what we need to do is make sail for port royal with all haste
i shall trade you the compass if you will help me
to find this
you want me to find this
you want you to find this
because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly
dotty belle ol
whats her face
is going to save elizabeth
how much do you know about davy jones
yeah its gonna save elizabeth
edinburgh trader a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a corner pulls it out the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound dress whats
if you both fancy the dress youll just have to share and wear it one after the other
its not like that sir
this ship is haunted
is it now
amongst us yes
all the men
they can feel it
the ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage i figure it
searching for her husband lost at sea
a virgin too likely as not
and that bodes ill by all accounts
that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit finds it
that that will just anger the spirit sir
what we need to do is find out what the spirit needs and then just get it back
youre a pair of superstitious goats and its got the best of you
now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard
a young woman by the look of it
i want you to search the ship and find er
oh and uh
shes probably naked
the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway pantano river aerial view of the mouth of the pantano river two longboats are beginning their way up the river
the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots why is jack afraid of the open ocean
well if you believe such things theres a beast does the bidding of davy jones
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off
and drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness
marty turns around at mention of the word pintel and ragetti look at each other they say the stench of its breath is like ooh
imagine the last thing you know on gods green earth is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses
if you believe such things
and the key will spare him that
now thats the very question jack wants answered
bad enough even to go visit
tias shack bayou with fireflies and an iguana on a tree trunk on the left the iguana eats a firefly with a quick slurping sound people are occasionally seen standing
quietly in the darkness among the trees no worries mates
tia dalma and i go way back
thick as thieves
nigh inseparable we are
ill watch your back
its me front im worried about
mind the boat
mind the boat
mind the boat
mind the boat
mind the boat

cotton is left alone in the longboat jack cautiously enters tias shack pushing the door open slowly near the inside of the shack door hangs a live snake moving slowly
tia is sitting at a table looks up from her crab claws sees jack in the doorway jack sparrow
i always know de wind was goin blow you back to me one day
tia sees will standing in the doorway goes up to him you
you have a touch of
destiny about you william turner

jack whistles once a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage look
jack cocks his pistol shoots the monkey the bullet has no effect but the monkey chatters in fright an undead monkey
tia lifts the cage door the monkey scampers off no
youve no idea how long it took us to catch that
the payment is fair
were looking for this
and what it goes to
the compass you bartered from me
it cannot lead you to dis
jack sparrow does not know what he wants
do know but are loathe to claim it as your own
your key go to a chest and it is what lay inside the chest you seek dont it
what is inside
unclaimed properties of a valuable nature
bad i hope
a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to ragettis face as he speaks you know of
davy jones yes
a man of de sea
a great sailor until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men
what vexes all men
dichotomy of good and evil
a wo man
he fell in love
no no no no i heard it was the sea he fell in love with
same story different versions and all are true
see it was a woman as changing and harsh and untamable as the sea
him never stopped loving her
but the pain it cause im was too much to live wid
but not enough to cause him to die
exactly did he put into the chest
literally or figuratively
he couldnt lierally put his heart in a chest
it was not wort feeling what
small fleeting joy life brings and so
he carved out him heart lock it away in a chest and hide de chest from de world
de keys he keep wid him at all times
you knew this
i did not
i didnt know where the key was
but now we do
so all thats left is to climb aboard the flying dutchman grab the key you go back to port royal and save your bonnie lass hey
let me see your hand
jack shows his right hand is untouched but tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand the black spot on jacks left hand is revealed uhhh
the black spot
gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest spins around once to the left and spits black spot
pintel and ragetti copy gibbs ritual in synchrony my eyesights as good as ever just so you know
pushing aside cloth door beads tia goes into a back room and searches for something i am justmy little where are you
jack steals a ring off of one of tias tables beside the ring is a silver locket tia comes back with an object from the back room davy jones cannot

tia hands jack a jar of dirt dirt

we have a need to find the flying dutchman
tia is sitting she holds several crab shells between her cupped hands and closes her eyes a touch
tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall fade to aerial view of rocky islands whose positions match the positions of the crab claws
black pearl pan beyond the rocks to the black pearl just offshore in stormy weather the black pearl crew look at the scuttled ship on the rocks thats the flying dutchman
she doesnt look like much
neither do you
do not underestimate her
jack gives gibbs a meaningful glance elbows gibbs mustve run afoul of the reef
so whats your plan then
i row over search the ship until i find your bloody key
and if there are crewmen
i cut down anyone in my path
i like it
simple easy to remember
your chariot awaits you sire
ha ha ha ha ha ha
if you do happen to get captured just say jack sparrow sent you to settle his debt
might save your life
ha ha ha
douse the lamps
marty douses a lamp then cotton douses a lamp then pintel douses a lamp will sets off in a rowboat alone toward the scuttled ship before attack will goes aboard
the ship lantern in hand will passes one dead crewman at deck level proped up behind net like rigging will comes across a wounded sailor who seems to be in shock the wounded sailor is pulling on a pulley desperately muttering to himself up the
theres no use
youve run aground
behind will a crewmembers body falls from a height splashing into the water will goes to investigate hey
will turns the mans body over to see his face the mans face is gone his face is just a puckered piece of skin which bulges outward the real flying

the rest have moved on
jones pauses to clench his left hand which is a large lobster claw jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen do you fear death

im sorely tempted to accept that offer
through a spyglass jack sees jones turn to look directly at him black pearl suddenly jones is standing aboard the black pearl directly in front of jack and his spyglass
cotton and gibbs have knives to their throats from other flying dutchman crewmembers who teleported over oh
you have a debt to pay
youve been captain of the black pearl for thirteen years
that was our agreement
technically i was only captain for two years then i was viciously mutinied upon
then you were a poor captain but a captain nonetheless
have you not introduced yourself all these years as captain jack sparrow
you have my payment
one soul to serve on your ship is already over there
one soul is not equal to another
so weve established my proposal is sound in principle now were just haggling over price
just how many souls do you think my soul is worth
one hundred souls three days uh
youre a diamond mate
send me back the boy ill get started right off
maccus blocks jack from exiting i keep the boy
a good faith payment
that leaves you only ninety nine more to go
have you not met will turner
hes noble heroic terrific soprano
worth at least four
maybe three and a half
and did i happen to mention
hes in love
with a girl
due to be married
dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony
i keep the boy
ninety nine souls uh
but i wonder sparrow can you live with this
can you condemn an innocent man a friend uh to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free
im good with it
should we seal it in blood
mm mm ink
jones grabs jacks hand resulting in a squishy sound uh
pintel whimpers with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of jones ship jack looks at his hand its covered with slime but the black spot disappears under
the effect of the slime oh mr
uh i feel sullied and unusual
and how do you intend to harvest these ninety nine souls in three days
fortunately he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be

the crowd cheers and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast men throw norrington into the mud with some pigs the crowd leaves except for elizabeth elizabeth turns norrington
over onto his back james norrington
what has the world done to you
mercer observes elizabeth and norrington from the doorway of the tavern flying dutchman jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles steam coming from pipes the crew are on desk
slaving away pulling rhythmically on a rope heave
secure the mast tackle mister turner
will goes to grab a rope step aside
bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son bootstrap is stunned bootstrap lets go of the rope will attempts to grab the sliding rope the cannons
rope drags will across the deck the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck and the organ music stops haul that weevil to his feet
the crew haul will to his feet five lashes to remind you
to stay on em
impeding me in my duties
youll share the punishment

and what would prompt such an act of charity
ha ha ha ha
what fortuitous circumstance be this
five lashes be owed
i believe it is
jones hands the whip to bootstrap jones tentacle curls around the shaft of it the cats out of the bag mister turner
your issue will feel its sting be it the bosuns hand by your own
bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip two crewmen tear wills shirt off exposing his bare back bootstrap whips wills back five times will is tossed into a lower part of the
deck partially filled with water will stands up wearing an intact white shirt you had it easy boy
ha ha ha
i dont need your help
so im to understand what you did was an act of compassion
below deck bootstrap and will enter the interior of the ship together crewmember wyvern is seen to their right encrusted into the interior side of the hull standing up ive
sworn no oath
not until i find this
wyverns eyes open in the coral encrusted wall at the mention of the key wyvern who is part of the wall breaks his head away from the wall leaving his
brains behind the deadmans chest
what do you know of this
open the chest with the key and stab the heart
no no no no
dont stab the heart
the dutchman needs a living heart or therell be no captain
and if theres no captain theres no one to have the key
so the captain has the key
wyvern retracts his head back into the wall having said too much where is the key
where is the chest
wyvern closes his eyes and falls silent black pearl the black pearl is at a dock loading fruits and livestock jack and gibbs are walking together elizabeth approaches from behind
still dressed as a man captain sparrow
come to join me crew lad
im here to find the man i love
im deeply flattered son but my first and only love is the sea
norrington vomits over the side meaning william turner captain sparrow
hide the rum
gibbs takes the bottle that jack hands to him and walks up the boarding plank in the background you know these clothes do not flatter you at all
it should be a dress or nothing
i happen to have no dress in my cabin
i know will came to find you
where is he
darling i am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but
through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me poor william has been press ganged into davy jones crew
norrington vomits over the side then spits oh please
the captain of the flying dutchman
you look bloody awful
what are you doing here
you hired me
i cant help it if your standards are lax
you smell funny
all i want is to find will
are you certain
is that what you really want most
because i would think youd want to find a way to save will the most
and you have a way of doing that
well there is a chest
a chest of unknown size and origin
pintel ragetti walk by together carrying a crate of bottles and overhearing the conversation what contains the still beating heart o davy jones
and whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command jones to do whatever it is he or she wants including
saving brave william from his grim fate
you dont actually believe him do you
how do we find it
unique here having the meaning of broken
this compass does not point north
norrington vomits over the side where does it point
it points to the thing you want most in this world
are you telling the truth
every word love
and what you want most in this world is to find the chest of davy jones is it not
to save will
by finding the chest of davy jones
jack hands the compass to elizabeth then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass elizabeth consults the compass for her the dial clearly points in a specific
direction jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass mister gibbs
we have our heading
cast off those lines weigh anchor and prow that canvas
welcome to the crew former commodore
heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
the goat neighs eitc headquarters beckett and mercer are in a room with the governor whose hands are in shackles mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the
window theres something to knowing the exact shape of the world and ones place in it dont you agree
i had you brought here because i thought youd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter
most recently seen on the island of tortuga then left in the company of a known pirate jack sparrow
and other fugitives from justice
including the previous owner of this sword
our ships are in pursuit
and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal
i personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board
your authority as governor your influence in london and your loyalty to the east india trading company
shall i remove these shackles
so you see mercer every man has a price he will willingly accept
even for what he hopes never to sell
deck slow motion scene of falling dice three crewman are playing liars dice organ music is heard in the background i wager
ill match ten years
its a game of deception
your bet includes all the dice not just your own
what are they wagering
so any crewman can be challenged
i challenge davy jones
immediately the organ music ceases immediately jones peg leg is heard thumping in approach with each thump of his footstep gooseneck barnacles retract someone laughs i accept
jones sits down at the gambling table the stakes
an eternity of servitude
i want this
jack shows jones the picture of the key how do you know of the key
thats not part of the game is it
you can still walk away
one of jones tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it the tentacle puts the key back bootstrap sits down at the table whats this
dont do this
seven fives uh
huh huh huh
welcome to the crew liar
and be called a liar myself for my trouble
bootstrap bill youre a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship

organ room nighttime on deck of the flying dutchman will emerges from a hatch on deck will sneaks past one one the crew on deck who is sleeping with a
bottle in his hand jones is asleep at his organ snoring will sneaks into his room behind him will grabs a nearby quill pen uses it to lift one of jones tentacles one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key almost waking up jones the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ that plays a song will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles will finally removes the key replaces it with his drawing of the key deck its not a fate you had to choose for yourself either

i will not abandon you
will sets out alone on a longboat black pearl crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the black pearl beckett
yes theyre signed lord cutler beckett of the east india trading company
will was working for beckett and never said a word
beckett wants the compass
only one reason for that
he wants the chest
yes he did say something about a chest
if the company controls the chest they controls the sea
a truly discomforting notion love
bad for every mothers son what calls himself a pirate
i think theres a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails
brace the foreyard
might i inquire how as to how you came by these
will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor
yet youre the one standing here with the prize
full pardon commission as a privateer on behalf of england and the east india trading company
as if i could be bought for such a low price
jack tucks the letters into his coat and begins to walk away jack the letters give them back
you do know will taught me how handle a sword
as i said
elizabeth walks away frustrated leans on the ships railing jack makes an odd grunting noise norrington walks up to elizabeth at the railing its a curious thing
there was a time when i wouldve given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me
i dont know what you mean
oh i think you do
oh dont be absurd
i trust him thats all

i just thought id be married by now

right on this deck

to act on selfish impulse
you want to see what its like

why doesnt your compass work
uh my compass works fine
because you and i are alike and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it
to do the right thing
i love those moments
i like to wave at them as they pass by
youll have the chance to do something
and when you do youll discover something that youre a good man
all evidence to the contrary
i have faith in you

youre going to want it
a chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow
you wont be able to resist
youre going to want to know
what it tastes like

elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion oh
elizabeth pretends to faint which knocks off her hat elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting oblivious to her elizabeth soon sits up puts on her hat pintel ragetti

for the heart which is gone where is it
where is the thump thump
we mustve hit the reef
its not a reef

what is it
all guns defend the masts
attack the starboard
ive seen it before
break out the cannons and hold for my signal
with a deep rumbling sound the krakens tentacles slowly crawl up the hull easy boys
the tentacles rise higher steady
the tentacles start feeling around the ship hold
i think weve held fire long enough
the crew fire the cannons hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some the kraken sinks into the sea some tentacles glowing from the blast the crew cheers itll be back

the crew continues loading aerial view approaching black pearl zooming through the rigging to the other side jack is in a rowboat alone rowing away from the black pearl jack

elizabeth runs to the railing sees jack rowing away oh you coward
another heavy thud hits the ship crewmen shout not good

to attract the krakens attention euh

elizabeth hesitates waiting for will to fall free one of the krakens tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards she screams ragetti chops off the end of the
tentacle holding elizabeth another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot only to be grabbed by the kraken and flung around the rifle drops onto the deck above elizabeth elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle but someones foot holds it down she sees that its jacks foot that he has returned to the pearl jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder slow motion scene of jack firing a ball into the gunpowder ball whistles through the air strikes the gunpowder which explodes the kraken releases its hold burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean groaning sound did we kill it

elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again
elizabeth leaves jack and climbs down into the long boat wheres jack
he elected to stay behind to give us a chance
the crew look uncertain go
the longboat casts off jack struggles with his manacles bugger bugger bugger bugger bugger bugger
a coconut and cannonball roll by on the tilted deck jack spots a fallen lantern picks it up with the tip of his sword jack breaks the lantern against the
mast pours oil over his wrists jack struggles with slipping his hand out come on
jack finally manages to slip his hands out the kraken rises up behind him jack halts turns around faces the kraken music and sound stop momentarily the kraken roars spraying
jack with slime and flinging his earlier eaten hat to the deck not so bad
jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet oh
jack spots his hat picks it up puts it on wipes slime from his face hello beastie
slow motion scene of jack boldy charging toward the krakens mouth sword drawn q deck jack sparrow

tias shack the remaining crew paddles through the waters to tia dalmas shack many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack holding candles mourning jack sparrow inside the shack
will absent mindedly keeps throwing his fathers knife into the table top tia carries a tray around to all of them offers the mugs to elizabeth against de cold
and de sorrow
elizabeth takes a mug but doesnt drink its a shame
i know youre tinking that wid the pearl you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadders soul
doesnt matter now
the pearls gone
along with its captain
gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack aye
and already the world seems a bit less bright
he fooled us all right to the end
but i guess that honest streak finally won out
to jack sparrow
never another like captain jack
he was a gentleman of fortune he was
he was a good man
they all take a drink out of their mugs except elizabeth if there was anything could be done to bring him back
would you do it
what would any of you be willing to do
would you sail to the ends of the eart and beyond to fetch back
witty jack and im precious pearl
but if youre goin brave de weird and haunted shores at worlds end den
you will need a captain who knows dose waters
a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room so tell me whats become of my ship
