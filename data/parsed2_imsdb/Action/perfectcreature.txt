written by glenn standring may the screen is black music evoking religion and danger begins
for three hundred years the great plagues have swept the earth
diseases created from the experiments of the alchemists
we see death tolls appear through this graphically
the plague million souls
virulent small pox million
mutated influenza million souls
lilly thinking they had discovered gods secret code for life the alchemists experimented with genetic science
they had no idea what they had unleashed
we begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke slowly revealing itself
continuing but there was also a miracle
one of these plagues helped nature create a new kind of being
at first they were called nosferatu or vampire and were feared
but they were not supernatural monsters just a better version of ourselves
they were the brothers and their religion and science helped sustain us against the plagues and influenzas that have ravaged europe and the rest of the colonies
for years our two races have lived in harmony
we are very close on a bespectacled eye
it stares at us and then looks down
off see here
this is what you need to look for
cut to the object in the genetic doctors hand it is like an x ray yet the image looks remarkably like a dna profile
continuing off a genetic mutation we all carry it
but we now know a virus activates it
we reveal the genetic doctor sitting at his desk smoking a cigarette
the surgery and the clothes suggest the year yet there are small things that are different not what youd expect to be around at this time
standing next to him in the dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor an apprentice who looks attentive
continuing this virus plays some unknown role in the birth the brothers
of course the mutation occurs very rarely these days
and only in males
the apprentice nods and then looks up
there is someone else in the room
a woman who we now see is pregnant
there is something about her that suggests more a prisoner or psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother
continuing strange isnt
apprentice doctor strange
that god would choose such humble vehicle for a miracle
the mothers invariably come from the slums we dont know why
to the woman this is your th isnt it
we see the woman shes like a hollow person hardly aware of where she is
the doctor shuffles papers
finds what he wants
continuing yes her first was successful a brother was born
thereafter variously malformed offspring
we can only hope this one will be different
to woman youll have to try harder this time
the woman now looks up
and tentatively speaks
what is it
i want to keep my baby
they always take my babies away
dont be stupid woman
the woman drops her eyes
we see the apprentice doctor almost pitying the poor woman
apprentice doctor to woman you wont have to worry
the brotherhood will take him
we are closer on the woman now
tears begin to glisten in her eyes as we drift closer to her
apprentice doctor continuing off raise him in the church teach him
you should be proud
its a blessing really hell want for nothing
not like the rest of us
we track in closer closer to the woman then continue right into her eye through the fluid to see the room reflected upside down at the back of the retina
this dissolves to an upside view of
pov babys view in an operating theatre
cut to the woman we saw earlier with the genetic doctor she has just given birth
the baby is placed on linen blankets and cleaned by a nurse
a man now enters the operating theatre we can tell the doctor is uneasy
the man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit
he does not wear a surgical mask
his eyes are a piercingly clear light gray
he enters with two other men who look similar to him
by his side there is also a pristine boy perhaps years old the same piercing eyes
they both approach the baby
the man stares serenely at the baby all bloody lying on blankets
this is your brother silus
you will teach him
the little boy then shares a glance with the woman who has just given birth
she seems to recognize the boy
is that my mother
no not any more
augustus then leans forward and gently opens the babys mouth
we see the baby close
in the otherwise baby like mouth we see something strange
there are two tiny fangs protruding from the otherwise smooth gums
we see augustus smile
in his mouth too we see two perfectly pointed teeth
continuing welcome to the world little brother
cut to we end close on the baby its piercing eyes
perfect creature the title fades
then another title appears
queens imperial winter residence the pacific colony years later we see a city seething with smoke from coal fires steam from engines alien distorted victorian spires are silhouetted against the
moody moonlit sky which is literally filled with dirigibles and strange flying machines that seem victorian of the industrial revolution but that are also strangely futuristic
it is but not our
the look of the film and the night is silver almost metallic moonlit skies
a hazy mist hangs in the air
wet steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man stands
he stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead its shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away
then we see him
the man is handsome in a perfectly cut long wool jacket dark gray
he wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can see the surrounding street reflected in them victorian gothic buildings
this man is silus
he surveys the street
while the houses are beautiful theyre run down
silus his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever seen takes a long long inhale through his nose his eyes closing briefly as if trying to sense smell
he stops the breath and opens his eyes
they are clear full of purpose
he bends down to the footpath runs his hand along its surface almost caressing it
he closes his eyes
the camera moves in to end close on silus ear
as this happens the soundtrack all the noises in the night become amplified
we see silus face see him concentrating intently
we hear several individual noises
first a very quiet pitter patter
cut to a cat stealthily moving between some thorny rose bushes
cut to silus again concentrating even more
now the distant sound of trickling water
cut to a drain pipe leaking
cut to silus once more
this time we can hear plop plop plop
cut to a pool of water
then plop as a drop hits it
the drop is not water
the drop is a red liquid thick now dispersing in the water
and another drop plop
high speed crane up from this pool up up the side of a building to end on a face in the shadows
we can see reflective gleaming eyes
and a mouth with blood dripping from it
cut to silus again
his eyes flicking open we see the footpath reflected in those perfect light gray eyes
music brooding ancient begins to hum as silus slowly rises as if his limbs have the power to make him float so perfect and powerful are they
a small smile has appeared on his lips it is the smile of a man who knows that something very dark something very dangerous is close by
slowly his hand slips into his jacket
he holds it there watching surveying the street immediately ahead of him for the slightest movement
he sees it
on the wall of an old georgian mansion across the road a shape on the side of the wall almost imperceptible hidden in the shadows and brickwork
a creature on the side of the wall
silus begins to move forward now everything in perfect shining silver slow motion
as he moves forward he pulls a gun from his jacket it is silver organic and glass art nouveaux styling and points it ahead of him as he glides forward
the creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards it moves a little and then like a spider scrambles along the side of the wall heading away from us
a bullet of silver explodes from the gun seems almost to hang in the air for a moment reflecting the moon above before hurtling at high speed towards its target
the shell explodes the wall next to the creature who stops suddenly in the light so that we can see it
with reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple lips
and teeth the teeth of a vampire
this creature immediately dives from the wall to the ground just avoiding another two bullets that crash into the wall
la as the man falls directly towards the camera
silus now rushes forward holding his gun out in front of him he moves forward gracefully
he can see the man skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building
silus tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing
he raises his gun towards the man once more but he is gone
close on silus enigmatic face
and in his mouth two perfectly pointed fangs
cut to we are outside a cafe the cafe is a warm glow against the cold night
we see past the fine falling rain through the large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux designs lacing across it to a table inside by the window where
two pristinely dressed men sit
cut to we are inside
closer on the two men
one is silus
the other man is augustus the man we saw in the operation theatre before
augustus has hardly aged at all
we see silus
cut to flashback from silus memory a dead girl on a bed blood splattered across her pillow
cut to silus face
pull out to reveal were back in the cafe
it is taken care of
this is good
we failed this girl
we asked her to help us catch him and then we failed her
but her death served a greater good
every trap needs bait
augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe from the onyx table at which they sit then settles back into a fine hardwood chair
the chairs swirling delicate back creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe
continuing are you sure you wont join me
silus shakes his head no
the opium in the pipe crackles
perhaps this is beyond us
perhaps we should inform the authorities
the human beings
augustus places the pipe down blows a smoke ring as a chinese woman dressed in a sarong brings over two finely cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men
silus now lifts the glass and we see what it contains
blood dark and red and viscous
silus takes a sip then looks over to the bar
there is a young woman there sitting at the bar being treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed patrons the young woman laughs enjoying the attention
tubes run from the young womans arms
these tubes carry her blood into a conch shaped glass bowl
we see the chinese waitress fill another glass from the bowl
silus watches blood slightly present on his ashen lips
and we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth
for now the brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves
if they find out we are covering up these deaths
which is why you must find him
silus now turns to augustus still looking unconvinced
continuing for centuries we brothers have served mankind and them us
the great union
but remember your history
years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our children as monsters
they had no notion of evolution
in another world we might all have been slaughtered only to be remembered in myth monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists
we must refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the two races
the old prejudices are still there
human beings are paranoid creatures by nature
perhaps they have good reason
simply concern yourself with finding edgar
find your brother so that we can help him
before he kills again
cut to close up of a newspaper
on it we see a banner headline
influenza vaccine shortages lead to black market trade
we pull out to reveal the paper is lying on a foot path
wind blows the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street
the street is wet glistening
the rain rain rain rain
the edwardian and victorian buildings of the street might seem beautiful but they are not
they are largely derelict
we see a woman standing in a doorway out of the rain
she is wrapped in a black plastic jacket that she pulls about her
a man approaches her
everyones ready lilly
they both move to one of the tall buildings a four story ancient tenement that looks empty almost derelict
they quietly move up the steps of the place and then pause
there is the bleep from a strange looking valve powered walkie talkie hereafter called an rt
continuing on three gents
crash cut to the door of the building swinging open wildly a hand held camera on the shoulder of lilly and jones
a large grubby looking woman stands in a long grim hallway mop in hand
at the far end of the hall another door disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards two men appearing out of the rain
to the woman dont you move
we see a gun in jones hand as he moves towards the woman who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees
the camera then pans wildly left and right
then lillys foot kicks in a door to our right revealing a dank office and a man half naked reaching for a gun
a woman is lying on a cot and shes screaming
she is instantly recognizable as a prostitute
to the slum landlord dont you dare
from this pov we see lillys hand pointing a gun at the slum landlord who is now slowly easing back into the scummy office
we now finally cut to see lilly
she is around an intelligent handsome
the man jones appears at her shoulder leering
jones is the type of guy you just know will go to seed at
but thats still years away
jones stares at the slum landlord who is trying to cover himself
god help us
what an appalling sight
the hallway again
the other two men we saw entering at the beginning are talking to the woman with the mop
one of the men is taking notes
we pan to the office to see lilly and jones standing before the slum landlord who is now wrapped in a towel and sitting in a chair
i dont know nothing about it
i give em out
make sure everyone gets em
thats a lie
we know youve been trading influenza vaccine in the workhouses
another man now approaches lilly
i think you should see this
halfway down the hall there is a door frank opens it displaying a set of stairs leading down
id use the mask if i were you
lilly pulls a dark surgical type mask over her face then slowly moves down the steps into the oblivion below
cut between lillys pov and her face her eyes glimmering in the sub light as she moves down the stairs very carefully
and finally the horror is revealed
in this basement there are or people lying on the floor
most of them are silent but a couple moan
one a woman pleads to lilly
the woman extends her arm
it is covered in sweat grimy
the glands at the side of the womans neck are distended and swollen her eyes bloodshot
the room is a version of hell
lillys eyes glisten
cut to jones has the slum landlord by the throat
youre a fucking liar
no no i swear it i gave em their boosters both of em
im a responsible landlord i swear to god
there mustve been something wrong with them vaccines
lilly stares at the slum landlord shock in her face and anger
this is a civil health violation
youre going to the hell house for this
you can forget lovely doris here where youre going
we see the woman who was screaming before the prostitute she makes an obscene gesture at jones
as this is going on frank and the other man weve seen are tearing the place apart looking for something
they dont find it and franks look tells lilly so
lillys face is a mask
she is watching the slum landlord very carefully
he keeps looking down strangely nervously
i dont know what youre on about
ive done nothing i swear to god ive done nothing
lilly lets her eyes drift down all the way down to the chair legs which rock unevenly on the floor
lilly is staring at the scratched worn floor boards which move
cut to frank prizing back the floor boards
jones restrains the slum landlord
frank pulls the floor boards away easily
we see that hidden in the floor cavity are packets of something
frank pulls them out
rips one of the plastic bags open
in it are packets with the words jamestown borough civilian influenza vaccination
frank holds it up for lilly to see
the slum landlord is now looking three ways at once
lilly slowly begins to approach the slum landlord
it is my pleasure to inform you that you are under arrest for trafficking influenza vaccine
i want my lawyer
this is a violation of the health act whereby you have withheld borough sponsored vaccines from your tenants
i want a lawyer
anything you say will be held against you as evidence and by endangering the public good you are not entitled to a lawyer
the slum landlord just stares at her
fuck you then
lilly smiles grimly
theres only one other thing
lilly gives the slum landlord one almighty slap across the face that stuns him
then jones grabs the slum landlord and drags him off but we stay on lilly
she stoops and lifts something from the landlords desk
a public health flier saying fight influenza
ask your landlord for your free vaccine now
then from the corner of the room the prostitute pipes up impatiently waving a cigarette at lilly
how about me
he promised me some of that
i earned it
cut to jones is in front frank is driving
the car has come to a lurching halt
some kind of cart is blocking the road
hitting the horn come one
jones is eating some kind of pie that is an affront to culinary art
lil you want some
ensconced in the back lilly shakes her head no
she is watching the patterns of street lights that play and flow over the wet windows of the car
im not letting that scum put me off my food
thatd be like a moral victory
ill get out here
we see lilly get out
frank and jones share a look
continuing whats up with her
jones watches lilly move off something like compassion crosses his features
is she alright
it died of the influenza didnt it
shes never said anything about a kid
she never says anything
jones stares after lilly then starts chomping into his food
the police car pulls out leaving lilly outside the subway station
lilly looks exhausted breathes in deeply
above power lines blow in the wind and rain and make a clacking sound
she moves off and we crane up to see the seething smoky city beyond
lilly enters her apartment
its nice not opulent but a haven of sorts
she stands for a moment in the empty hallway
we see a hall several doors run off it
lilly approaches a room and we see inside it
it is empty apart from a stripped bed and some boxes
lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes
she picks up a toy a pink fairy princess with wings the paint on its face worn
lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics
we see lillys face as she stares at the doll
emotion fights to claw its way out from under her skin but she doesnt let it
then in the distance we hear a childs cries
it almost sounds like memories wafting through the air but the stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that the noises come from there the sound of
cut to lilly enters her bedroom
the place is a mess
she sits on the bed
she picks up a framed photo which sits on a sideboard next to the bed
it shows lilly a man lillys age and a child of years who looks a lot like lilly
she stares at the child
we hear the sound of rain pounding against the window of the bedroom
pull out to reveal the exterior window
we can see through the window into lillys apartment again see lilly lying down hugging the photo
the rain has become a light mist
we are close on a poster
it shows a perfect face serenely beaming out it could be silus or augustus except this man is dressed in religious regalia like a priest
the poster says the brotherhood loves you
you are divine
we begin to crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp post
the street is seething the slums of jamestown
a young boy perhaps seven spiked up hair face covered in grime grime from dragging himself up in this hellish place
he carries a bag filled with the detritus hes picked from the rubbish bins of the rich
he wears a distinctive red t shirt that is several sizes too big
he moves along the street avoiding a disinterested passersby
as he passes an alley he hears something
an animal like growl
down the alley he can see two figures
one is a male
he is clutching another clothed figure female
at that instant the man turns to the boy
there half seen in the slick shadows the most piercing eyes a bloody mouth with fangs hissing
the creature drops the woman and scales the sheer wall of the alleyway clutching various handholds up four flights then gone
the kid frightened now makes to run off but bangs into a passerby
the man grabs the kid roughly
where are you going in such a hurry my little ruffian
pilfering by the look of you
the kid struggles and the man now sees the shape of the woman in the alleyway slumped to the ground
continuing whats going on here
whatd you do to her
dont i didnt do nothing
it was a brother
it was a brother did it
the man moves forward dragging the kid
and he sees the woman there deathly white in the alley
dead eyes staring
oh dear god
cut to we track past a sign that says museum of spiritual selection and alchemistry
in the distance we can see a group of people in the hazy light
cut to augustus the man we saw with silus earlier sitting on a chair surrounded by various objects
at his feet are a gaggle of school children aged around ten affluent looking human
augustus points to a strange ancient looking glass apparatus
years ago with these simple instruments the alchemist guiseppi de angelo discovered what we today call genetic science
continuing he deciphered that the brothers were a new race of beings sent by god to serve and protect you
we see the faces of the children rapt
continuing de angelo formed the church of the brotherhood
he was a great great man but there were others bad men who took what de angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results
the science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since
who can tell me what came from these bad experiments
one child puts his hand up
behind the child in the distance augustus now sees silus approaching silus obviously wants to talk to augustus
augustus points to the child while looking at silus
all the bad things
like bad germs and flu
augustus nods watching silus ominous expression
augustus looks at the child and tries to smile
continuing all the bad things
the streets are wet
high above several large zeppelins plod across the sky
we crane down to street level to find a police car pulling up through the steam
lilly gets out jones beside her wolfing down another bun
there are cops everywhere
an alleyway is cordoned off
the dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like wolves hassling the cops some yell obscenities generally along the lines of wheres the police when you need
jones stares at the people
someone should flatten this cesspool and start again
lilly and jones move towards the police cordon
immediately a reporter accosts them
do you have any comments on the death
theyre saying it was a brother is that true
lilly stares at the reporter pauses for thought
she whistles to one of the cops nearby who then approaches
jones and lilly push past as the reporter protests at being manhandled
continuing to jones find any witnesses and shut them up
jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley
lilly ducks under the crime scene tape moving into the alley
the alleyway is full of forensics personnel
lilly moves deeper into the alleyway
we see her pov moving forward finally revealing the body of the young woman who is surrounded by various forensics staff
lilly talks to one
can i step in
with the traffic
whats it matter
lilly moves forward
she can now see the woman more clearly
the woman is obviously dead her pale white skin like wet shining alabaster in the dark alley
flashes from photographic machines light the scene almost blinding lilly and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene
lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body
another man now walks up and kneels next to lilly young good looking obviously takes pride in himself
have you seen it
dominic bends down and moves the dead womans head displaying the side of her neck
a bite has torn the skin on the side of her neck
the wound extends down the carotid artery sliced in two
continuing its a bite
if you know what i mean
lilly nods then looks down at the womans dead cockeyed stare
lilly closes the womans eyes
she is passed a bloody id
lilly stares at it
continuing tanya garfield
jones now arrives
to forensics team where do you get a cup of tea around here
no one answers
continuing theres a kid who saw it down there
lilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance being talked to by two uniformed policemen
continuing says it was a brother
and theyve got another fellow thats all who saw it
alright well close this down gents
none of you are to say a word not even to your old mother
all the police officers stare at her they know what she means alright
jones shrugs and nods
lilly gets up and moves towards the street kid who is being talked to by two burly grumpy policemen
the boy is shaking
continuing he saw what happened
now he wont talk
didnt see anything
lilly looks at the boy
whats your name
the kid doesnt answer and gets a whack around the ears from one of the policemen
continuing to the policeman stop that
lilly stares at the kid as if the way he looks has keyed a memory in her
she squats and looks him straight in the eye
continuing whats your name then
you live around here
the kid looks nervous
lilly moves some of the bedraggled hair out of the kids eyes
continuing i grew up streets from here
the skrummers workhouse
surprised you did
or should i say i crawled out of here
the kid smiles
lilly focuses on him now
continuing no one else will do anything about this you know
they just think this is a slum
no one really cares what happens to the people here
except for you
the kid stares at her shes a magician and hes a believer
continuing what did you see
what kind of man
youre sure it was a brother
he had teeth and everything
where did he go
the kid turns and points to the shear wall of the alley
he went straight up there
lilly stares at the wall
alright you go with these men theyll look after you
continuing to the policemen get him to describe it all
and keep him away from everyone
the policemen grunt and begin to lead the kid off
continuing to the policemen and get him some food
jones now standing next to lilly moans
now theyll all want feeding
lilly looks at joness callous face shes not amused
cut to high angle pov of lilly and jones moving off
someone is watching them from the roof above
the pov belongs to silus who stares down at them
in particular he watches lilly
we see lilly pause and then look up as if feeling shes watched
we see lillys pov of the building above
there is no one there
ha of lilly looking up
cut to a device flies toward the camera sharp needles eject from it slamming into skin
seated at the desk is a harassed balding man anderson of about
hes just finished vaccinating himself wincing at the needle jabs on the soft skin of his arm
there are many other needle marks on his skin
off ive quarantined the neighborhood
lilly stands before the mans large desk which is lit by only a desk lamp
continuing as far as anyone knows we have a new influenza outbreak
what about the telephonic companies
theyre cooperating closing all phone lines in and out except directly to us
continuing youve done well lilly
the reporter is more of a problem
we have days by law before we have to release her
then its out
anderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he motions for her to sit
continuing i hate these things
im like a pin cushion
its better than the alternative sir
anderson stares at her a moment of tension
i need you to stay with this lilly
you know jamestown better than anyone how to handle the people
lilly acknowledges the compliment
continuing the brothers have requested to be involved with the investigation
thats nice for them
you have a problem with it
i think they can help
and i dont want someone working on this whose got something against the church
how do you know i dont
lilly youre the least prejudiced person i know
in fact youre the only one i know
the church is powerful but more than that peoples faith in the brotherhood is about all theyve got these days
and the government knows it
even the queen herself is involved
this is political
cut to lilly enters drinking a coffee
she begins to top it up from the coffee stand when jones comes up to her
lillys expression becomes taut
she peers towards her office
she can clearly see an exceptionally well dressed man in her office with his back to us
it is silus
a young female cop steph is in there and we can see her kissing a ring on silus hand and silus placing his hand on her head as if blessing
steph then exits the office and approaches lilly and jones her face is flushed with excitement
do you know who he is
thats brother silus
they say one day he will lead the brotherhood
hes a great man
i think i hear choir music
steph flashes jones a resentful look
do you respect anything
my old mum goes to church four times a week and gives blood
shes happy as a lark
just dont expect me to kiss him thats all im telling you
cut to close on the enigmatic ring on silus finger
we see lilly is seated on one side of her desk silus on the other
lilly is staring at the ring then she studies a photostat in front of her
there is a picture of a man a rather perfect looking man
senior brother edgar
how long have you known about this
silus opposite lilly his perfect serene appearance an anathema in the grunge of the jamestown police station
he watches her very carefully listens to the way her finger taps the sheet in front of her the sound of her chair swiveling all the sounds very acute to
him she has a physical ease about her
a matter of weeks
continuing is there something wrong
lilly stops smiling
for the first time she is still
covering up two murders
and no ones worried
if me or one of the people in jamestown did that theyd be in the hell house with the key thrown away
it seems the church is able to do whatever it wants
youre right to not like it
it is political
lilly becomes more interested at this at the bald honesty of the statement
continuing we thought we could find brother edgar ourselves
we were wrong
but now any debate is pointless
lilly stares at him
there is already something between them even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf
she nods accepting his point
continuing the greatest danger is if this were to become public knowledge
wouldnt want anyone criticizing the church i suppose
its more than that captain
this is about prejudice or rather the nature of it
as a female surely you would understand
how many other captains in this borough are female
how are your actions judged the same or differently from the men
lilly stares at silus he is an incredible being
if a white man kills then he is just a killer
if a black man kills then all black men are suspect
that is the nature of prejudice
those who are different are grouped together
if only one brother does a bad thing then all brothers are suspect because we are different
and then what would this world be like if there was no hope
lilly nods acknowledging the truth of it
so what do you suggest
first there is something you should hear
cut to scummy large briefing room
there are seven cops in here perched on desks and chairs
jones dominic frank plus four others
lilly is also there
so is silus sitting perfectly still calm
several of the cops look at him suspiciously
ok ok quiet down
everyone nods and shuts up as lilly stands in front of the men
continuing gentlemen theres no other way to put it
we have only days to find the suspect
there are guffaws from most of the policemen
theres no chance
not a hope in hell
we dont even know where to begin
lilly is angry
there is silence in the room
lilly seems more angry than she should be
continuing what you are about to hear will not leave this room
continuing i would suggest anyone with a weak stomach leave now
no one moves
they all stare at lilly
continuing this is brother silus
she motions to silus who rises watching the glares from the cops who eye him like a suspect
thank you captain
could we have the plate
an old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned off
the projector sprays an image up on the wall
the face of a killer before he became one the serene gaze of a brother
continuing senior brother edgar
until weeks ago he was a trusted and talented theologian and scientist
whatd he do
he was personally responsible for developing the most recent influenza antivirals
it is because of him that most of you are alive today
his behavior appeared normal
photos come up
continuing the victims
all in their early s but beyond that no obvious connection
continuing there is no precedent for brother edgars behavior
no brother has ever taken a human life not in the years since we began
our role has been to preserve and maintain the human life
not take it
next hell be wanting an fucking medal
silus stares directly at jones now
their eyes lock
silus continues perfectly calm
what i am saying to you is that brother edgars behavior is aberrant
we cont dont understand it
and therefore its difficult to predict
the only thing we know is where he will strike next
how do you know
silus moves to the desk next to him
he passes something to another cop who now sits at the desk
we see lilly now
the look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and shes not looking forward to it
we see what silus gave the cop
an audio tape
the cop places the tape in a tape deck
he then switches it on
he then turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs static hiss to two big speakers
we see the faces of the cops all listening in the dim light coming from the slide projector
above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise
it is a wet sound
like a cat would make if it were lapping up milk
an another sound
like an animal moaning with pleasure
we see the cops some of them are beginning to twig
and there is another noise
it is a man moaning
please dont hurt me
we see jones and dominic
their glares say it all
and then another voice
off like to a lover quiet
off i said shut up
then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be described as sounding like a dog killing something
jones springs out of his seat
jones sit down
why are we listening to this
jones stands there enraged
dominic pulls him down back into his chair
all the cops are appalled by what they have heard
and then a voice
now youre quiet
we can hear edgar moving around
continuing off did you hear that silus
i hope so
we see silus listening as intently as everyone else
continuing off the next one will be tomorrow
there is a square bridge square its called
i will take the next one from there
you should try harder this time
please try harder
more moving around then the sound on the tape cuts out
we are left with only tape hiss
everyone stares at silus
he sent this to you
we share the same mother
there is a bond
the cops all stare at silus emotionless response
there will be two teams
frank i want you and abernathy up in the buildings around bridge square
continuing ill lead the other team with dominic jones and queens imperial guard in support
no guns batons only
you heard me
hes to be taken alive
it has rained
the small square is dimly lit
at its center is a small park with distorted trees
and a rundown playground
a rusty swing creaks
we see a figure there
it is lilly
she watches the rusty swing creak
then she looks up to the surrounding buildings
we tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight stories high like the others around the square it is an apartment building
there is movement at the very top
cut to pov from the top of the building observing lilly below enter a black unmarked van
then there is buzz from an rt
we reveal pov belongs to silus
lilly is in a police van
jones and dominic are there with her both of them trying to come to grips with the strange stun weapons theyve been given
and there are three huge dark eyed soldiers there dressed in the ominous black uniform of the queens imperial guard cocking their electric batons which fizz in the half light
we cut between lilly in the van and silus on the roof
silus surveys the scene
he can see an imperial guard sniper over the square on the roof of a building
below in the street we can see the silhouettes of several brothers unmoving watchful sentinels
its getting late
he will come
well sit tight
lilly closes the com
jones is staring at her
this is a dud
lilly ignores jones and talks into the rt again
cut to frank is inspecting a stairwell of the building
he has abernathy with him
he talks into his rt
not a thing
off check each floor again
frank motions to abernathy who is already sighing
you heard her
once more for the empire
low angle from the floor of the two men beginning to climb the stairs their guns out
the shot stays where it is
we can see the stairs and the wall
the soundtrack is almost dead quiet apart from the buzzing flouro above us
and then the camera begins to advance like a pov heading for the wall ahead
it reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up to the roof
as it climbs we can see a ventilation shaft in the corner with no grill
the camera approaches it and moves into the shaft continuous
the shot continues to track through the man sized shaft
as we move through the shaft turning corners going up floors we pass grills
some of them show light coming from the apartments within
we can hear an argument in one room
a crying child in the next
a tv blaring in another playing porno
but mostly the rooms are dark
and as we move up and along there is a scuttling noise growing louder as if we are approaching it
then the noise stops
the camera halts stares down the long ventilation shaft
the camera starts to move again and then turns a corner to run into the leering face of edgar the vampire his teeth bared his eyes reflecting in the half
then he smiles
cut to a rat staring back at edgar
the rat turns and streaks off back whence it came
a slight smile appears on edgars face a smile that can chill the blood in your veins
then he begins to move forward
we hear his breathing low but excited
he moves with the precision and strength of an insect
his eyes glisten and reflect light like an animals
his skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft
cut to his pov approaching a grill
a subdued light comes through it
the pov approaches and sees into the apartment below
a woman around attractive brushing her hair
she has just had a shower
cut to the shaft
we see edgars hand enter shot
his hand grips the bottom of the grill and tries to open it
it doesnt budge
cut to inside the room the woman turns and looks up at the grill
she thinks shes heard something
she stares waits
she gets up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall
she places a chair under it then gets up on it standing on tip toes trying to see if theres anything behind the grill
her hand reaches out and tries the grill to see if its secure
then she leans closer to it
her face pressed right up against it
cut to edgars white face lurching into shot
cut to his pov
he is now looking through a different grill
this time there is a young man inside an apartment
and again that chilling smile
we see the man again who gets up and preens himself in front of a mirror
close on edgars eyes devouring the sight of this pumped up flesh
the young man exits the room going into a bathroom
we see edgars hand trying to open the grill
cut to frank and abernathy are on fifth floor finishing a sweep of it
as they move they hear a crash
then another crash coming from the floor up
then a scream
they look at each other then begin to run to the stairwell as frank talks into his rt
cut to frank
off hes on the sixth floor
hes on the sixth floor
everyone fires into action and begins to exit the van
silus watches from his vantage point
he can see lilly and her team below rushing into the building adjacent to him
and then he sees through one of the windows on the sixth floor the flashes of gunfire
cut to handheld camera with lilly and her crew rushing up the stairwell up up
cut to lilly and her crew entering the hall
they are confronted with a view of the long hall
halfway down there is a door with blood smeared on it
we can see abernathy lying in a pool of blood outside the door
the cops stop
a door opens close to them
a large greasy man pokes his head out the door and gets the cops guns on him immediately
lilly motions with her hand
get back inside
the man returns and closes the door
the imperial guards now swing into action
they move forward towards the room to the closed door
lilly and her crew follow
the imperial guards get ready outside the door batons ready
one of them motions for lilly and her crew to wait
jones is nearest them
he goes down on one knee
dominic moves past them and positions himself on the other side
lilly kneels where she is
then the imperial guards kick open the door and enter
lilly waits watching
theres no sound
dominic begins to move forward then enter the door to the apartment his baton raised
jones now moves forward keeping his eyes on the door
there is no sound coming from the room
cut to lilly kneeling in the hall
also staring at the door
too late to realize the door next to her is opening
before she can react shes staring into the face of edgar the eyes the bloody mouth
edgar is on her in an instant moving with ferocious speed whipping her like a rag doll into the room
meanwhile jones is edging towards the room dominic entered
cut to lilly trapped held by edgar who stares at her
then in one swift movement he lurches down tearing her neck with his teeth
she cries out
in the hall jones is looking into the room dominic went into
the lights come on
the room is empty
just the cops and franks bloody corpse on the floor
jones turns to see lilly but shes not there
the hallway is empty
he sees the door lilly was pulled through
then looks down
blood is seeping from under the door
cut to lilly being embraced by edgar she cant do anything
then a loud crash on the door as if someone is trying to break in
edgar stops feeding stares at lilly
youre so strong
then another crash on the door
edgar drops lilly
he propels himself towards a ventilation grill on the wall
cut to jones and the cops kicking the door in
it swings open to show lilly on the floor
jones stoops down
jones gets close to lilly starts squeezing the side of her neck trying to stop the arterial blood from squirting her life away
continuing oh shit shit
dominic enters and sees the scene
he yells into his rt
the other cops are now scanning the room
meanwhile dominic has found the ventilation shaft blood smeared around the opening
continuing hes in the ventilation shaft
jones then stares down at lilly pressing one hand against the wound
close on lilly going into shock
shes fucking dying
at that moment silus appears at the door
silus stares at lilly bleeding to death in jones arms
silus immediately bends to her
with his free hand jones pulls out a vicious knife which he points at silus
continuing get away from her
but silus ignores the knife and moves closer to lilly
continuing get away or ill stick you
do you want me to save her
continuing she is dying
jones backs the knife away
silus whips his hand to the blade of the knife slashing his wrist blood immediately issuing from the wound
he presses his bleeding wrist to lillys mouth
at first resistant lilly begins to suck at the wrist
jones is appalled
silus then leans close to lilly and whispers in her ear
all the other noises in the soundtrack drop out
stop fighting now
fall back fall back
slowly she does
silus removes his wrist from lillys mouth
she is silent comatose
a medical team now scramble through the door pushing past silus and the bloody jones and begin to work on lilly
for a moment silus and jones stare at each other
then silus turns to the ventilation shaft in the corner
he closes his eyes
hes getting away
the cops are silent
stare at silus who opens his eyes
continuing hes going up
we move in on silus ear
into his ear
the long shaft and in the distance edgar approaching his eyes reflective moving with the speed of an insect through the shaft his bloody mouth
cut to silus now also in the shaft his gun out moving forward
he turns a corner
the shaft is empty
he waits watching listening
he hears a scuffling
cut to edgar the same turning a corner to see silus approaching him
silus raises his gun
a puff emits from the end of his gun
the projectile hurtles towards edgar who just ducks out of the way in time
there is a grill next to him
he smashes it with his foot
cut to silus approaching the junction turning the corner just in time to see edgars legs pass through the hole
we see jones move into the hall looking at the roof searching
then he looks at lillys blood which covers his hands
he pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own dangerous looking gun
cut to a door bursts open
edgar in slow motion crashes through the door and into the hall
the sound track is a huge driving slab of choral orchestral music
the camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall his momentum carrying him diving towards the camera
cut to silus enters the empty hall
then he sees in the roof a manhole cover slightly ajar
cut to silus pov as he climbs into the crawl space its ceiling following the pitch of the roof
it is dark and extends for a long way
silus squats in the sub light like a beautifully dressed animal
what he cant see are two blinking eyes above him in the rafters of the dark roof
it is edgar
edgar drops silus turns too late as the weight of edgar drives into him sending both of them through the floor of the ceiling cavity and down
to fall a dead weight crashing down onto the floor of the hall in a hail of debris
edgar is on top of silus and strangling him and then he stops and turns
he moves just in time to avoid a bullet from jones gun which glances edgars cheek sending off a wisp of burnt colored smoke
cut to jones
gun smoking standing at the other end of the hall
edgar screams the scream of something from the animal kingdom
then turns and runs
cut to silus rising pulling out his gun
jones points his gun but silus is obscuring his view
cut to edgar runs away down the hall
then on silus
very still very silent
close on his finger pressing the trigger
the camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see the projectile entering the guns chamber and the hammer igniting it
the projectile explodes out the end of the gun
high angle of the projectile flying towards its target the ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective surface cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the side of the
then edgar camera tracking back at high speed
slow move in on silus cool gray eyes
the projectile stabs into edgars back the claws springing forward to hook onto edgars flesh we see the fluid within the transparent projectile flow into edgar see edgars eyes widen
see his pov of the approaching window then
edgars head implants itself in the wall below the window the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over edgars numb stare
in the background silus stands
we see jones walking forward gun still pointing heading towards edgar
silus turns and steps in front of him
get out of my way
jones stares at silus and contemplates firing
he killed lilly
silus doesnt move
he stares calmly at jones
jones points the gun in silus face
jones lowers his gun
we end close on silus serene face
voices in the dark quiet at first then growing more frightening then the hint of a face in negative edgar then screams like the screams of an animal on the
and another face alternating with edgars
high angle of lilly asleep lying on a hospital bed
we drift down
again there is rain pounding against the window
her body flinches she is in a dream a nightmare
as we drift closer to her her eyes open staring straight up and then to the left
then grim recognition
cut to low angle on silus standing above her examining the tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip
they say its like an animal bite
he slowly sits on the bed
continuing i want to thank you
we all caught edgar
i dont mean that
the blood they say it saved my life
is it true that people who go to church are given your blood
sometimes the rituals call for it
some say they have visions from it
that it restores their health
silus regards her and she him
she reaches out and touches his hand almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin
she turns over his hand to reveal the wrist the scars are almost gone from where silus cut himself
continuing healed already
in some ways my body is like a human embryo
the cells regenerate quickly
it is why we live so long
will someone come for you
she releases his hand
i dont have one
not any more
my husband was quick
but my daughter mary her little body fought it for a long time
so i just waited
but then you realize how cruel hope is
and you just want it to end
not to stop her suffering but to stop my own
i am sorry
do we seem pathetic to you
worn down by nature
but you fight back
were good at that
lilly stares up into silus serene face
i think yours will be a good life to watch lilly
lilly tries to smile as silus turns and walks off down the ward
close on lilly who looks grim
then she turns to the window
rain again blowing hard against the pane
as silus leaves the ward he passes jones whos been standing there as if hes been watching them
then jones shoves a newspaper into silus hands
youre more human than i thought
jones unceremoniously pushes past silus and moves into lillys room
silus reads the newspaper
the story tells of the recent deaths in jamestown explaining that it was an insane man who thought he was a brother
the mans picture is shown it is actually one of the victims
through the window in the doorway silus watches jones approach lilly
we are close on his enigmatic face
a ext brotherhood building foyer day establisher a we tilt down a grand building
a huge foyer shinning marble floors
all done in perfect taste
we see silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator
the elevator doors close
silus enters the room
there are several technicians at work at a console again the organic nouveaux stylings of the brothers
augustus is also there
next to him someone who is obviously human
his lack of perfection stands out the balding hair dark rings under his eyes
silus joins them
you know professor liepsky
silus shakes the professors hand
we see the hands touching then slide apart with a wisping sound that makes the professor wince a little
how is he
see for yourself
he taps one of the men at the console on the shoulder
the man hits a button and we see that in front of the console there is a huge glass window and beyond it a room which is now lit
edgar is in there
and edgar is not pleased
even from here his glowering stare penetrates everyone in the room
from this distance we cant make out much beyond the fact that edgar is seated in a chair in an otherwise plain white room
around his chair is a strange brace of sorts that seems to be holding edgar in place
is the brace necessary
he decapitated a guard as they brought him in
even though he was sedated
he said he will drink us all dry
silus now turns to the professor
continuing hes become infected
the professor looks to augustus as if worried hes said to much
go on brother silus will soon be part of the inner circle of the brotherhood
he should know this
cut to pov approaching a curved glass and metal door
on the door we see the words biological containment area
day establisher pov continues
there are beds in here
in them strapped down young woman
they are all insane monstrous the whites of their eyes are blood red
we see silus observe them but there is no horror in his eyes just compassion
he moves to one of the woman and slowly grasps her hand
she lurches towards him
if she wasnt restrained she would try to kill you
dont worry its only transmissible through their blood
we designed it that way
silus quietly turns to the professor
edgar was experimenting with the virus that created you
it was sanctioned by the government
since when do they sanction such things
since not one brother has been born in years
and never a female of your kind from which we could breed
and we need to breed more brothers
you give the world hope
to the people youre like gods walking the earth
this is what edgar was doing silus
trying to genetically control the birth of brothers
silus is now turns back to the poor creature on the bed
and edgar was successful
each of these women carried a brother for a time
but the virus
most of them have died and these will die soon
silus places his hand on the poor creatures head blessing her
continuing and edgar may be the first brother to ever die
continuing before that his brain will wither like these women
containment will be the issue
cut to a door slamming behind silus he is in a strangely eerily lit cubicle
off the police officer
did he infect her with this
she was lucky
but it is in edgars blood
it always will be
and another door in front of silus clicks then slides open to reveal
edgar sitting in the chair
he immediately turns to the door his eyes burrowing straight into silus
silus moves forward
we track silus pov toward edgar and the reality of his predicament is revealed
there are metal rods extending from the cage around him
two at the sides
two from the front
they strategically pointed at edgars chest and sides
if he was to try to get up they would pierce him
hello my brother
we can now see edgar for the first time in something approaching a normal state
he looks similar to silus perhaps not quite so perfect
he radiates confident primeval power less a man captured than an animal waiting
edgar is smiles
he shifts a little we see the rods piercing his flesh
do you like what theyve done for me silus
he moves again as if enjoying it
you are sick
we will help you if we can
i am being what i was meant to be
how can you help me from that
or do you want to tame me
animal or vegetable are those the two choices silus
edgar leans closer to silus
continuing i want to share the feeling with you
to feel their blood flow until every last drop is yours until that weak pointless little pump finally stops
they are staring at each other very intently now
edgar smiles gently
continuing the one i had the police woman
she was so strong
i found it hard to leave her
continuing is she dead
i will have her again
for perhaps the first time we see a real hint of anger on silus face
you wont touch her
edgar looks at his brother for a moment
edgars features are a paradox almost sympathy for silus followed by understanding
then he smiles
youve chosen to watch over her
you want her dont you
i can see it in your eyes
you are like me
silus control has returned now
i will pray for your cure brother
silus then turns and leaves
i wont be able to forgive you for this you know
in fact when i get out of here
he moves violently blood seeping from his wounds now
continuing i will make you see
i will show you the way
i will see you drink your little police woman right through
by now frightening music has hummed into existence
silus has paused at the door to the cell
without looking back he passes through the door leaving edgar to his prison
edgar slowly turns back to the window in front of him
he sees himself reflected in it
the camera moves into edgars eyes
the lights go out
all we are left with are his strange reflective eyes
a smooth white walled cell
flash edits of edgar
standing posing balancing literally on his fingertips doing sensuous slow gymnastic yoga
his hair has changed so we know time has passed
finally he stands there poised tensile steel
he slowly draws his finger nails against the shining floor of the cell it almost looks like hes sharpening them
a tube comes from his arm for taking blood samples
then edgar begins to run directly at the glass window of the console room and then dives for it smashing his head against it blood and saliva left smeared there
behind the glass window the console operators jump
i dont like it when he does that
scolding edgar into microphone you stop that or well use the gas
we see edgar slowly pulling himself up blood and bruising apparent on his face
we zoom in close to the glass see edgars infected blood run down it until it congeals a little caught in a tiny almost imperceptible hairline fracture
rain on the streets
a man covered in tattoos an affluent hood is in a doorway snorting snuff dominic jones and several other cops emerge from hiding places pointing their guns at the man
who puts his hands up
hand held cameras follow several other cops and lilly as they move into the building again catching various hoods unaware
lilly moves forward quickly down a hallway and finds what she is looking for
in a room she discovers a harem of prostitutes none of them older than ten years old
she stares at their doll like faces then lowers her gun
we see lilly the scars from edgars attack now healed but still apparent on her neck
her hair is shorter she seems more worn down
jones appears on her shoulder
take them away from here
jones nods as lilly walks off
you dont feel like a drink
but lilly doesnt respond she just walks off
jones watches her leave
then he stares at the round faces of the children in front of him something approaching compassion there
continuing now my girls anyone hungry
lilly exits the building into the rain wrapping herself up against it
then she stops feels shes being watched
she looks up at the surrounding buildings
but theres nothing there
she pulls out an amulet with the symbol of the brotherhood on it from under her jacket and then after a beat kisses it a little smile comes to warms
her lips against the cold
cut to pov looking down on lilly as she walks away
its silus watching her quietly from the shadows his eyes reflective orbs in the night
edgars cell is very dimly lit
edgar is in front of the glass window to the console room
he is repeatedly banging is head against it
and his fingernails slide across the shiny surface has he simply gone insane
a voice comes over the tannoy
off if you dont stop that well use the gas
you hear me
edgar just continues to bang his forehead against the glass it drums eerily
cut to we track through lillys apartment silently
we enter the lounge to see lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange looking valve powered globular television like device
we track ominously up behind her
off i knocked
lilly turns to jones
you nearly gave me a heart attack
steph now emerges from the kitchen dressed in a t shirt and shorts and carrying some food
jones looks at her coldly
whats this then
lilly and steph smile at the inference jones is beginning to draw
my apartment was condemned keep your hair on whats left of it
meanwhile lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray images emitting from the television
the ascension through the ranks of the church has been fast for brother silus
he will now be the highest ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the brotherhood
this is largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza pandemic
jones and lilly watch as silus is seen on the television in an interview
steph stares at the screen with awe she involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain around her neck it resembles a brothers ring
isnt he amazing
jones sneers under his breath
we move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and white tv screen
you have been an opponent of those who want an easing in the ban on genetic research
they would say youre denying legitimate research into a science that would change the world
the church does not deny the potential
only the motivations of those who want to exploit it
and the fact that we understand so little of its power
with the elimination of influenza are we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past
as she is saying this we are now close on the tvs speaker
we then begin tracking out
we reveal the speaker is not part of the tv but the speaker in edgars cell
edgar smiling coldly as he listens
as he listens he is gently gliding his finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair sharpening them
disease is part of nature it will always be a part of our lives
close on edgar
off brother silus confirmation ceremony will be held today in the sacred chapel of st
augustine where all the brotherhood will gather
edgar listens smiles
an ornate door ancient with strange beautiful dark symbols carved into the old wood like something out of a castle in prague
the doors open and we see a large chapel
and within the large dark interior lit by great long candles the brotherhood have gathered
they all stare at the camera which we reveal is silus pov
we see silus
unchanged still the perfect creature he has always been
but for now the suit has gone and instead he stands draped in fine ropes robes that carry his life on them achievements his rank which is now high
in the distance at an alter stands augustus
he is also in his gowns
a gong sounds and the brothers in unison with the music begin to chant it is eerie it sounds like tibetan monks
professor liepsky looking more aged worn enters the control room
alarms are sounding
at the console is a human male who looks terrified
i turned off the lights to try and calm him
liepsky hits a button and it floods edgars cell with light
edgar is right there staring at them his hands plastered over the glass window
he is covered in blood
in the background a bloody corpse on the floor
edgar bangs his head against the glass making liepsky flinch
on edgars forehead we see scars from this kind of repeated banging
continuing we gassed him as usual
we waited minutes
he must have held his breath
the look on liepskys face says it all
we see edgar
we had thought he was looking at the professor
but hes not his gaze is focused past the professor to the dimly seen back wall of the control room
on it is a schematic showing this room other rooms on the level the elevator shaft
edgar is talking it all in
silus on one knee before augustus
augustus now places a ceremonial sword at the back of silus neck then draws it gently across the skin
below a brother holds out a bowl to catch the drops of silus blood
the blood flows through them to us and we preserve them preserve the blood we are bound to protect
silus raises his head
we see his face
he takes the bowl drinks and then stands holding it up to the other brothers
let the blood be one and the two races join as the perfect creature
cut to close on edgar smiling
today my brother enters the history books professor
over the tannoy move back
after a moment edgar slowly walks backward in perfectly smooth movements
tonight all the brothers will be with him
a perfect day for me to celebrate
from the far wall edgar begins to glide forward first in slow motion then ramping up to full speed launching himself at the glass window
he bounces off it leaving blood and saliva there
the professor and the console operator share an unsettled glance
edgar slowly stands
he stares very intently at the glass window in front of him
we zoom in on the glass
the small hair line fracture we saw previously now begins to lengthen before our eyes
then he is forward at high velocity before anything else can happen smashing once more into the glass window this time shattering it into a thousand tiny pieces
horrified the console operator begins to make an escape
but edgar is on him before theyre a few paces towards the door
edgars long fingers sink into his neck like the flesh and bone were clay
the professor makes it to the door pulls himself through and shuts it but on edgars hand
edgar doesnt flinch but kicks the door open
the professor is now scrambling half falling in slow motion as edgar advances
as normal motion returns he kicks liepsky in the head the sound of impact has a nasty fatality to it
cut to edgar
a door further down the hall is being unbolted
edgar immediately runs towards it then launches himself at it his fingers extended like knives which enter the eyes of a guard whos coming through the doorway
the guard falls back on another two guards behind him
a round from a shotgun goes off taking a small chunk from edgars side but its nothing more than a bee sting to him
his speed and precision is that of a creature who knows he only has one chance
he kicks the second guard under the chin instantly snapping his neck while flicking the third in the eyes with his sharpened fingernails
this guard falls his eyes leaking orbs
edgar crouches like a dark god of destruction a siren sounding the lights all going off then flicking to red emergency lights
edgars eyes reflect in the half light
then he bares his teeth
at the end of the hallway he can hear the elevator arriving on this floor
cut to the gleaming surfaces of the ground floor of the brotherhood building
we hear the elevator begin to arrive
we pan off this to a desk where a receptionist sits
cut to the receptionist shes trying desperately to place a call
we see the shadow from a figure cast over her and she turns and looks up fear making her shake now
cut to edgar staring down at her
you wont be taking any more calls today
cut to slow steadicam along the underground halls
we see the bodies of edgars victims being cleaned up by personnel
in the distance we see the door to edgars cell open
cut to silus observing the scene
the lighting is intermittent flickering
augustus is standing next to silus the weird light of the hallway reflecting in his eyes
now he carries this thing out into the world
can you imagine what will happen if he infects others
or if the experiments were known
we are left with silus beautiful reflective eyes
the question becomes what will he do next
he said he would kill us all
but especially the police officer
cut to flashing lights of subway trains screaming through subway tunnels wheels screeching as metal grinds on metal
the streets are flooding like bangkok in the monsoon rain pouring off awnings that hang out over the street
the streets are full prostitutes drug peddlers apothecary shops the industrial revolution low down and dirty
there is a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like punk rockers
several people are alighting from a subway exit the exit has jamestown brougham on a nouveaux styled sign that might remind you of a paris or barcelona metro only dirtier
we see lilly in the distance in her dark jacket emerge from the subway
she begins the short walk to her apartment
the streets are crowded and there are plenty of maori people in this area so theres plenty of food stalls the air is filled with the sound of evening prayers
lilly stops at one of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables
a maori man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local dialect
she buys a live eel
cut to across the street in a doorway we see a very weedy sick looking guy this is freddy
standing next to him is a prostitute swaying from the effects of laudanum
come on governor you going to pay me or not
soon enough my cherub
ive not finished with you yet
he sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler then pockets it licks his lips and begins heading off down the street the drunk prostitute dragged along
cut to again lilly from a distance walking along the street which is more deserted now carrying a bag full of groceries
as she walks we begin to hear voices violent arguing
lilly approaches an alleyway the raised voices becoming louder
she slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a revolver
she edges into the alleyway
lillys pov down the alleyway
it seems empty
the pov moves in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can see freddy
he is standing over a woman who cowers shes plainly a prostitute
freddy points a gun at her head
youve been ripping me off
i should blow your dirty little brains out
put the gun down now
and now we see its not lilly weve been watching but steph
she points her gun at freddy
freddy turns to steph
he slowly raises his arms
im complying officer see
put the gun on the ground and step away
im doing it
freddy puts the gun down
the prostitute on the ground now scrambles to her feet and heads towards steph
she gives freddy the finger then heads off
to the prostitute wait
to freddy down
right now down on the ground
freddy gets down
im getting wet now
low angle on steph approaching
behind her a figure is descending the wall behind him
steph is over freddy now
hes staring up at her
he can see that a shape has appeared behind steph
edgar his eyes gleaming
steph pulls out some handcuffs
continuing put your hands behind your back
anything you say
but before steph can move forward edgar has her gun hand in a vice like grip
she cries out in pain as her wrist disintegrates
as a reflex she stamps on edgars foot and kicks him in the groin with her other
he does not flinch
he smashes steph into a down pipe on the wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face
we then see edgars face at her shoulder
nice to meet you again
edgar pulls back the jacket at stephs neck to find no scars
he pulls stephs face towards him brutally staring at her profile
he then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls unconscious to the ground
you brought me the wrong one
does it matter ones as good as the next
edgars stare makes freddy shut up and avert his eyes
edgar then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into the unconscious stephs mouth making her gag
continuing you promised me some of that
freddys licking his lips
edgar studies freddy then raises his arm
freddy just stares
we see the tube on edgars arm that connects to his veins
and in a moment freddy has latched onto it and is sucking like some kind of human leech
what do you see freddy
can you see your future
for a moment edgar strokes freddys hair then rips the tube away
freddy moves forward but is pushed back by edgar
dont be a greedy little pig freddy
you have to earn more
close on edgar his repellent features under the hood
he looks up
far above through the falling rain past the high rise slum around them we see the moon hanging like a pearly crescent in the sky
the moon is slowly obscured by clouds
continuing we have more to do
cut to we see a figure exiting the subway
this time it is lilly following the same path that steph took
making her way through the crowded street
the rain has given way to a fine mist
then as lilly moves forward she senses something that feeling again that she is being watched
she stands for a moment as people push past looks up at the gothic victorian buildings that loom out of the drifting mist
but there is nothing
lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist casting glances at the odd passerby
then ahead of her there is one pedestrian in particular taller than the rest wearing a great hooded jacket who stands out
he is immediately suspicious to lilly
he is slowly moving through the crowd towards her
from under the hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figures eyes an intense stare hidden in the shadows
the man now puts his hand in his pocket as if hes reaching for something
lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket her gun a cold hard presence in her hand
she stares ahead at the approaching figure who has now stopped after bumping into a pedestrian
lilly continues forward closer closer
from under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead catches hers for a moment
the man now begins to approach her his hand pulling something from his jacket going for something
lilly immediately pulls her gun
the mist beads on the shining barrel of her gun
the man is raising his hand towards her
put your hands where i can see them
the man now lurches forward his hand rising towards lilly her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun as the man looms closer
and then he is gone
cut to the man slamming against the wet wall of a building grasping at the hands that now threaten to throttle him
and we see silus his hands on the mans throat and for only the second time we see anger in silus eyes
people in the street scatter as more brothers emerge with guns pointed
and lilly shaking pointing her gun at the man silus is holding
on the ground next to the man she sees what he had in his hand
asking people to come to church service a picture of a brother priest serenely beaming out from it
meanwhile the man that silus has is gagging on the ground silus hand still on his throat
holy brother please
lilly grabs silus shoulder
let him go
she shows silus the pamphlet
continuing hes harmless
let him go
the man now pulls back his hood
he is black his large watery eyes stare up in awe at silus
he grabs silus hand which now relaxes and draws silus ring to his lips kissing it in tears
ive offended you
we see silus dark stare
then silus reaches out and places his hand on the mans head
you are divine
it is the world that offends me
silus rises the parishioner just lays there in awe
silus now turns to lilly who is on his shoulder
and now lilly realizes for the first time that it is silus
whats going on
we then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the rain
the door opens and jones emerges taking in both lilly and silus
a grim smile of realization comes to jones face
he pulls something from his jacket
cut to stephs id is tossed down on a table
off a shopkeeper heard yelling
went to see found this
jones tosses down a photo
it is freddy looking suitably scummy in a police identikit photo
continuing she identified this lovely citizen
we thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy
i guess we were wrong
silus stands by the window lights make patterns on his face
it is edgar
and now hes got steph
why does he want her
she is not what he was after
we see lilly slowly getting it
steph was staying with me
she was wearing my coat
it was me he was after
silus now turns slowly moves towards her coming out of the shadows
lilly finds it hard to return his gaze involuntarily touches her neck where it is scarred from edgars attack
jones is watching all this very carefully
he will come for you lilly
right then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place
shooters on the roofs
and when he comes we blow his fucking brains out
he will know
he will see and hear it
lilly is staring at stephs id
it has to be me
thats what he wants
its the only chance stephs got
what are you talking about shes probably dead already
and we cant make it too hard
he has to be able to get in
he cant suspect anything
jones is shaking his head
silus just stares at lilly
continuing thats the way it will be
im the bait
close on silus
we are in a large derelict warehouse detritus and stacked and smashed wooden crates
music is playing somewhere in the distance from a phonograph
we track through the space
daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high above creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from the dust
we pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high walled maze
music emits from a stereo loud
we continue to move down a hall
through the detritus towards a door
a hand opens the door
in the corner of the room huddled chained to the floor is steph
she does not look good
in fact she looks very sick
there are tubes coming off her arm
freddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from her arm
there are small taps on the tubes
he turns them on
blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already stained red
as he turns it off steph shivers her eyes open
the whites of her eyes are blood red she is sick
she speaks weakly
please im sick
she reaches for freddy but he pulls away
freddys not looking too hot either
dont fucking touch me
he picks up the half filled cup and leaves
steph stares after him
tears welling in her eyes beginning to shake now moving against the chains that bind her
but they stay fast
freddy moves into the large warehouse space the music still echoing
freddy looks around searching for edgar
his voice echoes through the empty space
continuing whereve you gone now
a pov wavering slightly the hint of a whispering breath
we see lillys apartment
the shot zooms in at high velocity searching the windows zooming in here to check the lock on this window then on that
then the shot wildly pans and twists to the street below
again it zooms in to the entrance of the building to a couple walking past in the night as if searching for any sign of something out of the ordinary
we can hear the couples voices talking about inane things
cut to edgars face in the shadows
his eyes reflective his whole being readied and concentrating
he closes his eyes
we move around to end close on his ear the soundtrack becoming stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and distinct
one sound in particular a kind of metal sound scratching slightly growing louder
edgars eyes open
cut to a zoom speeding towards lillys bedroom window then swooping at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down
and there gently moving in the night air a partially open window the latch grinding in the breeze
cut to a whiz pan pov ending on the lounge of lillys apartment as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their head as if alerted
all the lights are out
we slowly begin to move forward dipping and gliding silently into the hallway
slowly we approach a doorway and creep into
we can see lilly lying on the bed her skin alabaster in the moonlight that comes through the window blinds
closer closer until we halt above her
cut closer to see lilly asleep her hand grips her service revolver which protrudes from under her pillow
we see silus standing above her his eyes glisten in the sub light
as he watches lilly moves as if shes having a dream her hand grips the gun beneath her pillow
silus slowly bends down close to her
then he reaches out as if to gently wake her then stops as lilly stirs
she turns curling up into the fetal position
silus is confronted with the old scars from edgars attack
for a moment silus stares at her
then very quietly smoothly he moves his head down very close to her arm
he sniffs it as you would something very delicate very complex
then he closes his eyes
we see lilly her arm
silus slowly enters frame moves his face close to lilly moves along her arm as if taking in her scent
slowly her arm raises as his face moves up her body to her neck her hand now embracing silus head
closer as his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face turns towards him his dark lips and hers are close
cut to silus back where he was smelling her arm
his eyes open and he moves back a little as if shocked by the daydream he has just indulged in
we see lilly as she was before curled up in the fetal position
then a sound
silus immediately pivots his gun immediately pointed at the figure who stands silhouetted in the doorway
what are you doing
the camera immediately drops through the floor of lillys apartment to the apartment below to find
edgar standing in the apartment below immediately freezing
we zoom into his ear as he listens
flash cuts of sound and image a large man turning in his bed and groaning a tap drips in an apartment a fluorescent colored mosquito catcher vaporizing a mosquito with
a zing then a womans lips whispering
what is it
cut to silus above lilly his hand up to silence her jones stock still in the doorway
bang silus rushes to the window of the apartment ripping it open pointing his gun below
but there is no one there
then silus spots it
on the floor below the window is open a curtain gently wafts out of the window in the breeze
silus turns to jones and lilly
silus immediately drops out of the window
cut to lilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see silus dead on the pavement below but the street is empty
and then she sees it the window below her apartment is open
lilly gun extended moving forward towards her apartment door jones behind her trying to grab her
get back here lilly
but lilly shoves him off opens the door and moves into the hall and waits
she hears more smashing from the other side of the building
she turns to jones
and shes off smashing the apartment door in front of her with her foot and moving into the apartment towards the window beyond
jones can only curse lift his gun and move after her
lillys pov crashing through the apartment and reaching the window pulling it open to see
lillys pov of the city below
we see her search with her eyes and then she sees it
cut to lillys pov closer looking down on edgar running over a roof
cut to edgar running towards us as we track back then he launches himself
cut to low angle edgar jumping from above us to land almost on the camera stopping himself by grabbing iron piping protruding from the side of the building
edgar turns smiles thinking hes escaped then shock comes across his face
cut to edgars pov as silus flies through the air and crashes straight into the camera
silus hands go straight for edgars throat stopping edgar from falling
the two brothers eyes lock
you saved me
then edgars smile
he pushes off the wall with his legs sending both of them tumbling over the railing
we see them fall silus hitting a railing which sends him spinning out of control whilst edgar manages to clasp onto it
cut to silus pov tumbling wildly out of control heading for the ground finally coming to a jarring stop the view of the alleyway upside down
we now reveal silus only just conscious caught in wire netting hanging upside down in the alleyway
and there landing is edgar poised watching
edgar slowly approaches so that he is near
he bends down to silus
continuing when will you admit it
youre just like me
edgars nose is bleeding
he dabs some on his fingers then raises his hand to silus
continuing maybe you need some encouragement
he brings the dripping blood closer to silus closer
then an explosion the sound of bullets whistling through the air
then edgar is gone
cut to lilly and jones entering the alleyway to find silus still hanging from the railing
to jones get him down
lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for edgar
she turns and gives him a final quick look
if he escapes then steph is dead
just follow me when you can hurry
cut to lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway water plops and dribbles from leaking pipes
she swings her gun towards movement water crashing out of a pipe
lillys shaking terrified but she keeps on going
and then another sound and she swings her gun to find edgar standing in the shadows waiting
the little policewoman
edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires the bullet going through the flesh of edgars arm his arm now smoking
continuing i said dont move
where is she wheres the girl
edgar can only smile
oh ive killed her already
then he moves she fires but hes too fast spinning diving in an instant he has the gun twisting it and lillys arm behind her back
she fires once twice the bullets and smoke rising up from edgars side
he twists harder the gun then falling to the ground
edgar is now behind her
he moves his face close to hers
continuing has he tasted you yet little policewoman
lilly tries to twist out of his grasp
continuing hes just the same as me you know it you can feel it too
hes nothing like you
edgars face twists into a smile
we will see
you will be my tool
a cat hissing screeching
cut to silus and jones entering the alleyway the cat tearing away from them in fright
jones moves forward and we tilt down to see lillys gun lying on the wet cobblestones smoke wisping from the barrel
jones stoops down and picks up the gun then turns to silus
after a beat jones throws the gun at silus head
silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the cobblestones
you happy now
cut to close on freddys face looking at himself in a mirror
hes pulling back his eyelid his eyes are bloodshot and hes sweating
freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see edgar silhouetted in the bathroom doorway
you scared the shit out of me
hey the police woman
shes real sick
to tell the truth i dont feel so hot myself
edgar approaches still silhouetted
i want you to take her and put her where theyll find her
but im sick
shes given me something
edgar moves incredibly fast we cant quite see what he has done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in freddys chest
we see freddys face stunned deathly white
what have i said to you
freddy falls leaving edgars hand in mid air we cant see clearly but it likes frighteningly like he has one of freddys internal organs in his hand
continuing i hate arguments
cut to close on a pendant the symbol of the brothers
we pull out to reveal steph very sick now
edgar is has her wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit alley
ahead of him is a street we can see several passersby
edgar sits steph up against the wall of the alley propped up
she really is sick
edgar looks at her for a moment
then after consideration takes her hands and crosses them and places an envelope in her limp hands
happy with the composition he moves off
cut to a close high angle on steph looking up her bloodshot dazed eyes staring blankly
we drift up and away from her
already the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her
there are several nurses running towards us they turn and move down a hallway
we reveal jones and dominic
they move to the nurses station and jones flashes his id
stephanie richards you just brought her in
and then a scream
blood curdling the sound of someone insane screaming their lungs out hurling abuse
we see the faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them who points down the hall where the noise is coming from
the cops move off
the nurse then sees someone else arrive
she raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it
thank god youre here
we see who has entered
it is silus
near him there are several people sick
they look sick like steph and freddy looked
cut to jones and the dominic move through an anteroom
nursing staff and doctors are madly running about
the screaming we heard before punctuates the noisy clutter of medical procedures
jones approaches a door it has the words level isolation unit on it
a large guard blocks his way
jones shows his id
a figure brushes past them and enters the door the figure is fully decked out in something like a spacesuit
jones and dominic are ushered sideways to another room
this room has a glass viewing window which looks into the adjacent room
a middle aged doctor stands there his thumb nail in his mouth looking thoughtful
when he turns towards jones we can see there is fear in his eyes
jones shows his id
screaming from within the adjacent room draws his attention and that of jones
in the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line to stephs arms which are restrained by straps
steph lies on a bed
she looks truly sick her hair matted her skin blotchy
her eyes are also blood red the tiny blood vessels hemorrhaging
and she is screaming abuse at the nurses and doctors who work on her
close of jones staring at the scene
silus now enters the room
almost immediately steph stops screaming
she is staring directly at silus even this deranged she is still in complete awe
will she recover
the doctor turns to jones the doctor looks puzzled
containment is the issue now
and weve had more cases in the last hour
the doctor leaves
jones turns to silus
what is this
what is it
it comes from edgar
he has shared his blood with them
youre telling me that hes out there spreading this around
jones gets close to silus intimidating
continuing hell give it to lilly
dominic gets in between
dominic pushes jones back and then stares at silus
continuing this is spreading
silus doesnt speak just stares at steph
continuing brother silus
thats it lillys dead
he will keep her alive
so that i will come for him
thats what he wants
dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to silus who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten letter
it says everything flows from me
my blood will change the world
what does that mean
silus stares at the two men
then turns to steph her eyes creepy still locked on silus
jamestown from above
we drift down so that we see the buildings see fires breaking out hear screams echoing through the night
we continue down towards the rooftop of one building in particular
we see one of the infected citizens of jamestown standing on the roof screaming out into the night like some crazed animal
we continue past the creature then travel through a ventilation shaft on the roof
we hurtle down this down down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a subterranean basement
we drift through a doorway in the wet stone wall down a tunnel to finally enter a room
and we see lilly
she is covered in grime her hands bound above her head with chains to an ancient ornate pipes that twist through the place
she looks up at us
cut to edgar now standing above lilly
he bends down checking the chains that bind her
his face moves close to her so that he can smell her
hear her heart pounding
see the scars from his previous attack
then a noise echoing through the tunnels
the sound of the mad infected denizens of the containment zone screaming out into the night
it almost sounds like children playing dont you think
i looked at your body
you have borne a child
lillys features tense
continuing did you abandon it
your kind are good at that
even though her position is impossible lilly wont show edgar fear
why dont you just kill me
edgar just smiles
lilly spits in his face and screams at him
continuing kill me
edgar grabs her by the throat for a moment anger boils out of edgar but he restrains himself
i can see why he likes you
but i have a better use for you
to save you silus will take my blood
the world is insane
i am better than you
but they force me to serve you
does that happen in a sane world
forced to watch you waste the most precious thing you have
then edgars face changes he stares at her with pity for a moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be
continuing do you know what they do to us when we are born
they take us from our mothers
force us into a life of loneliness and denial
can you imagine a life like that
lilly senses an opening
you dont have to do this
you can change things
edgar places his head in his hands he seems to be weeping
you have reminded me of something
when he looks back up at her he is terrifying to behold
continuing i must search out my mother if she still lives
and kill her for what she did
edgar smiles quietly rises and exits
we are left with lilly bound to the rusty pipes
she strains tries to pull her hands from the chains but they wont move
above her on the pipe there is a old rusty bracket
lilly blinks through the sweat running into her eyes
she moves the chains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that she may be able to
cut her way through the chains
she strains harder and harder fighting back the tears the fear she just grinds at the chain repetitively
cut to steph in the hospital bed her eyes staring up hollow
a bed sheet is drawn over her dead face
cut to we see silus
staring through a window into an office
in there we can see jones
jones is talking in a very animated manner to someone who is obviously a reporter
the reporter stares like jones through the window towards silus
jones turns away looking guilty
cut to bedlam in the hospital corridors
people screaming being restrained
what is clear is that the virus steph had has now broken out into a plague of biblical proportions
we see a doctor standing in the middle of the hospital corridor blood over his smock in a state of pure shock
and we see silus there
a perfect creature observing the chaos
as he stands there he can see a small child a girl maybe around five
silus stares at the child
the girl is holding her mothers hand
her mother lies on a cot strapped down there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway
her mother is dead
the girls dirty face is stained with tears
for a moment silus wavers
then he moves over to the girl
she stares up at him with her tear stained grimy face
silus goes to place his hand on her forehead as blessing but the child cringes then jumps up and escapes down the hallway
silus can only stare at the horror of it all
cut to on a dirty stained valve radio
we slowly track in on the speaker hearing an interview coming from it
off some say this plague is the result of genetic experimentation by the brothers
do you have a comment
cut to we move past road blocks
off were asking everyone to stay in their homes in the sections of jamestown now under quarantine
armed gas masked guards stand with their guns at the ready
beyond the blockade is jamestown
fires burn bodies lie on the streets
off there are reports of residents being shot trying to escape the quarantine zone
is that true
they say the queen has left the city
is this martial law
a figure is stumbling towards us
one of the guards fires and the figure drops
cut to two soldiers wearing crude victorian containment suits surveying a map
weve blocked off this section and here containing the jamestown slums
we see the soldier outlining the quarantine zone marked in red
there is an angry mob banging on the locked doors of the brotherhood building
their placards tell the tale
brothers have brought the plague
no to genetic experimentation
off do you like the world i am making for us silus
i havent had your little policewoman yet
but i will soon
youll just have to find me
you know where i am
everything flows from me
human police stand ready with guns
its a disaster
silus is there
he watches the faces of the mob baying for blood
he sees them burning the emblems of the brotherhood
we are in a beautifully ornate office
it is like a private chapel
we see silus enter
he is grim
augustus is kneeling in prayer
he senses silus
the infection is spreading
each day he shares his blood with more of them
even though they are locked in their homes
he is somewhere in the quarantine zone
i will find him
augustus turns to silus
augustus moves closer to him stares into silus strange pale eyes
so very clear your eyes
the way they were when you were born
there will be no search
augustus moves off to his desk
silus is shocked
the queen has instructed the government to evacuate the city around the quarantine zone
in another day they will take action
what kind of action
of everything within the area
they will burn it all
and the innocents there who are not infected
it is a necessary step
we cannot let this escape
augustus looks up at silus this is perhaps the first time silus has refused anything that augustus has decreed
is it the policewoman
is this affecting your thinking
there is no love for our kind silus
we have done this
released this thing into the world
we have betrayed their trust in us more than once
i wont do it again
there is no debate
they will be sacrificed so the rest will be pure
silus shakes his head
continuing this policeman jones
he talked to the press
told them this came from edgar
silus watches augustus very carefully
continuing there are members of the inner circle who question the way you have handled this
blame you for this mans actions
i have made it clear that you will fix this
that you will silence him
augustus moves close to silus now
gently touches his face
continuing these are hard things we do
but you must think of the greater good
and of your own future
cut to a light bulb flickering
jones exits an elevator
the light above him flickers and dies
he stands in the dark
jones begins to stomp down the hall towards the part of the hall that is lit
then pop that light goes out as well
he pulls out his big gun from his armpit holster
he checks over his shoulder and then with the gun extended he moves slowly forward
he approaches an area that opens up a little
he pauses then under his breath
continuing come on then
he launches himself around the corner and fires his gun
hes lucky that his misses his target
a small dirty cowering boy with his fingers on the bank of light switches
the wall next to the boys head has exploded dust and wall board now drift down like snow
jones can only stare at the quivering child whose dirty face blank with fright
then jones turns
he can make out a figure in the dark hall
a patient quiet sentinel
jones opens the door to his apartment and enters
the place is a dump
lounge and kitchen all one area bedroom off to one side dishes in the sink clothes everywhere
jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a coffee machine then grabs a dirty glass pours a drink
silus watches him
jones comes into the lounge
he still has his gun in his hand
he stares at silus whose perfect outline makes jones life seem even more abysmal
what do you want
i want to help you
they know you talked to the press
they can fuck off
for that matter so can you
jones takes a slurp on his drink
continuing youd be the last person id trust
i saw you
watching lilly when she was asleep
silus doesnt answer now
jones moves forward
continuing maybe youre just like your brother
maybe youre helping him
now theres a thought
jones prods silus shoulder with the gun
continuing do you know where she is
jones prods again and finds silus elegant steel fingers around his wrist
the two men face off
continuing youve changed
not the outside
i know you
you know what i can see myself
jones tries to wrench his wrist free but silus holds it tight
jones swings his free arm and smashes silus on the side of the face
for a moment silus doesnt move then his hand is around jones throat
his other hand wrenching the gun from jones hand
there is silence in the room apart from jones choking gags
then silus pushes jones back so that he flies into a chair
jones stares up at silus now fear in his eyes
silus watches him
then a sound attracts his attention
cut to water hisses from jones coffee machine in the kitchen
continuing sneering coffees ready
cut to silus turning listening focusing on the water dripping from the coffee machine
silus is concentrating
realization comes into his eyes
we zoom close to silus ear
the soundtrack becomes enhanced
cut to the tap in jones festering sink dripping plop plop plop
we see the water in the bottom of the sink reflecting the room
we see silus approaching reflected there
his hand enters frame and touches the water
and we hear edgars voice the words we heard him say in augustus office
off you know where i am
everything flows from me
we see silus staring at the water
we see a giant drop of water hanging from the tap hanging hanging then falling
cut to we are under water liquid drops down into the water red liquid blood
we can see a figure distorted in the water the figure is bleeding himself into the water
it is edgar
cut to we see a subterranean water system
we see edgar at the edge of a pool bleeding himself into the water supply
edgar looks up
his eyes reflect at us blinking like an animals
cut to lilly in her cell still grinding away at the chains that bind her hands
she stops as if shes heard something expecting edgar to walk through the doorway
she begins desperately grinding away at the chains once more
cut to back on silus who now turns to jones
do you have a map
cut to jones laying out a map of the city on his kitchen table empty booze bottles roll out of the way
jones has a pen and hes marking off an area
theres the quarantine zone
its a pit
the water supply
where is it
jones searches and then pin points an area in the center of the quarantine zone
there all the old suburbs are supplied by their own artesian wells
thats why it hasnt broken out of jamestown its the water
the two men stare at each other both reaching the same conclusion
he is there with lilly
we see the map
cut to a crane down to reveal silus and jones observing the guards at the blockade
youll never get in theyve circled the whole borough
silus turns to jones
i will get in
you must go to the press
tell them about the water
tell them what the government will do
youre dead after this
you know that
watch for me officer jones
jones watches him leave then jones leaves too
we see silus close
its as if he is meditating
we pull out to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building he looks as if hes preparing himself for something
he then rises all fluid concentration and runs towards us and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the roof
cut to silus pov falling down down falling towards a window then smashing through it
silus exploding onto the floor of the apartment
for a moment there is silence just glass tinkling silus poised
then silus turns and is gone
cut to the slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn there an eerie dead zone made all the stranger by the gothic spires that climb out
of the haze
then silus hears something
it is the wailing of a new born child
silus moves towards the cries then up ahead he sees a figure kneeling on the ground
as silus moves through the haze he sees what it is
it is a brother priest kneeling beside someone
the brother is holding the hand of the person on the ground who is in the last throws of death
when silus is next to him the priest looks up at him
tears wet his cheeks
for a moment they just stare at each other
who has done this brother
to our shame
the silus hears the babies cries again
the priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of him
drops the limp hand he was holding
then rises and turns squarely to silus
i have something to show you
the priest moves off towards a building and silus follows
cut to we see silus and the priest enter
the priest leads silus into the dark place
as he moves forward silus can hear a strange gurgling sound not of the sick or dying this is a more innocent sound
the sounds of a newborn
we see silus approach a filthy roughly made crib
in it is a baby its eyes stare up at silus with wisdom beyond their years
it is a miracle my brother
she is a female the first of our kind
silus watches the baby carefully
she must be protected
he then turns to the priest
continuing i would ask for your help brother
the church can no longer be trusted
edgar atop the roof of the building that sits above the water treatment plant
he is watching his handiwork the screams in the night the burning fires the haze rising up cloaking the city
then down below he sees a figure approaching
he knows who it is
silus is coming to him
cut to lilly in her cell
she is working the chains that bind her hands against the pipe
shes rubbing them desperately harder harder
then she stops
she can hear someone approaching
edgar appears in the doorway still and poised
then he turns listening
a creaking echoes through the tunnels as if an iron door somewhere above has been opened
hes coming little one
hes coming for you
edgar takes one more blinking look at lilly and then leaves slamming the large iron door behind him
lilly pulls at the chains hoping against hope that theyll break
she now looks above
the pipe her chains are connected to runs up towards the roof then takes a bend to disappear into the wall near the door
she bangs on the pipe
there is a little movement where it goes into the wall
just enough to give her some hope
lilly struggles now to her feet
she slides the chains up
to get the chains over the bend shell have to jump
she does sliding the chain over the bend
now she hangs from the pipe the chains cutting into her wrists viciously making her groan
she then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding along the pipe until she is near the door
she then reaches up with her feet and kicks at the wall pushing trying to dislodge the pipe
it moves water leaks from it
but it does not give way
a desperate beat
then she reaches down to the door with her foot
she tries to force down the door handle her foot wet and slippery
finally she gets the handle down opens the door so that it clangs against the wall
im down here
her hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into her wrist
she cries out in pain
cut to above we see silus stopping
lillys cries echo through the place
it is a wet maze of grease and rust ornate twisting pipes built long ago and now decrepit
silus waits listens
cut to feet moving fast splashing in a pool of black water
silus turns just catching a movement a flash of someone moving off through the distorted piping
he moves to where he saw the figure to catch sight of a person moving to an open iron doorway
but when the woman turns it is not lilly
it is one of the infected the red eyes mad and staring at him
and both he and the creature hear it
cries of someone in pain
cut to lillys cries echo up the stairwell up towards the surface
cut to lilly twisting on the chains that bind her to the pipe crying out in pain
cut to the creature moving through the doorway towards the sounds of lillys cries
silus now moves forward to get to the creature flying towards the doorway
we see him approaching the doorway and then from nowhere edgar slams into silus sending them both careening over a railing
low angle looking directly up at the two brothers fall bouncing and crashing off the rails on the way down
they both hit the wet stone floor
they are in the pipe room where subterranean mineral springs rise up from deep in the earth and where the boroughs water supply is sterilized
silus is stunned rises blood issuing from his mouth
silus pulls his gun from his coat but edgars kick is too fast whipping the gun away so that the glass instrument smashes against some dripping pipes
edgar then squares off against silus
it is a maze down here
but given time that thing will find her
do things to her
ill show you where she is if you take some
edgar stalks forward
he holds up his arm to silus
silus stares at the tube coming from edgars arm
edgar moves towards silus twisting on the tube so that his infected blood drips onto the ground
continuing youre almost there anyway
and then silus face intense a dark smile his hand now gripping edgars hand surprise in edgars eyes
he pulls edgar toward him with all his might his hand clamping onto edgars throat the power of the entwined bodies immense then edgar whipping his body breaking silus grip
smashing silus on the side of the head but then only to get a kick from silus directly in the stomach that sends him smashing into several protruding pipes ripping into his back
half conscious now hanging from the pipe above her twisting
the sound of edgars screams makes her groan awaken a little dazed
then there is a loud clang
she cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her cell
she catches sight of a shadow movement in the tunnel
then the figure moves into the tunnel shuffling the legs not completely following the brains instructions but doing enough to propel the person forward then a stumble
and in a shaft of light lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet wall
but it is less a hand than a claw
and the face that follows the hand the red reflective eyes of one of the half mad the infected
the thing catches sight of lilly then propels itself towards her
we see its pov approaching faster faster
and lilly reaching out with her foot to the door struggling to hook it with her foot trying to close it almost catching the door handle but her foot is
so slippery and the thing is almost on her
then she stretches out with her foot just catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that is about to attack her
the thing on the other side of the door is now screaming wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature tries to activate it and lilly has
her feet on it trying desperately to keep the door shut but her feet keep slipping
and then she realizes that the pipe from which she hangs is beginning to wobble water is now coursing from the hole in the wall beginning to flow faster and
her feet slip more and more on the door
lilly tries to keep the door closed but her feet are too slippery and the thing is pushing through the door
in the dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear hands grasping for lilly legs scratching at them lilly twisting the creatures nails searching for purchase on her
lilly hauls herself up wrapping her legs around the pipe shes attached to
the thing below her is groaning incoherently reaching up its hands grabbing at her lilly pulling herself just out of reach then seeing the eyes below her wanting her
lilly tries to pull herself higher
and then she feels it
the pipe shes attached to is shifting where it joins the wall
water is now flooding from it the pipe jerks down some of the old wall giving way
the creatures fingers are now able to grasp lillys t shirt drag at it pull at her screaming the pipe grinding water flowing and then the whole thing comes down
the pipe bursting out of the wall
lilly and the pipe falls right on top of the creature
for a moment neither of them move then the creature is grabbing at lillys hair pulling her head back
in a flash lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the face of the creature
this gives her time to stagger upright
shes still chained around the pipe she can see the end of the pipe near the door
she begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to rise and advance towards her
lilly desperately slides the chain along the pipe
it catches on a protrusion while the creature advances
lilly frees it just in time falling backwards as the creature jumps at her lilly lifting the chain up to hold the creature back
the creature strains to get at lilly
lilly now has the chain at the creatures neck
she begins to tighten it around the creatures neck her only hope now
the creature changes now from frightening to pitiful as it realizes it cant breath its fingers desperately moving over lillys face almost pleading
tears form in lillys eyes as she tightens the stranglehold there is no anger there just desperation and behind that pity
the creature breathes its last breath then collapses onto lilly
edgar and silus stalk each other in the steam room
edgar launches himself towards silus but silus is now too quick
silus slams edgar sideways into a pipe an imprint of edgars face left on the pipe
stunned edgar releases his grip stumbles back silus rising now he has him
again silus slams edgars head into another pipe
and now silus has edgars throat in his fist and the look on silus face tells edgar he will not escape
we see edgar beginning to lose consciousness now dying
steam now rises all around them from broken pipes
then behind silus edgar can make something out
an old corroded tank steaming with the words sterilizer on it
there are a series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube and held in position by clamps they look like theyre for sterilizing bottles
with a last effort edgar propels silus backwards onto one of the shafts making silus grimace and clutch his back where hes been pierced then slide to the ground
the piercing has operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the wound on silus back
cut to silus looking up clutching his back with the pain of it
and now edgar above him
he removes one of the sterilizer shafts from the bracket that holds it
he clutches a lever on the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end of the shaft
edgar moves slowly towards silus
we see silus unable to rise crawling back until bang hes stopped by more pipes behind him
nowhere to go
and edgar ready to pounce
he does driving the shaft towards silus head
silus manages to raise one hand to edgars wrist to stop the shaft from piercing his skull
now the shaft is right in silus face the lightly steaming hole staring back at silus
edgars finger moves to the lever on the side of the shaft ready to get some steam going
if i burn the skin from your face i wonder how that would be
if you looked like a monster
cut to edgars finger moving over the steaming lever
the steaming end of the shaft right in silus face
then edgars face as he watches his brothers face for the last time
the blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the shaft drifts into our frame
cut to silus
his face is not scolded
cut back to edgar his expression getting tighter his face redder the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot
then he goes to speak but now words come out only a swirling puff of steam
and then he falls and we see behind him standing there is lilly one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand steam still rising from the sharp end of
cut to edgar prone on the wet floor of the pipe room steam rises from both his mouth and the back of his head
pov steadicaming through the streets of the quarantine zone
the pov belongs to lilly who moves down the street half carrying silus who limps
lilly takes in the devastation
then silus pulls up
what is it
silus is pointing to a fallen down building through the haze and the rain
is there something wrong
he gently touches her mud smeared face
continuing there is something very precious
you must take it keep it secret
dont let them touch it
i dont understand
and then they both hear it
a wail distorted echoing it sounds like a hurt animal
lilly looks at silus
lilly turns towards the building
she slowly moves towards it into the doorway as silus watches her go
silus turns to the sunrise it reflects in his eyes
cut to lilly moves through the derelict place past fallen beams
it seems empty
then lilly hears it again
this time she knows what it is we can tell from the way her eyes glisten
she moves forward closer to the sound
and finally she sees the brother priest we saw before who kneels in front of a crate
he looks up at her as she approaches
as lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate
wrapped in dirty sacking there is a baby
in the corner lilly can see a woman the childs mother dead from the infection
the baby cries and lilly can see the tiny fangs of a brother in the babys mouth
the first female of her kind
the first daughter given to us
lilly moves forward
emotional music rises in the soundtrack evoking memory the circle completing
lilly reaches out letting the baby girl grip her hand
lilly reaches into the crate drawing the baby into her arms staring down into the babys face a face somehow already wise already serene
broken tears run down lillys cheek as she presses the baby to herself all the pain of the past flooding over her the babys tiny hands reaching out clasping onto
before they find her
cut to lilly exits the building
she looks around for silus but he has gone
through the mist and drifting smoke from the fires we can see that in the distance a tarnished sun is lighting the horizon
we must go
after a final pause lilly moves off with the priest carrying the tiny bundle with her
for me everything has changed now
because of silus i see the world through new eyes
silus on a fire escape in the shadows
gone are the clothes of the brotherhood rather he is dressed as someone who does not want to be seen
cut to his pov
we see lillys building
we see through the window into her apartment a beacon of warmth in the night
in lillys bed we can see the baby its hands happily making patterns before its eyes
now i see hope and i see a child the first female of her kind
silus scans the apartment
he can see the lounge
jones is there with lilly
lilly is dressed to go out to leave
jones and lilly hug
then jones picks up two suitcases and moves towards the door
silus watches as lilly moves into the bedroom and reaches down for the tiny baby its tiny arms clasping onto her as she lifts it
perhaps edgar got what he wanted after all because it time this child will truly change our world
we see silus closer watching
cut to lilly pausing moving to the window of her apartment staring out into the night almost directly toward silus
she raises her hand as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she leaves
cut to silus close nodding
