by walter hill this screenplay is dedicated to raoul walsh based on the novel by jim thompson february doc mccoy is being walked across the compound by a uniformed guard
carrying a riot gun
other prisoners around the yard turn and stare as the two men head for the main building
doc walks down the bleak hallway a black prisoner passes doc in the corridor they slap hands
the guard remains at his shoulder
near the end of the passage another guard clangs open a barred door and allows doc and the first guard to enter the room where he stands sentry
a long table has been set up at the head of the room several prison officials and parol board members are seated facing the length of the room
seated at one end of the table is an irish looking man floridly handsome and a bit overweight his red hair is beginning to grey
the nameplate in front of him reads j
doc enters the room and seats himself near two other prisoners the guard stands back against the wall
another table has been set up this one near the seated prisoners for their legal counsels several lawyers examine papers before them waiting for the hearing to begin
a man at the center of the large table clears his throat then begins to speak
i think we can begin

the state of ohio has waved jurisdiction mr
they no longer seek mr
mccoy in connection with that case
adjusting his papers that is correct
mccoy has served four years of his sentence
prison record satisfactory

the chairman lowers the paper looks across to the lawyer
we would only again like to call the committees attention to mr
mccoys satisfactory behavior as a prisoner
notice is taken
he looks down the table at the dark suited men
continuing the board met in closed chambers last week
have you reached a decision regarding mr
mccoys request for parole
his face is taut
a second man looks across to the chairman
seated near beynon request for parole is denied
the prisoner may re apply in one calendar year
lowers his eyes then looks up at his lawyer
the lawyer avoids docs glance
he shuffles the papers in front of him begins stuffing them into his briefcase
still totally without emotion very well
the next request for parole is from john doty
is legal counsel present
doty is serving five to twelve years for embezzlement of corporate funds
torn magazines beaten up radio butt cans filled with sand
doc and other prisoners run out of the gate leading to the tractor driven carts that will take them to their work area
doc and work party have already arrived at the forest and begin to cut file and burn brush
they are always guarded by guards some on horseback
doc leans against a wire fence chewing on an oven match he watches the other prisoners aimlessly wander around the exercise yard
doc is standing in line with the other prisoners starchy puddles of food are being ladled out onto the metal trays
hands and knees cleaning a long line of open filthy toilets
a guard stands nearby
coarse soap and brownish yellow water
doc has an american eagle tattooed on one shoulder
a guard looks out over the empty exercise yard
buildings containing bleak cell blocks stand beyond the open compound
a warder jangles his key ring as he passes by the iron doored cells
doc and others working
the noise of machinery is deafening
the clatter of the constantly working parts is maddening
doc lies across a small cot within his shadow crossed cell
he works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge
doc glues the final pieces into place
around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen a picture of an attractive woman several battered paperbacks
doc continues looking at the bridge
then suddenly begins smashing it to pieces with his right fist
doc is seated
carol enters the darkened room and seats herself opposite doc
they are separated by a wide table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid point between them
big smile she wants the moment to be an upper hello doc
he simply stares back at her
carols finely honed features compliment a face that at first glance is pretty at a second glance shows willful strength
doc continues looking at carol
doc is silent
its been raining a lot the last few days
doc is silent
well try again
ive got to get out now
get to beynon tell him im for sale
she looks at him
do it now
she hesitates tries to touch him through the mesh
gets up and leaves
doc remains unmoving
carol enters a legal office wearing a soft billowy dress
she looks very good
a middle aged secretary looks up at carol
a short balding man the accountant in his forties works at a large desk across the room from the secretary
he seems totally occupied with his bookwork
they are dressed casually by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality they are professionals
hayhoe thirty years old buck teeth and blue eyes a bitter ender
cully well padded strength large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves
swain a little older and a little smarter than the other two his narrow features allow no warmth
i want to see jack beynon
the accountant nods to the secretary she points carol towards a door leading to an inner office
go right in mrs
doc and carol paces parts op bodies emphasis on hands in bed
his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her stomach
doc mccoys old lady
cully looks startled
the very same
the doctor took out mcgovern for her
she only rides winning class easy class
pressed against a mans neck
she kisses then bites a tiny portion of skin
how are you mrs
ready to talk about my husband mr
so the good doctor comes up again
then please sit down
hes asked me to come and see you
beynon looks at her
then lets their eyes meet
handing her a drink why
can i help
yes i think you can
a mans fingers staring at the anklet on the womans leg then drawing an imaginary line upward
a womans hand wearing a wedding ring comes up to meet it
a uniformed guard leads doc down the hallway they turn a corner and go into a small private room doc is now dressed in civilian clothes
doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror
he stops looking uncertainly at the image
and then moves on with the guard
he looks down the two lane blacktop road that runs along the edge of the penitentiary
doc turns looks again at the prison
four years is a long time
a dark caddy is parked down the road
the accountant or swain sits behind the wheel
he stares at doc
doc crosses to him
beynon will see you the day after tomorrow at the river walk
he gestures and drives away
he leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance way
the duffel bag rests beside him
a late model ford approaches stops near doc
the passenger side door opens from the inside
carol is driving
doc and carol look at one another their eyes holding several moments
big smile im a lot better off than i was an hour ago
they look at each other for a moment
carol leans forward
doc inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls kisses her lightly but with affection
you want to drive
my license expired lets get out of here
she starts the car slips it into gear
the ford moves along the deserted roadside crossing the border and passing into the state of texas
doc alternately stares at the passing scenery then back to carol
im sorry i was late
i got my hair done
the girl was slow
it looks fine
where do you want to go
i want to take a walk
he smiles then reaches over and gently touches a strand of carols hair
he sits on the bank watching the kids play
college kids some are swimming some studying some just grooving
carol starts to speak but doesnt
he is preoccupied lost in his own thoughts
finally he stands looking down at her
he slowly takes off his coat folds it lays it on the grass then turns and starts walking towards a tree
suddenly he takes off his shoes breaks into a run and dives for the rope
carol is already on her feet her sweater off shoes kicked aside she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash
she is a brief second behind him
they come up together and he laughs with the pure joy of being free and alive
she joins him in his laughter and with their arms around each other they turn as they are swept down stream
the interior is cozy and carol
carol has lived here almost two years
on the wall there is a poster which will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now on
around the room are drying clothes
carol is ironing with a steam iron
doc is sitting at a table with a colt
in front of him and a
he is field stripping
there is a bowl of peaches on the table
pointing to the poster it doesnt look like that
what do you mean
youve never been there
ive been there every day for the last four years
she crosses to him and gives him a hug then returns to her ironing
whats beynon got set up
small town small bank big money
she holds up some by photographs in front of him
where did you get those
ive been doing my homework
just like old times
better than old times
i hope so
i am not looking forward to another stretch
i made a mistake
ill never make another one
after a moment where did you get them developed
how much is the score
half a million
that beynons got a long arm
after a moment what do you want for dinner
whisky and a peach
she laughs softly and goes to a cupboard and takes out four bottles of whisky four glasses and a bowl of ice
doc smiles at her and begins sampling
as doc eats a peach with a sharp knife how does it taste
just the way i remembered
doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently
you been okay
made a quick trip to oregon saw my brother and the kids
figured it would be my last chance unless they wanted to travel
some things never change
nothings been boring since you found me
carefully thats not all of it
its been a long time
he continues stroking her arm
you go out much
after four years and now the question comes up
couldnt handle it then
now i can
with warmth and a smile im still here doc
he stands kisses her gently
she stands and they move toward the stairs
they both sit rigidly
docs eyes are on carol she stares vacantly expectant
doc begins to unbutton her blouse it comes undone with agonizing slowness
carol pulls her shoulders back helping doc drop the garment down to her waist
doc hesitates then carefully touches her shoulder
he kisses her
doc gently eases himself away from carol
he is very tight oh christ
he again moves close
doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as carol places both of her arms around him holding him tightly
doc unsnaps the top fastener the second one catches remains unyielding
he closes his eyes for a second
the pressure of the moment is again too intense for doc
once more he pulls gently away from her
carol looks at him her eyes very reassuring
continuing i guess im kind of
its all right
explaining the obvious its just been a while
weve got time
weve got a lot of time
i can help you
she stands begins to remove her skirt
give me a minute
she sits beside him again takes his hand in hers
ill be okay
listen im just as nervous as you are
they look at one another
he kisses her their embrace pulls them back across the bed
continuing let me make you feel good doctor
but she has little chance as he begins to make love to her
how was it
better than i remembered
doc wearing a robe is cooking eggs and drinking whisky
i was going to fix you breakfast
you were asleep
i bought you a lot of new things
she exits and returns with some clothes
he looks at them
yeah well i think ill stick with what ive got
they start eating
how much does beynon get
carol looks directly at doc
right off the top
is he straight
you got the parole didnt you
he picks up a fork and looks through it as if it is prison bars
she takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him
then i m glad you waited
simply i couldnt have
but i got you out
didnt i doc
i did it
i got you out
carol begins to laugh softly
why are you laughing
i laugh when i feel happy
sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh
i had a lot of that
and other times that wasnt enough
i had a lot of that too
i know you find it hard to believe im happy just loving you
that doesnt hurt
but sometimes i cried a lot too
trying to smile i didnt
i just waited
deeply moved want to cry now
doc smiling still holding her hand leads her from the table
they cant keep their hands off each other and laughing with complete release they half carry each other into the bedroom
you gotta be kidding
not at all just a pleasant way to have lunch
pedal boats cut through the water in the background
glad to see you in civilian clothes
the accountant and swain are with beynon in the boat
apart from them two pedal boats come up behind beynons boat
cully and hayhoe are in one and two other men are pedalling along in a boat numbered
all it takes is a long arm
hard to judge how these things happen
the parole board almost never reverses their decisions
sarcastic i guess it was because i was a model prisoner
this is the only time you and i meet in public
any business with me handle it with him
beynon nods toward the accountant
he then turns and gestures toward the other two men
continuing youre back with your own people now
got you some professionals
flat hard i get my own help
quiet strength you run the job but i run the show
you got two weeks to set it up
its not a big bank but it handles cash deposits for an oil company

beynon nods to the two men and they immediately begin to approach in their paddle boat
rudy butler hard eyes and an easy smile obviously a heavy gun
prank jackson young mid twenties ruddy face and blond hair a small man with blank insensitive features
nods to cully swain and hayhoe what about them
the one with the moustache is my brother

irritated ill take care of my end
big smile stay clean
on two of them huge sets of binoculars have been racked into place beside them on a tripod is a lectern with notepad and pencil
doc and carol peer through the binoculars then write several notations on the paper
both doc and carol drink coffee from paper cups
the residue of dinners served on hotel trays lie about the room
doc and carol share a sandwich as they work
the bank carries on its normal mid day activity
a guard enters the building quickly followed by the bank president
making further notations
before a tellers window
as she reaches the window id like an application for a checking account
she gets it moves to unobtrusively eyes the bank
he moves to the head of the line
he notices a tv camera and a wanted poster showing the faces of wanted bank robbers
with a smile could i get change for this fifty please
his eyes alert and probing
from a coin dispenser
his eyes find a beacon city policeman idly talking to a citizen
a police car is near the officer the drivers side door open
mounted on the dash is a shotgun
doc tucks the paper under his arm and moves off down the street
doc with briefcase is talking to a civil engineer
they both study the detail map of a city sewage system
with a pair of scissors
table piled with equipment watch caps several different colored raincoats a huge pair of wirecutters road maps chemical containers and four sticks of dynamite four visas and two passports and
several padded u
army super bullet proof vests which are not vests at all more a shield
rudy and jackson stand near the table
carol is seated
she nervously runs her hand along the edge of one of the road maps
doc is holding one of the vests
the wall behind the table is dominated by diagrams and maps and photos which show the interior of the beacon city bank the bank vault and several diagrams of the
main street of beacon city a beacon city police car and a detailed reproduction of the beacon city main sewage system including electrical wiring a detailed road map of the town and various photos of a farmhouse and barn
bank president three tellers and one guard
cutting in usually on the right side as you go in
nail him first be careful he doesnt panic and want to shoot somebody
local police have one car a rover shouldnt be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless its answering an emergency call
if the cop car shows up remember it doesnt have any automatic weapons
only a shotgun braced on the dashboard
get into a tight spot youll be out of range at forty yards
then theyre down to their side guns
for exits off main street
should be light traffic that time of day
the bank guard carries a
these will stop an m
at fifty yards
he throws the vest on the table
just in case someone gets a shot off

carol turns away from the mirror

i feel like the night before the first day of school

carol gets into bed
doc is already in bed

smiling at him and live happily ever after
sticks of dynamite two tubes of naptha a lot of prima cord and one small dark percussion cap
carol sits behind the wheel of the grey panel truck as it prowls smoothly down a brush lined central texas road
carol drives calmly professionally
he wears a jacket and watch cap
doc is squatted down quickly activating another timing mechanism checking the clock face on the bomb against his wristwatch
with a quick dexterous movement he places a bomb into the two large grocery bags at his feet
after burying the explosives within each sack he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper
the grocery bags are then gently shoved forward resting against the wheel well of the truck
as doc looks at carol
parked along a secluded pathway facing the highway which lies a quarter of a mile away
he has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailors watch cap
he stares at the highway
rudy checks his pistol
he shoves the pistol into the side pocket of his raincoat
rudy starts the engine
then slides the car into gear
a sleepy traditional municipality
he is the president of the first bank of beacon city nodding to a few passersby he stops at the front door of the bank knocks twice
a bank guard opens the door and the bank president moves inside
sign that reads founded hours am to pm weekdays only the president snaps on a bank of irridescent lights
several tellers have begun setting up for the days commerce
doc shifts his position slightly then pulls his
out from beneath his jacket
doc breaks out the clip examines it snaps it back to position
he replaces the gun under his jacket the gesture seemingly more a mannerism than a precaution
a huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the floor of the truck near doc along with a black leather suitcase
carol in the drivers seat beacon city appears on the horizon through the windshield
the president begins turning the combination on the massive door as the vault begins to open
rudy in the buick driving down the roadway near the outskirts of town
a texas highway patrol car passes moving in the opposite direction
then checks his watch
the watch belongs to doc
he looks expectantly towards carol
the panel truck is now within the commercial district of beacon city
rudys buick is visible a hundred yards behind
the hay truck drives off main street and into an open field near a corner of the town
jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to the sidewalk
rudys buick pulls over and jackson gets into the passenger seat
the buick then cruises back out onto main street
carol in the van approaches an intersection
through the trucks window a traffic signal appears
rudy pulls the buick off the main drag and onto a side street
another turn and he again moves parallel to the main street
the bank president leaves the vault allowing the heavy door to stand open
a lattice work barrier made of wrought iron is pulled across the vault opening
the bank president snaps the latch lock closed
carol in the panel truck
she pulls the van carefully to a stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red
she turns her eyes back to doc
doc catches her look then instantly springs into action
he reaches down pulls a hatch like cover up from the floor of the truck revealing the road below
a portion of a manhole cover is visible
barking the words two feet forward
on the street several cars can be seen moving up behind the panel truck
doc grabs the tongs inserts the ends into the manhole cover notches
he lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover forward
doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into open manhole carrying the huge cutters with him
as he disappears from sight
rudy driving on the side avenue still moving parallel to main street
the buick is now geographically well forward of the panel truck
jackson stares at his watch
rudy makes a sharp left
the car accelerates its wheels begin to quietly whine
main street comes back into view
carol watching the signal
a man in a pontiac eases to a stop behind the panel truck
he watches the signal
doc standing in the sewer pipe
he turns on a flashlight moves ahead
his feet slosh through the six inch high murky water
doc shines the light on several ankle thick conduit lines that run along the sewer wall
he moves down the dark oval corridor
the guard opens the front door allowing the morning patrons to enter
the president smiles upon seeing the customers
he looks over to the wood frame clock on the far wall
rudy in the buick makes another left turn now back onto main street
the bank appears a half block away through the car window
rudy and jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a disparity between their features
main street the traffic signal has now blinked to green
carol is grinding away at the dead engine of the panel truck
the man in the pontiac leans on his horn
other cars behind him begin to honk
carol leans out of the cab of the panel truck and gestures for the cars to pass her
she again grinds away at the engine
doc stands at a massive connecting box where four strands of the conduit intersect
he puts the wire cutters to the first conduit grasps the insulated handles and with a crunching pop he cuts through the conduit with one bite
doc immediately starts on the next strand
carol on main street trying to start the engine
the buick slams to a stop in front of the bank
rudy il and jackson pull open the car doors
the bank guard is placing a local high school basketball schedule and display into position
several patrons have formed small lines and are transacting business with the tellers
the wall clock shows the time at
rudy and jackson burst through the glass door
they stand shoulder to shoulder guns extended the full length of their arms
beneath the mask rudys smile is visible
the bank guard looks up prom the basketball display
his eyes widen
both guns are leveled directly at him
simultaneously the lights go out
the bank president desperately pushes the alarm button near his desk
insert button and bell
carol on main street trying to start the engine
tortures a balding patient with a drill
the patient groans lifts one leg in the air from the pain
when the power goes the dentist quizzically raises the drill and examines it
the patient pants in relief
superior technology my ass
an electric weather time indicator above the town square
as the bulbs dim
doc running down the sewer stopping at the manhole he scrambles up the permanent ladderway tossing his wire cutters up into the truck parked over him
carol in the drivers seat again she tries to start the engine
doc pulling himself back up into the van with a gymnastic thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs
carol the engine still wont start
doc drops the hatch door back down into place on the floor of the truck
snapping his look to carol okay
carol as the engine roars to life she engages the gearshift
the truck begins to move forward
suddenly the motor does stall
docs pace tightens
the cars behind the van continue carol again grinding away at the engine
her lips are compressed into a thin line
after a moment
the motor catches the truck again moves forward
doc picks up the large black suitcase from the floor of the panel truck then begins to move toward the cab and carol
the panel truck whips off main street and onto a side avenue
carol pulls the van up to the curbway jerking to a stop
doc is now in the front seat beside carol
he pulls the truck door open then hesitates
he touches her arm their eyes meet briefly both their faces warming for a moment
doc gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck
doc turns and begins walking toward an open alleyway
behind him the panel truck pulls smoothly away
he turns again now moving down a totallydeserted side alley
the alley opens at one end onto a back street the opposite end is bounded by a large brick building
doc removes his pistol from his coat pocket then approaches a doorway along the side of the brick building
at the last moment he pulls down the watch cap mask
rudy disengages the latch on the side door
doc kicks the door open with a violent jerk of his leg
rudys gun is trained prom the back of the building over the tellers and patrons spread eagled across the floor
their heads are down several of them are trembling
doc stands holding the
in one hand suitcase in the other
he moves into the building shutting the door behind him
rudy is now stationed near the front door ready to intercept any incoming bank patrons he covers the room from the end opposite jackson
rudy stands near the bank guards outstretched right hand the guards head is bloodied from rudys pistol whipping
his gun has been kicked against the wall
a short distance away rudy is watching
the bank president lies face down on the floor directly under the arc of jacksons gun
who is continually turning to watch the guard
doc quickly crosses the distance between the side door and the vault passing the bank president
he slips the
into his jacket side pocket sets down the suitcase then either cuts the lock or picks it
looking at his watch seconds
carol in the van she has stopped the panel truck near the deserted lot where the hay truck is parked
she drops the bomb laden grocery bag inside the truckbed
she moves back towards the van
doc finishes rips the door open lifts the suitcase and moves into the vault
rudy looks at the bloodied guard notes the distance separating the man from his gun
though unconscious the guards head begins to move
jackson holds his gun hand fully extended
again he takes a brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and at the guard
angles and inserts the vault is lined with safety deposit boxes and large cabinet drawers
a metal table stands off center the black suitcase resting on its surface
doc opens the satchel
he then pulls open one of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money pads into the open suitcase
the bank president lies near the open vault
he listens to the sounds of doc at work
he slightly cranes his neck trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault
rudy watching the front door
a patron enters rudy gestures with the gun
she hits the deck
jackson is getting more nervous by the minute
doc continues working within the vault
the woman now on the floor quietly crying
jackson watching the guard
rudy watching jackson
calling out time
the bank guard glassy eyed but conscious he has the look of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout but is ready for one more round
the bank president in his prone position
he looks at jackson then to the vault
the panel truck now at the other end of main street
carol exits the van carries the second sack to a large rubbish bin in front of an empty store
she deposits the grocery bag
the suitcase is now filled
he snaps the fasteners shut
doc exits the vault after withdrawing his
from his coat pocket
jackson sees doc leave the vault
he edges around the side of the tellers cages toward the front of the bank
he passes the bank president
doc carries the heavy suitcase in his left hand
he gestures to rudy and jackson with his pistol while moving towards the side door
entrance still watching the bank guard
hands and knees
the guard looks at his pistol
bank with his gun
towards his pistol
shouts just pick it up
the bank guards body turns end over end from jacksons bullets
some of the bank patrons scream others sob with fright
doc his eyes are furious
rudy and jackson rudy shoves jackson out the front door
doc covers their exit then slips out the side door and into the alley
rudy guns the buick forward the wheels tearing at the asphalt
jacksons shoulders rock back as the big car accelerates
doc gun and suitcase in hand nears the end of the alleyway
carol in a ford suddenly pulls up filling the roadway opening
doc tosses the suitcase into the back of the car
then slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel as carol slides over to the passenger seat
doc pulls off the watch cap mask his face taut
the ford smokes off as doc kicks it into gear
the buick streaks down the center of the roadway
two bombs detonate into fireballs
the hay truck blazes upward bales instantly igniting
the grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange flame inferno
traffic stalls on the boulevard drivers and pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes
rudy zig zags the buick along
maneuvering through the stopped traffic
doc slides the ford through a right and left turn emerging onto smoke covered main street
the speeding ford avoids a halting car then suddenly spins out of control jumps across the sidewalk splinters a wood bench and finally slides in a complete circle across the
grass of a small park
rudy driving through the bedlam
suddenly a gun appears in his right hand aimed at jackson
the pistol roars bucks roars bucks again
jackson is shot through the head twice
avoiding stalled cars
carol grasps at both the seat and the dashboard handholds to maintain her balance
the buick emerges through dense plumes of smoke
fire licks along the one edge of the sidewalk
rudy in the buick has now almost cleared the town
he tears along the highway
sweating a little but becoming cool
he is a pro
his watch cap is now removed
on the curve jacksons body is kicked out of the automobile and bounces across the pavement
doc in the ford powers along
he approaches the flaming building then hits the brakes as
a big diesel truck and trailer is coming in the opposite direct ion jack knifes across the road desperately trying to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the
doc as the truck and trailer suddenly appear through the smoke in front of him throws the car broadside into a four wheel drift
now sideways then straight he bumps across the sidewalk over a patio of a house knocking down two pillars through a parking lot taking with it a large cleaners sign
then bores back onto the road
rudy in the buick stroking along the open highway
looks in the rear view mirror
rudys pov through the buicks rear window black smoke is visible billowing skyward
doc and carol in the ford now driving calmly through the countryside
a police car with light turning and siren wailing passes them heading for the conflagration in beacon city
docs eyes follow the patrol car until it disappears from sight
the buick series of angles it pulls off the highway and bumps down a dirt road
rudy strains to hold the big car on the rutted pathway
the dirt road becomes a lane
a farm house and barn appear at a clearing
rudy powers the car up a fairly steep hill the crest of which is occupied by a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn
rudy jumps out of the buick trots to the front of the barn and pulls the double doors open
a station wagon with wooden panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within
the ford sweeps off the highway and onto the dirt road
within the ford doc is driving
carol peels off her sweater
she has worn a faded blouse underneath
she pulls a ribbon her hair falls changing her appearance
rudy in the barn the buick is now parked near the station wagon
standing in the shadows he intently reloads his gun then moves towards the large doors of the barn
carol in the passenger seat of the ford she watches as doc drives up the lane
rudy stands outside the barn as the car approaches
doc studies rudy through the windshield watching him wipe his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer
doc pulls the ford to a stop just within the double doors
he passes rudy leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway station wagon
doc jumps out of the ford as soon as the ignition switch is cut carol a beat behind him on the opposite side
rudy moves into the archway created by the barns open doors
he stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks around him
doc snaps open the door of the car his back turned to rudy
he reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase not by the middle handle but by each end as if it contained a great weight
speaking over his shoulder not looking at rudy wheres jackson
rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat
pointing his gun lazily at doc supremely confident he didnt make it doc
you didnt either
doc straightens still holding the suitcase
he starts to turn to rudy eyes wide helpless
carol fumbles for the gun in her purse
rudy extends his arm ready to begin the execution
doc swings the suitcase around slowly seemingly ready to face rudys bullets
then he shoots rudy in the middle of the chest docs
slug driving him backward
doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel
he drops the suitcase with his first shot fires again blasting rudy in the middle
two large holes now show at the chest of rudys raincoat
rudy is knocked back over the hillock tumbling down the precipice and into a grassy meadow below
doc stands at the crest of the hill
he looks down as rudys body stops turning
doc shifts the
to his right hand
rudys body lies still
doc turns quickly away prom the hilltop not giving rudys body a second glance
carol gun in hand stands outside the barn transfixed
how did you know
doc doesnt answer motioning her into the car
the getaway car
as she starts to change clothes
doc takes a long look at carol
carol is driving
tooling comfortably along a country road
doc is beside her the suitcase resting in the back seat
after several moments of silence what about the bank
after a moment jackson panicked and nailed the guard
carol takes a deep breath then turns her look at the side window
doc leans forward
snaps on the radio
rudy butler stumbles back over the crest op the hillock and onto the pathway in front of the barn
his figure is slightly grotesque the raincoat shows two holes from docs
slugs along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on his ass over tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill
he is obviously in some pain his walk is a half lurch
rudy turns on a rusted tap which sends all pocketed water gurgling down into a mold covered trough
rudy pulls off the yellow raincoat revealing the fact he has worn one of the padded bullet proof vests
rudy undoes the vest lets it fall to his feet
a huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone
rudy touches the blood with his right hand then looks at his hand
breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash the purling water across his face and then he laughs
we got between four and five
carol starts to open the bag and count
doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing
doc reflectively studies the roadside ahead
they are heading along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that carries only a sparse amount of traffic
docs eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead
now noticing the road doc
flat i see it
on the road ahead highway patrolmen have formed a traffic barricade
several cars and trucks are being waved through the check point
wearing sunglasses and stetson hats the uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing vehicle
doc analyzes the situation without changing expression he slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line of slowly passing vehicles
she turns starts to reach into the back
doc gently catches her arm preventing her from moving further
theyre looking for three men
a young officer looks into the cab of the pickup then glances at the empty flatbed
another patrolman flanks the other side of the truck repeating the procedure
several patrol cars fully loaded with additional officers are parked nearby
the pickup truck is waved through
the station wagon rolls up to the check point
doc rolls down his window
he smiles and nods to the young patrolman
big smile whats the problem
carol studies the officer on her side of the car through the closed window
the officer peers back at her then into the rear seat
the station wagon is waved ahead without a second glance by the patrolman doc accelerates away from the roadblock
after a moment doc leans forward snapping on the radio
inside the barn behind the wheel of the panel truck rudys matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face
he starts the engine painfully bringing it to a roar
the panel truck leaps crazily forward careening across the barn floor smashing through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts out into the sunlight
the station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near an outdoor phone booth at a filling station
of loose change
he begins to dial
i m here
he presses a button on the intercom
he presses a button on the intercom
he presses a button on the intercom
they checked in
call the ranch tell beynotr well leave his cut here
there are three men dead
ive got to give him his money
that was our end of the deal
he might be ready to chop us up
do it my way
he starts the engine
the station wagon pulls away
tell me about beynons ranch
ive never been there
when we met it was in his office
doc looks at her for a moment
continuing hesitant do you trust him
i just figure the percentages
he wouldnt try a cross until hes got the money
lets send his cut back just keep going
if we make a mistake
hell burn us
you make a deal youre always better keeping your end up
i dont want to go there
do it my way
the wagon continues moving down the road
two hours before sunset
a chill southwest wind is blowing
the station wagon appears moving slowly down the roadway bouncing along its rutted surface
at a small intersection two mail boxes stand close to one another
the name beynon is printed in black paint on one of the letter bins
doc stops the wagon momentarily looks at the box then turns down the indicated road
the station wagon clears the crest of a sage brush hill and passes camera
doc parks the wagon under a gnarled cottonwood tree in front of the house
as he shuts off the engine he pulls the
out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband
carol watches the gesture
doc starts to open the car door then hesitates
you can wait here
ill wrap it up fast
doc steps out of the wagon then pulls the leather suitcase out of the back
he quietly shuts the car door and moves around the side of the house toward the barn garage at the rear
he looks carefully around the area his eyes searching for signs of beynons men
nothing seemingly amiss he moves toward the front door tries it moves away
doc crosses to the back screen door of the house
after another moment doc quietly opens the screen door and enters the house
doc moves through the service porch pantry and into the kitchen
beynon sits at the long kitchen table head on hand eyes slightly glared
on the checkered oilcloth in front of him is a quart bottle of jim beam now half full
hes drinking the sour mash straight with a water chaser
doc looks steadily at beynon for a moment sets the suitcase down on the floor then crosses to the sink picks up a glass and sits down at the table
doc pours himself a drink takes a sip
swishing the drink news said two persons killed
except for a faint thickness of speech beynon seems quite sober
beynon wears a
detective special c
in a worn leather belly holster
rudy got ambitious
and you got him
doc looks at beynon notes his gun then continues stacking the money
what about your wife
what about her
moving right to the business at hand lets c ut up the money i want to get north
your wife told me no one would be killed
you hired jackson and rudy
they may nail me into this now mccoy
thats your problem
smiles you know you and i may be two of a kind
i always do my own work
beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into docs glass
i understand the way you feel
as a matter of fact you and i might share a great many feelings
beynon drinks from his glass
doc continues counting the money
snaps the words im in a hurry
you still dont get the picture do you
ive always heard what a smart ass operator you are
beynon pauses a moment
doc looks steadily across the table into beynonts eyes
prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening
beynon gets out of the chair stands beside the table
lets examine the situation
one an extremely attractive woman
then theres the womans husband a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison
three a man with political influence a man who can easily get a parole for a convict
why should he
beynon sips his glass slowly
docs hand edges down toward his waist band
continuing a simple reason mccoy
the obvious reason
to rob a bank
i knew that life didnt add up to the obvious when i was
cautiously what do you add up to here
the radios rappin about
we only got a half a million
a little more was taken out before
a beat my brothers a director of that bank mr
i had a few pressing debts
so we did that crackerbox
to cover for you
nodding the obvious
as his smile fades but we are both not interested in that right now
a long beat my old lady must have made a lot of promises
but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled
doc senses a movement from the shadows behind beynon
turning his head slightly doc can see carol standing at the entrance to the kitchen
she holds a
the pistol seems to be pointed directly at doc
you wouldnt have come here when you were eight mr
as the gun continues to be pointed directly at doc
continuing dont think too badly of her
after all you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman
riding over beynons words get it over with
carol fires the automatic
the big gun belches the full slip in a stuttering explosion
the slide remains back and in an ejected position
beynon is driven back to the kitchen wall
he shrieks aloud the noise strangely like laughter
his body flattens against the surface slips downward riddled by the big bore slugs
doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned table
he looks up from beynons crumpled body
carol takes two steps forward then drops the automatic sending it clattering and spinning away across the floor
doc looks at carol their eyes find each other
he turns moves to the sink splashes water across his face then fills a glass of water from the tap
drinks it he looks back at her
carol stands watching doc tears scream down her cheeks
doc crosses to carol takes her arm picks up the gun spent shells and the suitcase then leads her out of the kitchen toward the back door
beynons body has slipped from sight only a few traces of blood show along the white wall
rudy is driving along an open highway
rudy mouths inane lyrics to the radio one arm on the wheel the other clutching his wound
a small sign near a mailbox catches rudys eye
he swings the panel truck around in a u turn then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm house
practice of veterinary medicine
the station wagon is parked along the cement road standing in isolation against the vast texas b
doc stands away from the car his back turned to it
gazing at the horizon
carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the ground
doc suddenly turns walks to her and gives her a stinging slap across the face
tears begin to roll down carols face
continuing why didnt you tell me
there wasnt any way to explain it
you sent me to him
when i got out why didnt you tell me where it was
what the hell do you want
mary tyler moore
shes on tv
if you dont start telling the truth
breaks off what do we do
quietly we keep going
swain sleeps on the davenport
cully and hayhoe sit at two sides of beynons large desk playing a game of checkers
hayhoe seems to have cully badly beaten
the accountant enters the room
the block on the wall shows eight oclock straight up
the two men abandon their game
cully kicks the sofa awakening swain
he groggily gets to his feet
the station wagon enters the building
doc takes a bright orange ticket from an attendant behind a glass window then accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper levels of the building
checks his watch momentarily as he prowls the wagon between long rows of automobiles
whine through a sweeping turn within the auto parks uppermost level through the buildings portals the bright morning sun can be seen reflecting off the citys rooftops
doc pulls the wagon to an abrupt halt within a parking stall at an isolated area
he steps out onto the concrete flooring slams the door shut
doc turns away from the car
as he approaches the elevator doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops them into a trash bin without missing a stride
carol is standing in a ticket line that moves slowly foward
she struggles clutching the heavy money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms
the line of ticket buyers moves forward
just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down
the station is ancient vaultlike
baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station
carol approaches the ticket window
she places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg
carol pops open her purse
a clumsy item in itself
as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket seller looks across to her
two day coach tickets on the flyer
thirty four fifty six with tax leaves in forty five minutes gate three
carol pays the tariff places the tickets into her purse along with the change
wearily she labors the satchel back into her hand then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres wide station promenade
near a portico within the main lobby carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles
she glances across the promenade walls her eyes finding carol stares across the room at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her
carols nervous boredom increases she looks down at her lap pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles
carol finally rises impulsively from the bench immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel
carol walks back down the promenade while carrying the suitcase
as other baggage laden passengers scurry around her she looks across the arcade her eyes finding a glass walled cocktail lounge
she hesitates then begins to trudge in that direction
a bank of lockers stands near the cocktail lounge
as carol approaches an elderly woman deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside
closing and re locking the door the woman quickly moves away
having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station carol steps to the end locker takes a quarter out of her purse then studies
the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker
she slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door
as carol bends to pick up the suitcase the locker door swings closed
she tries to open it but the door has re locked itself
carol quite disgusted with her predicament again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse
as she again reads the numbered directions a young man appears at her shoulder
the man is a prototype of urban sleaziness doberman pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie
the mans appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness
kind of tricky isnt it
she turns startled by his sudden proximity
in one smooth movement the dapper man plucks the quarter from carols hand deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open
setting the heavy suitcase inside he closes the door tests it to show that it has been re locked then removes the key from the lock and puts it into
she is intimidated momentarily by the mans sudden appearance and forcefulness as well as his intentions
toothy grin no trouble lady
stepping backward his canine features disappear into a welter of station activity
carol watches his receding figure for a moment then simultaneously placing the key into her purse she turns and begins moving towards the cocktail lounge
a young kitten in a cardboard box wrestling with the barrel of a
a thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the fur along the cats neck and backbone
rudy butler is preoccupied with the cat giving little attention to the thirtyish man standing nearby
harold clinton puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the medical bag
rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn like animal hospital
the large room is lined with stalls cages and pens many of them vacant
the wonded criminal is bare chested
a plaster cast has been attached to his left arm and shoulder
fran clinton sits on a high wooden stool opposite rudy
five years younger than her husband tight sweater and skirt bright scarlet fingernail polish well built her face suggests sensuality
frans bare milk white legs are crossed under her rumpled skirt
to harold whats the damage
collar bone is broken
no infection yet
the bandages should be changed twice a day
i got a nurse in mind
going along oblivious to the implication the glucose will begin working in half an hour
youll feel better then
flashing a grin despite the pain the three of us are going to do some traveling
were going to take your car to el paso
thats not possible
we cant leave here
weve got all this
rudy smiles at mrs
hes never met fran before but hes known her for years
is it possible mrs
scared but trying to be friendly just
tell us what you want
rudy looks back down at the gun and cat
the following silence is like a scream
finally what kind of car do you have harold
cutting in a ford
we have a ford
thats very good
now harold you go out and gas up the ford check the oil and tires we dont want any problems on the road
one more thing
if anybody but you comes back
he points the gun at mrs
continuing she gets her clock fixed right away
you understand that harold
a long pause
you do what he says harold
after you come back ill listen while you make some phone calls tell a few friends youve got to leave for a week or two
you have to call another vet about the animals
you tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow
no slip ups on that
they got to be looked after
we really dont have too many friends
they dont think he married well
smiling that makes things a little easier for us then doesnt it
carol sits in the bar
a young soldier approaches and sits down at the counter next to her
she is finishing a vodka gimlet
to a bartender beer
carol glances at her watch
continuing begins with the obvious guess you have to catch a train
pink cheeked and freckle faced he has to shave maybe twice a week twenty one years old not good looking his best feature is his gentle easy grin and not
he just wats to meet a girl
not too patronizing thats right
got twenty four days of furlough and im goin home
the soldiers beer arrives
utah the bee hive state
im from orem right near salt lake
say you wouldnt happen to be a mormon would you
chuckles no im not
theres about twelve people in the state that arent mormons and im one of them
that certainly makes you kind of special
i guess it does
carol pushes aside her glass
c ont inuing you wouldnt be taking the train to salt lake would you
smiles across to him no im afraid not
i never have any luck
carol smiles at the soldier
her features suddenly freeze as she glances toward the entrance to the bar
doc stands looking at carol and the soldier
i really hope you have a nice trip
i hope yours is okay too
carol moves towards the exit
the soldier quietly sips his beer his face a bit grim
they look at each other
wheres the suitcase
carol continues looking at doc for a moment
then suddenly moves past him leading him out into the main lobby
carol emerges from the cocktail lounge followed by doc
they cross to the lockers
she retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the proper slot
it doesnt turn
puzzled she tries again then forcing the key shakes the lock violently
her eyes widening into a quiet panic she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key
her features are now totally ashen
she walks up the bank of lockers
puts the key in another locker the door opens the compartment is empty
carol turns away from the locker eyes glazed with fear
doc at her shoulder
a man helped me open it
deceptive calm and switched keys
he must have
angrily it isnt another boyfriend is it
carol winces containing her anger
continuing icily how long ago
continuing with quick calculation hed figure you for longer enough time to try another hit
hes probably still in the station
as doc pushes carol forward
continuing lashing out there better be a guy with the lashing back you bastard
walking at a rapid pace they start through the station doc forcing their speed clutching carol under her elbow
they reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the promenade
carol stops suddenly
she stares down the long corridor her eyes finding the thief
he stands near another bank of lockers the black suitcase at his feet
the thief looks up at carol virtually within the same moment that she spots him
his expression never changes
he takes a step towards her smiling
then with a movement that is both abrupt and casual he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons
doc has seen the thief
recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him
carol follows doc but is unable to keep up
she watches as doc vanishes behind the row of lockers
carol rounds the last locker in the row but both men have now disappeared from view
she sags back against the edge of the metal compartments exhausted fearful
indistinct above the roar of the station attention please
the flyer now boarding at gate three
the flyer now boarding at gate three
carol again raises her eyes
still breathless her face glows with moisture
fran is still seated on the stool
rudy stares at her from the cot
harold is now absent
i dont think you have to worry much about harold
he wont do anything
he speaks very politely that right
you can trust him
how long have you been married
can he trust you
smiles thats what matters isnt it
rudy continues looking at her
come over here a minute
he gestures with his gun
fran crosses the distance slowly moving with apprehension
look im not going to be any trouble to you either fact is this may sound funny but maybe you and i could be close friends
rudy gestures her closer
continuing you dont always have to have your gun out
ill get whatever you want
really i will
she is now standing over the cot looking directly down at rudy
he jerks her down
still polite get rid of that nail polish i dont like it and when i tell you to come over here you move fast
you and i are going to get along because ive known a lot of people like you so dont tell me about it because i got your ticket going in
now get up and get that paint of your fingers
doc moving like a gun dog on the hunt between the rows of lockers catching sight of the thief momentarily he closes in
after a series of criss crossed movements among the banked locker corriders doc again loses sight of the thief as the slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse
doc is faster and more agile than the thief but the station is unfamiliar territory to him
both doc and the thief move carefully they must not arouse enough attention to make themselves conspicuous thus risking police interference
the thief hurries along the main concourse weaving between the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long corridor
doc in pursuit down the concourse he passes several sealed off departure arrival gates
the thief steps off the concourse into gate three an open stairway winding downward
doc follows his quarry down the stairway to the train area where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the loading platform
emerging from the short tunnel doc isnt surprised that the thief is again nowhere in sight
doc steps behind a pillar he waits watchfully
after a moment or two the thief edges out from behind another column and starts back up the platform towards the concourse
doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but as the thief spots his approach he turns and joins several passengers scurrying toward the awaiting train
the flyer stands gleaming at trackside perpendicular to the boarding gate
two doors to the train stand open one in the pullman section the other entrance admitting day coach passengers
carol on the main concourse moving along with the flow of about to depart passengers
the flyer comes into sight visible on the next level below
the conductor at trackside stands smiling broadly by the coach entrance
he grins at the boarding passengers as he speaks to a nearby brakeman
the thief skirts around a baggage laden elderly couple and moves up the two step and into the rail car passageway
doc moving quickly again
he sees the thief slip past the conductor and into the train
the thief is now inside the day coach
he heads toward the forward compartments
doc expertly squirms through the boarding throng and disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car vestibule
carol watches as a blondish man in a grey suit skips aboard the flyer standing below
she is unable to get a clear look at the man and is unsure as to whether or not it was doc
she hesitates then moves forward to gate three which will take her down to trackside
carol stands at the edge of the gate the last of the crowd having already passed through
she hesitates again staring down at the shining train
the aisle is clogged with passengers
people hesitate over their selection of seats put baggage into overhead racks clumsily remove their overcoats
the thief continues to move forward squirming around the passengers at a hurried but controlled pace
doc enters threading his way forward scanning faces
he is one car behind the thief and losing ground due to the fact that doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he passes
doc is further delayed by a woman blocking the aisle
she struggles painfully trying to fit a suitcase into an overhead carriage
doc with the most forced of smiles reaches up to help her
the thief moves through another vestibule and into an
empty car now unobserved he immediately breaks into a run
the passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the front of the train
this car also deserted he maintains his trotting pace swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes
reaching the end of the smoker he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car but the thief is brought to a halt by the sudden
dead end of the passageway
the next car holds only baggage
he has reached furthest forward passenger car
the thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door hoping to escape by jumping off the train but the doors are tightly locked
he begins to retrace his steps
doc moves carefully into the next car forward still unknowingly two cars behind the thief
smoker his eye suddenly catching the mens lounge
he tries the door locked
the thief snaps out a pen knife picks the lock with a deft movement
passengers are visible behind him as he works filtering into the pullman car following the smoker
none of them notes his activity
the restroom door swings open
the thief immediately snaps the bolt lock shut behind him crosses the small murky room and tries to lift the window
he strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly jammed
doc enters the final passenger car notes the half dozen travelers and continues moving forward going next into the smoker
the smoking car is empty although several passengers and a porter enter it moments after doc leads the way
doc passes through the length of the car moves into the vestibule and like the thief a few moments before finds his passage blocked by the baggage car
doc hesitates then turns and begins going back in the opposite direction
doc stops at the mens lounge staring hard at the door for a moment
he tries the handle
the door remains firmly shut
appearing suddenly at docs shoulder be open five minutes out of the station
doc nods and moves away continuing to retrace his steps toward his point of entrance onto the train
the thief having abandoned the jammed window is now undoing the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed
the lid pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands
the thief grabs a money pad runs his thumb over it then shoves the stack of greenbacks into his coats inside breast pocket
doc moves with determination back through the passenger cars
the thief has again closed the suitcase
he nervously looks about his tight walled sanctuary then crosses back to the window and stares out through a corner of the pane
he pulls the shade lower
metal wheels grind against the rails the train shudders then begins to move forward
the thief is watching through the mens room window as the train edges forward
his body suddenly tightens
he sees doc outside the train walking slowly between a narrow passage of moving passenger cars and several parked tinders
cars walking cautiously ahead
as the flyer continues to move slowly forward doc disappears from view
the thief allows himself a quick smile
turning away from the window he picks up the suitcase unbolts the lock and steps back out into the vestibule
at the back of the smoker the thief seats himself next to a window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair opposite from him
in the forward position of the car well behind the thiefs back a dozen passengers are scattered about the lounge chairs
a conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the thief and begins to collect and punch tickets
as the train begins to pick up speed the thief lifts an abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him
he glances at the front page then unfolds the width of the paper
as a precaution against regaining poverty the thief rests one foot against the suitcase
all seems secure
then doc sits down next to the thief
thiefs neck pulling him close
softly almost gently when you pop a lock dont mark it
the thiefs knife instantly flashes into his hand but before he can bring it into play doc catches his arms
the knife is tightly wedged into the thiefs hand
docs fingers are vise like at his wrist
the other passengers remain pre occupied at the other end of the car taking no note of the quiet encounter
the conductor is still at the opposite end of the car from doc and the thief
he continues collecting and punching fares
loudspeaker the train has left
the conductor as seen by the thiefs widening eyes
he methodically punches the tickets never looking more than two seats ahead
the thiefs eyes bulge as doc chops him on the windpipe
the thief goes out
is he dead
doc pulls the thiefs hat down over his head
the soldier comes by stops
she doesnt recognize anything
thief are seated
he stops in the aisleway expectantly leaning in docs direction
as doc takes out his wallet peels a fifty out and gives it to him
end of the line
grumpily all right
the conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make change
down the highway
with his one good arm rudy cares for the kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat
talk a little harold loosen up
good for you
harold works his jaw his grip tightens on the wheel
chuckling at harold something ought to loosen him up
how comes were going to el paso rudy
i just want to find a suitcase
beynons body remains out of sight behind the overturned kitchen table
a small trickle of blood oozes out from under one of the table legs
the accountant stands with cully hayhoe and swain staring down at beynons body
they may still be going to nogales
what about laughlin in el paso
cover both get someone down there
either rudy and mccoys got half a million
theyve got to switch cars
put out the word
looking back at beynon what about jack
take him out in the country throw him down a dry well if you can find one
as doc thumbs idly through the newspaper
he is suddenly showered with spurting water
he lowers the paper and looks to the aisle seeing a seven year old black panther dressed appropriately and holding a water pistol
stick em up
doc looks at the brat
continuing im gonna shoot you
he squeezes the pistols trigger two bursts of water land on docs shirt front
doc continues staring at the boy
the kid looks hard at doc not giving an inch
come here a second
doc takes the boys arm gently pulls him closer
continuing look im sure youre a nice kid and that your mothers nearby
now you better get back to her real quick or im going to break your little arm
doc releases the boy
the kid looks at doc for a moment then bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the passenger car aisleway
doc again lifts the paper turning to the sports page
doc lifts the suitcase as the conductor appears at the vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the next stop
doc prepares to get off
the passenger car remains sparsely populated
no one occupies the seats near the corpse
carol sits watching the people she gets up doesnt know where to go
sits down again
fear and anticipation on her face
ready to go where
ready to sit down again she looks up
doc crosses slowly to her carrying the suitcase
pleased to see him
pleased that hes back
steely your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in huntsville
nailing him i wouldnt worry doc
i can always get you out
ill screw every prison official in texas if i have to
texas is a big state
i can handle it
ill bet you can
youd do the same for me wouldnt you doc
rising tone if i was caught wouldnt you
doc is silent
after a long pause
continuing quietly when we had trouble before it was different
nodding you dont like the way things are i dont like the way things what do you want to do
maybe we should split up
ill cut the money with you
do you mean that
i mean it
a long pause
maybe she wonders what if he is lying but what if he isnt
she makes up her mind
i dont want to leave
doc and carol watch through the double windows as the train yard lights of a town go strobing by
doc and carol come down out of the gangway of another train and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot
doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk
well grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes pick some up for me
grab some food now paper bag it we eat in the room
cutting in youve got all the answers
what about when they find the body on the train
when they find it they find it
to the cops a descriptions only good if theres a channel for it and theres no connection between that stiff and the robbery
youve got it all figured
looking at carol and thinking about beynon no
theres a couple of things im still working on
but doc doesnt answer
doc lies next to carol
carol is eating a hamburger wrapped in wax paper
she passes one over to doc along with some greasy french fries and a couple of napkins
the suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across the room
doc silently munches his hamburger
doc glances at the poster rolled up
carol hasnt put it up on the wall yet
the train goes clickety click through the night the young panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping passengers
his mother catches him takes him back to his seat
discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near her leg
behind her doc now in his undershirt reads a texas newspaper
carol continues to loosen the greenbacks
she is surrounded on the double bed by stacks of money
she lights a match drops it into the wastebasket
the money bands quickly burst into flames consume themselves then die back into crinkly ashes
not looking up there may be a hunting party
why theres nothing on the news
i didnt mean police
he continues thinking
carol watches him for a moment
tell me about it
doc looks across at her
calmly loredo is out
ive been thinking about rudy
if he was on his own were okay
if beynon bought him out
doc looks at her
if beynon bought him out and he talked then maybe beynons boys will be waiting for us in el paso
rudy knew about laughlins
youre full of ifs
i think you liked it with him
i think he got to you
at least i got to him
pause where do we go from here
the seven year old brat squeezes off several plumes of water
the thief is hit by the guns spray water runs slowly down his ear and the back of his neck
the boy watches the immobile man
he fires again once again there is no reaction
the brat steps forward
smiling he pushes the thiefs arm pushes harder
the thiefs body suddenly falls back across the chair
his eyes roll upward
staring at the panther
his neck is bruised he pushes his hat back slowly
very hoarsely get me a doctor
carol sleeps on her stomach her head resting across one arm
doc lies beside her eyes open
he looks over at carol a moment noting the long strands of hair that move rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing
after a moment doc quietly stands moves to the writing table and stares at the black suitcase
he opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn shade
still holding the money doc looks back at carol
printed clearly on the brown wrapper
a plainclothes officer holds a similar money pad with his handkerchief
the panther is sitting with his mother on a nearby seat
still dressed in his panther suit but no longer a brat
his face reflects both fear and shock
to the thief where did you get it
hoarsely it was a gift
carol comes in
she is wearing a new suit sandals it looks great
she tosses a package on the bed
doc looks at her outfit and opens his
they are too flashy
as carol starts to speak you look great just great
they could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes
that would be the first time
angry when are you going to learn
i did i killed a man
doc throws his clothes away
laughing and that could be all for you
carol suddenly angered slaps him
doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow
carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties his laces and pulls on his jacket
doc stuffs the colt
into the flapped outside pocket along with clips
he turns to the bed and picks up the suitcase
carol continues looking at doc
now you learn this time it could be the chair for both of us
carol starts to speak
continuing from now on you just shut up and do as youre told
if i hadnt killed beynon
you would have
doc doesnt answer
he turns and exits
printed at one side of the photographs are their criminal records
officers are seated within the communication room of the department
the transcriber comes to life as the cylinder receiver begins to turn
the cylinder now reveals doc mecoys face
yes thats him
no question about it
pointing to the thief how about him
hoarsely listen im a friend of the court
you are here because youre under arrest
on a bedstand
the frequency hand indicator glows with a yellow light
the man has been positively identified as carter doc mccoy only recently paroled from a penitentiary where he was serving time for armed robbery
he is believed to be travelling with his wife carol ainsley mccoy
ad libs rudy reaches over to the nightstand and shuts off the radio
his eyes stare vacantly ahead for a moment
harold clinton is tied securely into a chair his mouth tightly gagged
rudy begins to smile
fran is next to rudy within the bed wearing only a bra sleeping one arm wrapped around rudys middle
how you doing over there harold
you sleep okay last night
im glad to hear it
did you listen to the news
that means we dont have to drive so hard today harold
were gonna be travelling a lot faster than they are
we got a lot more time than i figured
rudy continues smiling
he pulls the sheet away from frank then allows his hand to reach down cupping her breast from inside the bra
fran half awakens pulls herself closer to rudy
hayhoe the accountant and the rest of the boys are sitting in the office waiting
rudy is driving now fran and harold are not speaking
doc and carol
doc is driving
they are also silent
cannon one of the accountants boys whom we have not seen before enters the dark nearly deserted lobby and approaches the reception desk
the large room is populated by overstuffed and threadbare furniture
laughlin looks very much like dub taylor and speaks spanish just about as badly
he flashes a quick grin from behind the counter as cannon draws near
at the switchboard behind laughlin carmen maybe sits next to the telephone jacks all of them idle readinc a movie magazine
friendly yes sir and thats my wife and thats junior
laughlin indicates a seventeen year old bellboy sleeping in one of the overstuffed chairs
i need a room
you came to the right place one thing we got is a lot of rooms
what else can i do for you
as it motors down the texas highway
the black suitcase is propped up between doc and carol in the front seat
doc seated on the passenger side bangs the car radio with his hand
the radio is obviously not working as he turns the dials and pushes the buttons
cajoling it cmon workl i almost pleading cmon
we hear garbled words for a moment pleasing doc
and then the radio conks out again
this time doc hits the radio hard
angrily to the radio give me the news
when it is clear that the radio wont work you cant trust anything these days
ill tell you something doc
one day youre going to have to trust somebody
doc slams the brake grabs the wheel as the car veers over to the side of the road
he opens the black suitcase want to see what i trust
in god we trust
he pulls out a bill and points at it the words on every bill
slamming the suitcase closed you keep it up and it wont matter how far we get away because its going to be all over between you and me
do you understand that
there wont be anything left
she starts the car up again and continues driving her knuckles tightening around the steering wheel
harold drives fran is again in the front seat beside her husband
a scrunched up sack of food beside her
she wipes her mouth with a napkin shoves it inside the paper bag then turns to watch the passing scenery
rudy sits in the back eating spareribs
he suddenly throws a just finished bone at fran hitting her on the shoulder
have a bone baby
he throws another sparerib at fran
shouts oh christ you wrecked my blouse
god damn it rudy what did you do that for
laughing ill tell you why i did it
it makes me feel good
he laughs and again throws another bone at fran
she suddenly catches his mood and begins laughing herself
tossing a bone back at rudy
harold continues driving
his knuckles whiten around the steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front of him
the kitten is sleeping within the cardboard box oblivious to rudy and frans laughter
that will be the day
the chevy moves along with the light mid day traffic passing various roadside business establishments then pulls up before a radio tv repair and sales shop
all the latest model radios are stacked on shelves around the small room
a television display featuring several models is in one corner of the shop
another tv is playing near the counter and the proprietors desk
the proprietor moves to a shelf
as docs picture suddenly flashes onto the tube with appropriate dialogue
doc staring at the television then he quickly reaches over and snaps the set off
the proprietor brings out some radios seemingly oblivious to docs action
to dollars take your pick
doc turns then looks at the corner of the small shop
all the television sets have docs picture on them
doc turns back to the proprietor the man is looking at him not at the sets
paying fifty taking a set he exits
you have change
but he doesnt answer
carol turns as doc sticks his head through the open door hands her the set
we got trouble
lets take a walk
doc and carol walking up the sidewalk op the small town
they turn into a sporting goods store
the chevy is behind them a block away
the proprietor looks carefully out the window at the empty car then turns and grabs his telephone
examine some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the street
doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store
an attendant moves up to help doc
with a smile can i help you
id like an invicta gauge pump with the twenty inch barrel
two boxes of double ought buck
gonna knock down a wall
big smile might try that
the salesman puts a form in front of doc then goes to the gun rack behind him lifts off a short barreled shotgun and begins to wrap it
the radio repairman exits the shop as a police car comes down the street and makes a u turn
stopping near the chevy
after a brief conversation the radio repairman goes back inside his store and the police car pulls forward down the street from the chevy
the two cops look like homer and jethro
both men stare hard at the now staked out chevy
as doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket carol turns looks at doc their eyes meet
doc reads her he knows that the police are in the street
be one hundred and eighty five thirty two
doc quickly pays the man
doc turns as the salesman drifts over to another customer he approaches carol at the store window
only one car
lets do it
carol moves ahead of doc exits the sporting goods store and starts up the sidewalk
homer and jethro continue staring at the chew
their car is pointed towards the radio store its back to the sporting goods house
doc leaves the sporting goods store crosses the street and begins walking up the opposite sidewalk back towards the chevy
the two rural cops move into action their car pulls forward and parks diagonally across the street partially blocking the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the chevy
car guns drawn
he levels his big gun
doc fires the shotgun through the brown wrapping paper point blank into the squad car caving in one side of the machine and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck
homer and jethro hit the ground paralyzed with fright as their car explodes behind them
with three more blasts doc blows most of the top off the police car then calmly reloads
slide those guns
the two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement
carol has instantly moved back into the chevy started the engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street
she makes a u turn then pulls up near doc
doc steps forward kicks the two pistols back under the police car near the gas tank
he walks to the back of the car
carol throws open the passenger door of the chevy
doc shoots the gas tank of the squad car it instantly ignites
walking calmly around the burning police car doc then starts to climb into the chevy
carol revs the engine
doc pauses a moment looking back at the prone police officers and the blazing automobile
carol guns the car forward doc unprepared for the chevys sudden movement falls flat on his face across the pavement
carol throws the chevy into reverse and roars back to pick up doc
doc a little chagrined picks himself up grabs his gun and jumps into the chevy
he slams the door closed carol again tears forward tires peeling down the pavement
homer and jethro raise themselves
with very long faces they study the burning remains of their once proud squad car
the chevy speeds out of town onto an open stretch of road
doc jams one more shell into his paper wrapped gun carol grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road
the chevy continues to accelerate
the chevy crosses the roads broken white line and passes a lumbering greyhound bus
doc staring at the highway behind them the bus fades off into the horizon
the chevy pulls off the highway moves up a dirt road for twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out farm smashing through the six foot
well out of sight the chevy slams to an abrupt halt
dirt road toward the highway
doc still carries his gun in the brown wrapping paper
carol labors with the suitcase as she runs
on the highway doc stands in the middle of the road waving both arms overhead
the greyhound bus comes to a lurching halt doc and carol scramble aboard
doc buys two fares from the scowling greyhound driver
the bus again moves forward
doc and carol sitting together on the bus doc hold l ing his camouflaged gun
they lean back on their padded seats as the bus jostles along the road
two police cars pass the bus sirens screaming lights turning
doc and carols eyes meet
one more black and white passes the bus and races on down the road
while leaning against a hot dog stand
one foot rests on the suitcase
the invicta has been re wrapped in a laundry bag
the paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot of doc
a grey mercury pulls up near the doggie diner
carol is driving
doc walks up to the window of the car
where are you going
doc opens the door and moves into the drivers seat
twenty eight hundred
as she looks at him he smiles are you hungry
he drives off
ive got to stop
s hands move over him ill tell you when
carol now driving pulls off the highway and into an oasis drive in restaurant
the mercury comes to a stop within a row of cars facing the indoor portion of the restaurant
doc and carol inside their automobile as the car hop a skinny girl wearing a brown jacket and slacks approaches the car carrying two menus
she arrives with a smile
doc leans forward looking past carol at the waitress he lifts his hand not accepting the bill of fare
thats okay honey
two cheeseburgers two coffees and a milkshake
how about fries
big smile why not
the car hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk towards the kitchen area
harold is tied to a chair rudy is lying on the bed half clothed eating chicken drinking a beer while fran slowly strips down to bra and panties
doc and carol watch as the car hop prepares to bolt the serving tray onto the car door window
could you roll it up part way
the girl clamps the tray to the window
the car hop narrows her features looking at doc and carol then smiles and turns and heads back toward the kitchen
carol begins to eat she looks casually at the mirror
carol reaches for her coffee spills it and then reaches for the light switch knob on the dashboard
the car hop at the pick up stand notes the lights then turns her head the opposite direction pretending not to see
the car hop stares at the cement pavement
within the kitchen behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot
their faces expectant
she made us
carol looks into the rear view mirror
across the wide lot a police car appears cutting in off the highway
doc goes into the back seat carol kicks the engine over jams the stick into gear
all this is accomplished while staring into the rear view mirror
doc lifts the laundry bag covered shotgun onto his lap
the police car cruises slowly along the line of autos
a riot gun
the squad car pulls to a stop fifteen feet behind the mercury seemingly blocking the way
carol stands on the accelerator
the mercury goes screaming forward as doc shoots out the back window
then as the terrified cops duck to the side he shoots out their front windshield
the mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll across the concrete
the car slams back down through a vacant space on the opposite side and moves around in a semicircle across the asphalt heading for the highway exit
doc smashes out the rear window with the butt of his shotgun
the black and white now in reverse zooming back trying to get between the mercury and the highway
she pulls the wheel to the right and brings her car across the front of the still stopping police car
the officers try to bring their guns into play as the mercury streaks in front of them
the police car explodes
the hood is lifted off the car
both officers jump out of the vehicle pouring shots after the retreating mercury
another squad car comes speeding up in the opposite direction
the driver hits the brakes the tires smoke along the street as the black and white screams to a stop
the police car the front and back fenders are hit the wheels disintegrate the impact of the shells rocks the black and white upward
the second passenger cop firing a
out his back window at the mercury as it streaks down the road
three holes open up on the trunk of the auto
doc can see both officers jump out of the second black and white through the rear window
carol makes a quick turn off the highway
commercial section suddenly slow makes another sharp turn this time through a red light
corner whips up to the curb doc and carol jump out of the car
she carries the suitcase he hangs onto his big gun
doc and carol moving down a deserted sidewalk the sound of sirens
they round a corner then quickly move into an alley
the alley is narrow deserted
doc and carol pull back into an alcove as a prowl car goes screaming down the street and off into the night
they continue down the alley
the opposite entrance to the alley is blocked by a large metal garbage container and the driver empties two cans of garbage into it
then he starts across the narrow street beyond in order to grab several others
doc looks behind him then grabs carols arm
they run for the container
doc tosses the suitcase into the container jumps in reaches back pulls carol in beside him
sirens again sound close by
after a moment a large garbage truck pulls up lifts the container with hooks and dumps the garbage and doc and carol into the truck
inside the truck
doc and carol start to panic but they have room enough
within the truck doc wiggles his
out of his jacket and into his hand
he carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly amongst the garbage
a moment after doc frees his gun a load of garbage descends on their shelter partially obscuring them
doc and carol sweating
again the sound of sirens
the truck lurches forward
the truck moves along the empty streets passing several prowling squad cars
the garbage man driving the truck making stops throwing in more refuse
the truck continues along
doc and carol their faces covered with perspiration and flies
buried within their enclosure under the moist garbage
the truck growls along the rutted pathway surrounded by acres of open trash
areas within the dump reveal the slow smouldering fires
the truck bed rises and tilts forward as the load of trash tumbles down the face of the crater
doc and carol slide down the mountain of filth and stumbling forward they climb into a large cardboard box
the driver gets out of the cab checks to see that the garbage is gone from the truck bed
on his way back to the cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto tire
with his newly found prize the driver re enters the truck and drives away
the box lies at the bottom of the crater amongst the broken bottles melon rinds flashlight batteries tin cans used tires
doc saws at a corner of the cardboard box with his penknife
the matted paper gives away allowing them more room within the box
i think so
i dont know
doc puts his hand to her face wiping away a thin trace of blood from a scratch
its not deep
carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while
doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the crate
the heat and the flies have become unbearable
carol begins to scratch her leg
dont scratch it just rub youll get an infection
carol ignores him she is in bad shape
continuing do what i tell you its not a game
its all a game dont bother me
doc stares at the garbage around them
we better stick here till tonight
doc smiles trying to get her to smile again
were going to make it
further down sure
carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled tweed suit
she looks away from doc
doc stares at her mussed hair and tear stained cheeks
i want to say something
quiet defeat i dont want to hear it
softly listen to me
its hard enough
carol turns back faces doc
their eyes find one another
continuing look what you said yesterday
i guess that was right
it isnt worth anything if we dont make it together
i dont think we can any more
if we ever get out of here maybe i should take off
we got this far
weve come a lot of miles
but were not close to anything
i guess youre right
i always thought jails make people hard
youre just not tough enough to forget about beynon
i chose you not him
either we pick it up or else we leave it right here
we got to go one way or another
setting the condition no more about beynon
whatever happens its over
not trusting his mouth sounds good
you want to try with me

i dont see how
a long moment
finally talcing docs arm okay
slow smile you and me
can we make it
we get to mexico we can have a life
thats all i want
its the only thing i have ever wanted
as she pulls herself against him im going to try and get it for you
they pull each other closer tightly holding one another
the fact that they have been seen in the north
fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets
calling softly harold youve had ten minutes get out of there
rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom
harold is hanging from a bracket
very dead and not very pretty
rudy looks at him then sits on the john continuing to read his paper
they hold one another tightly fighting the cold and the relentless roar of metal wheels
carol and doc are the only customers
they sit in booths while their clothes are being cleaned doors open at bottom
cannon watches them from across the room carefully cleaning his teeth with a cinnamon toothpick
laughlin leads rudy and fran down the dark walled hallway stopping before room number l
laughlin turns the key in the lock opens the door
its hard to figure
theres something about the composition of the track at pimlico
you cant go by the clock any speed horse take a second off any other track in the country
continuing but a speed horse is the only thing that consistently holds form
they got to let em run dumb god damn trainers try to rate em just breaks their heart
rudy kicks the door shut with a slam grabs laughlins shoulder spins him around hits him full in the stomach
as laughlin begins to fall rudy catches him wallops him again in the mid section then throws him back into a ratty armchair
rudy instantly pulls out his
and shoves it hard against laughlins mouth
okay sweetpea you get two choices
live or die

still breathless just tell me
first things first

the black suitcase is on the ground
across the street from the bench is laughlins
four stories of red brick
the switchboard is now vacant

he picks up the room key
doc starts for the elevator

doc gives laughlin a half pissed look then crosses to the elevator and pulls the cage door open
laughlin watches the rickety self service elevator move upward
he reaches for the desk phone
fran wearing only a bathrobe is doing her nails while watching an old movie on the black and white tube seated on the bed
the phone begins to ring
fran looks over to rudy from her overstuffed armchair
okay grunt pick it up
she walks slowly carrying the heavy suitcase
reaching the door to room oj carol knocks rapidly three times waits then raps out two sets of two knocks
the door swings open and doc stands within the archway
doc shuts the door and slips his arms around carol revealing his
automatic in one hand
rudy is spinning the chamber on his
then shoves it into his coat pocket
fran is getting dressed in the middle of the room her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines of the bra and girdle
the calico kitten sleeps peacefully in its cardboard box
carol is in the shower steam hangs in the air as she vigorously soaps her body cleansing herself of the residue left from their cross country flight
doc in the main room is standing at the large windows facing across to the building next to laughlins
the fire escape is one story beneath him
doc crosses throws the suitcase on the bed undoes the straps and snaps lifts the lid open
he stares at the huge amount of money for a moment then digs into the suitcase reaching down to the bottom
he withdraws his hand holding four visas
he puts two of them on the bureau drawer top
the other two he begins to tear into sections and places them into a large ashtray
he touches a match to the scraps
the flames curl around rudys photograph in the ashtray
automatic sits beside it
docs overcoat also lies across the bedpsread near it the wrapped shotgun
the poster is again on the wall
carol still in the bathroom of room
she wears only a slip
carol is washing out her bra and panties in the washbasin using a coarse bar of soap
doc enters he begins taking off his shirt

as rudy and fran emerge from their room
the door shuts behind them rudy guides fran to the stairs
back of his skull
tired he closes his eyes rests the side of his head against the tile
carol still wearing the slip she lies back across the bed
her eyelids slowly fall shut
carol has pushed the suitcase overcoat and
off to one side
rudy and fran come down the stairs
rudy puts one hand inside his overcoat
the accountant and hayhoe ride in the back seat
carol is napping lightly on the bed as doc bursts out of the bathroom
again dressed in his shorts holding his pants in one hand
get upi carols eyes snap open
continuing were moving now
he quickly pulls his pants on
what is it
hes always got his family around
that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses
if they are not here he must have sent them away
rudy and fran step into the hallway toward room l a passing several rooms
frans face is taut
rudy starts his nervous grin
hard get your clothes on move your butt
she looks at him doesnt move

i want to get some rest
she is interrupted by a hard knock on the door
doc drops his shirt to the floor
he quickly reaches down lifts his
doc gestures to carol
she moves towards the door
continuing now at doorway who is it
fran stands at the door to
rudy is at her shoulder he has taken out his revolver
its your food i brought up your sandwiches
carol standing near the door
looks at doc
he mouths and half whispers stall
doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket crosses the room to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room
he begins forcing the lock

after a moment i cant do that maam
you have to pay now so i can pay back the boy that went out and got the food
doc working on the door his
shoved into the waistband of his pants
carol thinking hard
youll have to hold on a minute my husbands in the shower
doc breaks the lock and opens the door he quickly crosses the dark apartment moves to the front door slips out his automatic then gingerly cracks the door
his eyes tighten in amazement as he sees
rudy standing slightly behind fran his
held tightly up to the door jamb ready for instantaneous use
rudy and fran are feet down the hallway from docs slightly opened door
they both have their backs turned to him in three quarter fashion
bare chested he decides on a course of action
the door swings quietly open
within the hallway doc closes the distance between himself and rudy in two swift strides rudy turns swinging his gun too late as docs
crashes against his head
rudy looks at doc still smiling eyes glazed
he falls abruptly
doc stands over the fallen body
fran continues to scream
doc finally turns away from rudy looking now at the screaming woman
he flattens her with a left hook to the jaw
fran drops to the floor as if she had been shot
suddenly everything in the corridor is silent
rudys head is bloodied
he lies without movement
open it up its me
carol swings the door open
doc bursts back into the room grabs his shirt begins to button it
continuing come on come on
who was it
just get your clothes on
as doc and carol come back out of they step over the fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator
carol stops as she recognizes rudy
doc pulls her along forcing her to keep moving
carol again carries the brown suitcase doc holds the shotgun
they go down the back or front stairs
in the lobby of laughlins
within an alcove behind and to one side of the desk the area serving as an office cully swain and hayhoe have stretched laughlin across the pine desk
the accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the hotel acting as lookout
cully inside the alcove lifts a snapped off leg of the heavy chair to use as a club
the thug turns back to the desk where swain and hayhoe have laughlin pinioned
just tell us the room number
laughlin looks back at cully
he is very frightened but says nothing
now you want to tell me
the other guys in
sure about that
he again whacks laughlins knee
doc and carol emerge moving quickly for the
they get five steps before simultaneously seeing the accountant
doc and carol freeze for an instant
the accountant snaps his fingers twice
cully lowers his club looks to the accountant as do swain and hayhoe
the accountant smiles staring at doc and carol
calmly to his men out here
cully swain and hayhoe appear from the alcove behind the accountant
they look over his shoulder toward the rear of the hotel their eyes finding doc and carol
carol continues to hold the suitcase up in front of herself almost like a shield
the distance between doc and carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk
carol edges backward a few steps toward the massive wooden staircase
just have her set it down
docs hand comes out of his coat pocket a slow gesture revealing that his palm is empty
you want it
come and take it
quietly get him
as the three men reach for their guns
doc moves much paster
he ducks to the right levels the disguised shotgun and fires in the same movement
the reception desk near the accountant splinters from the blast and he is hit painfully
the other three men duck away from the sudden burst of fire power
hayhoe levels his pistol at the retreating couple another shot from docs riot gun
this one breaking open the floor at hayhoes feet and cutting him down at the knees
cannon cully swain and max open fire as they dive for cover
they miss their shots digging up walls stairs and flooring
on the winding stairway doc and carol flee upward she struggles with the heavy suitcase doc transfers the riot gun to his left hand pulls out the more accurate
to use with his right
cully and the accountant run to the elevator enter it pull the door shut
swain and hayhoe limping and cannon and max start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of doc and carol
all the men save the accountant now have guns in their hands
swain and hayhoe cautiously going upward
still below the first level landing their eyes search overhead
the sound of doc and carols pounding feet can be heard
hayhoe leans out over the banister points his gun directly up and fires
doc and carol between the first and second floor landings as hayhoes bullet tears by ripping through the wooden banister supports
inside the elevator the accountant and cully watch the arrow indicator pass two
doc aiming his
resting it on the banister he fires two shots back down the stairwell
swain and hayhoe moving up the steps two at a time suddenly hayhoes leg buckles as a
slug tears through his hip the other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder
swain is now beside the banister he points his l revolver straight up
doc and carol as swains bullets break around them
doc pulls carol down lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell with a huge roar
the staircase ten feet in front of swain is smashed by docs blast
swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to continue moving upward
cully pulls open the door moves out into the corridor
the accountant remains within the elevator
carol on the stairway above as the shots smash past runs ahead of doc by three steps
they pass the second landing keep moving upwards towards the third
docs focus of attention is downward
he knows that he and carol are being pursued up the stairwell but he isnt aware of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces
his head bloodied from docs heavy pistol he slowly wobbles to his feet
rudy looks down at fran
she sobs violently her back leaning against the wall
rudy picks up his
then stumbles into the open door of doc and carols room
he unsteadily crosses to the bathroom closes the door
carol frantically moving upward doc has now fallen five steps behind
cully walks cautiously down the corridor pistol raised
he moves toward the landing having covered one quarter of the distance from the elevator
the accountant is still within the elevator
carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for doc
the sound of swains pistol and docs answering
carol senses a movement she turns and sees cullys gun leveled at her
as carol screams doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor
his plane of movement knee high
the riot gun in his left hand
in his right
cully is hit in the chest by buckshot
the killing wounds fling him upward as he fires his own gun
his aim destroyed by the death blows the bullets stray above carol high of their mark
the corridor wall near the elevator is smashed by one of the riot guns jumbo shots as is the top of the elevator
the plaster flies away revealing further damage
the cables are smashed the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward
the mechanism transfers over line catching within the pulley housing
the line snaps taut halting the speeding car
above the floor level
the accountant bounces from the floor of the car to the ceiling then back to the floor
laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain
he sees the suspended car through the iron grill door
the accountant lies completely still on the floor of the elevator
his head and neck twisted at an oblique angle
he jams several shells into his riot gun while holding his ready for an appearance by swain
reloading completed he stands with carol
he again begins to move upward
doc stops sets both the riot gun and the
on the banister
on the winding staircase below him there is a dark movement
the stairwell around swain disintegrates
the thug is obliterated by the firepower
doc cannot see the effect of his shots
he again resumes his flight upward
rudy holds his bloody head in the sink bowl dumbly splashing water over himself
carols underwear is still present
rudys pistol lies on the soap tray
the landing as doc and carol come pounding into view
no further avenues open they turn down the corridor
doc grabs carol and pushes her into the room past fran he kicks the door shut
doc grabs the suitcase runs to the window tears off the shade lifts the frame looks
the drop is too far
he grabs carol and runs into the hallway
they run down two doors and break in
over the door is the sign fire escape
doc helps carol out onto the fire escape
he aids her with his left hand the riot gun now clutched tightly in his right
he motions she hands him the suitcase and follows
they descend the fire escape
they reach the end
the fire escape stays rigid
doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps
he turns and with the suitcase crosses to the end
throws the bag and the shotgun across the foot gap to the retaining wall preparing to jump
rudy comes out of the room onto the fire escape holding his
he looks down at doc then slowly raises his gun
doc is hit in the side flesh wound
in the air he spins and lands
rudy fires again and again as he runs down the fire escape
doc rolls picks up the shotgun and fires
rudys time has come
the jumbo charges mash him back against the wall and off the fire escape
carol runs almost staggering and gets ready to jump the six feet
the fire escape
begins to sink
carol looks at doc mutely as she sinks beneath the retaining wall
his hand out jump
and she does
he catches her and pulls her up
they look at one another for a long moment then he stands and helps her to her feet and leaving the shotgun behind they walk into the alley
in a parking lot at the end of the alley slim a tough grizzly western is about to pull out
doc opens the back door and carol gets in
doc opens the front door as slim turns and looks at him
in hand pointing drive
he lets out a yell and guns across the lot over the four foot drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the street
grinning how was that
smiling in spite of himself just fine
where we go in
id like to find a quiet place to cross
the car pulls forward as the light blinks to green
as the car passes an intersection several police cars can be seen arriving at the front of laughlins
the car continues moving up the street then makes a right onto a larger boulevard
doc half turns to carol
nodding where do we go from here
i dont know airport i guess
they will have our description before we can get a plane
way down yeah
i guess you aint gonna shoot me are you
i kinda doubt it
slim is obviously pleased that some excitement has come into his life
ill cooperate dont worry about that
yes sir ive had some trouble with the law myself
doc and carol look at the man
three years ago i dynamited some fish at the reservoir
beginning to laugh oh my god
that little job cost me a hundred dollars
didnt even get to keep the fish
resigned to the insanity of the moment lets just get to the border
sure thing mister its coming right up

quiet crossing that is
at the white line a mexican customs officer emerges from the station house
as he looks inside the car
speaking right up chihuahua

the official smiles and motions them past
juarez chihuahua city road

slim stops the car near the soft shoulder of the dirt road
doc looks at slim

doc turns to carol

as she begins to open the suitcase
youre going to have to walk back to the border

slim steps out of the car carol moves into the front seat as doc slides behind the wheel
continuing leaning through the window hope you get to where youre going
hope you do too
by the way youre getting a hell of a car there mister
laughs well i paid a hell of a price
now for gods sake keep your mouth shut
his pride hurt wish you hadnt said that
when slim canfields lips are sealed theyre sealed
smiles go with god
doc slips the car into gear
one thing though
how do i explain this to my wife
tell her you robbed a bank
the car pulls forward
slim waves goodbye then turns and begins walking back down the highway
are we going to make it
hell i dont know
but we sure gave it a run
positive with a small smile whatever happens
were going all the way
smiles yeah why not

i guess we are
after a moment why dont you try the news
carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a mexican announcer is heard
no more news from now on were just going to listen to music
she spins the dial
mariachi music comes on
they are walking along the highway the edsel is now a dot in the background
another dot appears grows bigger as it gets closer it is a bus
very mexican but very greyhound in appearance
doc and carol turn doc flags it down
it pulls to a stop they board
the bus pulls out
mexico rolls by outside the window
they look at each other and smile
doc and carol look back
the black panther is leaning over the seat his empty fist cocked up like a pistol
pulling the trigger bang
doc and carol look at him
