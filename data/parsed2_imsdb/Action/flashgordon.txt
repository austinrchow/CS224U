at first only darkness then the rising sun paints in an endless savanna from horizon to horizon
we hear savage drums beating in the distance coming from some unknown place
the sun clears the horizon
suddenly it changes amazingly the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions from yellow to green to purple to an incredible blood red
from it shoots a red lightning bolt
the sky echoes with thunder
we hear a howling ethereal wind but not a twig of the brush stirs as bolt after bolt of red lightning rips the sky with each one a title or
under final credit snow is beginning to fall on the burning blood red savanna
is a twin otter with the logo of some commuter airline
it buzzes along over pleasant countryside through a sky thats almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds
there are just two passengers in the cabin
one is dale arden a great looking dark haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled karate for the single girl
a guide to survival in the city
a few rows forward near the open door into the pilots compartment is flash gordon
hes studying a football play sheet one of those diagrammed things with xs and s for the players and dotted line arrows indicating the directions of movement
suddenly the plane makes a violent bump
it almost knocks the book from dales hand
she looks out the window with sudden fright tossing hair out of her eyes in a gesture thats habitual to her in moments of stress
theres nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds
she looks forward again and watches flash standing up easily leaning in t
e cockpit doorway to speak to the pilots
what was that fellas
clear air turbulence is all
nothing but nothing youd want to toss a third down pass through either grinning back at can i have an autograph for my kid mr
sure my pleasure
as flash takes a bit of paper from the co pilot the plane takes another jolt even more violent than the first
call westchester approach see what theyve got
i sure hope we dont have to turn back
i mean this is first day of training camp i wouldnt want to be seat belt time
flash starts back to his seat
the plane jumps again shudders violently
he holds on calls up front maybe itd be smoother if you went will you shut up
as flashs head look mister flash gordon they have their hands full just let em drive
the plane buffets
flash is sent reeling catches hold of the rack above dale lowers himself into the seat next to her
he buckles fast takes out a candy bar and offers it to her
when youre nervous it can help to chew on something thanks a lot i look dumb enough to take candy from a stranger
im not a stranger exactly you know my name
number one draft pick cover of people mag whatd the giants sign you for eighty nine million
god i hate flying im dale arden its crazy of me to hate flying im a travel agent you see
ive just been checking out a little hotel in vermont can i still have that candy bar
and in the same breath are we going backward
look at the clouds
the pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to surround the airplane
over the engines we hear that same ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening
slowly and terrifyingly the sun starts turning blood red
the clouds race faster faster until they are actually streaming past the plane from behind
flash and dale faces bathed in the eerie light
speechless dale grasps the football players hand with all her strength
it is a huge and rambling antique standing in semiruinous isolation in a pretty country landscape
the sun has turned
the same blood red we saw from the airplane and clouds race across it with unnatural velocity
in the center of the greenhouse rises a glass paned tower through which we glimpse something mirror bright
floating high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium filled balloons secured by wires
as we move closer we discern a man moving about actively on a platform inside the central tower about half way up the man is dr
hans zarkov big bearded feverish looking and seemingly half mad with exhaustion
in striking contrast to the antique greenhouse exterior here there are all kinds of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash fashion
quantities of neglected plants most brown and dead or dying hide the works in here from outside view
as zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays a grim voiced tv
newsman is appearing and speaking from a good sized television screen above the main control console the extraordinary weather disturbances reported from africa this morning are now crossing the atlantic
and are expected to reach the east coast of the united states by noon
according to scientists at nasa the earth is being struck by an immense stream of cosmic energy apparently the result of some catastrophic stellar accident beyond the reaches zarkov whirls
slams the tv sound off and yells at the silently mouthing newsman on the screen
cant you understand
this is no accident its an attack
an attack planned by a mind
this is munson a scared looking assistant comes running up the stairs with a computer print out sheet
look at the report from the last balloon
zarkov grabs it eyes it
i predicted it didnt i
yes sir you sure did
and this funny sun too ozone layer starting to crack up
by tonight carbon dioxide will be combining with free nitrogen to form breaks off crumpling well this is it
sir the president is on the tv behind what the hell do i care
i tried to warn him he called me mad like all the others
the tv screen explodes in a fine shower of glass
time for us to go munson
get your toothbrush and whatever
up and at him
stunned munson turns his head and glances at something big and mirror bright gleaming behind foliage in center of tower
perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes zarkov pulls out a revolver and points it at munson
i cant handle the capsule alone get your toothbrush
the pilots watch these clouds also transfixed with disbelief
they speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe
whats e word from westchester approach bill
all chanels dead
reacting to the panel say get a load of the vors
the directional needles are going crazy
all the instruments are going crazy
displays flash impossible symbols
the pilot gapes at them a moment then returns his gaze to the sky and swallows
on the left about six oclock high
the racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some surreal painting
from the cortex laser like bolts of red lightning shoot out
like a missile one zaps right over the planes nose with a horrible crackling noise
hold on tight lets put baby down right here
the co pilot reaches up and hits the flap control
there is a whooshing crackling zap
the whole cockpit flares out with an intolerable blinding flash of red light
the cockpit door flys off its hinges admitting a gale of wind that scatters flashs play sheets like autumn leaves
flash unsnaps his belt leaps up and races forward
the two pilots are gone vanished without trace
wind from the shattered windows assaults flash as he charges in
he stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive
recovering he scrambles into the left hand seat grabs hold of the bucking wheel yoke pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals
dale lurches in against the tornado
can you fly it
i can fly all right ive had a couple of lessons
just dont if i can land
grab that other wheel
help me pull her up
dale staggers into the co pilots seat pulls back on the wheel in front of her
ever hear about the man who fell ninety stories from a window and didnt break a bone
no but id sure like to
howd the man fall ninety stories didnt break a bone
the window was ninety one stories up
the earth is approaching fast wheeling and tilting
we get a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a flat area
another barrage of crackling red lightning bolts shoot all around the plane but just miss it
brace yourself im aiming at that field up ahead
its thousands of panes reflect the red sun and the red bolts which rain down in intermittent bursts
one strikes an end of a gallery exploding glass and foliage
from inside we hear a furious echoing voice i see you munson
come out or i shoot
zarkov is on the lower stairs of the tower aiming his revolver
munson emerges from some dry brown bush where he was hiding
so whats it matter if im shot or go up in that thing
im a goner either way right
of course i admit that
but this way youll be giving your life for a chance of saving earth
havent you any spirit at all
goodbye doctor they were all right about you
have a nice trip
munson starts walking away toward the door at the end of the long side wing
i tell you i cant take it off alone
if you wont come who will i find
if you woot come who will i find munson ignores him totally keeps walking away
zarkov lifts his revolver and draws a bead on the mans back
just as he is about to shoot he reacts to something outside
amazingly a twin otter is gliding in to a horribly rough landing in the field outside
the plane hits on one wheel bounces into the air comes down again and keeps right on rolling toward the greenhouse
seeing the onrushing plane freezing an instant then starting to run
he hardly gets five yards before the twin otter comes slamming in through the greenhouse wall burying munson totally under the wreckage
crazily angled filled with dust and smoke
dazed blood on his forehead flash struggles from his seat
are you all right
flash gordon you have just made me a giant fan for life
come on lets get out before she blows
flash helps her from the wrecked seat wheels and kicks out the emergency exit in the cockpit area
flash lowers dale to the ground jumps down after her
zarkov is there smiling at them in a strange way
im flash gordon this is miss dale arden delighted to see you
this crazy storm knocked us down could we use a phone
just follow me up those stairs
some weather huh
it will get worse
zarkov turns and smiles at them again as they start up the tower stairs
suddenly dale stops short staring at zarkov with a funny expression
zarkov hesitates just an instant the nods
how did you know
i saw you in people mag
after you left nasa remember
it said you were utterly dale breaks off almost biting her tongue
off my rocker
i forget what it said flash lets find some other phone okay
im sure dr
zarkov is very busy
flash is baffled but he gets her urgent look
well all right but it seems to me we ought to now its flashs turn to break off
zarkov is pointing a gun at him
up the stairs to the tower
ahead of me quick
as they gape at him quick i said we havent much time earth is being attacked
theres only one slim chance of saving it
mister you are insane
howl of ether wind increases
storm of red laser bolts
glass showers them as parts of the green house explode and dry foliage bursts into flame
up the stairs run
zarkov jabs the revolver into dales back
red bolts zap around
flash whispers to her as they start running up ahead of zarkov
go with the flow wait for a chance
below them bottom of staircase disintergrates in a red flash
zarkov rips away a screen of foliage revealing a mirror bright capsule seamless but for one door
he yanks that open
on every side things are blowing up and burning under the merciless rain of bolts
one strikes the capsule head on but does not even leave a mark
i need your help to take off
get in or i shot you dead
dale gasps and shrinks back
take off for where
god only knows whatever black corner of space this is coming from wherever he is
well plunge into the devils heart and destroy him
well die ourselves of course but our names will be honored till the end of time
look doc i dont book kamikaze tours never
flash is poised to jump but zarkov suddenly pushes dale off balance into the capsule
flash leaps after her
it is curiously transparent from the inside mirrored only on the exterior
there are some controls and displays but in general the interior is severely ascetic as far removed from conventional spacecraft as zarkovs solitary genius is from everyday science
immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity zarkov waves the gun at flash
sit down there
foot on the red pedal
zarkov wheels and pulls the door shut
flash jumps him
he punches zarkov in the gut
zarkov slams him back with the well known strength of a madman
flash clobbers him again
falling zarkov dives sidewards and hits a switch
the capsule whines softly and begins to whirl
looking out through the transparent wall it is as if the capsule itself was motionless and the scene outside is whirling
whats left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those laser bolts flashing fire that makes us dizzy
flash staggers to his feet and finds dale folds his arms around her protectively
the centrifugal force is rapidly increasing now throws them both against the wall
faster and faster whirling the force presses dales body back against flashs until they are almost one flesh
we move over and find zarkov plastered against another part of the whirling capsule his face drained white and distorted by the terrific g force operating here now his lips
moving as he speaks with enormous effort friendship
built this to send to them in
the end now
end of the world
unless we every sound an effort unless
zarkovs eyes close
he loses consciousness
totally ablaze within now one huge fantastic jewel of fire
the whole central tower explodes outward
from the inferno a mirror bright capsule slowly rises hovers begins picking up speed again as it ascends
whirling whirling invincibly unharmed by the laser bolts which glance off it again and again accelerating up into space
the earth recedes below into a ball red hued under the fantastic sun
a fast approaching light flares up against the mirrored surface and is recognised as our moon
it flashes past follows earth into e distance
all around the sky darkens into the void of space
they hurtle past the capsule in rapid sequences a sudden gauntlet of careening asteroids all sizes from tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as africa
mammoth jupiter with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of deadly methane clouds more than miles deep
the red patch on its surface is a storm miles across which has raged without intermission for earth centuries
through the rings of saturn in a dazzling lightstorm of blazing ice crystals
neptune pluto outermost uranus
one after another the planets are left hurtling behind wheeling in their concentric orbits the entire solar system dwindling into nothing
it tilts and wheels wondrously as the capsule passes through the middle of it
considering that this nebula is probably a million light years from edge to edge we get some notion of the capsules speed
curving light rays from another galaxy are drawn fantastically together and then simply disappear as they are pulled in by the unimaginable gravitation force of is thing
we see the capsule tiny curving and spinning along amidst the mind blowing display of light rays sucked along with them then simply disappearing as it too enters the void
visible again gleaming in an amber glow
suddenly a dancing grid of lines appears over it making us realise that we must be seeing it on some kind of screen
it blurs out of focus comes back again more sharply as some adjustment has apparently been made
deep in shadow gleaming with evil amusement
curve of lip flare of nostril fold of eyelid gleam of shaven scalp each a menacing landscape of sensual shadow as they survived our black hole
shall i drown them in the sea of fire
later klytus i think we will look at them first
through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is rapidly slowing down
the three voyagers are crumpled on the floor against the wall in strange attitudes flashs arms still holding dale
they seem semi conscious as if dropped
an amber glow bathes them and soon we see its source
a huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall
it is mongo
its curved surface is a pure sea of amber fire molten lava with great tongues of flame erupting horrifically
zarkov blinks struggles to focus his eyes
he succeeds with horror sees where they are headed
making a choking sound zarkov stirs and tries to crawl over to a control panel
he pushes switches
the capsule keeps on going down
a great leaping tongue of fire licks it
suddenly just as destruction seems imminent the capsule miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the remaining flames
it races through them
a shadow passes over mongo as the capsule passes through a wall of purple vapor and emerges above a totally different landscape
a dozen various colored clouds sweep past in silent majesty
the capsule slows hovers starts straight down into a sea of high grass
in the distant b
against an extraordinary sunset sky rises the shimmering city of mongo
a place of many levels golden tiers and turrets towers flags and pennants
it is like something dreamed
several strangely armored men watch the mirror bright capsule descending slowly
the leader waves and they all start toward the capsule
gentle bump as the thing touches down
by god we did it
we made it
made it where doctor
i dont know
suddenly dale gasps reacting to something she sees through the transparent from within wall
they all look around and see those strange men approaching
suddenly i like it in here just fine the door of the capsule is opened from the inside
zarkov and dale and flash get out
the men stop
long beat as the two parties gaze at each other the first human eye ever to see an extraterrestrial being
flash walks up to the leader
hello my names flash gordon can you understand me
were from earth we come as friends
extend your hand
thats the gesture of friendship known everywhere
with a warm grin flash extends hi right hand
with lightning speed a manacle is slammed on flashs wrist and he is thrown to the ground as other red men advance to handcuff dale and zarkov
you are prisoners
i will take you now to ming the merciless ruler of the universe
groggily flash lifts his head towards zarkov
thanks doctor next time ill call my own play
another strange glimpse through an opening
some fierce tethered beast is being goaded and tormented by mongo men as in an elizabethan bear baiting
on the floor lies the tor n body of one man who apparently got too close
dale has one brief horrified glimpse of this then turns her head away and shuts her eyes as shes marched along
just do what im doing
flash what are you doing
shutting my eyes dreaming i booked us to disneyland
a gigantic statue comes into view amidst topless columns at the end
light plays over it in ever shifting patterns
as we come nearer we see that this statue is cut out in the middle to form a throne
ming the merciless sits in the throne niche silent gazing down on the prisoners as they are marched to a halt before him
hail great one without mercy
a hundred reduplicated echoes of that shout ring through unseen reaches of the palace
ming bends his head slightly in acknowledgement points idly at the armored men at the left of the group
as flash dale and zarkov are marched along by many armored men perspectives are bewildering curvilinear surfaces
bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable dimension
we pass an archway opening into what seems to be an amuseme nt arcade
glimpse of mongo people playing amazing electronic games while mongo go go girls cavort on a platform to unearthly music
fantastic into a black hole and out the other side to this
who said hans zarkov was mad
look down over a balcony from a moving pov
a fencing glass is in session
six pairs of men go at each other with magic swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the blades clash
thrust parry slash
the head of one duellist explodes in a bloodless fountain of fire
you got us into this how do we get out
were being taken to ming getting at him is our only hope of saving earth
zarkov im about to show you what it feels like to be clipped by a new york giant flash its no use hes too crazy
step forward soldier
the designated one marches two paces forward halts
are you loyal to ming
would you die for him
fall on your sword
instantly the armored man pulls his sword rips open his breast plate sets the sword hilt down on the floor and plunges forward on to the fatal point
with a little cry of horror dale shrinks back into flashs arms
you inhuman fiend
of course im inhuman
thats a compliment
dropping his voice pathetic earthlings forever wondering if you are alone in the universe beaming you plaintive messages into to the void for anything that might hear you even hurling
your bodies out into it and all without the faintest inkling of who or what is out here
if you had known anything anything at all about the true nature of the universe you would have hidden from it in terror
there is a low throaty laugh from the shadows
flash and dale turn their eyes quickly in its direction
emerging half into the light beside a column fondling the head of an obscure beast slouching between her legs
voluptuous beyond her years fiercely erotic aura looks flash boldly up and down as the beast hisses with the pleasure of her touch
flash cant take his eyes off her
no normal man could
flash swallows with a dry throat as auras gaze devours him
dale gets the electricity going on gives him a poke and whispers watch it fella you came with me
aura laughs again sidles up toward ming
we dimly see a couple of mutant creatures dragging away the lifeless body of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty
you know who ming is now who are you and why do you come to mongo
im flash gordon of the new york giants this is dale arden dr
zarkov hijacked us in an effort to save ming looks questioningly at klytus sirs earth is the meaningless planet you are in the process of obliterating
pouncing on that in the process
you mean earth still exists
for the moment not for much longer
what in hell have we ever done to hurt you
you exist and yet you pay no homage to ming
what greater crime can be committed
the palace rings with an answering chorus voices of all the armored men and numerous others presently unseen including many women
hail great one without mercy
come closer dale arden let me see you
dale doesnt move
ming takes a step down narrows his eyes and gazes at her intensely
this guys personal magnetism is enormous
as if irresistibly drawn dale steps forward
ming moves his hand in a gesture
a sourceless golden light bathes dale sensuous musical chords are heard
dales lips open slightly her color heightens her rate of breathing increases
ming touches her flesh lightly
flash tense ready to spring
this woman will amuse you
klytus can see the future eh
he can foresee it but for a few moments only
it gives him a unique gift for survival and treachery
id like to study his beta factors i wager i could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise
peering at klytus tell me when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle
ming flashes a glance of interest at zarkov then addresses the leader of the armored men
chain this one up
preserve him for further examination
zarkov is roughly seized
flash starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away
oh no you dont
we came together and were staying together
languidly ming indicates flash gordon with a pointed finger
that one is useless to us
remove him and kill him
flash wheels back at ming as dale steps in front of her friend
you dirty old bastard can kill me too
wetting her lips moving sinuously to whisper to ming
dont kill him yet father
give him to me
what would your prince barin say
i can handle barin
really aura your appetites are too monstrous even for our family
this could cause great trouble with barin i must forbid it
aura touches the rime of mings ear with her tongue as she but you adore me father you ca refuse me nothing
as ming steps quickly away from his super provocative daughter and indicates dale
take the earth woman to our quarters
bathe and annoint her for our pleasure
a hooded guard comes from shadow moves towards dale
flash starts around to defend her but before he can do it dale has made her own move
quick as lightning she flattened the hooded guard with a perfectly executed city girls kick to the balls
dale is astonished at her own prowess
my god and i thought that book was another rip off watch out
three more hooded guards are emerging from the shadows towards
flash flies at them
an elbow in the mouth disposes of one
he seizes the mans mace like club as he falls uses it quickly to knock cold the other two
auras eyes shine at flashs prowess
fascinated she runs her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth
panting braced flash stands in front of dale with raised mace
unearthly martial music comes in a glissando from the cavernous space above
to its tempo mings personal guards now starts appearing
they are all a race of amazon warriors and the most amazing thing is that they all have the same face
from left to right back and front the amazons advance n flash and dale
they do not attack merely stun ad overwhelm us with their massive silent answerable threat
flash swallows looks this way and that stands as if paralysed
low and tremulous whats the play flash
i cant i just cant cant what
clobber a woman dale you damn fool those arent women theyre murderous amazon dykes
the amazons are all around dale now
flash is paralyzed by indecision one beat more then suddenly makes up his mind
he flies into action slams the nearest pair of amazons
fast and furious
great havoc is wreaked by dale and her karate by flash and his flailing fists but the amazons numerical superiority is of course decisive
soon flash is on the floor pinioned by a dozen amazons
he looks up with despairing eyes sees poor dale being dragged up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper gloom
the pitiful shout sends flashs adrenaline rushing
with a superhuman effort he fights free from the pile up and dashes after dale
flash struggles to get through to dale
dale claws fiercely at the bare amazon arms and shoulders that engulf her reaches desperately back down for flash
just touching their fingertips
opens like a yawning trap door under flashs feet
flash drops away with a yell in the very instant that aura comes running into the shot and boldly jumps after him
aura is swallowed up too a split second before the trap door step closes again after them
watching that as klytus hisses into his ear
she betrays you
shell take him to aboria
so prince barin will kill flash gordon for me i dont care
dont be too sure
ming glances at him then back up the stairs at where dale has vanished
his face softens his tone turns museful
i havent taken a wife in centuries
i could bring myself to marry this dale arden what do you see in her future klytus
ming turns his head and finds that klytus is gone
not particularly surprised or concerned ming gazes again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own question with a licentious smile
it is seemingly endless faintly lt by phosphoresence from below
we dimly make out the figures of flash and aura falling away from us far below falling falling
we hear hollow echoing voices reverbrating up to us
take a deep breath
grab my ankle after we hit the water ill lead you
hit what water
in answer we instantly hear a titanic splash
flash plummets down aura right after him
recovering balance in a universe of bubbles flash finds himself confronting an enormous savage luminous fish
wheeling himself away in fear and revulsion flash encounters aura
he seizes her ankle as directed
holding his beat flash swims after her through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern floor
aura dives down leads him out of sight through a low opening
flash and aura emerge from a pool of water
flash staggers across and collapses on a fringe of beach
for sure auras wet clinging robe doesnt make her look any less sexy
he stares at her
catch your breath then ill take you up and find you a disguise
youre saving my life
how can i thank you
ill fly you to the forest of arboria well find a way
lets get one thing straight ive got to find dale and that nut zarkov too rescue them and try to save earth too
do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me mings daughter
im no good at lying
youre funny are all eathlings like you flash gordon
i guess im about average
there are windows on one side emitting a fierce glare
flash follows aura rapidly along
suddenly he stops short looking in through the tinted glass
an infernal place chief feature of which is a lake of seething magma that slowly rotates within a wide encircling platform
the platform is piled with glowing radioactive gravel being shoveled into the magma by lizardman slaves who toil in rythmic unison
the plasma core
its e source of the energy beam my father ia aiming at earth
you cant stop it
ming is merciless and all powerful
showing ankle electrodes shackled to each slave so that those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by guards stationed on a surrounding catwalk above
any slave unable to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by hooded men waiting like executioners to perform this chore
the slaves are lizard men
once they had their own water kingdom the fairest of mongo
then they dared to rebel
they will suffer for it here forever
flash looks at aura again then back in the window
zarkov is being led along by soldiers heavily shackled
he stops gazing in wonder at the seething lake which flares up blindingly with each shovel full of gravel
flash and aura you cant reach him
if a soldier spots you its instant death
aura takes his hand
with one backward look toward zarkov who of course has not seen him flash follows her
incredible the very core of this planet is it not
we are but soldiers
we do not know
you guess well dr
zarkov wheels in his chains looks up
high above this place where ming stands with klytus lit by the infernal glare as he goes on
i am forcing this plasma through the successive nuclear phases of a star building it toward the apocalyptic moment that will end earths pathetic history in one flash of fire
why dont you turn this science to peaceful use
the name ming would be blessed instead of cursed
bring him up to the dome soldiers we wish to show him wonders
at that instant a couple of worn out slaves are pitched into the magma
their dying screams are drowned by the chorus from all the minions hail
hail great one without mercy
aura leads flash out through a doorway
he is now fitted out with a fairly resplendent mongo costume boots cape headdress and all
they hurry along through shadows
suddenly flash seizes her by the shoulders stops her
listen wheres he got dale
as she looks at him she sees a detachment of soldiers marching this direction
quickly she pulls flash into a niche presses her body against his in the narrow space
whispers forget dale arden
i mean i hardly know her forget her flash gordon i saw a look in my fathers eye i think he intends to marry her
what are you talking about
the soldiers have gone past but aura is still pressing against him
oh you ask so many questions
im taking you to people wholl help you
can i honestly
aura hauls flash from the niche they hurry on a bit further
aura stops in front of big doors with glass windows in them
here we are
here we are where
ive dressed you as a royal pilot first class
well slip into my personal car and youll fly it
flash takes one look into the glass then swivels back to those are rocket ships in there
i cant fly a damn rocket ship
soft teasing learn from me ill teach you so much
open at the top to space
but instead of our familiar pinpoint stars here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are born and die
zarkov stands before ming in chains mesmerized by fantastic devices on every side
most prominent is a huge transparent cube supported in the air above a control console
ming moves to that plays in it like an organist
we hear a soft intense hum glimpse great dish like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome
an astonishing things happens
inside the cube a recognisable greenish globe appears like a three dimensional holograph slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view below a veil of clouds
yes zarkov as it was
now as it will be when my plasma reaches full force
a sudden tide of fire sweeps the globe even the clouds burn
zarkov gasps as mings fingers dance of the control keys again
and as it will be in yet another time long after you have died
a pleasant image no
the fires recede
the hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed
but thats impossible
even your perverted genius cant create new life
of course i can create life
theres nothing easier
it only requires myself and one woman
as in that childish myth of yours adam and eve wasnt it
i will breed with her and repopulate the earth in my own image
ive already done it on over a thousand planets
ming touches a key
the image of earth disappears from the cube
zarkov glares hatred at ming for a beat then his eye catches something else
a big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded in it just their hilts sticking out
angle to include zarkov
chained as he is he suddenly bounds over and seizes a sword hilt tries to pull it out
it doesnt budge
the magic blades are not for your kind zarkov
one is my own the other will only be withdrawn by my rightful heir
pull on them with all your zarkov tugs desperately but it doesnt give an inch
he falls panting over the block
ming laughs makes a sign to a soldier
return him to the dungeon
dale stands amongst the exotic females of this lavish place being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into a diaphanous gown
they intend her no harm
though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity all are very beautiful
tickled dale cant suppress a giggle
the females are amazed and delighted by this phenomenon
they take turns poking at her ribs as tall hedonia glides up bearing a flagon of green liquid
dale recoils her giggling cut short
what is it some rotten drug
it has no name
but many brave men died to bring it across space from cythera planet of pleasure
it will make your hours with ming more agreeable
with a karate chop dale knocks the flagon away
hedonia rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry
we are of different race dale arden but we all are women here
i know your fears
believe me it will be better if you drink it
hedonia retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it landed extends it again to dale
where are you
of course there is no answer
sudden tears of despair spring from dales eyes
she seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks it
her expression changes
say this stuff isnt bad at all
sails along a wonderful little bubble topped two seater with royal devices
floats toward us dazzling sphere of frozen seas and glaciers
coming into shot in a curving pass over the surface
its a nifty bubble top two seater with royal devices
there are no normal controls just a glowing multi colored panel over which the pilot makes hand movements to effect changes of course and attitude
flash is in the left hand seat beside aura gazing down at the glittering sight
frigia eleventh of the moons of mongo
its inhabited by the bear men who eat their own young
patches of frost and ice start to form on the crafts bubble
now pull up go starboard around that next moon rising ardentia
flash moves his hands over the panel
the craft pulls up and banks
another moon rising ahead
its reddish desert surface is swept by a raging sandstorm
some lucky people live on that one too
of course the sand men
every moon is a kingdom seperate and hostile to all the others
they have nothing in common but mings rule and their hatred of him
why dont they team up and fight him
fight ming the merciless
you saw what happened to the lizard men
with a sudden thoughtful look his head working
sue but that wasnt a team effort
i dont know these words whats a team
flash just shakes his head
aura watches him a beat more then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above her seat
its a transparent hood with strange fittings inside not totally unlike a beauty shop hairdryer
telekinetic thought transfer
setting its dials im going to get together with prince barin in arboria and tell him im arriving
hes the one wholl help you
because he does anything i ask
he loves me
you can really transfer your thoughts with that
like i could get in touch with dale
if i showed you how
but im not going to
aura just gives him a look and laughs
flash stares at her a moment then suddenly moves his hands sharply over the control panel
the craft hurtles into a violent dive
what are you doing
aura drops the plastic hood lunges to move
her own hands on the controls but flash seizes her wrists
showing the windblown surface of the moon ardentia dead ahead
are you mad were diving straight at ardentia
thats right princess and were not pulling out until you put that gadget over my head and tune me in to dale arden
aura struggles wildly but flashs grip on her wrists is like iron
the surface of ardentia looms up closer and closer
dale is immersed naked in a bubbly swirling tub a luxuriant prisoner of the females who bathe and groom her
she seems dazed by steam and by the sensuous movement of the water
a couple of the females lift dales hands make a cup of them
hedonia pours rich oil into it
rub this on your body
it gives ming pleasure
dale starts to oil herself as the females exchange looks and laugh softly
suddenly a filtered voice is heard from nowhere though it seems very close dale its me flash
am i with you
she blinks befuddled pauses in her oiling of herself
whats the matter
with the thought transference gizmo down over his head a faint bluish glow flickering within as aura watches him and we see the moon ardentia falling behind rapidly through the
flash concentrates fiercely
we hear his voiced thoughts but his lips do not move
no dale youre not dreaming im flash im with you and you are with me
are you receiving my thoughts
now we hear dales voice without her lips moving either im receiving something
i read you dale im getting you too
think of me hard
as they communicate
note there might be some faint glow in the air above the tub some spectral suggestion
of flashs presence the idea being to show that hedonia and other females are unaware of this interchange going on as they continue to bathe and groom dale
where are you flash
speeding for the kingdom of arboria to get help
im in a spacecraft with aura mings daughter
dont trust her
shes after you
listen she means nothing to me not a darn thing
where are you dale
naked in a bathtub
oh god if i could only see you dale
if i could touch you what are you in a tub for
im being fixed up for ming
chained in a dungeon i think
whatll i do flash
fake em out
just fake em out dale girls know how
but dont go too far
i mean get to zarkov and release him ill have help by then ill find you
can you do all that
sounds like fourth down and about ninety yards to go but ill try
dale youre some girl god you really are
do you get what im thinking now
dale were gonna get out of this jam i swear we will ill find you and when i do well who has been watching flashs face with increasing frustration and
jealousy during this suddenly snatching the thought transfer bubble off flashs head
he has a dazed dreamy look on his face
aura slaps him out of it points ahead
green tangle of branches and leaves and vines
angling up we see the shuttle craft approaching us head on at a down angle
it races up toward the crafts windshield
we level off for a moment then plunge down again into a blur of green
working his hands over the control sensors as crazy greenery rushes by outside
thump thud crash
the craft careens to a swinging halt so suddenly that flash and aura almost have their wind knocked out as they are thrown against their seat belts
i guess landings arent my thing
it hangs snagged in a huge vine like a creature caught by some monstrous boa constrictor
this is a complete world of green the light the feeling of the air
everything rings with forest sounds
the very sky is shut from view by leaves and foliage
the crafts hatch opens
flash struggles out gives aura a hand up
kneeling on the cabin flash takes in this incredible vista stretching all around
wheres robin hood
it doesnt matter
how do we get down
carefully balancing lithely aura starts along the trunk of the great vine that caught them
ultra byzantine splendor
the only light is by a huge bed on which dale reclines
a serving girl glides up with a flagon of that liquid
he is coming to see you now
are you ready
easy smiling very
do you need any more of this
just turn down the light a bit would you
the serving girl leans over the bed to do so
we glimpse dales hand rising quickly to deliver a karate chop
ming walks down it toward a closed door at the end
he pauses a moment in anticipation composes himself opens the door
its nearly dark
ming comes from shadows looks down at the bed
there is a feminine silhouette on it
ming sits extends a hand
his fingers travel sensuously up a bare thigh suddenly stop
savagely ming pulls the face of the girl into the light
it is not dale arden but the unconscious serving girl now dressed in dales gown
opening close on zarkov who lies asleep in his chains
a hand touches his shoulder
zarkov wakes with a start to see a serving girl bending over him tray in hand
she moves her cloak to reveal that she is a guard stands nearby against a wall faceless in the shadow of a cowled uniform
serving girl what business have you in this dungeon
dale quickly puts the tray down stands and turns to the guard she smiles invitingly lifts her skirt up above her knee
the legs are long and terrific
the guard catches his breath steps toward her lecherously to accept the invitation
he doubles up as dale kicks him in the groin goes down without a sound as a left right left series of karate chops hits his neck
he is hardly on the floor before dale is pouncing on the key ring at his belt
making their way swiftly through it between earth and heaven crossing this green world on branches and trunks of monster vines
listen are you sure this barin will help me
gently provocatively aura puts her finger on his lips to silence him
of a fantastic structure many levels built of wood and other materials from the heart of the forest
move off it to find flash and aura nearby him gazing at this apparition with a strange wistful expression
its amazing i dreamed of this tree house when i was a kid aura laughs softly waves him on
climbing the ramp like stairs which wind up around it in a mounting spiral
suddenly the forest rings with singsong cries and calls i mingled with a sort of roaring snarl
its barins hunt
aura leads him on at a run to the wide balcony above
with a desperate lion man running full tilt roaring and snarling as he zig zags this way and that
there is a swishing sound and an arrow like missile catches him in the back
sharp pfsssss as of gas escaping
barin prince of arboria and looking every inch the part stands with a fired crossbow
over his shoulder is a quiver of glass arrows each a little pointed cylinder at the end
some distance behind and around we see a number of his loyal barin got him
flashs eyes jumping to her as he hears that echoing
these are the guys who are gonna help me
it means nothing
they only shout that because its treason not to
they hate ming
i scent a tiger man near the lodge
form battle lines above and below
as the tree men scurry to obey barin moves forward reloading and cocking his weapon
the stricken lion man comes into view
incredibly the glass arrow in his back has transformed him into a statue of ice
at barins footfall he disintegrates in a tinkling fall of frozen shards
the tiger man is poised behind a tree near the lodge panting
he is a magnificent creature with a horn sticking out of his forehead
he tenses hearing the birdlike calls of the advancing hunters
we see another pair of lion men crouching nearby terrified
the line of tree men comes into view
the crouching pair look in appeal to the tiger man by the tree
he watches a beat waves them to run backward then covering the escape of the others tiger man charges into his enemies headlong
flash and aura watch the fight
tiger mans rage is magnificent as he flails the nearest tree men without regard for their number
he has flattened half a dozen when suddenly barins upper line of tree men leap down on him from the branches above and he is buried under their sheer weight
i know just how he feels we played the pittsburgh steelers last year
angle barin advancing by himself hearing the triumphant shouts of his men
we have him
bring him back for sport watching with horrified fascination as nets are thrown over the struggling tiger man
auras eyes bright with lust for this kind of spectacle aura speaks low to flash go inside let me talk to barin first
as flash hesitates foolish earthling trust me
barin walks up ahead of some tree men who are carrying the tiger man in their nets
suddenly he stops reacting to aura on the balcony
its so long since ive been with you barin i couldnt stand it
please dont be too angry at me for coming
angry at you
flash is flattened against the wall iwatching through louvers of a door
sound of feet on ramp snarling and roaring of captive tiger man
barin comes hastening into view on the balcony and embraces aura
youll stay the night
ive dreamed of it
his eyes alight with anticipation barin steps back from her
as his men arrive with the netted tiger man
get me a sword turning to aura this is the fiercest tiger man we have ever hunted
im going to kill him now and dedicate his blood to you my beloved
but thats treason
blood can be dedicated to ming alone
i know you aura the more a man risks the greater your passion
if i knew a greater risk id take it
aura smiles turns and calls softly toward the interior
flash gordon come out
flash steps out halts about ten feet from barin
reactions from barin and his tree men
im from earth prince barin
my friends and i were mings prisoners
she kindly brought me here to enlist your help
what in hell
hide him from my father dont let him wander keep him for me
keep me for
oh my god
i trusted you
aura darts into shot puts her lips to his ear and whispers you still must im playing a game
what are you saying
aura darts back into shot on his side now whispers in same hes a mere toy to me my love when im tired of it well kill him
as aura quickly steps away continues aloud its the risk i ask barin hide him for me in arboria
ill hide him all right under six feet of arborian dirt
the sword barin ordered has been brought
he seizes it
im not your enemy prince barin
we share a hatred of ming
are you so afraid of my earthling barin wont you even give him a chance
barin hesitates provoked by that then shouts snake keeper
rouse your beast
a halfwit tree man drowsing against another part of the parapet he jerks awake shuffles across to a big wicker basket pulls off the lid
a hideous eel like serpant rears its head hissing and snapping venemously
the keeper sticks his arm down
the snake coils around it
with a drooling grin the keeper withdraws it
cu flash watching with horrified revulsion
keeper carries the hissing snapping snake toward an enormous stump of a tree trunk
he holds his arm out over it whistles a curious note
the snake leaps off the arm and vanishes into the hollowed out trunk
we notice now that there are six holes drilled into the gnarled wood
who dares the beast
a battle scarred old tree man steps forward
without a word he goes to the stump and plunges a hand into one of the holes
big cu snake with a hiss fangs strike a wrist
with eyes widening in horror hs face starts to turn blue
he pulls out his hand and staggers backward
barin plunges his sword into the mans breast and he topples over the parapet dead
sword in hand barin turns to flash
i did him a mercy
this venom brings death only after long tortured madness
your turn earthling
i think ill pass on this one
there are six openings to the serpent
five are safe the sixth is death
choose one or take your end from my sword here and now
he swallows looks at the stump at barin with his bloody sword to the stump again then at aura
he crosses close and stares into her glittering eyes
would you give dale a message from me
tell her im sorry how things have panned out i loved her
ill do that
what the hell
sending that message by you is like sending a lettuce leaf by a rabbit
barins sword touches flashs back
he walks to the stump
every eye is on him every breath held
with a sudden quick motion flash plunges his hand into a hole
he leaves it there a second then whips it back out and wheels to barin
your turn prince barin
barin goes still
this is not what he had planned
auras tongue runs over her tee
if your love for me is great enough barin surely it will protect you from the serpent no
aura laughs softly
barin strides across plunges his hand into another hole rips it out again unscathed
he whirls to flash points the sword at him
flash thrusts into a third hole pulls out again
what are you waiting for
barin glares at him takes a breath jams his hand into the fourth of the six holes
his eyes widen horribly he makes a choked sound
pull back fast as he whips his hand out unbitten
his face twists into a grin
fooled you didnt i
aura laughs turns her smile on flash
its an even chance now flash gordon thats better than daddy would have given you boy
you oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself
if i were you id choose the sword the point touches flash again
just two holes left
he does a silently mouthed eeny meeny miney mo between them plunges his hand into one
the snakes head moves fast
as flash whips his arm out again
amazingly he has hold of the terrible serpent grasping it just below the head
cries from the astounded tree men and then flash is leaping into
whirling flash swings the hissing snapping writhing beast at the nearest treemen scattering them and thrusts the serpents head at barin
barin slashes with his sword misses
the serpents tail coils around the blade rips it from barins hand as the prince of arboria dives backwards
flash whirls again slams the serpents head into a post and snatches the sword from the tail before it hits the floor
he dashes for the ramp to the ground
the tiger man is right in front of him struggling in the net
flash pauses slashes at the cords
tiger man is freed bounds to his feet with a roar clobbers a pair of tree men just jumping on him and flash
snatching ones crossbow and quiver of glass arrows he races down the ramp behind flash
picking himself up wheeling furiously on aura who has been watching all this with her lips half parted her tongue flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement
a mere toy of yours eh
maybe i was wrong surely the prince of arboria wouldnt be beaten by a toy
barin snatches a horn from his belt blows a blast
the hunts on my tree men
to the hunt with barin
they run through the green tangle
flash trips over a vine
tiger man picks him up
thank you for freeing me
you can speak
for all the good it does me
sounds echo hunting horns birdcalls of tree men
they start running again
have we a chance tiger man
only if we climb out of the green light to the sky prince barins tree men cant follow us up there
what do you mean
mings law outside his own kingdom every hunter becomes the hunted
ahead is a huge tree made for climbing branches stick out like the rungs of some great green ladder
they leap onto the lowest
angles the tree flash and tiger man climbing
jack and the beanstalk up and up panting but there is never a top in sight
suddenly the branches end
end of the line
tiger man reacts to something off
touches flashs shoulder and points
a crazy sort of elevator is going by
its a moving
vine with leafy baskets attached a vertical conveyor from the ground to above
as flash and tiger man watch they see one basket moving up with an armed tree man in it scanning the forest below
snatches the crossbow off tiger mans back cocks it notches it quickly with a glass arrow from the quiver
hearing the click of the cocking
he wheels looks up sees flash
letting out a fierce birdcall
he jumps up and swings his own crossbow just as flash shoots
swish pffst as flashs arrow hits him
ice he tumbles out of the basket
flash and tiger man run out along the branch jump into the basket as it passes by
how far will this take us
i dont know no man has ever been above the green
barin and a troop of tree men are poised in the branches listening acutely
the one scouting in front calls back the sight call came from the left
the sight call carne from the left up and across well cut them off
he blows his horn again
the tree men start moving quickly some climbing others swinging laterally on vines
flash and tiger man rising looking upward as the light through the leaves is changing becoming less intensely green
what is that color above
we call is blue
a dozen tree men come swinging into view on vines land on a fat branch
the leader looks right in this direction points and gives a chilling birdcall
the tree men unsling their crossbows reach for glass arrows
flash and tiger man
seeing cold death staring them in the face
flash reaches for an arrow notches it
you havent a chance
throw down your weapon
flash makes like to throw his crossbow away
at the last instant h swings it around aims and fires
are startled as the arrow whirrs in and sticks into the branch under their feet
the branch instantly turns to ice
hears a loud brittle cracking sound
he looks up gapes holds on tight to the tree trunk
a dozen shrieking tree men plummet down around him amidst chunks of ice crashing through the branches to doom
a look of fierce delight on his face barin resumes his climb
flash and tiger man jump from their basket into a wide leaf near a loading platform where the elevator vine goes around a great iron wheel
the forest is open to the sky at this altitude a sunny eden of huge exotic flowers
enormous overlapping leaves form a floor flash and tiger man can stand on
which way to the border legend says arboria ends in an ocean to the west
flash quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the shadows starts in the direction he estimates is west
flash and tiger man running over the leaves which are somewhat bouncy like a huge trampoline
its quite enjoyable
flash laughs aloud at the sensation takes a big jump off the edge of one leaf bounces high from the next
amazingly a fat tendril seizes him in mid air coils around his waist
flash yells as he is lifted further up
is right above him
the closed petals open
the inside is viscous hideous looking
in the deepest recess is a dark red blob which pulses like a huge heart emits a being sound
with horror flash realizes the tendril is feeding him into the flowers maw
plash struggles vainly against the tendrils strength
tiger man dashes to his rescue below but another tendril knocks him flat
flash is conveyed into the flower
he punches wildly with his fists kicks but petals are closing inexorably around him
on their inner surface are deadly spiny spikes
scattered around are the crushed skeletons of luckless tree men who have been fed in here
out of nowhere a glass arrow comes flying past flashs ear sinks itself into the flowers heart
the flower shrieks
all around flash it is turning into crystalline ice
the tendrils lose their grip flash falls onto the leaf below beside the tiger man
as flash turns his head to see barin standing with his crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away
i saved you because your death must be mine
whats the point of all this killing
why dont we team up and overthrow ming
barin notches another arrow cocks his bow with slow pleasure raises it and aims at flashs heart
suddenly a shadow covers barin
he jerks his head up to see diving from the sun at him
it is a hawkman magnificiently fierce
it seizes barin in its talons and lifts him into the hover their wings beating the air
they dive on flash and tiger man lift them too
rises in a steep climb over arboria
in the pilots seat gazes off at something through tricky little binoculars
ascending with their three captives put the binoculars down with one hand lowers the thought transfer hood over her head with the other waves the craft into a sharp turn
away from the hawkmen
without her lips princess aura returns to mingo city the passage through the force field opens at her approach aura twists the tuning dial then goes on in a soft
daddy darling am i with you
are you getting me
sits some fanciful form of ground transport perhaps a thing with bicycle wheels and sails
they are inside she watching tensely as zarkqv throws switches and eyes displays
will it fly
basic circuits seem okay
it has to fly
we gotta rescue flash from that vampire before she sudden blinding blue light explodes within the capsule
come diving out headlong into the grass
i was just starting to test the primary transformer banks zarkov stops abruptly looking down at himself
my god your hands
your hands are gone
it is true zarkov has no hands
not gone just invisible
invisible hands pick up a pebble from the ground hold it before dales nose
magically they toss the little object back and forth from one unseen hand to the other
dale touches one can feel it
does it hurt
not a bit
i believe mongos gravitational
field must have reversed the polarity of my generator so that he breaks off again
slowly in front of our eyes zarkovs hands are fading in again and becoming visible
dale whistles in amazement
i wonder if its controllable
shadow over them suddenly
great whirring of wings
dale looks up and screams
swoop down on zarkov and dale bear them aloft as they did with flash and tiger man
in his wonderous dome room watching something
klytus is beside him as usual
angle to include the viewing screen which ming is watching
on it is a directional continuation of the scene we just saw a struggling dale being carrie dup into the open sky by hawkmen
mongo is restless today
your vessels stray from their appointed kingdoms
that damned vultan time i clipped his wings once and for all
we could put those insolent hawkmen of his to work in the plasma cavern dale arden and flash gordon
will i send out the imperial fleet to bring them back
well let vultan tame her first ill look pretty to dale arden after him
flash gordon is nobody
klytus smiles that sinister way
ming looks at him questioningly
sire it is not for me to tell great ming that he is making mistakes
serried squadrons of hawkmen escort the ones bearing flash barin and tiger man through space
struggling against the two hawkmen who have him snarling and roaring
he butts one in the belly with his horn
want us to let you go et
light streams rough tremendous el greco clouds
hawkmen are tiny figures rising against it
above the clouds a blinding dazzle comes into frame
it resolves into a fantastic sky palace hanging in mid air reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and terraces
the hawkmen climb above it
carrying flash and barin and tiger man going into a screaming dive
rushing at us with horrifying speed
zooming down we see a dark opening
the wind howling around wings we rush dizzingly into the aperture
vultan circles admiringly around dale
vultan is a lusty viking of the sky winged like his men one eye blinded his beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw
gorgeous hawkgirls watch jealously as vultan inspects dale very closely reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom
dale slaps his hand away
watch out you old bird ming wants to marry me
vultan hoots at that as hawkgirls murmur
hes about to touch her again when there is a clamor o
hawkmen carrying flash tiger man and barin swoop out from another hole like the one they dove into
the whole place is like a great hanging birdhouse hawkwomen and hawchildren moving in and out and perching on the various exterior terraces
flash and tiger man are dropped on to a terrace so hard it stuns them
is lowered more carefully on another terrace this one grander with a throne in the center
flying down from above hovering above barin with menacing glee
i knew my hawkmen would catch you one of these days
be careful how you address me vultan
i am prince barin ruler of arboria
not in my kingdom here youre just a stray animal to be killed for our sport
will you do that vultan
what would you do if youd caught me in arboria
yes i would hunt you down and kill you without mercy
flash on the other terrace lifts his head groggily reacts to something
angle to include zarkov stumbling out from an opening in his usual clothes
hello we do meet in the strangest places
the boss bird has her up in his
sudden ear piercing scream from above
dales scream flash bounds to his feet
dale is surrounded by jealous hawkgirls who are pushing her toward the terrace edge
screaming again dale goes over
flash wheels toward the sound dives to the parapet and catches dale as she plunges past
he hauls her in and they embrace in a steamy kiss
flutter of wings
hawkmen swoop at the terrace and lift up the clinging couple
it barely interrupts their conversation flash when i was in that tub yes it was me did you mean it
every thought baby
as flash and dale are lowered on it
what have you to say to vultan prince of the air
were all mings prisoners
i say lets team up and smash him
listen to his words
on his feet on the other terrace shouting across
i know im only an ignorant tiger man but i tell you flash gordon is the leader weve waited for
where vultan gazes at tiger man a beat then turns mocking eyes on flash
youre a leader he
well back home its what im paid for i called a pretty good game against the dallas cowboys once do you understand him
not a word
i was hunting him when you seized me
before you finish me
vultan i beg only that you let me finish him
oh god here we go again is everyone on mongo crazy
havent you guys ever heard of teamwork
when i had that damn snake in my hand i couldve poked it in your face and killed you
i had you in bow sight you were dead
shouting to all around these vagrants talk a brave fight my hawkmen
shall we test their words
cheering and shouting eagerly from all around test them
lets have sport
to the joust
take them below put them together
vultan leads the way down
flash barin dale zaakov and tiger man are escorted by many fierce hawkmen
flash dont do this
low bitter ive got to
he has no choice dale its the mongo way
im so homesick what i wouldnt give for a nice quiet night with some muggers in central park flash squeezes dales hand
ahead appears an archway opening to the sky
a great gong is heard
angle hawkman appears with a mallet he beats again on a huge bronze gong
startling sight a big disc hangs in the air between the curved prongs of a lower terrace the shaft that supports it lost in clouds below
flash and the others appear
they halt looking at the disc
is greasing the shiny surface with a mop slipping around a bit as he does so
shots ash and barin getting prepared
removing shirts being equipped with heavy leather gauntlets and so on
each is given a long vicious whip
angle a bridge like plank extends itself out over the edge of the shiny greased disc
flash and barin appear ready for combat
hawkmen behind them wthey start out over the bridge
arm the disc
stopping short eyes popping as he sees razor sharp knives are popping up from the top surface all over maybe two feet apart
if a man loses his footing and falls he will surely be fatally impaled
feature flash and barin with whips in hand they step from the bridge onto the disc
flash almost slips and falls immediately
getting his balance again
barin moves across amidst the knives takes a stance facing flash raises and coils back his whip
ready for me earthling
i ask you to swear barin if you defeat me youll join vultan against ming
if for no other reasons because youll never have aura as long as her father lives
what do you now of aura
quite a lot
barins whip lashes out savagely at flash
suddenly the fight begins
flash and barin stalk around slipping on the grease whamming at each other with their whips
the disc suddenly begins to tilt and sway making this affair even more desperate
barin begins to get an edge
slashing cutting he drives flash back
flash i love you
win for me flash
adrenaline courses through his veins as he hears that over the uproar
he flies at barin dodges the lash grapples with him hand to hand
they wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting surface
it looks bad again for flash when with a superhuman effort he flips barin over his back
over the edge
in the same instant flash dives onto his side amidst the deadly knives and grabs at barins wrist
flash catches him
barin hangs suspended over the abyss of space held only by flashs grip
youve won earthling
drop him to doom
gasping at barin try to catch my wrist
the other one
what is this
call it what you want vultan compassion mercy let us teach you the meaning of these words
swing your body see if you can get a leg up here
suddenly an echoing voice booms from the sky vultan
hear ming ruler of the universe
where ming watches the sky palace scene on a viewing screen a weeping aura beside him as he goes on i see you vultan and barin too
you both have defied we by sparing these earthlings
barin my only i swear i didnt mean to get you into this
as the voice goes on do you want to live vultan
what creature wants to die
then kill flash gordon now
pick up dale arden deliver her to me on your own wings its your only chance
my fleet is already in the air ready to destroy your whole kingdom if you disobey
the echo rolls and dies
tiger man suddenly leaps out onto the disc slides over between the knives helps flash pull barin up to safety
zarkov in his chains walks over to the confused vultan
whatll you have death or dishonor
vultan looks down at flash once more then makes up his mind
he shouts to his people well save these earthlings
into the air my hawkpeople fly
zarkov grins extends a hand to vultan
he just looks at it
i dont understand this
i think ive gone mad
ming snaps off the viewing screen looks at aura spare him daddy oh please spare aura tries to throw herself into his arm but he pushes her roughly away
klytus materialises from a shadow smiling
youve always wanted her klytus aura is yours
it is being evacuated
squadrons of hawakpeople stream out of its many openings diminutive figures against the sky
several rocket ships appear wonderfully gaudy contraptions with mings battle flags flying
a ray shoots out from the nose of the biggest
the ray zaps it
the whole place explodes
vultan and his captain lead
ranged around are barin flash dale tiger man and zarkov each carried by a hawkman
distant explosions rumble like thunder
dont look back hawkman
head for that cloud cover
over his shoulder wheres this capsule of yours exactly
in the high grass east of mingo
pick it up captain
the captain and a few hawkmen peel off
flash and dale gaze at each other lovingly flown along about a hundred feet apart
he calls for her guess the first thing you and me are gonna do after we land
darling not in front of the hawkmen youll make me blush
gonna do it first thing around here never know if youll get another chance
dark shadow falls over dale
she looks up
a big rocket ship hovers doors in its bottom side opening
a flickering ray shoots down
as an effulgent glow envelopes her
inexorably dale and her hawkmen are sucked upward
im coming dale
to his hawkmen follow her climb
vultans command of course takes precedence
the hawkman bearing flash follows his mates into a shrieking vertical
dale and her hawkman are sucked up into a chamber
waiting soldiers seize the struggling hawkman brutally smash his wings pitch him out the bottom as the doors close
dale backs off drops into a karate stance with a whining roar the craft accelerates throwing dale off balance against a wall
hedonia enters through a door her arms full seems to be yards and yards of filmy white material
hedonia smiles nicely
time is short
ming sent me to fit you with is
fit me with what
your wedding dress
tree men and lion men and tiger man toil together in peaceful concernt constructing a crude wooden launch gantry around zarkovs space capsule which has been conveyed here
several hovering hawkmen hold it in position with vine cables as the work is completed
capsule door is open
through it we see zarkov at work inside feverishly re wiring a control panel
up on lodge balcony flash barin and vultan lean over a table on which maps and drawings are laid out a typical military staff meeting
with a bit of charcoal barin sketches a semi circular line over a map of mings city
a force field covers the whole city from here to here
with luck flash can lure them into lowering their defenses
what if he fails
this is suicide barin
i cant order my men to suicide
vultan ascends into the air
hovers as he goes on the flight brought me back to my senses good luck and goodbye
ming destroyed your kingdom
well build another
let him go i understand
up to vultan thanks anyway for getting us this far
vultan hesitates a moment the soars away with determination
ready for a test
whats the game plan
when i give you zero punch that button
zarkov jumps out leaving the door open
he crouches low
barin and vultan and everybody are watching
five four three two one zero
interior of the capsule is filled with blinding blue light for an instant
zarkov pops up sticks his head in
do you hear me flash
where are you
as invisible hands turn around the helmet on his head
i did it
you can come out now flash not unless you get out of my way i zarkov moves inside
look he still casts a shadow its true
flash is totally invisible but on the ground we see his shadow as he climbs out and stands upright
suddenly there is rising whining humming sound that seems to fill the whole firmament
the earth trembles
lion men and tree men cower in terror
tiger man roars
what have you done
the sound grows louder intolerable
brown smoking foliage rains down
everyone looks up
the topless forest of arboria is withering falling apart
tree men cry with primal fear as the see the sky revealed
hovering against the sun are the dark shapes of mings rocket ships
pulsing rays emanate from projectors on their bottoms
a voice booms from heave prisoners of ming you are surrounded
the creature who moves is obliterated
everyone stands frozen
howls in terror makes a break for cover
a ray instantly zaps down at him and he explodes into fiery fragments
a small shuttle craft descends vertically to a soft landing
klytus gets out
every sound ceases
he nods at barin at zarkov
he walks directly across flashs shadow to zarkov
well find vultan later
wheres flash gordon
his hawkman dropped him
nooo its not true
it is they saw him fall a mile into the glaciers of frigia
dale shuts her eyes sobs out oh flash no you cant be dead it doesnt make any sense when i think of being given to klytus i wish it was
myself who had fallen
blazing at her i dont believe you
you you awful mongo person you were born without a heart then what is it that melts into my eyes dale arden
feel it breaking tear runs down auras cheeks
she seizes dales hand presses it against her wonderful breast
dale is really moved
you poor kid dont you have a mom to talk to
ming tired of her
he blew my mother into outer space
i look into the night sky sometimes and wonder what star shes orbiting god aura no wonder youve had problems that bastard dale embraces aura
they cling to each other bosom against bosom in perfect womanly understanding
golden chords are heard
capsule sits in its launch gantry amidst the ruined blight left by the ray attack
there is not a soul in sight
then flashs shadow moves quickly over the ground toward the capsule and vanishes into the hatch
the door shuts itself
control levers move
a red button depresses itself
through the side which we should remember is transparent from within we see the scene outside going into a green brown blur as the capsule starts to spin for takeoff
ming is being robed by two girl attendants
suddenly klytus is there in a shadow smiling
ming senses him turns
what is it this time
i cant remember
i feel danger but i cannot see it
klytus youre impossible
aura deserves you
i foresee another thing
in one minute exactly the earthling space capsule will be seen on the scanner
klytus is swallowed again in shadow
sailing over the ever frozen moon of frigia capsule is seen on the viewing screen grid lines dancing over the image as frigoria is left behind
watching are ming klytus the captain and several other soldiers
shall i disintegrate it your majesty
no captain bring it in
land it to a warm reception
through the front we see mings city dead ahead and below
numbers flash on the navigation display constantly changing
invisible hand picks up a microphone holds it before vultan
do you read me
vultan and some other hawkmen perch listening to voice coming from a radio in vultans belt
flash gordon calling vultan
vultan doesnt stir a feather
after a moment okay dont answer im on hawkman frequency i know you are reading me
now get this im being guided through the force field under their control
youre on the beam when youve got the tops of two towers lined up exactly the high gold one behind the green one with the blue flag got that
okay vultan its your decision the ball is in your court i hope ill be seeing you you crazy ole bird
the microphone hangs itself up on the panel
just sit there grim faced
vultan shake his head
he calls us crazy its an armed camp
soldiers stand admits tanks and ray gun artillery every weapon trained on a landing pad in the middle
klytus waits with his captain watching the mirror bright capsule coming down
captain gives a signal
from a tanks ray gun
the capsules door is knocked with surgical precision off its hinges
flanked by soldiers with ray guns at the ready the captain advances and looks in
he turns and calls back to klytus in surprise
mustve taken off on some automatic program
he doesnt notice the shadow that suddenly passes over him moves on quickly
halts shift shape as flash stops in dismay at that turns
a ray gun on a tank zaps out a ray
zarkovs capsule glows white falls into thin ashes
lets out a bitter sigh
then the shadow moves again fast to an open doorway
stands on guard
suddenly out of nowhere but very close
which way to the dungeons soldier third elevator down turn left
then doing a take who is that
a left to the gut doubles him over to take an invisible knockout right on the chin
two soldiers stand with ray guns before a heavy locked door
suddenly invisible flash steps behind a flaring torch casting an enormous shadow on the wall
he manipulates his caped arms so that the image becomes truly fearsome
i am the ghost of all the good men murdered by ming
prepare for doom
the soldiers faint
four soldiers march along two by two filling the narrow way
sound of running feet coming towards them
they halt i n consternation
invisible flash crashes into them sending them flying like bowling pins
four guards lounge
move to one of them who sits studying the pictures in the mingo version of playboy magazine
a shadow falls over the page
im looking at it now wait for your turn
an invisible uppercut knocks him off his chair
as invisible flash goes after the other three with a deadly chair that seems to swing itself through the air
zarkov barin and tiger man lie in chains heads cocked at sounds of the facas outside
thud of a body falling brief silence then sound of a key in the lock
the door opens itself
the same one aura and flash fell down originally
now barin zarkov tiger man and flash are inching their way up it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney in
back to back pairs feet pressed out against the shaft walls
what makes it look even stranger half of the flash barin twosome is invisible
low conversation as they pant and struggle up the how do we get down to the plasma level
anti gravity shaft i got a guard to show me this wont be easy flash nothings easy on mongo lizard men slaves work like mad shoveling radioactive fuel into the
controllers are at consoles
many guards stand around
everyone watches a big hanging dial
its needle quivers with each flare up from the inferno below inches toward a red faster
whats the hurry
controller whats the hurry
he wants to give dale arden the final destruction of earth as a wedding present
controllers twist the shock knobs
tortured slaves howl in agony
some drop and are thrown into the fiery mass others redouble their efforts
the needle quivers upwards
move off it to a slot like window in back wall
there are eyes behind the glass
zarkov barin and tiger man crouch amidst whirring ventilators watching through the window
hows it look to you
plasmas contracting into a critical mass
when that needle hits the red earth is finished
ill charge down at them zarkov and barin just look at him
tiger man slumps out of his fighting stance
low door at the back opens itself and invisible flash comes in
cavern is sealed tight every door locked from the inside hope drains from his expression
lets face it my friends without a miracle weve lost
it is filled with hawkmen flying toward us
vultan and his captain
fly in the lead looking ahead and down at the city of mingo
all right i see the towers lined up now as flash gordon said vultan soars up and hovers shouts to the ranks behind
through the force field my hawkmen
the pass is narrow dive three by three
any man who wishes to turn back may do so
keep flying right on not one bird of them turning back
musing to his captain who are these earthlings that so many would die for
they must have one hell of a little three hawkmen are seen in steep descent
comes into focus over them
several officers and soldiers are around a console watching the screen and other displays
another officer touches a red firing button
ranged here are devices like multiple rocket launchers bristling with hundreds of arrows
swoosh one fires its load into the sky
the three leading hawkmen are impaled a dozen times each crumple and plummet down
vultan and captain hovering its a trap
the passage is covered
we outnumber their arrows overwhelm them
intercuts hawkmen and arrow projectors as the brave hawkmen dive in a converging stream at the invisible opening and the projectors fire again and again
great slaughter is wreaked on the hawkmen but they keep coming
one group veers to the side away from the deadly fire only to crash into the equally deadly force field
they explode into flames
firing officer is almost breaking his thumb he has it jammed down so hard on the red button
angle to the viewing screen
on it vultan leads a stream of descending hawkmen
circle and reform some giving mid air aid to wounded mates and on they come onward
man the battlements
hawkmen descend as soldiers rush out at them
the battle is epic a crazy combination of swords and ray guns and clubs and spears
vultan is a towering figure in the middle of it dealing havoc on all sides
as he fights three soldiers another races at vultans back with a deadly spear
suddenly he trips over nothing and crashes headlong to be dispatched by another hawkman
vultan whirls and is amazed to have his freehand warmly clasped by an invisible one
ming and klytus in ceremonial robes
as part of his costume ming wears a sword
you have the ring
in my pocket
door flies open an officer dashes in
your majesty were under attack by hawkmen
so what are you doing down here coward
why arent you in the fray
sire i thought youd mingo city is impregnable
im not about to put off wedding dale arden for this
the battle continues
bloodies hawkman captain fights his way up beside vultan who is engaged in seizing a dominant piece of ray gun artillery
whats for us after this lot
the cavern first
gotta get zarkov in there to suddenly music is heard from below
some great electronic organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably here come the bride
the familiar thrilling wedding march
on my god
a magnificent wedding is on
dale marches slowly up the middle on klytuss arm helped along by amazons who march at her back with spears
her long train passes between the amazons to be borne behind by lovely girls as the party passes between ranks of splendidly garbed mongons
an aged high priest waits at the throne altar with ming whose eyes lecherously devour his approaching bride
her beauty only enhanced by the teas rolling soundlessly down her cheeks
the molten mass is more intense than we have ever seen it scarcely bearable to the eye
even in here there is a terrible glare from the slot window zarkov turns his face away suddenly infinitely sad
i cant watch any more
to think of all our history ended this way the incredible ascent from primordial slime to albert einstein and dale arden and look
vultan and three hawkmen are swooping down from some gallery above
vultan and two pounce on controllers while the third hawkman flies down to open a door on the lower level
zarkov and barin and tiger man scramble for the low exit behind them
earth turns slowly in mid air its seas and continents veiled by clouds of hideous smoke which seethe with flashes of interior red lightning
then faces come into focus below and behind it and we realise we are in ming s great hall where earth is a holographic image in a transparent box above
the altar throne
standing beside ming at the altar with klytus looking up despairingly at her beloved planet while the high priest do you take her this earthling dale arden to be your
empress of the hour
do you solemnly promise to use her as you will not discard her until such time as you grow weary of her
the wedding ring please klytus produces a golden ring hands it to ming
ming takes dales left hand forces it up into position holds the ring poised to slip it on
mings face has never been more merciless
recite after me with this ring i thee wed with this ring i thee wed
an invisible hand snatches the ring from mings grip like lightning and james it onto dales finger
dale runs like hell but is tripped by her train and goes down as ming leaps up onto his throne platform
seal this hall
close every portal
swinging shut barin squeezing in through it at the last instant sword in hand
klytus rushes at him with a sword of his own
looks around wildly whipping out the sword sheathed at his belt
its blade is like crystal fire
he reacts sharply catches his breath
exactly like his a blade of fire apparently hanging in the air and pointed right at him
where did you get that sword
from the crystal block
it could only be pulled by my rightful heir
how about that
the sword slowly advances
his face contorted he flies at invisible flash behind the sword
flash parries the blow
astonishing pyrotechnics as the blades hit each other
shrieking mongons flee under showers of fire
hawkmen and lizard men slaves engage mings people
aided by vultan and tiger man zarkov battles his way up to the mezzanine control area
he shouts down wildly
attach the electrodes to the shovels
pitch them into the plasma
ming and flash duel dazzlingly around the enormous throne
suddenly flash starts to lose his invisibility
a pair of eyes appears the tip of a nose parts of limbs
pinned by amazons reacting to that
flash look out youre coming back
he can see you now flash
flash and ming flash pauses to look at himself almost gets his head lopped off by a fiery slash from ming recovers to bound up higher on the vast throne
statue wheron they battle
in the f
the image of earth slowly turns and glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds
barin and klytus duel in another area of e hall
a thrust by barin catches klytus on the forehead
klytus springs back blood gushing down over his eyes
i foresaw at blow youre blinded klytus drop your sword
klytus laughs reaches up and throws off his helmet whirls in a lightning way to reveal shadowed hideous marked with all the evil in the universe
its mouth emits a raging scream
lunges with horror slashes with his sword point
is slashed but grotesquely does not bleed
barin and klytus fly at each other again trade blows then each catches a wrist of the other with his free hand
klytus laughs horribly
you fight me in vain barin i do not foresee my death at your hands klytus twists away knocks barins sword out of his grasp drives barin back against the
klytus lifts his own sword puts it at barins throat for the final thrust
suddenly changes horribly
aura is behind him her hand on the hilt of barins sword which she has driven into klytus back
soundless dead klytus falls to the floor
aura and barin move together embrace
barin touches her face
gently aura strokes barins cheek in hirst human like loving touch
flash and ming have duelled their way right up onto the shoulder of the great statue now fight against a vast replica of mings needle trembles on the verge of
angle down to zarkov at console protected against the final guards onslaught by vultan and tiger man as he works feverishly with a screwdriver on a wiring panel pulled out
from the innards he straightens up takes a deep breath
cross your fingers boys
zarkov hits a switch
reacting to something pointing upward look earth
oh its so beautiful
as he swivels his head for a quick look
he freezes gives a cry of unmitigated rage
flash seizes the instant thrust his sword
the blade goes into ming up to the hilt
flash pulls it out
there isnt a drop of blood
ming just stands there smoking in spectacular fashion into the atoms of which he was constituted
ming is just gone
everyone looks upwards at flash standing with his sword atop the statue
there is a clatter as amazons cast away their spears
a cry goes up as if from one throat
hail flash gordon
vista of stunning beauty as hawkmen soar and loop in wondrous victory rolls leaving behind rainbow contrails
it is a scene of peace now
hawkmen and soldiers join in tending their wounded
formerly fierce amazons act as gentle nurses
move over this to find flash dale and zarkov standing together looking up at the terrific sky shadow flash with an arm around dales shoulder
he glances at her tenderly is surprised to see tears on her cheeks
whats the matter darling
we saved earth but we lost the capsule well never get home again
you are home
zarkov is right
shouldnt you fellows be leaving on your honeymoon
dale laughs turns her face up to flash
he kisses her
as they head into the palace zarkov gazes upward again
hawkmen swoop and soar weaving rainbows as end credits what you have just read is a reproduction of the st draft for the feature film flash gordon
