kelley may full pink draft over black we hear the distant but near melodic cry of a loon
the loon continues its hypnotic call as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water which doesnt even ripple
the loon continues her nocturnal cry as we savor the beauty of the lake the elegance of the bird and the haunting echo of her lonely call
until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under silenced forever
a lone feather surfaces and floats as credits roll over the black lake to richie havens singing i can see clearly now
then and they pay you for this
to tag beaver
as we fade in a face comes into focus from underwater
it is the face of walt lawson maine fish and game looking down from a boat
next to him is sheriff hank keough paunch disposition of an untipped waiter
ask me what an animal does in the wild is his own business so long as he doesnt do it to man
i think mark twain said that
dry i think he didnt
but since youve said it i guess were covered
keough holds a stare
walt drops overboard
keough pulls a twinkie from his pocket
begins to unwrap
find kelly scott pretty thirty as kevin campbell forties approaches
warmly kevin hey
she beams affection he exudes a little discomfort
could i steal you a second
great idea absolutely
they enter on the cut he closes the door
i had a great time last night
reading his look she suddenly smells it
her face drops
deducing thats not what you came to say
you work for me
im not comfortable with yknow us
shes a little crushed
i was working for you when us started whats i know and i thought i could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else its a dangerous mix
kevin as long as we
suddenly what was that last part
sheepish the somebody else part
yeah that part
somebody whos um
feels terrible else
this probably wasnt meant to be yknow
i mean im
god i gotta be ten years younger and you you
reading her mind a jerk
you have no idea oh
then no no im not angry im not im just thrown im
checks her watch i actually have an early lunch so
its ten after nine
and she rushes out of the room
off kevin we walt dives down visibility is lousy
whether its algae or dense vegetation the water is extremely murky
keough unwraps the second twinkie
walt continues to swim
not much to look at
no just a snapping turtle swimming away
walt descends a little deeper
he loves it beneath the water theres a tranquility he can find nowhere else
next best thing to meditation
suddenly he stops kicking
a black water snake it must be almost three feet in length
walt flippers himself closer wants a closer look
the snake seems unimpressed
then suddenly the snake lunges at him misses
walts look says what the fuck
then the snake swims off
he looks around uneasy
he gets this feeling hes not alone down there
looks about nothing but murky water
but hes not alone we can feel hes not alone
he looks left right
four snakes swimming hovering looking back at him
whats with these snakes
walt decides hell go back to the boat
something hits him
and its no snake
suddenly walt comes thrusting up with a scream
and walt is promptly yanked back under
upon which walt surfaces
he swims frantically for a beat before hes suddenly yanked under again
then he surfaces thrashing as keough speeds over with the boat
he takes hold of him and pulls him on board
whats left of him
theres nothing below the waist
walt is just a bleeding torso though still conscious
going into shock jesus christ
clenching around keoughs arm
he knows hes done
off keoughs continued horror we a dinosaur t rex is angry and out for blood
were watching an old classic creature feature
find kelly alone slowly eating popcorn rapt tense
watching the movie
as the suspense builds her hand freezes halfway between the popcorn bag and her mouth
the monster pursues its human victim
fear on her face
the monster makes its final surge capturing its prey
as she screams with fear and delight
her scream is only partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers
after a beat she calms daring to eat popcorn again
wearing gullibility vulnerability all over her face
then from behind a hand appears taps her shoulder causing her to let loose with the most blood curdling scream of all
all the moviegoers turn to see
as will we thirties standing mortified the woman who tapped her shoulder
kelly and okubo emerge from the movie theater
what do you expect mugging me from behind
i tapped you
well you shouldnt have
how did you even know where i was
sarcastic wild guess
i dont like to be scared myra i have a thing about fright dont ever scare me
kevin told me you were upset
i never realized he was so psychic how could he detect that did he tell you theres somebody else
he didnt have to tell me that part
stares at her
it started before you kelly i never wouldve you
it was just a quick thing which we thought was over and and
you and kevin
it wasnt suppose to happen i dont know what to say
you dont know what to say lucky for you action speaks louder than words
kelly im not upset myra okay
i just never thought of you as a yknow
dont be silly no
i should get back
and kelly peels off to go on her way
bumps into a pedestrian
she then gives him an angry shove under to the pedestrian dont fuck with me
and off she goes
the pedestrian and okubo exchange a look
walts covered body is being loaded as jack wells fish and game thirty emerges from his truck
he approaches the body
lifts up the sheet
stares a beat in disbelief
turns to keough
what did this
off keough we kellys in her office working at her desk
hows it going whats happenin family good great nice to catch up get out
this is business
then there was an accident in maine some guy got killed by something in a lake
probably a bear but
they found a tooth
a tooth they say couldnt have come from any bear
they say it looks prehistoric
like maybe a dinosaur
without looking up oh well then im sure thats it he got killed by a dinosaur anything else
i want you to go there
now she looks up
im sure its nothing but youre a paleontologist this is what we do i this is what we do
id like you to check out this lake
see are you on drugs
kelly im not going to maine i wont even go west of forty third street part of our research im not even a field person
well on this one id like you to be
kelly stares back
the nickle drops
this was myras idea wasnt it
get me out of the office for a few days until it has nothing to do with i never do field work and even if i did maine to look
at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody couldnt you dream up something kelly i am not going to maine
a sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky nothing but evergreens and lakes below
kelly with the pilot
she looks a little white
kelly is walking with keough toward the morgue
he just came up screaming
did he say anything
he just kinda gurgled
he was pretty much dead
and you didnt see anything
the lake was dead calm until up he came
the tooth is in there
thats the morgue
is the dead guy in there
thats where they keep them
then you want me to bring the tooth out here
bravado no no
reveal the medical examiner steven daniels is there with keough and kelly
walts torso is covered
kelly is examining the tooth
i need to get a microscopic look at it
indicating there you go
maybe i should see
the body reading her i wouldnt
im fine thank you
have you ever seen a dead body before ms
admits at wakes
this is a little different
i can look at dead things
and daniels is about to pull the sheet back wait
she takes a breath
and daniels peels back the sheet
kelly strains to disguise her extreme horror
finally fighting off nausea this
how long did this attack go on for
and this is how he came to the boat
then and is there a place nearby i could go to vomit
off this we its a small almost tiny town general store post office fire station
kelly and keough are in front of the general store loading supplies into a van across the street in front of the sheriffs department
nobody lives within twenty five miles cept some old couple who live right on the lake
teenagers trek in every once in a while none have disappeared and none have spotted anything unusual
you talk to the married couple
what kind of backup do we have
that strikes a nerve
im just a little unclear as to why the museum of natural history would send somebody here
you have a thing against museums
i got nothing against ever even been in one
he stares back
then picks up a huge cannon like gun
as he loads it what is that
lightweight forward area air device unit
whatevers out there one shot with this and hes dead
incredulous and you stock these things for what to fend off russia
youre sort of a rude person
its just that suddenly like a shot kellys arm jerks up as she jet sprays a white fog from a can of yard guard
keough holds a look at her
i have a thing about mosquitos
upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up its marked maine fish and game
jack wells emerges kellys eyes scan him like radar
re kelly dry a museum in new york sent us some additional back up
kelly shoots keough a look
then kelly scott
a museum sent you
are we all museum bigots in maine
jack holds a look decides to let that pass
did you make anything of the tooth
yes it did seem prehistoric but im sure he just carried the thing for luck
not that it worked obviously
it probably somehow got lodged into his body
jack holds another look
why are you staring at me
to keough do i have a smudge on my face it would be so you not to have told me
keough also lets that pass
to jack im ready when you are
as they start out kelly grabs jack by the arm
one other thing its a small point but
i have a thing about being humored and im feeling humored more by him but you seemed quick to join in
maam your first impression isnt going well
as janine post sixteen flirtatious little vixen steps up
is it true youre going to look for some kind of monster in black lake
were just going to investigate an accident
theres no monster
we heard a man got bit in half
there was an accident thats all
nothing to worry about
and janine goes into the store
the men just watch her go
sixteen going on twenty nubile
kelly just looks at the men gaping at the girl
keough jack and kelly are in a boat motoring towards a farmhouse
no other houses in sight
jack kelly and keough are questioning delores bickerman mid sixties eccentric if not slightly daffy
shes brought out refreshments
oh my husband passed away almost two years ago
my department doesnt have any record of that mrs
with some attitude oh well im sorry
i didnt realize you keep such a firm track of the dead
gently what was the cause of your husbands death maam do you know
off bickermans silence we dont mean to invade your privacy but
was he ill was he sick
was he swallowed
bickerman the reason were up here
a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake
do you know how your husband died
brightly oh yes
i killed him
keough clenches his eyes shut
the old womans a loon
you killed him
happily oh yes
and how would you have accomplished this maam
rattling it off quickly simply well he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well
i think he had alzheimers he would be coherent one day incoherent the next and one coherent day he asked me to end his suffering
i wouldnt do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that i finish him off
finally i just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead
jack keough and kelly just stare back at this crazy woman
off their looks to keough dig him up if you dont believe me javert
keough and kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the thickly wooded shoreline
half mile up theres a clearing
you gonna dig up that ladys husband
ill call the coroner
looking around what is with this lake
it looks black and
there are no waves or anything
they wanted to call it lake placid
but somebody said that name was taken
to jack gee
jack smiles gets her sarcasm
the tents were sent ahead they should already be set up
were staying in tents
i told you
two days wed have to camp
yes camp i thought that meant holiday inn i never heard tents will there be toilets
seeing something what the hell
keoughs attention has been otherwise arrested
he sees something in the water
slowing the boat i thought i saw
it looks like a branch
he leans over to grab something floating in the water
looks like a branch
he lifts it up revealing it to be an antler
connected to the severed head of a moose
keough seeing it as he lifts it screams throwing it
it hits kelly and she screams a blood curdling scream as the head hits the floor of the boat with a heavy thud
kelly rears back still screaming and belts keough in the shoulder
you threw it at me
denying i just let go of it
you threw it at me
to jack did you see that
she belts him again
stop hitting me
dont throw heads at me to jack and stop calling me maam
this head looks ripped off the body
what is going on here
a small tent camp is being set up
two deputies burke and stephens present
kelly is with jack
how big do the bears get
a bear couldnt do that to a moose or man in water
on land maybe
and theyre sure he didnt get tangled under the outboard somehow
hank says hes sure
kelly takes in the scenic surroundings
it really is beautiful isnt it
never been to maine before
i was told they discriminate against people with hygiene
off jack i never believed it
he measure her
then why are you here
i told you
the museum of natural history doesnt send out investigators to how would you know what and even if they did i doubt he or she would have problems with tents
so i dont like tents why you dont like tents mosquitos look at your fingernails you have about as much business being in the woods whats wrong with my as
emily post it doesnt fingernails these are make sense perfectly good overriding they sent you out to examine a tooth why are you out here on the on the lake
might as well tell
i am a paleontologist
throwing it out i also was dating my boss he turned out to be involved with a co worker who was also my friend and for the sake of comfort
theirs i was shipped off to maine
then i dont feel like going back yet
she said it
he stares back
im not making it up
you dont have to stay out here why dont ive come im here im staying
unless there are ticks
we then hear the sound of a descending helicopter
she looks up
then oh my god
if this is who i think it is
as it gets closer it is
hes a rich kook mythology professor
hes done some work with our museum
he also treks the world to swim with crocodiles
arriving with what
hes an expert on them
and if hes here
then he must think thats whats in this lake
there have been northern sightings
but not this north
as hector cyr this giant ball of life deboards his chopper spotting kelly disappointed you beat me
then i need some of you to help me unpack
to burke and stevens you and you
to keough not you
to kelly who do we have from fish and game
to kelly me
who is this man
rapid fire i could see the algae blooms just coming in how long has this lake been stagnant
extending his hand to keough hi hector cyr
the earth is round and so should you be
to kelly who is he
ill need any and all topographic studies
wait just a second
you dont just fly in here and start barking orders
i apologize i just dont want to lose the light weve got time for a quick scout to kelly youve had work done
flaring frustrated i have not
who is this man
hector cyr i said it once let me know when it sinks in to kelly have you seen it
it couldnt be a crocodile
theyve been migrating north kelly this lake connects to the ocean frustrated mr
cmon were losing light to kelly why does the big one heckle me
kelly yanks him aside
the big one has no sense of humor
and since hes the one who decides whether you get to play try not to be your obnoxious self
that hurt my feelings
and it did a little
hector is a big teddy bear
arriving if were gonna go we better go
keough and kelly are in one canoe hector and jack are alongside in another
hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar devices
if hes here ill find him
to jack re kelly did she tell you we had sex together
i never had sex with you
even so youre allowed to boast
you look thin by the way ive mentally undressed you i can see your ribcage
i really dont mean to be discourteous
patronizing but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england
they have saltwater glands they can swim across oceans its only a matter of time
and what would he do come winter
they can survive winter
as long as their nostrils dont freeze they survive to kelly am i foolish to explain things he had such trouble with my name
to keough is this where it happened
knows his crocodiles if hes eaten in the area he shouldnt be far away
crocs hang around the food source
but theyre nighttime hunters hector hed probably be on land now anyway
cept he wasnt before was he
then to keough you know when friends or family members say things they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger
suddenly there are ripples fish breaking surface about thirty feet away
are they feeding
doesnt look like it
they look like theyre jumping
they look scared
upon which something grabs the front of kellys canoe and with one crisp yank flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table sending them all flying
in an instant keough and kelly are swimming for their lives
screaming yelling they scramble for the canoe climb onto its flipped over back
breathless they all exchange confused looks
what the hell happened
kelly still in wet clothes is talking on her portable phone
keough is there as hector approaches
jack is approaching as well
activity bustles in the b
into her phone none of us actually saw anything
then i realize this sir but something flipped us over i doubt very much it was a mink
whats going on
they dont believe her
still into phone thank you its so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you you fucker
she clicks off such the flirt
wildlife wont send anybody without a confirmation
same thing from fish and game
somethings in that water
well until we see it were not gonna be convincing too many people
as deputy sharon gare approaches calling sheriff
keough looks over
pointing to the ground you might want to see this
they all walk over
theres hundreds maybe a thousand worms squirming surrounding
a human toe
oh god worms
i got a thing about worms
its a human toe
hector studies it picks it up
then some decomposition little acidic it has been swallowed
to keough holding the toe is this the man who was killed
keough deadpans back
then wed only just met
well youve got a croc alright theyre keystone species
species keystones affect the entire ecosystem that could explain all these worms the water
youve got a crocodile
proffering the toe bury your friend
hector gives the toe to keough then heads off
keough stands there holding the tow as we kelly is testing a machine that sends out little squeaky sounds as jack approaches
takes a second to
well admire her
shes an attractive woman
he then approaches
adult males will charge hatchlings
if theres one out there
if one could be out there
why does fish and game tell me its impossible
because they just consult their little indigenous charts
a beat as she tends to her work
if you really do know crocs you should know how stealth like they are
i wouldnt be standing a foot from the water
he could be right there and you wouldnt see him
still looking at the water id be able to see something
upon which jack tosses a rock over her shoulder
as it makes a splash she screams and practically jumps into his arms
then realizing oh thats funny
that was real funny
and she heads off
off jack we two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent
from within we hear music the sounds of a party
looks at deputy burke whos digging
shrugs he paid us
keough continues on toward the tent
his tent is on the palatial side
stereo generator hes got a margarita bar going
theres a party
hectors dancing with deputy gare others are enjoying the drinks and music
youre a beautiful woman
and law enforcement such dangerous work
the idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring disconcerting lets mate commit your genes to perpetuity
upon which keough enters doesnt like what he sees
he goes turns off the music
we are here on official business
then whats with digging the holes
they come on land and theyre brazen
theyre also attracted to noise you can see i make a lot of it
everybody out back to your tents now
they start to leave
re gare could she stay weve tentatively scheduled intercourse
and they all go including gare who shrugs to keough hes kind of funny
to hector you listen to me
the only reason im letting you be part of this is cause you got the helicopter and the radar and you like me
i do not like you
deep down gut check
im growing fond of you and its liberating to say so
keough stares back
youre a whacko
and keough leaves to as keough heads off that hurt my feelings
kelly stands alone skipping stones
after a beat jack approaches
what are you doing
look how flat that water is you can get ten skips on a good one
hank and i think it best if you stay on shore
i beg your pardon
whatevers out there did flip over a canoe i am not staying on shore
its too dangerous for i didnt fly up here to roast marshmallows you flew up here because your boss i am going out on that boat and why are you
picking on me is this some kind of hazing new fingernails im not picking in the woods
overriding im beginning to see why you were shipped off
and her face falls
wounded quietly that was an awful thing to say to me
feels bad now im sorry but youre
he doesnt finish the sentence
genuine i do know crocodiles and i wont get in your way
then i really do want to be a part of this
jack reads her he can see that she does
then were up at six
a beat night
theres a little chemistry here though both would probably deny it
he heads off toward his tent she sits with her book
she gives one last look watches him go
then she goes back to her book
the lake is still the campfire is out the tents are quiet
the quiet sounds of night
a courageous raccoon looks about seeing what he can rummage
by the water
a black bear takes a drink
he emerges compelled by a full bladder wearing only his trousers carrying a revolver
he walks into the nearby woods
he removes from his shorts his bladders connection to the outside world
proceeds to urinate
he hears something
the sound of rustling leaves
he stops urinating we hear a half second of movement
must be his imagination
he resumes his business
more rustling its not just the sound of dense urine against leaves he stops
somethings out there in the darkness
he starts up for a second stops quickly and we hear it for sure
somethings rustling towards him
with his free hand keough pulls out his revolver
keough points the gun
something on the ground is coming toward him
he moves slowly gun drawn into the darkness
the rustling is getting louder
its almost upon him
then keough peels away a bush revealing looking into a gun barrel
then jesus christ
what the hell are you doing
what are you doing
youre crawling around like a im laying a spring trap
a spring trap
i keep telling you they can come on land i dont wanna wake up in the middle of the night i coulda shot you you this could end up saving
your life youll be glad you didnt hey look im sure you shoot me then youll be finished first in your tongue massaging my class but i think you need hemorrhoids just before to be retired to the big rubber running off to get your room where you can play with sister pregnant who you soft stuffed reptiles
probably already call mom
and now all the others awakened are charging
what is going on
this man takes a pistol hes crawling around to pee
escalating this is an official investigation and this cuckoo bird is a civilian
i dont care how much money hes got hes a total mental
and hector storms off
you hurt his feelings
i think you should go apologize
were a team here
it hes a fruitcake
wont kill you to get along
the thing about hector
he takes this crocodile business very
how to say it he thinks theyre godly
he thinks theyre what
in his defense every primitive culture known to man deified them
hes a mythology professor he thinks crocs are divine conduits
is this spose to make me take him more serious
its to make you understand him with understanding comes tolerance
too bad they dont put proverbs in twinkies my load would be lighter
befuddled why does everybody insult my intelligence i have intelligence intelligent people eat twinkies
keough shoots a look to jack
lets just all get some sleep
and keough heads off under im an intelligent person
upon which he disappears from earth
hes stepped into one of hectors pit traps
calmly i shall kill him
the steam is lifting off the lake
keough kelly hector and deputy burke are cruising in the whaler
hector and jack are both in full diving gear
jack also has a stick gun for protection
hector does not
again i dont mean to be annoying with my questions
but if it is a crocodile which i dont think it is
and if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds
to jack why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time
to hector with you it makes sense
they dont really attack underwater and that walt guy got hit underwater no crocodile has ever to hector you should take a flax pole
and what if i tranq him kelly
you think about that
im just saying last resort
not to be disruptive
do we have a problem with it dying
crocodiles dont sever with their teeth their molars are blunt
as if thats suppose to clear it up
keough stares back blankly
then is this a trick
what im saying is if its a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred
years old it would be unthinkable to destroy him
to burke alright lets just drop here
burke lowers the anchor as keough just continues to stare at hector
kelly readies the hatchling recorder
she lowers it into the water
they respond pretty quick
ill wait till you get down before i turn it on
climbing over see ya soon
there was a twinge of real concern in her voice
he makes eye contact with her
then drops over
to kelly two years married divorced used to be a lawyer quit im still waiting on his sperm count
off hectors look oh as if im interested
as hes about to go overboard to keough will you miss me
to hector i brought a pork chop maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck
no thank you but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log
and hector drops overboard
to kelly was that like a homo sexual remark
strict i asked you to be nice to him
keough rolls his eyes
we hear the high pitch of crocodile hatchlings
visibility is again pretty limited
hector dives through the dark black water
visibility is lousy
jack dives searched
looks ahead sees something
he moves closer
its the carcass of the moose no head
kelly and keough onboard
he may be a kook but hes also been all over the world with them
he even swam in the grimetti with killer niles all around him he never got nipped
and thats why he thinks theyre godly
he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes
simple you like jack
i dont even know the guy
hector thinks you like him
well hectors a giant cracker
you think jacks handsome
what is this
im just curious
i can never tell what women think is handsome
is he handsome
hes probably rugged handsome i guess
jack and hector diving together
the boats sit still on the dead calm water
kelly works the radar keough covertly eats a twinkie
it shouldnt be taking so long
they both scan the surface
hector moves about
we can hear the hatchling recorder but hes not seeing anything
jack looks about
he looks up
doesnt see much but he gets an eerie feeling
somethings out there
keough kelly and burke standing idly scanning the calm surface
into headset hector jack we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left and youre on the last tank
time to go home
that was a bust
something jerks the boat a little
what was that
i dont know
it was like a tug
something tugged us
upon which something really yanks the boat
kelly flips over the back into the water
the boat is moving being dragged quickly
somethings got the anchor line
but kellys alone in the water the boat being pulled away
into headset jack
were being dragged
as he starts the motor to burke cut the line
cut the fucking line
burke goes to work on the anchor line as we angle kelly treading water in the middle of nowhere
shes completely vulnerable
hector swimming for the surface
kelly treading water
find keough on the boat he now has the engine running fighting against the drag but whatever has that boat has a fucking strong hold
cut the goddamn rope
working away im trying
and finally as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne with a jump burke nearly sails out
keoughs boat then races to kelly
suddenly about thirty feet away
we see fish breaking water
the boat is zooming toward her
as keough and burke go to pull her aboard we see a dark shadow rising
screaming look out
and jack explodes out of the water it was his shadow
keough and burke pull them both aboard
back to kelly are you alright
then wheres hector
to jack where is he
we went in different directions
that water is thick you cant see through it
hector is swimming toward the surface
a shadow looms over him
he looks up
there is no boat
we cant see it just a big shadowy mass
into headset hector
hector we got dragged off position when you surface you gotta yell
hector is still charging toward the surface
the lack of visibility is frightening something could be six feet away and he wouldnt know it
pointing theres bubbles over there
keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where kelly indicated under there he is
here he comes
and keough has the boat to him as hector breaks surface
and they quickly pull hector on board all attention is on hector as they lean over to rescue him
on the far right
moving closer to the oblivious rescuers
slowly moving in everybody is so preoccupied with hector deputy burke at the end of the boat is leaning way over to see hector
if only he knew what hes not seeing
the eyes come closer
theyre now in the water right below burkes head
how can he not see it
suddenly a mouth a dragon teeth something flashes from the water snap
and deputy burkes head is simply gone as his limp body hangs over the boat
kelly screams in horror
in a microsecond burkes head and life are both gone
off their stunned faces as kelly continues to scream we burkes body is being loaded into an ambulance
people move in silence the wake of tragedy
a few state troopers are on the scene
giving a statement nobody actually saw it
it happened sudden
pan to find kelly staring almost blankly as jack finishing a phone call approaches
he measures her expression shes still in shock
then nobody saw anything
wildlife is on their way
thats probably good
police want to keep it quiet if the press gets word
they just want us to sit tight
she is visibly undone she appears almost to be fighting off shock
jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her
are you okay
jack can see shes willing herself to be stoic
a man died
you dont have to be so tough
she nods appreciatively
part of her would love to collapse into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic
pan to find keough walking
still visibly shaken
he unwittingly approaches hector
they hold a look
genuine im sorry
was he a good man
whenever somebody dies i consider it such a waste that i didnt know him better
then fighting off disbelief shock maybe his head was just
sadly i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless
keough turns to stare at him with incredulity
quietly rattling it off id be on the ground looking up at my body no head walking around bumping into everything
and my parents wouldnt let me in the house cause theyd just bought all these new antique lamps and they were afraid id knock them over made sense and meanwhile
the neighborhood bullies would see my round little head on the ground looking like a ball and theyd come rushing over to start up a game of soccer
id actually feel grateful just for being allowed into the contest thats esteem for you what are your thoughts
keough has had enough of this guy
a powder keg you know hector im sure youre a fine person in your own mental way
but i think it would be best if you and i didnt speak
and keough heads off
he takes about four steps
up goes his upside down body like a rocket
hes stepped in hectors spring bow trap
he swings upside down like a pendulum
this is a setback
you dont want to cut me down
cause ill kill you
kelly and jack
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow look for prints
she just stares out as if she didnt hear
and he fixes his own stare on her
feeling it she turns catches him looking at her he diverts the stare
she feigns a non reaction
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion
when you get scared the brain releases a chemical same chemical it releases when somebodys
a beat in high school the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie
what are you talking about
im saying between the moonlight a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off
you look good
gee that was so poetic jack
im all moist
forgive me for trying to be nice
nice would be you look pretty nice is not some man eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good
i didnt say it like that
you did you i was trying to pay you a compliment i was guising it as science cause i know youre comfortable in that arena
a man just died youre hitting on me with science
just forget it
arriving beg pardon
sorry to intrude but hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree
hank hangs still upside down from the tree as hector kelly and jack approach
i probably couldve accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face
hank says nothing he hangs there perfectly still
the three exchange looks
are you okay
calmly almost sweet other than feeling slightly embarrassed im perfectly fine
then could you cut me down
promise you wont kill me first
calmly i have no interest in ever looking at you hector
again could you please cut me down
jack gives kelly a knife
you cut well hold him
hector and jack grab hold kelly cuts they lower him to the ground
calm thank you
then i lied
and he charges after hector who runs toward the beach
keough chases jack and kelly pursue trying to stop him
and suddenly exploding out of the woods a ferocious charging growl
screams all over a half second of confusion before we see its a large black bear jumping out of the darkness right at hector
hector dives out of its path
screams panic shouting as the bear rears up on his hind legs
seemingly about to lunge when
exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile
in a flash instant the beast engulfs the bear twisting it slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water
the bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here
in a matter of seconds both bear and crocodile have vanished
and the water is calm again
whatever they expected to find in this expedition they werent remote prepared for that
there are no words here
shock is pre empting every other human sensory
what they just saw
a crocodile head measuring five feet rise up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear
then admitting okay
its a crocodile
ill admit it
a beat as they gulp air
to jack youre cut
there is a little blood over jacks right eye
he dabs it
to hector he was an indo pacific
daunted are you sure
scales were oval
it was an asian crocodile
how could he get here
obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet
he had to be thirty feet long
the little cannon you brought get it
guard the shoreline
otherwise were done
we made the i
our job is finished
i wanna know why that monster is here
you got a theory
why hes that big i dont know
why hes here
the wetlands are being developed crocodiles are moving
australia fiji the things have started to cross oceans
but why maine and why alone
crocs are social whys this guy on the move by himself
maybe he doesnt play well with others
is everything a big fucking joke to you
re his groin bite my bishop
and keough starts for him but jack intercedes
im sick of him
interceding let him go
im sick of you cmon
too let him go
then thing about being rich sheriff my parents had the added luxury of being able to ditch me off at karate school im a brown belt
so go ahead
take your best shot
keough throws a haymaker decking hector
lays him out
he said he knew karate
shaken at school theyd always say go first
to keough get your big gun and guard the shore
go to your tent
muttering as he goes he never said go
to keough get the gun
muttering as he goes if i fall into a hole or get hoisted into a tree
and hes gone
re keough and hector like little children
then you okay
i got some stuff for your cut
i couldnt believe
did you see the size of that things mouth
i wonder if hes some kind of mutant
then that bear had to be surprised
taking her arm ushering lets get away from the shore
she looks at his hand on her arm which suddenly makes him self consious
they hold a look
we are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake
a four wheel drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly unpassable dirt road into the clearing
told you i could make it
as the jeep comes more into view we reveal its occupants to be six teenagers including janine and tom steve danny carol ellen
theyve been drinking but theyre not sloppy drunk
as they climb out tom points to a swing rope which extends from the branch of a tree that overhangs the water
there it is
stripping last one ins a dead man
could be more like first one in
the teenagers begin to strip off their clothes
as they giggle and laugh we kelly is butterflying jacks wound necessarily working very close to him
just gotta pull it a little tighter
who taught you be be a nurse
fathers a surgeon
i can even stitch in a pinch wouldnt be a bad idea here
keep it dry
dry thank you
they hold a look
then youre having the best time of your life arent you
people have been killed i hardly think im having a good time why would
off his look copping does it show
jack nods slightly
this is the first time ive actually
yknow been in the middle of anything
ive never really even gotten dirty before with me showers have always been preventative
their eyes are locked now making her self conscious and nervous
thats why youre here
to get in the middle of something
ive always read about whats happened
i know it sounds silly but its nice to be someplace while something is actually
something is happening right now
we should probably go to bed
quickly get rest get some rest
go to our separate beds get some rest
the freudian slip of her life
they hold another look
then he starts to exit
he stops at the door turns back
thanks for the
please dont go night
he holds another look then leaves
off her punishing herself for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment short
the teenagers are now skinny dipping having a grand ol flirtatious time
as they splash and frolic and cop their feels we angle
about fifty yards away
two eyes pop above the surface
followed by the snout
go to six fresh delicious teenagers
the croc as he slowly starts to move
the teenagers start to take turns swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the shoreline
as they laugh and yell danny swings on a long rope
landing with a splash
about ten feet from the croc waiting stealth like his eyes barely above surface
he could easily go for danny
but he somehow knows the service will get better
as danny swims back to shore janine takes hold of the rope
here i come
ready or not
and she swings away
a better swing than dannys
and she splashes down about five feet from the eyes
again the eyes dont move
the teenagers cheer janines record setting swing as tom takes hold of the rope
all or nothing tom
from the jaws of defeat
and he flies away
its a leap to die for
as he splashes down
like a seal grabbing a fish
and tommy has vanished
the kids cheering at the leap stop cheering when tommy fails to resurface
they first think hes playing a joke
still no sign of tommy
still in the water tommy
then this isnt funny tommy
and now theyre concerned
they all move down toward the shore
and now theyre starting to panic
where is he
yelling this isnt funny
suddenly thrusting up out of the water
the crocodile tommy in its jaws
bloodcurdling screams from all as we hector and keough both hear the screams of the teenagers
it came from across the lake
keough jack and deputy stevens are in the boat zooming towards the teenagers
to keough you said nobody came in here
obviously i was wrong
hector and kelly are flying toward the area the search beams are on
he just took him in his jaws
the teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on
hectors chopper is hovering over the area its beams lighting the water
lying on the beach covered
and basically unhurt
he was in his mouth
stunned to tommy youre okay
in shock i think just cuts
the thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us
you should have signs posted for gods sake
examining him youre really okay
then i might need a tetanus
keough and jack exchange a look of disbelief
hector keough jack and kelly looking tired trek toward their tents
just spit him back out
some shall live some shall die arbitrarily sound like any higher power we know
dismissive he didnt eat the kid cause hed just swallowed a bear
half man half croc oldest god im tired hector
i know this because youre beginning to not bug me
that sounds good but underneath its hurtful
theyre growing on each other
jack and kelly exchange a smile
hector and keough are developing an odd kinship almost
they continue on as jack and kelly stop at her tent
we seem to say goodnight a lot
we could not say it and
suddenly a coward well that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to
he holds another look
she goes into her tent
he stands there
waits to see if she calls him back
he then heads off
her head pops out
watches him go
almost calls after him
we see the campsite looking at it from the water
all is still
after a beat
an eye blink
we are not looking at the campsite
we are close on an eye reflecting the campsite
we hear a slight snarl
then hector and deputy gare inside the chopper lifting of to begin an early morning search
kelly jack keough and stevens searching for tracks along the wooded shoreline staying a good six feet from the actual shore
their senses are very heightened
keough has his cannon gun
get back from the shore
we know how fast he can leap out
we shouldnt even really be doing this
they wont be here till at least noon
we got a few hours to kill
so does he
obsessing im gonna get ticks
i know it
theyre drawn to me
i got a thing about ticks
i heard something
hes staring at a brush thicket
after a beat we hear a slight rustle
the guns go up quickly
jack bends down picks up a stone
tosses it into the thicket
and out it charges
kelly screams theyre all about to fire before they realize its only a beaver
it scurries into the water
trying to gather herself shit shit shit shit shit
embedded in the mud
it must be two feet in diameter
to keough guard the water
kelly and jack go quickly to examine the print
thats pretty big
the chopper is descending
hector and gare are inside
it seems like were getting lower
it happens when i land
why are we landing
cause this is the cove he obviously lives in
alarmed so why are we landing
kelly and jack are still working on the footprint
physical proximity which theyre both a little distracted by
thing we can lift it
dont mush it
annoyed im not mushing it
youre mushing it a little around the im not mushing it
suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot scaring all of them but particularly kelly who jumps
her foot lands on a long extended branch and even more suddenly burkes severed head seesaws out of the shallow water hitting her in the shin
she screams as they all jump back
they just stare as kelly continues to scream
holding her okay
that is it
i keep getting hit with heads
holding her shoulders calm down
you calm down
she takes a couple of calming breaths
im being very calm
this is the second time ive been hit with a severed head im entitled to complain
re the head is that uh
i cant recognize him from the back
it looks like him
keough takes a stick
squeamish he tentatively pokes the head trying to turn it over
it is burke
keough leans in for a closer look
re something what the
something appears to be in his mouth
keough takes a small twig pries back a cheek
the mouth is full of worms
now im gonna puke
seeing something you gotta be kidding
about a hundred yards north mrs
bickerman is leading a blindfolded cow to the water
kelly raises her binoculars
so does jack
what is she doing now
then mother of god
look ten feet into the water
mouth fully open
is the fucking crocodile
kelly jack and keough as they lower their scopes
they look at each other then back at the foregoing
bickerman singing itsy bitsy spider is happily leading the blinded cow to the shore
the cow tentative just allows itself to be led not knowing what the plan is
bickerman gets to the water she looks out to the croc
come and get it
and with that she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump forward
almost simultaneously the croc makes its charge and the cow is dead before it has a clue
after a long beat keough kelly and jack are questioning a slightly hostile mrs
indignant i havent broken any laws
bordering on condescension oh but you have maam
you lied to us that could be obstruction of justice
a mans been killed in part cause of your silence i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and im sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat
the reason i lied is if id told you the truth youd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what youre doing
how long have you been feeding this thing
about six years
he first appeared in may of nineteen ninety one
bernie was out fishing and it followed him home
so we threw him some scraps and well
he didnt seem to bother anybody
he became kind of like a pet who lived in the wild
he just appeared
you have no idea how he arrived in this lake
your husband bernie
you didnt by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded
offended no i did not
then the crocodile did kill him though
but it was all
it was a mistake
one of our horses got loose two years ago went to the lake to drink and
well the crocodile started coming in bernie went to intercede and
it was all a terrible misunderstanding
then if i reported it they wouldve sent people to kill it
keough kelly and jack cant quite believe what theyre hearing
then maam how could you not report this
he puts human life at risk and nobody lives on this lake
its really his lake now
the chopper free floating is drifting near a small cove
hector in diving gear is about to go into the water as gare tries to dissuade
getting panicked cmon hector
i know youre crazy but you cant i need to see his habitat
as he drops in
ill have sex with you anything but get out of the water
hes not gonna hurt me
kelly jack and keough with bickerman
murders and rapes in the cities
people bomb planes
can the police stop them
but feed one little cow to a crocodile
youre to wait right here until the police show youre under full house arrest
thank you officer fuckmeat
through walkie talkie hank
we got a problem with hector
into walkie talkie what problem
through walkie talkie he went swimming
hector is underwater exploring
her radar is up she heard something
but she doesnt see anything
she scans the surface closely
the water is slightly more visible as hector swims
other than the odd school of fish an otter a snapping turtle
then a flash shadow looms over him
he looks up but sees nothing
probably just the sun ducking under a cloud
it does make him sufficiently nervous however to head for the surface
he swims upward
hector breaks the top
lifts his mask looks toward the chopper which he sees about forty yards out
he continues to breaststroke on the surface
the crocs head rises up right behind hector whos oblivious
he continues to swim
the croc follows
maybe divine intuition
hector gets a feeling hes being followed
he then turns to look the other way upon which his face goes rigid
about three feet from his nose
are two giant eyes staring at him
the croc doesnt move
it just stares at him
then end of his snout is almost touching hector
hector himself doesnt dare move for fear of spooking the croc into action
we get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids
i suddenly feel a bit foolish
then youre different from the others
the croc raises his head now to reveal the snout
and his deadly smile
hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible
he deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over
perhaps this is what he came for
to be judged by this symbol of mythology
he backswims ever so slightly
the croc pursues just as slowly their eyes are locked
he could snap off hectors head in an instant
terrified trying to convince himself holy spirit of sobek
swallows holy shit
gare still scans the waters surface looking for any sign of hector
and her face freezes
oh yes theres the sign
hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc slowly follows
we can hear the quaking fear in hectors voice
as he continues to slowly backswim
to gare forced calm just turn the ignition its fuel injected
gare turns the ignition the engine kicks and dies
she turns it again and the engine turns over
the crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and closer toward the chopper
i know under the circumstances biting off my head might seem viable
it would cheapen you
but nothings funny about this to hector now
what hes staring into is death
gare raises her rifle
i might get a shot
fear in his voice no
if you dont kill him instantly im dead and youll only kill him instantly if you get his brain which is about the size of a cherry
and even if you were on target a bullet might not penetrate his hide
re the croc jesus
to hector about twelve more yards
keep coming just like that
craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye contact with the crocodile it growls
hector quickly locks eyes with him again
weakly oh my god
by now hector is almost to the chopper the croc is right there too
hectors right hand then goes slowly for his belt though its impossible to discern why
the crocodile seems poised to finish him
theres a slight growl
and then suddenly a small underwater pop followed by an explosion out of the water
its an inflatable life vest and as it pop tarts out of the water the croc lunges for it
as the croc goes for the vest hector makes his dash for the chopper
in almost an instant hes climbing on board as the croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater
hectors up on the choppers ski
the crocodiles head comes thrusting up its massive jaws snapping shut missing hector by an inch maybe two
hector dives into the chopper screaming
she revs the chopper
the croc comes up again chomping down on one of the landing skis
both gare and hector scream as the whole helicopter is jerked mightily
the croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to thrust off when the croc surfaces again mouth open
gare fires her revolver
it might as well shoot bbs
the croc is undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up and running finally safely out of the reptiles reach
jack is nearly manhandling hector pulling him by the elbow towards his tent
kelly and keough are there too
livid this time im gonna kick your ass
bastard bit my chopper
jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point
hector yelps in pain
you wanna kill yourself that it you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide
back to hector you might think theyre godly you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and flaring lets not overlook
he didnt eat me maybe cause he just ate a cow you stupid jack
im a civilian
you dont have any authority i can arrest you
then do it
you probably do want to be killed by it that was you trying to meet your maker
so profound and fat
hector feelings hurt stomps off again
kelly looks at jack
then kelly follows hector
hector enters sits
kelly enters goes to sit next to him
softly did you want to be killed by it
you think im that nuts
then what you just did
there was at least some sort of a death wish going on
escalating im rich people are automatically my friends sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and hes sounding erratic
im no psychiatrist
but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy than pained im an empty man kelly wealth has robbed me of the dream in life
i sit here broken a hollow sack oh bullshit
and hector drops the act
didnt even sound good
worth a try eh
can i tell them you wont go back in the water
i dont know
he has trouble saying it
could we have intercourse
she just whacks him
off hector worth a shot we jack and keough are there to meet kelly
just heard from wildlife and florida fish and game
they should be here by four
we might as well pack
theyll kill him
they turn to see hector is standing there
theyre not going to be able to snag him in pitmans
tranq him in water he drowns
they could try to tranq him on land
knowing they wont
hes taken human life the mission will be to put him down
gee that would really disappoint me
forget about him being god hes thirty feet long he is a miracle of nature who somehow made his way to maine
this is a grand beast
a grand dragon
an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive
well you can try talking them into that if i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out
and i think i know a way to forget it
i know im crazy but when they come they will kill it
they have to politically hes too dangerous if something were to go wrong
the odds are he will be destroyed which is exactly please hank let me finish what
im having a sane moment this is a window
if he were neutralized when they got here
they might consider saving him
and how would we neutralize him
we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs
weve all seen it
hes probably a hundred and fifty years old hes bigger than an elephant
hectors impassioned here hes not fooling around
so maybe wildlife will try to save him theyre more equipped to we both know what theyll do
admission by silence
then even if we could tranq him how would we get him on land
other than to eat us
he follows anything that moves
you guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns
if he charges drive off plus hank youve got your hand held cannon
we could do this with no safety risk
if it works we save a beast that should be saved
they are sympathetic to the idea
how would you get him on land
thats actually the easy part
we hear the chopper
to keough ill sue you
and up goes hectors chopper
reveal connected to a long cable
an airborne cow dangling from the chopper
to jack you cant take a cow by eminent domain
we wont let him get hurt maam
youre all fuckers
vicious little fuckers
jack turns to kelly
are we crazy
weve got a cow hanging from a helicopter
lets get back to camp
not much drag
as long as i can keep him from swinging were okay
hectors chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove
find keough kelly and jack on the water cruising back to camp
keough has his gun
two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage
kelly jack keough
riflemen are ready with tranq guns
into headset keep enough tension to hold him up hector we dont know if he can swim
through headset right
the more he thrashes the better
through headset you ready on shore
the chopper lowers the cow
he starts to kick his legs in anticipation
through headset if he tires lift him out
and the cow goes into the water
he swims frantically a few meters
the chopper lifts him out briefly
it cant work
he has been going after everything
it could work
then but this is not a happy cow
he looks like a giant tea bag
the cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he just hangs there like pasta
jack keough and kelly are poised with tranq guns on the beach
looking through binoculars he doesnt seem to be swimming
is he swimming
looking through binoculars hes floating
take it home
into headset hector
i got something on the screen
theres a mass
moving toward the cow
into walkie talkie now adrenalized where
through walkie talkie thirty meters or so
moving slow but straight toward elsie
can you confirm visually or just radar
through walkie talkie radar hes underwater
but hes definitely coming
lead him in
to the others barking okay everybody up on the trucks
we aim for the stomach or side
theres little chance the darts will pierce his hide
everybody up on the trucks
they move into position
charged on our way
there hes surfacing theres the snout
you little sucker
that giant snout breaks the surface
ever so calmly
it moves toward the cow
into walkie talkie if he gets close you go up hector dont you endanger that cow
shes worried about the cow now
through walkie talkie hes following
here we come
depicting the same
to hector nice and slow
to the others lets get ready
hectors chopper cow dangling is slowly approaching the shore
the snout and eyes of a giant croc
back on the shore keoughs men ready themselves for action
the team is mobilized
we hear a distressed cry from the cow
theyre coming right in
such a simple idea and its working
what does that tell you
that its about to go wrong
into walkie talkie almost here hector
dont forget to lift up the cow
sarcastic through walkie talkie thank you jack
to the team you shoot on my order
if he charges ill be yelling go which means drivers take off
and drive fast they can move on land
to keough you set
dont worry about me
the plan is working
a giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline
hector dangles the cow closer theyre now nearing shore
the big crocodile eyes on the prize is moving in for the flank steak
the time is now
were in about four feet of water now
three two one
the crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow snapping at air
hector pulls up with the chopper
jack gare and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts
but hector has taken his chopper up too fast causing the cow to swing like a pendulum
it rocks the chopper
the chopper is in trouble
the cow sways the helicopter struggles to stay airborne
screaming watch out
the men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts
hectors having trouble righting his chopper
suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow snapping off the cable
and down comes to the chopper hector cannot control it
it crashes into the lake
to keough take him
ill get hector
where is he
we gotta get to hector
to the driver back us in a little we need to get a shot
hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper
he looks around
where is he
to the deputies tranq guns down rifles up
the men switch guns under yelling to hector do not go in that water
to the driver back us in
as the pick up backs closer to the shore to keough if you get a safe shot
ill take it
do not move
the water is calm again
to gare you see anything
looking through binocs nothing
maybe he swam out
upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging the truck
the pick up spins dirt lurches forward throwing keough off balance
the croc heads back for the water as keough regains his balance
and keough blasts
it detonates the ground near the croc causing him to surge airborne into the water
and he goes under
did you get him
i dont know
to the driver back the truck no
hector you see anything
on the pontoon of his chopper
hes looking about studying the water
sarcastic i just have this feeling everythings totally safe
yelling i see blood
maybe you got him hank
and as hector looks further
up surfaces the crocodile in all his stealth
his head is two feet from hector and nobody knows it
least of all hector
i cant see him but this is definitely blood
maybe you got him
and as he turns back he sees it
the croc comes up as hector screams jumps off
keough leaps off the truck and charges into the shallow water with his gun looking to give hector some cover
hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper
he climbs in
where is he
i dont know
no sooner said than the croc comes launching up
as he springs toward the open chopper cabin hector leaps out on the other side
the crocs head comes crashing clear through the cabin and he becomes wedged
the crocodile is stuck he protrudes right through the chopper
hes not completely immobilized but wherever he goes now the helicopter is going with him
but now jack has joined rifle in hand
hector surfaces again swimming for shore
jack runs to help him onto land
taking aim alright
but the croc looks feeble now
he lets out this moan of death
and even keough hesitates to pull the trigger
to kelly should i
the croc unable to dive is now thrashing toward the beach
but theres no rage in his behavior now
he seems desperate
hes taken some bullets hes tired hes wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and hes exhausted
i think the drugs are kicking in
breathing heavily he lumbers into the shallow water unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage
as unbelievable as that cow looked dangling from this very chopper the sight is even more astonishing if not preposterous now
a thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter
and he just cannot go on anymore
kelly hector jack keough stare back
they approach with caution
they all stare at the tired crocodile
hes now looking back
in his eyes
we can see it
the beast is beaten
theres no triumph
in their eyes
i dont think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath
it continues to breathe heavily
hes through fighting
look at him
i dont care
keough raises his cannon
hes got nothing left
yeah and every time we think theres no more danger upon which a twenty footer another croc thrusts up out of the water seizing hector
it death rolls hector flings him out of his mouth and in seconds hes coming up for more
keough blasts his avenger
a direct hit
it takes the smaller crocs head right off sending it sailing into the air
it splashes down the first head not to hit kelly
they all then go for hector pulling him to shore
youre not okay your legs a mess
get him onto shore
he heeds a tourniquet
keough quickly peels off his shirt
gives it to kelly who goes to work
youre gonna be okay
guess i finally got bit
yeah you got bit
im gonna fix it
a sudden roar
kelly screams as jack and keough wheel to see
the big croc
maybe his final roar he looks weak
gasping in the crashed chopper
jack and keough approach
quietly re the big croc hes done
dont count on it
then we better take him out
but something about this crocodile
his eyes looking back at them
nobody wants wants to take him out
looking back at them
he knows hes in their hands now
quiet flax him under his tail
two hundred ccs
under the tail thatll put him to sleep
upon which we hear the sound of trucks
florida fish and game u
wildlife arriving on the scene
officer colson florida fish and game emerges approaches
stares with utter disbelief
we need to get it some medical help
re hector and him too
by now the florida army has moved in
they all stare with the same suspended disbelief
explaining we trapped him with our chopper
a crew including vets are working on the sedated croc trying to free it from the wreckage
find the paramedics with hector on a stretcher
jack kelly and keough are there
were gonna airvac him to portland
to hector thats where theyre taking the croc hector theyve got some big tank there
hes gonna live
thanks to you
to keough i know you werent really trying to hit him
gently i was aiming for you
thanks for the rescue
jack leans down
you take care
you talk to bickerman
she didnt tell us about the other croc cause she was afraid wed blow its head off
are there anymore
just those two
we gotta take him
we got room for one
i got stuff to pack up and
he looks to kelly but before she can say yes grudging ill go
the paramedics board hector
keough turns to jack
thanks for your help
thats about as much affection as you get from keough
he then extends his hand to kelly
im sure this would offend you on principal but
could we keep in touch
and she kisses him on the cheek
keough fights off his blush boards the chopper
as it then lifts up kelly turns to jack
you wanna ride in my truck
arriving your truck is jammed
should we take some stuff out
no no ill be a while anyway
im gonna say goodbye to the lake
i dont mind
no i actually want to stay for a little while
they hold a look
then ill miss you most of all scarecrow
and she kisses his cheek
if im ever in new york
they hold another look
yknow if we didnt live in separate worlds and
a beat but we do
then hey well always have maine
something meeting you
he kisses her hand
holds a look
the tents are down everythings packed
a couple trucks remain
the croc is gone
things are quiet
kelly stands down by the water staring out
the lake doesnt even ripple
she soaks it in as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to this again
she hears every bird
including a distant loon
serenity has returned
a stone goes skipping out four five six skips
kelly turns around
jack stands there
they hold a look
i thought i should say goodbye to the lake too
takes her hand
weakly different worlds jack
yeah i thought about that as i was driving
i havent found somebody in my world
you found anyone in yours
so i was thinking
maybe if i met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in new york good for me we could fix each other up
worth a try
we dont wanna be alone forever do we
they hold a look
he kisses her softly
yknow if the guy asks me can she kiss now ill be able to tell him if you can
and they kiss again this one escalates a little
and then he holds her
tightly as the camera pulls up to an aerial view of them embracing at the waters edge
police cars lights flashing motor down the highway
on a flatbed truck
a thirty foot giant crocodile
headed down the southbound lane of the maine turnpike
it doesnt even look ridiculous
weve become accustomed to such sights
as we lift up higher and higher richie havens i can see clearly now resumes
eventually we jack and kelly board his vehicle
they drive off as we daffy mrs
bickerman sits at the end of her dock feet dangling in the water
throwing bread crumbs
cute little buttons
mommy loves you
come eat your supper little buttons
nibble mommys toes
three maybe four crocodile hatchlings a foot in length are swimming near her feet eating the bread nibbling her toes
off them then happy mrs
