star trek first contact story by rick berman brannon braga ronald d
moore screenplay by brannon braga ronald d
moore first draft september we can hear movement
strange skittering sounds like razor claws on metal
the hiss of pneumatic hoses
the whirr and click of servos
an eerie alien cacophony
appears hanging now in the starry blackness
the alien noises continue and far in the distance we hear the muffled thump of what could be a distant explosion
alien text suddenly appears next to earth and we reveal we are in the image of earth is actually on a monitor which is only one of dozens of monitors
covering a huge wall
we dont see anything of the rest of the room but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre a mixture of organic and mechanical elements
circuitry and optical cabling are side by side with what looks almost like arteries and organs
we can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises
occasionally a shadowy form sweeps past the camera vaguely humanoid but we cant tell who or what it is
all of the monitors are active and they present myriad images and sound all related to earth history
the screens show everything from written chinese
to renaissance paintings
to black and white newsreel footage of world war two
to what look like clips of space battles from the th century
the entire range of human history dancing across the monitors
the effect is dizzying we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race
there is another thump and the wall of monitors shudders slightly
we hear the voice of what we will come to know as the borg collective thousands of voices speaking at once restrict search parameters to through
the images on the monitors now change to show us images from st century earth history
again its a collection of still photography video footage text artwork etc
we hear snippets of sound bites music speeches from the period
a lot of enticing details
as the images race across the monitors we should learn the following
the turn of the st century brought chaos
regional wars the collapse of the united nations
societal break down
crime starvation desperation
a third world war
nuclear explosions environmental disasters tens of millions dead
the united states ceases to exist
all political authority vanishes
humanity teetering on the edge of the second dark age
the image of a single man zephram cochrane
a visionary scientist
he see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile
he flies the first warp test breaking the light barrier
it changes history
grainy black and white images of a vulcan scout ship landing on earth
they saw cochranes flight followed him back to earth and made first contact with the human race
humanity turns the corner
first contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before
humans and vulcans working together beginning to solve long standing problems with new technology
we see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions
a new world government is formed
people from planet earth and people from vulcan form an alliance
they call it the united federation of planets
and they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration
they call it starfleet
these are images recounting the birth of the star trek universe
another muffled explosion this one stronger shakes the entire wall
one of the monitors blows out in a shower of sparks
and now a new voice a womans voice low threatening with a slight metallic inflection speaks for the first time stop search
calculate temporal coordinates
another explosion rocks the room and it takes us to a huge spherical borg warship as it takes a phaser shot from an unseen vessel
the blast smashes into the borg sphere but the massive ship continues
the sphere returns fire
follow the borg fire to locked in battle with the borg sphere
the borg fire destroys the federation ship in a fiery blast
as the borg sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship and as it does we reveal that this is just one small part of involving dozens of
starfleet and borg vessels engaged in a fierce firefight as far as the eye can see
ships turning twisting firing exploding
lots of movement
its a spectacular sight
the borg sphere is moving away from the battle heading off in another direction
in the middle of the battle
a borg cube is attacking a smaller federation starship
the starship is taking quite a beating
explosions all along the hull
it doesnt look like it can take much more of this
suddenly a spread of four torpedoes come blazing in from o
the torpedoes slam into the borg ship causing massive damage
soars into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship
the enterprise is starfleets newest and most powerful vessel
an elegant and majestic ship
but unlike the last enterprise starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory
we get the feeling this enterprise is ready for anything
the bridge has been redesigned
a single captains chair dominates the room and surrounding consoles and stations all face inward instead of out giving picard instant access to his officers
picard in the captains chair
riker at a new ops station
data at the helm
worf at tactical
troi at communications various crewmembers at their posts
the ship is at red alert and everyone is tense
signal the endeavor to fall back
well cover them
she works her console
the endeavor moves off as the borg fire at the enterprise and blasts the saucer section
this should also produce an unusual effect instead of the traditional bubble shielding the new armor of this enterprise absorbs the blast and dissipates the energy across the hull
the ship is undamaged
the ship is rocked by the blast
dispersive armor is holding
bring us about
target borg ship alpha four port side battery
port battery ready sir
as rapid phaser shots leap out from half a dozen points along the ships port side
note the phasers also look different more along the lines of a gatling gun
the borg cube explodes
the enterprise flies through the debris
including main viewscreen which has a view of the chaotic battle surrounding them
another borg vessel looms into view
starboard battery fire
the enterprise fires a burst of phasers but this time the phasers have no effect
we see a strange shielding appears around the borg ship
on the main viewer the massive borg ship looms closer
the borg ship has modified its shields captain
our phasers will no longer be effective
ready quantum torpedo
only three left
another jolt as were hit
la forge to bridge
where geordi and n
engineers are rushing about hard at work
geordi is no longer wearing his visor he now has artificial ocular implants for eyes
they have a distinctive electronic look to them
captain im starting to worry about the hull integrity
weve been running the support field at full power for three hours straight
i dont know how much longer its going to hold up
keep me informed
the borg cube is huge on the main viewer as the enterprise rushes toward it
incoming transmission from the borg
data works and the viewer changes to a view of the interior of the borg cube
a vast chamber crammed with hundreds of borg drones standing upright in individual alcoves
theyre everywhere on the ceiling walls floor
this is a borg collective hundreds of borg that form a gigantic hive mind
the borg are half man half machine
no individual personalities
they have only one goal in life to assimilate new races into their collective
to become a borg is to experience living death
when they speak they speak as a collective thousands of voices speaking as one your defense perimeter is useless
you will be assimilated
to borg break off your attack
by now you must realize you cant win
your opinion is irrelevant
we are the borg
resistance is futile
well see about that
to worf fire
a quantum torpedo blasts out of the launcher and heads toward the borg cube
this torpedo is completely different than the traditional photon torpedo
it oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks toward the borg ship
as the quantum torpedo hits it
but instead of exploding on the surface the torpedo pierces the ship like an armor piercing shell and momentarily vanishes from view
the ship then explodes like a star going supernova bright light and shock waves
the ship is rocked violently by the shock wave
people hanging on
main power still on line captain
riker looks at his console
casualties are light captain
minor buckling on the port nacelle
incoming message from the starship intrepid
the viewer shows admiral hayes on the bridge of his starship
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick jean luc
weve destroyed forty seven borg ships so far
and only lost fifteen of our own
beat but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses and its heading directly for earth
can you handle it
mister data set a pursuit course
as it breaks away from the battle
and races into there are starfleet satellites and space stations in close orbit
the borg sphere seen before enters frame
the satellites open fire but they have little effect on the massive borg sphere which returns fire exploding them in orbit
the sphere heads down toward the earth
we are approaching the terran system captain
go to impulse
wheres the borg ship
it has entered earth orbit
off console correction it is not in orbit
it is heading directly toward the surface
picard gets up moves to datas console
incredulous some sort of suicide tactic
suicide tactics are not normally associated with the borg
data reacts to his console
sensors show a temporal signature emanating from the sphere
high concentrations of tachyons
picard studies datas monitor
and chronometric particles
its as though theyre trying to create a temporal vortex
a beat as picard makes a shocking realization
theyre attempting time travel
beat full power mister data
worf quantum torpedoes at my command
the borg sphere glowing red and beginning to burn with friction as it plummets toward earth
plunging down into the atmosphere giving chase
range fifty kilometers
a temporal vortex is forming directly ahead of the sphere
just ahead of the sphere we see a temporal vortex opening a maelstrom of light and energy stretching into infinity
energy explodes from the vortex as the sphere begins to go inside
as its hit by the tremendous energy blast from the vortex
the ship spins around nearly rips apart
everyone thrown to the deck
main power off line
switching to emergency back ups
riker checks a console
were caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex
another quantum torpedo is launched from the enterprise
but just before it hits the borg sphere the sphere vanishes inside the vortex
the torpedo hits the roiling energy of the vortex and detonates with a harmless flash
the vortex itself starts the shaking subsides
i have helm control
wheres the sphere
they have traveled into the vortex
the vortex is collapsing sir
contact starfleet command
reacts to console im not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sector
off console captain ive scanned the planet
the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane carbon monoxide and fluorine
the oceans have been chemically altered as well
she works and on the view screen earth appears as seen from orbit
the crystal blue marble is now covered by a thick turbulent dark atmosphere polluted and ugly
thirty five billion
reacts all borg
a shocking moment
off console the planets surface is covered with borg technology
beat so is the moon
and three other planets in this solar system
they mustve done it in the past
they went back and changed history
stunned they did it
they assimilated earth
but if they changed history
then why are we still here
we were caught in the temporal wake from the vortex
it must have protected us from any changes in the time line
worfs console sounds an alarm
captain there are five borg ships closing in on our position
making a decision data set a course for that vortex
we have to follow them back
repair whatever damage theyve done to that time line
working course laid in
engaging impulse engines
the ship is suddenly rocked
the enterprise is being chased by five borg ships as it heads down toward the planet
the borg vessels fire on the enterprise
the ship is shaking
hull integrity down to thirty percent
steady as she goes
ahead of the ship we see the vortex collapsing
the shaking increases
a console explodes
borg vessels are closing to two thousand meters
the ship is hit again and again
on the view screen were nearly on the vortex but its closing fast
take us in
the enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex as it finally collapses
both the enterprise and the vortex vanish
an empty star field
suddenly the vortex appears and the enterprise comes roaring out into space
the vortex vanishes behind the ship
the shaking subsides
everyone exchanges a look tries to re orient themselves
were still in earth orbit
which shows earth
the borg pollution is gone
what year is it
working according to our astrometric readings
the year is
captain ive found the borg sphere
its on the far side of the planet
firing at the surface
to data intercept course full impulse
to worf weapons status
phasers are off line
we have two quantum torpedoes left
but the computer targeting system has been destroyed
go to manual
worf pops open a panel and a high tech targeting console emerges with a small monitor and a traditional cross hair in the center
worf grabs the targeting hand controls futuristic joysticks
the ship is firing its weapons down toward the planet as the enterprise comes up over the horizon
worf works his controls
a complex array of grids coordinate information speed data and other weapons info on the monitor screen
he begins trying to focus the cross hairs on the sphere
over above action to troi track their weapons fire
off console western hemisphere
north american continent
we are within torpedo range
theyve seen us
theyre taking evasive action
urgent mister worf
worf struggles with the targeting system
the crosshairs keep missing the image of the borg sphere which is now twisting and turning to evade us
troi reacts to her console
captain theyre firing at a nuclear missile silo
in central montana
the crosshairs finally lock on the borg sphere
the quantum torpedo streaks in from off camera and slams into the borg ship
it penetrates the sphere as seen before
a long beat
and then it explodes
as everyone reacts to the destruction of the sphere
but picard has no time for celebration
to data mister data i want to know the exact date and time
to riker give me a damage report on that missile silo
works today is march second
the time in montana is oh eight forty five
works looks like they damaged the silo
long range bio sensors are off line
picard thinks for a moment
makes an instant decision and turns to worf
worf have doctor crusher mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three
riker turns to him curious
in twenty four hours zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test
from a missile silo in montana
if im right the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship
nods in understanding and if they succeed humans wont make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow
beat as first officer i should be the one beaming down
normally i would agree
but in this case the mission requires a certain knowledge of st century history
youre many things number one but youre not much of an historian
he grins slightly has to agree
good luck sir
ill keep in contact
you have the bridge
picard geordi and three security guards are checking their phasers and tricorders
everyone is wearing civilian clothes
geordi has a large engineering kit
transporter chief pulling on a civilian jacket
she looks a little frazzled its been a long day in sickbay
will somebody please tell me where were going
beverly joins them on the pad
to chief energize
well that answers everything
why the hell are we they dematerialize
picard geordi beverly and the security team materialize on the vast rolling plains of montana
continuing going to montana
picard and geordi take out their tricorders and start scanning the landscape
off tricorder i have the silo sir
bearing three one zero
distance three hundred meters
they start walking
is anyone going to tell me what were doing here
were here to find zephram cochrane
he may be injured or dead
the inventor of warp drive
but hes been dead for three hundred
realizes long sigh oh god
weve gone back in time again havent we
im afraid so
if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans
earth will remain in the second dark age
an easy target when the borg arrive in the th century
well why didnt you just say so in the first place
picard gives her a look
as they keep walking
hanging in orbit of earth
close on a dead crewmember lying on her back
a sheet is covering her face
a hand reaches in pulls back the sheet revealing the face of a crewman
lieutenant sandra farrel
widen to reveal troi and data
data is holding back the sheet while troi scans the body with a tricorder
there is repair work going on in the b
two medical n
s stand by
it appears death was caused by a plasma discharge
beat ill note in her record that she never left her post
troi glances at data who is clearly disturbed by the sight of the dead woman holding his emotions in check with difficulty
did you know her
not very well
we met shortly after the enterprise e was commissioned
i found her to be a most
troi looks at him in concern
are you sure youre all right
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming
grief loss remorse
we still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action
maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until were done
human beings do not have that luxury and neither should i
i will admit
there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off
riker to data
taps combadge go ahead commander
riker worf n
s at their stations
were reading some kind of gas leak in the environmental control room
take a repair team down and check it out
on my way commander
as data exits
a wide shot of the ship
camera closes on the aft section of the ship moving underneath of the hull pushing in on an area at the very bottom of the enterprise
data and ensign porter enter through a set of doors
the lights are off in the room dim
this is a large room crammed with many conduits gas tanks th century machinery and monitors
its normally unmanned this is where oxygen gravity heat and other environmental conditions of the ship are controlled
in a far corner of the room a conduit leading to a series of high pressure tanks labeled d o has ruptured and is spewing a corrosive poisonous gas
data scans it with his tricorder
to porter one of the diathermic oxygen tanks has been damaged
shocked diathermic oxygen
it is a new subsystem of nova class ships
it regulates hydropressure and temperature variance
beat remain here
the gas is highly corrosive to organic material
it would liquefy your flesh on contact
be my guest sir
data walks over to the spewing gas tank and without concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas
groping around for the broken conduit finally grabs hold of it
and with android strength bends the metal conduit back into the bulkhead
the gas stops leaking
data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas
to porter begin a diagnostic on the safety interlocks
there appears to have been some damage during the attack
porter moves around a corner behind some equipment out of datas vision
who opens a panel on the wall
but instead of the neat and orderly starfleet technology he is confronted by a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling diodes and what almost look like arteries
some of the tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy
what the hell
porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops
buried deep within the tangle of bio circuits is what looks like a human face covered with cybernetic tubes and chips
its barely discernable in the darkness and clutter
porter isnt even sure what hes looking at
he leans in for a closer look
and suddenly the eyes open
who hears a thump and a sickening liquid crunch from off camera
he takes a few steps in that direction
he stands there for a moment puzzled
then a faint skittering scrape can be heard like tiny claws on a metal surface
he whirls at the sound
are you all right
data walks around the now deathly quiet room
turns the corner to where porter was working
the open panel is still there and there doesnt appear to be any place porter couldve gone
data looks puzzled takes a step forward when his boots make a squishing sound
he looks down
taps combadge data to bridge
data to security
beat this is lieutenant data to anyone who can hear my signal
i need assistance in the environmental control room
data quickly turns and heads for the door
theres a metallic scrape above him and he looks up are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to pounce
one of them has porter and appears to be inserting some horrible borg device into his head
before data can react the second borg suddenly lunges at data
the silo is buried deep underground but on the surface there is a large poured concrete missile door
built to withstand a nuclear blast the door has nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the borg attack from orbit
there are large smoking craters all around
part of the ground seems to have collapsed to a depth of ten feet like a sinkhole nearby
picard and his team approach
this must be it
how serious is the damage
off tricorder im having trouble scanning underground
theres a lot of radiation leaking from something
probably from the nuclear warhead
cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive
as they speak beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives everyone injections
this will protect us from the radiation
geordi moves to the thick concrete missile door scans it
im picking up faint life signs twenty meters below
there should be an access hatch nearby
everyone spreads out
looking for the hatch
one of the guards lange finds it
everyone rushes over to him
theres a small hatch on the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and brush
geordi kneels down starts working a complex looking lock on the hatch
we need a password to get in
i have the password right here
picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back
he aims and fires at the hatch which is blown open revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness
as they start to crawl inside
this is the mission control for cochranes test site
the underground room is filled with st century equipment consoles and monitors
one entire wall of the room is dominated by a huge metal blast door which is now closed
we will learn that on the other side of that door is the nuclear missile warp ship itself
the ceiling has partially collapsed
chunks of concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the equipment
only a few of the consoles are active most are dark or fritzing sporadically
the lights are out and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires
four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room
its a scene of destruction
and his team enter the dark and smoking ruin
beverly and picard move to one of the dead men while geordi and the security guards move to the other three
beverly rolls the man onto his back hes clearly dead
the name stitched on his uniform says rippert
picard looks up
to others see if any of these men are cochrane
geordi and the guards start checking the dead bodies
this ones a woman
picard and beverly move toward the immense blast door
as beverly scans it picard glances at a nearby desk
is littered with debris and various documents and schematics
three photographs are pinned to a bulletin board above the desk they show zephram cochrane and two angles of his warp ship
the photos are odd looking printed on what appears to be some sort of cloth
theres a life sign behind this door
about ten meters below
geordi moves to the door
its designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched
there should be some kind of manual release
they hunt around for a moment
geordi runs his hand along the edge of the blast door
picard turns to the guards
to lange get those fires out and then try to restore main power to the control room
the guards move off
got it captain
geordi has found an emergency box with several pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled emergency use only
he pulls down the lever there is a hissing sound and the blast door slowly slides down into the floor
we can now see the missile silo itself beyond the door
picard geordi and beverly step into
picard geordi and beverly step onto the catwalk which surrounds the silo walls
in the middle is the warp ship itself
it should look like an advanced icbm missile with a cockpit in place of the warhead and with numerous modifications to the fuselage
the cockpit is on the same level as the control room
on the side of the missile is the name phoenix
the missile itself extends down another four stories
there are other catwalks below this one with ladders connecting the different levels
beverly sees something below
two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the grating
they all scramble down the ladders past the massive missile
note because of the design of the silo we will see the entire missile only in a few shots
for the most part our view is limited to sections of the missile
beverly reaches the man who is lying face down on the metal grating
she scans him
severe radiation exposure
geordi looks over at the section of the missile on their level
the side panels have been removed revealing complex circuitry within
picard joins beverly who turns over the injured man
its zephram cochrane the man whose picture we saw on the borg monitors
beverly begins pulling devices out of her medkit injects cochrane with a hypospray
cochrane is a man in his mid forties
he has a youthful dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation burns
ive stabilized him for now
but hes in a coma and hes going to need radiometric therapy
i want to take him to the ship
picard nods reaches into his pants pocket takes out a combadge
picard to enterprise
no response enterprise please respond
it could be the radiation captain
try from the surface
then takes a deep breath tries to orient himself to the task at hand
theres a lot at stake and a lot to do
he turns to geordi
mister la forge listen very carefully
if you remember your history
in less than twenty four hours a vulcan ship will be passing through this system
when it does this ship needs to be in space flying at warp speed
geordi takes a deep breath its a tall order
id better get started
geordi goes to work
picard bends down and carefully hoists cochrane up into a firemans carry
beverly follows him up the catwalk
cochrane is lying on the ground
beverly is kneeling beside him unfolding a portable stretcher from her medkit
picard is checking two combadges with a tricorder
its not the radiation
and theres nothing wrong with the combadges
the enterprise just isnt responding
jean luc this man needs medical attention now
as i recall the town of resurrection is about two kilometers east of here
they might have a hospital
picard looks troubled at the thought
what are we waiting for
it may not be that simple
this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
are you saying they wont help us
im saying they might shoot us on sight
you have to remember
these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them
there must be some good people
even in this time
lets hope so
because if cochrane dies
the future may die with him
picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put cochrane on the stretcher
riker troi and worf studying a monitor which shows a three dimensional diagram of the enterprise which turns and rotates as needed
the schematic shows battle damage and repair efforts
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems
so far theyve had no success
assign another team if you need to
i want to re establish communication with the captain as soon as possible
worf nods and begins making notes on a padd
are we in any danger of being detected by earth defense systems
there were no planetary defense systems in this era
their weapons were designed to fight each other
we have to start thinking about a way to get home
to troi analyze our readings from the temporal vortex
were going to have to recreate whatever the borg did to just then the ship shudders and the lights flicker
off console we just lost main power
and weve got class three alerts all over the ship
im not sure whats an alarm goes off on worfs console
he reacts to it
a ship wide decompression has been initiated
were venting our internal atmosphere directly into space
close on the saucer as vents and hatches pop open on the hull and giant jets of vapor start blowing out into space
crewmembers walking along are suddenly knocked to the floor as hurricane force winds blow through the corridor
the ship is venting air into space creating a virtual vacuum inside the ship
the people in the corridor grab onto the bulkheads struggling to hang on against the force of the wind
suddenly an emergency airlock on the bridge opens
violent wind roars through the bridge and everyone hangs on
troi is ripped out of her chair flown across the bridge slams up against the bulkhead struggling to hang on
worf runs over grabs her arm keeps her from flying out
riker manages to reach a control panel hits a button and an emergency bulkhead finally slides down over the airlock and the wind dies down
everyone takes a beat
what the hell is happening worf
off console it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room
realizing the borg
some of them mustve beamed over before we destroyed their ship
to worf seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields
data was down there
to worf mister worf
find data if you can but your top priority is isolating the borg
worf heads for a turbolift
off rikers disturbed expression
his eyes are closed
theres a beat then his eyes fly open and he looks around
we pull back slightly revealing data is lying on some kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints
he tenses his arm and tries to move but he is unable to break the restraints
about two feet in front of his face is what appears to be a bulkhead
there is a cacophony of strange background noise scratching hisses gurgling liquids odd alien hums
suddenly the table begins to move
it rotates and as it does so we realize that data has been hanging upside down staring at the floor
its a disorienting moment as our perspective changes and data rotates upright
as the table gyrates we reveal the room slowly
and we realize were in the environmental control room seen earlier has now been transformed into the inner sanctum of the borg
the room has a dark moist organic feel a tropical jungle of cybernetic equipment
the borg are altering the room converting starfleet technology and materials into the living bio mechanical look of the borg
we see one borg drone attach a small pod to a starfleet console and activate it
the pod immediately sends out a complex web of borg technology which covers the starfleet console inside and out
its like weeds overpowering a flower bed within seconds the console has been borgified
the walls ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with the alcoves that make up the borg collective
borg drones are motionless in their alcoves cabling and other conduits connecting them to various equipment
while other borg are moving about the room carrying out various modifications to the room
at one point we see ensign porter
hes been completely borgified
his skin pale expression blank
no hint of humanity left
still strapped to the table which is twisting and rotating giving him frightening new glimpses of the room
a new image appears six borg drones are clustered together in one section of the room each with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits connected to its face
through the tubes we can see an exchange of fluid and energy pulsing back and forth some sort of bizarre feeding or renewal is going on
the tubes all seem to lead toward the ceiling
data is now horizontal on his back and the table locks into position
a borg drone opens a panel on the side of datas head and begins connecting a thick bundle of optical cabling to it
to borg your efforts to assimilate me will be unsuccessful
the borg ignores him activates a console
and the cabling connected to datas head lights up with power
theyre trying to connect him to the collective
data thinks for a moment tilts his head slightly
and then suddenly theres a shower of sparks from the cabling hes been connected to
the lights on the cable go out
data has thwarted their attempts
to borg it would appear that resistance is not always futile
suddenly a new voice is heard echoing through the room a womans voice low seductive deadly brave words
ive heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds
since long before you were created
data looks up toward
a rustle of movemnet somewhere in the cyber tangle
almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds
and for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a face unlike any borg weve ever seen
the face of a woman
raven hair slicked back
a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish technology
and then its gone
he saw it too but hes not sure what to make of it
they are all one with the borg
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before
as an android i am in complete control of my neural net
the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed
you are an imperfect being
created by an imperfect being
finding your weakness is only a matter of time
suddenly three borg drones converge on data with various wicked looking borg devices
one of the borg has a specialized cybernetic arm which extrudes a series of stiletto tipped drill spikes
as the six inch spikes begin to bore into datas head
resurrection is a small town around people a rural western community thats probably existed for at least two hundred years and we can see the roots of the original ranching
community in some of the architecture
but its also a community of the st century
the most striking feature of the town is that it sits in the middle of nearly a hundred wind mills which provide the only source of power for the town
the blades are enormous but the structures supporting them are little more than simple poles
some are sleek fiberglass futuristic
others have a more cobbled together make shift appearance
at the moment only a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze
picard and beverly emerge from the nearby woods carrying the stretcher
they exchange a look at the sight of the city and then head toward it
a few minutes later
picard and beverly carrying cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the end
as they walk along we get our first taste of post apocalyptic st century life this is a recognizable american community but its definitely a futuristic town
clothing architecture technology all have changed over the course of seventy years
but it is a broken future
what used to be high tech public computer terminals are rusted and abandoned
we can see the corroded hulks of hover cars lying idle in the streets
futuristic elements now useless
at one point they pass a large polyurethane tent the inside surface is covered with condensation and we can see the silhouettes of people moving within
the entrance is guarded by a single militia guard
later we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse the only place where they can grow uncontaminated food
what used to be a mcdonalds or some other recognizable food chain has now been gutted and has been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop
people are fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and tongs
the sidewalks are populated with people who congregate in small groups quietly talking amongst themselves others just staring vacantly off into space
many of them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies victims of the war and post nuclear environmental dangers
a few of them are applying a special lotion to their arms and face protection against the toxic elements
a long food line snakes around a block as people line up to get their daily rations
a few people glance up at picard and beverly with curious or suspicious looks
this is not a community that welcomes strangers
at one point they see a man dressed in futuristic camouflage carrying an automatic weapon we will learn hes a militia soldier
he stares at them with a neutral expression then walks off
the people here have that hollow eyed listless look about them
theyre going through something that makes the great depression look like a minor inconvenience
but theres also a toughness to these people a resilience and determination to survive in the face of overwhelming odds
we are looking at our future
and its on the verge of collapse
a short time later
cochrane is being lifted onto an operating table
picard and beverly step back from the table as a doctor and two nurses look him over
the doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered tired look to him
the hospital itself is like the rest of the town a futuristic setting fallen on hard times
the light in the room is provided mostly from the sunlight streaming in through the windows
light bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital we get the feeling they have very little power
how long has he been unconscious
at least four hours
he checks cochrans head injury as beverly takes out her tricorder and scans him
it looks like he has a cranial fracture but ill need x rays to be sure
to nurse get ruby in here
one of the nurses runs off
off tricorder he has a severe fracture of the left occipital plate
hes not hemorrhaging
but the radiation has damaged his kna and his apr cell count
he looks at her curiously
apr cell count
what the hell are you talking about
quickly doctor crusher has been
studying some advanced medical theories
re tricorder what is that
new medical scanner
its a little more precise than an x ray machine
the doctor eyes it
is it japanese
beat now hes going to need a respirator
do you have one
we have two
but we dont have the juice to run them
there hasnt been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks
most of the batteries are depleted
dont you have any generators or other fuel sources
the doctor throws her an irritated look
maybe youd like to take your patient to the hospital in bozemen
its only two hundred miles away
cochrane wheezes breathing becoming labored and ragged
beverly scans him urgent
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating
weve got to get him on a respirator
to nurse bag him
the nurse picks up a portable respirator sack puts it on cochranes face and squeezes the bag forcing air into cochranes lungs
picard has been thinking through this scene finally has a solution
beverly your tricorder
she hands him her tricorder
to doctor wheres the battery room for the hospital
i told you theres no where
outside around back
next to the water tank
picard rushes out the doors
beverly checks cochranes pulse
his heartbeats irregular
beverly climbs up on top of cochrane straddling him begins giving him th century cpr
she takes charge
adrenaline ten ccs
as they rush to save him
the back of the building
picard rushes out and spots an old dilapidated battery unit providing power to the hospital
he quickly yanks off the back panel revealing a tangle of wires and several large batteries
he kneels down then removes the back of the tricorder
as picard pulls out a small power cell about half the size of a dime
the blinkies on the tricorder go out
holds the power cell with one hand and starts pulling out wires from the batteries with the other
beverly the doctor and the nurse trying to save cochrane
pumping his chest one
the nurse squeezes the bag
suddenly the room is filled with the hum of power and all of the lights and equipment come to life
monitors blinking fluorescent lights flashing on
everyone reacts with shock
its filled with patients
the lights and equipment here flash on as well
doctors and patients alike react with surprise
theyve placed a respirator down cochranes throat and attached electrodes to his chest
beverly has just finished giving him an injection with a hypospray
the heart monitor in the background is now beating regularly
the doctor turns to picard
what did you do to the batteries
just a little tinkering
how is he
with meaning but it would be better if we could contact
but until then youll have to make do with what youve got
thatll be interesting
what happened to him
revealing ruby sloane standing at the front of cochranes bed
a striking woman in her mid to late thirties dark hair tall lean beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment shes not at her best it looks like shes
just come in from a hard days work
shes wearing an old lab coat
but the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes
shes looking directly at picard for an answer
picard realizes he has to say something
he looks into her eyes and there is a moment here a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the captain just might follow up
but at the moment he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer
there was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo
she looks at him for a moment her eyes boring into him without expression as though probing the truthfulness of his statement
ruby were going to need a series of cranial x rays tonight
nods i have a fresh set of plates at home
ill have them here by eight
she turns back to cochrane moves to his side gently takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection
quiet take care of him
hes a very special man
yes he is
she looks up at picard and again theres a slight feeling of chemistry in the air
and then she turns and starts to walk out of the room
picards combadge beeps
la forge to picard
stopping i think theres someone in your pants
i have a
picard takes a few steps away pulls the combadge out of his pants pocket taps it
ruby watches him a beat then walks out of the room
captain we have a problem
i think youd better get back here
im on my way
picard moves to beverly
sotto i have to go back to the silo
will you be all right
ill be fine
re cochrane hes a different story
beverly begins examining the medical equipment shell have to work with as picard exits
a short time later
picard walking down the main street back toward the gates
people passing him taking no notice of him
picards mind thinking ahead
he happens to glance down a side street then he stops
looking down the side street
ruby the mysterious woman from the hospital is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder
she stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt out old hover car
stares at it
then pulls a home made futuristic camera out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car
she continues on her way
picard is intrigued wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of
just then catch
picard turns just in time to catch a small metal canister with a screw top
the man who threw it steps into view
its lieutenant scrimm
scrimm is the head of the towns militia
while not a physically threatening man there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility
hes wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm
before the war scrimm was probably one of the survivalists who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of armageddon came true
at the moment scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to picard
pleasant think youll need that
picard eyes the canister not sure what to make of it
its no zone solution
off his look you know
he points to the sky
lieutenant jonathan scrimm
im the head of the resurrection protective force
beat and you are
jean luc picard
you dont sound french
scrimm is still smiling at him but his eyes never leave picard
i was raised in england and here in the states
thank you for the
picard begins to walk away not wanting to engage any citizens of the town
scrimm falls in next to him
where in the states
here and there
you know how it is
i was born and raised right here
never had much use for travel
he casually steps in front of picard blocking his way
where are you from most recently
thinking fast california
used to be anyway
i didnt think anyone still lived there
theres a few of us left
picard steps around him and continues walking down the street
scrimm waits a beat then walks after him again
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospitals batteries
howd you do it
it wasnt a trick
i used to be an electrical engineer
he steps in front of picard again still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face
picard realizes he isnt going to shake this man so easily
and what were you doing out at the missile silo
im an old friend of cochranes
i wanted to see how he was doing
lucky for him you came by when you did
he might be dead now
maybe you can tell me what hes been doing in that silo
we heard some explosions out there this morning
i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine
and one of the fuel cells burst
scrimm eyes him evenly
you seem to have an answer for everything
something wrong with that
a tense beat
then scrimm smiles easily
re balm be sure you put that on
you need a lot of protection around here
he holds picards eyes for a moment
but ive never had much trouble protecting myself
now its picards turn to smile pleasantly at scrimm
picard walks around him and heads for the gates
scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression clearly hes more than a little suspicious
in orbit of earth
worf and a large security detachment a dozen or so men and women are moving down the corridor with grim looks on their faces
they are carrying new powerful looking phaser rifles and other equipment
the feeling is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous mission
they stop at one point and worf lifts up a deckplate exposing a large hatch in the floor
worf hits his combadge
worf to bridge
were in position
riker in command troi nearby
riker is standing at the security station looking at a monitor which displays a schematic graphic of the ship
the position of the security team is flashing we can see they are on deck
this is the bridge
im releasing the emergency force fields
he nods to troi who works a console
worf and his team watch as the forcefield protecting the hatch flashes off
worf reaches down and releases the hatch which slides open with a soft whoosh
he glances at his men for a moment then jumps down the hatch
as worf lands on his feet
the light is dim no power on this deck hard to see
he looks around warily for a moment phaser at the ready then activates his wrist beacon
we immediately notice that we can see worfs breath its freezing cold down here
he shines the light around the darkened corridor then silently motions his arm for the others to follow
a beat then we see the security officers start to drop into the corridor from the hatch above
as worfs squad spreads out along the hall weapons at the ready everyone alert with fingers on the triggers
we see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their own light sources intended to illuminate the target before you shoot at it
the security officers are constantly moving their lights back and forth through the chilly air
worf gives hand signals holds up two fingers then a fist and points forward
two guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet stop and take up firing positions
then two more members of the team run down leap frog ahead of them and take positions further down the corridor
classic military deployment
worf starts scanning with a tricorder
hits combadge worf to bridge
theres a dampening field in place on this deck
our tricorders are useless
the team continue to explore deck
its spooky eerie a sense of menace around every corner
they open doors check room by room section by section still no sign of the borg in the freezing cold darkness
the corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall ceiling and deck panels all the normal decorative enterprise sheathing is gone revealing the circuitry and machinery of the ship itself
unlike the rest of the corridors there does appear to be power flowing through some of the conduits up ahead and it gives off an eerie glow
we can also see that some of the machinery has been altered and changed not just the neat and orderly arrangement youd expect to find behind bulkheads theres a sense
of cross circuitry re wiring equipment being rearranged
clearly a lot of work has gone on in this area of the ship
worf steps forward examines the corridor closely
what the hell is going on
worf signals the team forward and they slowly begin picking their way down the borgified corridor
its not easy they have to choose their footing carefully as they walk through the maze of cables circuits and machinery
ensign hawk accidentally steps on some circuitry which gives off a beep
the entire team suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the unfortunate ensign who pales at their sudden attention
worf looks irritated then motions his team to continue their search
they continue making their way down the spooky corridor
and as they turn a corner
where the machinery is now thicker and more borg like in appearance
tubes and cabling hang down from the ceiling
if anything its even colder in here
the deeper they go the worse it gets
we can now hear a low sinister hum of alien power
at the end of this corridor is the enviromental control room as seen earlier
the entire doorway is gone and a weird pulsing glow fills the room
worf stops his team at the sight
from this vantage we cannot see directly into the room but clearly something is going on in there
worf signals his men to spread out and they take up positions around the corridor all weapons trained on environmental control
worf to bridge
were about to enter the environmental control room
any sign of data or the borg themselves
as work and riker continue talking we move to ensign hawk who is now the last man in the formation covering the rear
hes shining his phaser beacon into the empty darkness
he cant help looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant environmental control room that seems to be where the action is
as he turns his beacon moves with him throwing the corridor behind them in and out of darkness
however theyve reconfigured the odn network
and re routed all power on this deck into environmental control
as worf speaks ensign hawk turns back but this time when he shines his beacon into the darkness something moves in the distance a shadow
the ensign freezes brings his rifle up
but did he see it or was it his imagination
a tense beat as he waits heart pounding
but nothing happens
on the wall next to his head we see what can only be described as a bio mechanistic cable creeping out of the wall
which begins slowly heading for the ensigns neck
just as he begins to sense that something is happening behind him the cable whips out around his neck and yanks him deep into the bed of circuitry in the
blink of an eye the motion so fast we have trouble following it
worf turns his head at the sound
stand by commander to team wheres ensign hawk
everyone looks around surprised that hes not there
everyone is alert keyed up
the tension is thick
utter silence except for the hum of the machinery and the frosty breathing of the team
is something wrong
something is very wrong commander
were falling back
worf gives hand signals for the team to move out
but just as they start to fall back everything happens at once
explode out of the walls ceiling and floor
what follows is a blur of action happening so fast and furious we never get a true sense of whats happening
a flurry of violence and motion and images a snarling borg face half human half machine a cybernetic nightmare
strange bio mechanical weapons extruding from borg bodies ripping into human flesh
a crewmember pulled into a bed of machinery
fire at will
but the borg are already on top of them
its a brutal fight in close quarters with no escape
phasers and borg lasers lighting up the corridor bodies flying through the air
utter chaos and terror
the fight goes hand to hand and worf sees that they dont have a chance
throwing off a borg fall back
the team starts backpedaling firing as they go
but the borg are unstoppable now they put up personal force fields to protect themselves
go go go
worf pushes his men down the corridor
everyone turns and runs like hell
worf bends down and grabs a frightened lieutenant by the collar pulling him along
the team running through the corridors shooting behind them at the pursuing borg to no effect
two of the borg raise their arms and fire laser bursts out of their arms and wrists taking down two security guards
worf sees them fall but theres no time to go back
as worfs team starts climbing up and out the dark hatch in the floor seen earlier
as the last member of worfs team climbs out to safety
the borg swarm is about to overpower worf
he quickly hits a few controls on his phaser sets it to overload
we hear the building whine
he jumps straight up into the air grabbing onto the hatch rim pulling himself up
he barely manages to vanish from view just as the phaser explodes in a fiery blast taking out several of the borg drones
the conclusive blast comes up through the hatch causing worf to duck for a moment
worf reaches out to close the hatch when a borg hand bursts up from below and grabs his forearm
its a test of strength
worf reaches over with his other arm hits a control and the hatch slides closed severing the borg arm in a shower of sparks
worf to bridge force fields
the force field flashes into place
worf and his team sit there a moment catching their breath stunned at what theyve just been through
what the hell happened down there worf
we have a problem
off worfs shaken expression
geordi and picard are walking down the catwalk ladders toward the missiles massive engines
now that the smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a bit we get our first good look at the ship and the damage done in the
on the move cochrane was going to use this solid rocket booster to lift the ship into orbit
before the warp drive took over
everything would depend on these old chemical engines
beat now heres the problem
they arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see a large section of the engines have been blasted away leaving a deep ugly scar broken conduit lines
wires that now lead to nothing
its clear that a key piece of equipment has been destroyed
re damage this used to be the throttle valve assembly
observing it it controls the thrust of the engines
its been completely vaporized
and without it theres no way to launch the ship
can you reconstruct the throttle valve
if i knew what it looked like
theres probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours
beat there must be some design schematics
were tearing this place apart looking for them
but the computers are down and the fires destroyed half the files
so far nothing
they look at the damage in frustration
if it was just part of the warp drive id know what to do
its like trying to rebuild orville wrights airplane with canvass and sticks
picard thinks remembers something
wait a minute
picard and geordi are looking at the three cloth printed photographs seen earlier the headshot of cochrane and two different angles of the three cloth printed photographs seen earlier the
warp ship with people working on it
picard spreads them out on the desk
yeah i looked at these already
geordi points to a photo of the ship a worker is walking in front of the throttle assembly blocking most of it from view
you can almost see the throttle assembly in this one
but this guy walked in front of it when they took the picture
picard considers absently sticks his hand in his jacket pocket
he pulls out the canister of balm scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table
could you reconstruct the throttle from a photograph like this
if that man wasnt blocking the view
geordi thinks it over
as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration
but so far we havent found any other photos
staring at photos if there are other photographs
i think i may know how to find them
its a while later and the borg are making progress
data is strapped to the table panels open on his head and chest
three borg drones are working methodically on his inner circuitry
the jagged voice of the woman cuts in your resistance is
to us your neural net is simply another piece of technology
we will learn its secrets
data stares at the murky ceiling
who are you
i am the borg
that is a contradiction
the borg act as a collective consciousness
there are no individuals
i am the beginning
i am the one who is many
i am the borg
out of the mist that hugs the top of the room descends the borg queen
she is unlike any of the borg drones weve ever seen a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out of her body
she has no legs
her torso is suspended by a complex rig of cables and hydraulics
her face and upper torso are much more humanoid with the pasty pale white of borg flesh
her eyes have a silvery glint to them
her demeanor is seductive and sensual in contrast to the harsh mechanical surroundings
she is an eerie blend of two worlds organic and mechanical
with the soft hiss of hydraulics she lowers herself down to where her face is very close to that of datas
her features are almost angelic but the silvery glint in her eyes betrays an inner darkness
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg
i bring order to chaos
she studies his face with a certain child like quality
its unfortunate we will have to destroy you to obtain the information we need
you are a
and yet far more than a simple automaton
you have no idea how close to perfection you are
she stares at him intently and we get the hint that her interest in data may go beyond simple assimilation
she seems fascinated by him
data picks up on this
how do you define perfection
the queen opens her arms slightly clearly indicating herself
a blending of the organic and the synthetic
the highest form of life in the galaxy
data eyes her considering
an interesting definition
but it is not one that applies to me
i am completely artificial
i have no organic components
she looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
she mightve just found the chink in datas armor
have you ever wondered what its like to have flesh
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference
the queen looks to the three borg drones and gives them a silent command
the drones immediately stop working on datas open panels
and shift their attention to his right arm
one of the drones tears off the sleeve on datas uniform exposing his bare arm
another then uses a small cutting device to slice off the synthetic skin from datas arm
as data prepares himself for the worst
three armored security guards with phaser rifles run into view hit a control panel on the wall
a giant emergency bulkhead comes slamming down cutting off the rest of the corridor
the security guards turn to run down the hall but then there is a high pitched shriek of wrenching metal
they drop to the deck and take combat stances
set phasers to rotating modulation
they make adjustments to their weapons just as the bulkhead doors explode inward in a blinding flash
the guards shield themselves against the fire and debris
looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal shapes of the borg jumping through the smashed bulkhead racing down the corridor toward them
the guards fire and when they do the phaser blasts alternate color red blue green purple orange a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency
the phaser blasts take down a few of the borg
but then we see the distinctive personal forcefields of the other borg begin to compensate and the phasers no longer affect them
thats it theyve adjusted fall back
they turn to run but borg phaser fire lances out from the borg soldiers and rips them apart
the mood is tense grim
riker worf and troi are gathered around a schematic of the enterprise
the lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by the color red representing the borg advance through the ship
a they watch another section of compartments and corridors suddenly turn red
riker lets out a wary breath starts pointing to various points along the schematic
weve lost control of eight decks
three cargo bays
do we have any idea how many borg were dealing with
we saw at least thirty
and there are twenty two enterprise crewmembers reported missing
including commander data
well have to assume theyve been assimilated into the collective
datas positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise
command codes security protocols
if they control data they control the ship
a grim beat
we cant worry about that right now
lets concentrate on what we can
they stare at the schematic
to control the enterprise theyll have to gain access to one of two locations
or the bridge
we have to cover both possibilities
to troi well take care of the bridge
worf take your men and seal off main engineering
turn it into a fortress nothing gets in
worf nods and exits
as riker and troi exchange a tense look
the hospital is completely lit up the only building in town with this much power
picard walks down the hall stops outside a door marked x ray processing
the red light is on above the door but that means nothing to picard
who opens the door and steps inside
much like a traditional darkroom trays of chemicals and washes etc
but everything has a slightly futuristic and cobbled together feel
they are developing x rays by hand instead of by machine
the room is lit with an amber glow
as soon as picard opens the door we hear rubys voice shut that door
picard quickly shuts the door behind him looks around the room
ruby whos working at a tray of chemicals turns around in fury
what are you an idiot
didnt you see the red light was on
but i didnt realize that thank god this plate was already fixed
she pulls down a small pane of glass probably from a window out of a tub of water
holds it up to the light
and there on the glass is a x ray of a mans skull
picard moves to her
re x ray cochrane
and i only had enough silver halide for one shot
so youre lucky you didnt screw it up
im very sorry
she glances at him sees he feels genuinely bad
she softens a little
dont worry about it
she picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to dry off the pane of glass
did you need something
i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo
there were three of them
printed on some kind of fabric
off his look i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints
not the best material but i havent seen a clean piece of paper in five years
did you take any other pictures of the rocket
the x ray is now dry and ruby turns and looks at him
jokingly why did you want to buy them
picard doesnt realize she was kidding jumps on the opportunity to get the photos
i dont have any money right now but i may be able to get some
ruby looks at him for a moment is he serious
she gives him a curious smile
so you can get dome money
i can try
youd have to try real hard
no ones used currency in over ten years
what are you from another planet
picard hesitates smiles at her tries to laugh it off
but sometimes i feel that way
beat what i meant was id be willing to trade for the photographs
for a straight answer
beat who are you
and how do you know zephram
im an old friend
i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in cuts him off fraid not
ruby walks past him with the x ray
picard follows ruby out into the corridor
she has a satisfied smile on her face its not easy to put one over on this woman
and the truth is shes enjoying picards frustration
as they walk along
casual youre lying
what makes you say that
youre not someone who lies very easily
so its obvious when you do
at least to me
are you always sucha good judge of character
she stops turns looks at him
ruby turns and walks off
picard follows her doggedly determined to get those photos
beverly is holding the x ray glass ruby made up to the light as the doctor seen earlier looks on
the occipital fracture is widening
were going to have to fuse the bones
im a little worried about some of these bone fragments
if they move any closer to the brain we could be looking at a hemorrhage
as beverly and the doctor examine the x ray we move to ruby whos looking down at cochrane
hes still in bed and on a respirator
she smoothes his hair with affection
picard stands on the other side of the bed watching her
were the two of you
not like you and doctor crusher used to be
surprised how did you know about that
ruby looks at him with a smile
her smile widens and then she leaves the bed to join the doctor and beverly
picard shakes his head and smiles after her chagrinned and amused at the same time
to doctor we cant take any more x rays until i can mix up a new batch of the silver halide
can you do it tonight
we may have to operate
itll be ready by morning
ruby turns and heads for the door
picard moves after her
i need to talk to you about those photographs
its very important
im sure it is
but itll have to wait until tomorrow
it cant wait until tomorrow
beat besides itll give you all night to think up a new set of lies
she flashes him that smile again then darts out the door
picard is left frustrated he knows that he cant let it go at that
worf and a team of ten security guards are preparing for battle
theyre setting up large heavy duty phaser equivalents of machine guns big mean looking weapons on tripods
there are two of these weapons aimed at each entrance to engineering
the security officers are strapping on body armor checking weapons building makeshift barricades over each of the doors
worf is in command directing the action
to team double check each assault phaser
make certain that the range setting is no more than thirty meters
we dont want to blast through the hull
worf turns and picks up his batleth sword off a nearby console
he checks the sharpness of the blade
are you sure you dont want something a little more
mind your post lieutenant
the lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and moves off
worf makes a quick practiced motion with the sword
decides hes ready
riker and troi watching the schematic
riker works a control and the display zooms in to display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting engineering and the surrounding deck
a swarm of dots representing the borg is advancing on engineering
to com riker to engineering
the borg are approaching your position
riker and troi watch as the dots move closer
right up to the perimeter of engineering
the dots begin surrounding engineering which looks like its being swarmed over by a sea of ants
the security guards have taken positions around the room all weapons trained on the doors
worf is standing in front of the warp core batleth in hand
calls out charge weapons
a massive hum of power fills the room as all of the phaser weapons begin charging
its tense everyone standing ready with their weapons charging
this is the moment of truth
worf stands ready phaser in one hand batleth in the other
this is worf at his purest the warrior ready for battle
riker and troi as before watching the schematic of the ship
the dots representing borg have now completely surrounded engineering on all sides including the deck directly above and below
in essence the borg have cocooned engineering from the rest of the ship
worf and the security team in their positions tense
a few beats of silence
then they start to hear soft scratching coming from somewhere behind the walls it sounds like rats skittering through the walls and ceiling of an old house
everyone stays alert checks and re checks their weapons
a couple of hard swallows
then from somewhere up above a loud metallic clang
then a large scraping sound that seems to start at one end of the room and travel to the other
theres an overpowering sense of creatures just outside those walls moving about
its unnerving even for crack starfleet troops
riker and troi watching the display
the borg dots teeming around engineering like ants on a candy bar
the clawing skittering clanging noises increase and get louder
we expect to see the borg bursting into the room at any moment
worf tightens his grip on his batleth teeth bared
unbearable tension and then
the noises begin to fade away
eventually disappearing all together
if anything the silence is even scarier
worfs eyes narrow
he looks around the room all his senses alert waiting for the slightest sign of the borg
but nothing happens
riker and troi react to the diagram as the borg dots begin moving away from engineering
it looks like the swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the ground moving toward the forward part of the ship
theyre bypassing engineering
where the hell are they going
off the mystery
close on datas face
his eyes are closed he is in the android equivalent of sleep
camera rotating and pushing in on his face as we hear the overlapping sounds of voices from datas past picard riker troi the enterprise crew aliens hes met datas own
bits and pieces of his life
the theme of the sound bites should be datas quest for humanity picard giving him advice troi counseling him soong talking to his son etc
the last line of dialogue we hear is data saying i want to be more human
datas eyes fly open now awake
we pull back revealing that data is still strapped to the borg operating table
his right arm and shoulder are encased in some kind of strange cybernetic shell obscured from view
clear tubes run out of the shell into borg machinery liquid is coursing through the tubes
a couple of borg drones are moving about the room carrying out various tasks
theres been a change since weve been here last
there are now several plexiglass cylinders surrounding datas table each of them filled with some kind of murky red fluid which is swirling around
every once in awhile something that looks like raw flesh bumps up against the clear plexiglass then disappears again
we dont know what these tubes are for but theyre definitely creepy
data takes all this in but there is nothing he can do hes still immobilized
suddenly the table rotates and begins to move up toward the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling
it stops a few feet away
and data finds himself face to face with the borg queen again
youve taken your first step toward perfection
how does it feel
i do not know what you are referring to
thats because you havent been properly
a whoosh of hydraulic power signals another movement by the borg queen
she slithers through the air and down slightly so that she is on the same level as data
she looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing datas right arm which opens at her silent command and moves away
we can now see that all of the skin has been removed from datas right arm showing the inner workings of his android limb circuitry and servos etc
but on the top of the mechanical forearm there is something new a small patch of human flesh held in place with various nasty looking hooks and clamps and small
tubes carrying blood
its a delicate fragile piece of organic life on an ugly mechanical surface
data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little puzzlement
re flesh do you know what this is data
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo skeletal structure
what a cold description
for such a beautiful gift
she smiles slightly utterly confident
she leans her face in close to datas still immobilized right arm
we are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see the individual hairs
the borg queens lips move into frame and she exhales a long and sensuous breath
we see goose bumps form on the skin and the hairs stand straight up in response
as datas eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in surprise this is a sensation hes never felt before
the borg queen sees the look on his face and smiles
was that good for you
data can barely describe the sensation
but clearly it was pleasurable
he looks at her
do it again
as she smiles
a tiny single story house one or two rooms at the most in serious need of repair and maintenance
the house sits on dirt
the nearest other structure is at least a hundred yards away
a very solitary place
the windows are dark painted over from the inside
some large pieces of exotic looking equipment are sitting off the front porch
after a beat the front door opens letting out a soft feeble light
ruby steps out onto the porch carrying a gallon size plastic jug
the light from the house now lights the equipment a little giving us a better view
theres a contraption that appears to be a pump of some kind with a funnel on top spigot at the bottom and several stages of filters and tubing in between
ruby sets the jug underneath the spigot
then sits down for a moment on the edge of the porch
she takes a breath and runs a hand through her hair stretches her back trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck
an exhausting day
is watching her intently from afar
hes concealed behind a supporting beam of one the towns many windmills
hes in shadow hidden from rubys view
pulls off her jacket
shes wearing a pull over shirt
and in one motion she pulls off the shirt revealing only a tee shirt underneath sleeves torn off long ago
she stands up
kicks off her boots
undoes her pants
and begins sliding the jeans off her hips
glances around a little awkward
this really isnt why he came out here
kicks aside the jeans
shes now down to tee shirt and panties
she grabs the bottom of the tee shirt
pulls it off
doesnt want to look but cant help himself
moves to the side of the porch
and steps into a large enviromental suit a bulky one piece with gloves and helmet attached
is a little relieved
has now encased herself in the thick rubbery suit
pulls over a helmet with a gas mask
she walks over to an oil drum marked with a distinctive bio hazard symbol
she carefully opens the lid
takes a metal pitcher
reaches down into the drum and scoops out a pitcher full of toxic waste
she closes the lid walks over to the pump filter contraption
she pours the sludge like waste into the funnel
primes the pump
makes a few adjustments to the filters
and then turns the spigot
after a beat a trickle of clear liquid starts to come out of the spigot
ruby steps back and pulls off the helmet
watches curious about what shes doing
is now out of the bio suit again
pulling on her shirt and jeans
grabs her jacket
turns off the lights in the house and shuts the front door behind her
she begins walking toward the windmill
steps behind the girder stays very still in the shadows
waits quietly as ruby passes by the windmill without a glance and heads into town
after shes gone picard steps out from his hiding place watches her go then quickly heads for rubys house
picard opens the front door and goes inside
but he doesnt notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small red light starts flashing some sort of silent alarm
picard enters and closes the door behind him
he fumbles around for a light switch
finally locates one
and a soft golden glow fills the room
the house has only one room which functions as a living room kitchen bedroom etc
this is also rubys darkroom
the windows have been painted black and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo equipment all around
but the most striking feature of the house are the large hanging cloth printed photographs
they vary in size and shape
some are hanging on walls others hang from the ceiling in mid air still others are stacked on the few pieces of furniture thats here
the absence of paper has forced ruby to print photos on anything she can find bed sheets shirts pieces of upholstery backs of carpeting etc
picard stands there for a moment taking in the scene hes never been in anyplace quite like this
the cloth photos give the room a feeling of a small intensely personal gallery
picard moves around the room looking from photo to photo
hunting for the elusive shots of the missile silo
and as he does we get our first close look at rubys images and they tell us a great deal about her
she has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the mundane and the ugly
there are pictures of hope amidst despair
beauty amongst devastation
there seems to be a theme running through the photographs a romantic almost idealistic sense of optimism
at one point picard finds a photograph he recognizes
its the rusted out hover car she photographed on the streets of resurrection
its an ugly decrepit piece of junk
but there in the center spot lighted by a single ray of sunshine
is a tiny flower about to bloom
picard takes in the image for a brief moment
then pushes onward
goes to a file of photos sitting in a box
begins sorting through them quickly
we see pre war photos printed on real paper
they show a younger ruby with her parents
resurrection the way it used to look
ruby with a dog
picard pauses frowns
gets the odd feeling that someone is watching him
he turns around to see
a three foot photograph of picard is drying in the air behind him
ruby mustve taken the photo when picard was on the street talking to scrimm
it was taken through a telephoto lens a close up of picards face he looks focused determined heroic
its a remarkable shot of the captain and even picard is a little taken aback by the image
shes captured the essence of the man
the sound of a shotgun being cocked
slowly turns around to see whos there
is standing in the open doorway a shotgun leveled at picard
you should pay closer attention to those little red lights
picard glances down at the doorway sees the flashing red light in the doorjamb
you know id be perfectly justified in shooting you right now
picard glances at the photograph of himself
id say you already have
dont flatter yourself
i take pictures of a lot of junk
she perches herself on the arm of a small couch holds the gun loosely but never taking the aim away from picard
okay lets hear it
im sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house
were trying to repair doctor cochranes ship
its been damaged and we
and a few other friends of zephrams
friends from cornell
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed
and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like
considers all right
i believe that one
why is it so urgent you couldnt wait until morning
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon
picard has to come up with something decides to throw her off with a high tech explanation
or the shielding around the plutonium core will begin to deteriorate
within a day the entire silo will become so radioactive that no one will be able to come near it for a hundred years
ruby eyes him evenly
one more and i pull the trigger
picard is starting to get angry
why are you being so difficult
all im asking for is to look at one of the photographs
itll take five minutes
and all im asking for is the truth
that would take five minutes
beat for all i know you caused the explosions at the silo
and now youre trying to steal zephrams ship
i am not a thief
rubys had enough her temper flares and she gets off the couch takes a threatening step toward picard
no youre a petty burglar and a liar
beat youre no friend of zephrams
he is a great man
hes not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town
picard jumps in with a quiet forceful quality no
hes a man with vision
he can see beyond the problems that surround us
he knows theres a better future out there for everyone
a future where crime poverty and war are things of the past
a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars
beat i believe in that future too ruby
i believe in it in every fiber of my being
and im telling you
if we dont launch that warp ship tomorrow theres a very good chance that future will never happen
she eyes him for a moment and were not sure if his words have had any effect
ruby still has her doubts but decides to go with her gut
and finally hands him the photographs
picard glances through them his expression tells us the photo he needs is in there
you wont regret this
they share a look
and then picard turns and walks off into the night
ruby watches him go
and we can see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions
something about that man has touched her
a telescopic green and white image of picard walking away from rubys home
is watching picard through a set of night vision binoculars perched on the roof of a nearby building
he frowns wondering what picard is up to
the giant deflector array at the front of the ship a giant round bowl shaped array used for communications and shielding
as we watch four hatches open surrounding the dish and borg start to emerge from the interior of the ship and crawl out on the hull
the borg do not need pressure suits or breathing equipment they crawl around the hull with ease and onto the deflector dish
where riker troi worf and n
s are watching this image on the viewscreen
what are they doing
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish
to do what
if they wanted a weapon they couldve taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay
why the deflector dish
it doesnt make sense
the deflector is only used for shielding and long range sensors
riker stares at the screen
computer magnify grid twenty one alpha
the image on the viewscreen zooms in to a specific point on the deflector dish giving us a clear view of two borg who have opened a gigantic panel on
they appear top be modifying power conduits in some fashion
theyre re routing the deflector power conduits
computer thermal enhancement
the image now is overlaid with an infrared view of what theyre doing
the power conduits are glowing bright red very hot we can see the heat signature travel back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew shaped coil which is pulsing
theyre connecting the conduits to subspace communications
realizing theyre converting the deflector dish into an antennae
they may be trying to send a message to the other borg
the borg in this time period
what kind of message
thinking if it was me
id say attack earth now
in the st century
theyll be too strong in the th
they think about this for a moment as they watch the borg swarming on the deflector array
we have to stop them from sending that message
destroy the deflector dish
can we aim our dorsal phasers at it
riker shakes his head
weve lost control of all weapons systems
transporters are down
we cant get to a shuttlecraft
and it would take us too long to fight our way down to deflector control
there is another way commander
do you remember your zero g combat training
riker looks a little wary at the suggestion
i remember it made me sick
to worf what are you suggesting
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll
off their expressions
another one of rubys cloth printed photos this one a clear view of the base of the missile engines cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle
above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle valve assembly
im almost afraid to say this captain
but i think its going to work
move to reveal were in the cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk
geordi and picard are watching a couple of n
s attach the newly built throttle assembly to the side of the ship
s are using high tech welding tools and sparks are flying
as they talk they head back up the catwalk toward the control room
wheres you get the alloy for the throttle itself
they used copper pipes in their plumbing
so i melted it down
and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings
beat its not the strongest alloy
but its better than all this crude aluminum and steel
as geordi and picard enter
lange is checking out a launch console
the room is now humming with power its beginning to look like the place is up and running
picard stops near the desk
mister lange have you brought the computer systems back on line yet
this trinary language is pretty archaic
but i think i understand it now
as they speak camera moves in on the metal canister of lotion picard set on the desk earlier
scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a cluster of military surveillance gear listening to picard and geordis conversation
far in the distance we can see the missile silo
are we on schedule
the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours
itll be tight but we should make it
what about our warp signature
it has to be strong enough for them to detect
ive enhanced the plasma injectors dont worry theyll see it
well with any luck
the vulcans will land outside resurrection tomorrow morning
and earth will never be the same again
scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm it sounds like picard is planning an invasion
id better start familiarizing myself with the flight controls
a console buzzes
lange moves to it and activates a small color video monitor
it shows an external view of the missile silo just outside the hatch
beverly can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious zephram cochrane
doctor crushers at the access hatch captain
let her in
lange hits a couple of buttons
a short time later
his head is bandaged and hes conscious but frankly he looks like hell
he sits back looking a little overwhelmed
let me get this straight
youre from the future
im about to change history
and all i have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship
picard geordi and beverly are standing around cochrane who is sitting in a high backed chair in a corner of the control room
he studies their faces sees theyre serious
he smiles a little ruefully
and people say im crazy
i assure you doctor that after today
no one will ever call you that again
cochrane considers them
finally nods what the hell
just do me a favor
bring my ship back in one piece
thats a promise
picard turns and walks off with beverly
geordi moves to cochrane with a little bit of awe
my name is geordi la forge
im an engineer
can i shake your hand
cochrane is touched by geordis obvious respect
they shake hands
i wish i could go with you
is there anything i can do to help
but i do have about a thousand questions ive always wanted to ask you
since time is short
why dont you pick the top ten and fire away
have moved to another part of the room
beverly looks exhausted
she sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair
surprised you actually performed surgery
it was an experience
needle and thread
she looks up with a smile pulls a small device out of the medkit a surgical transporter
re device but i had a little help
i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain
how did doctor almack react to that
he was so confused by what i was doing i dont think he even noticed
beat any word from the enterprise
you think theyre still up there
wry if theyre not
wed better get used to living in montana
light that might not be so bad
at least for you
shes kidding but picard is a little defensive
whats that supposed to mean
there is no animosity or hint of jealousy in beverlys attitude shes simply making an observation about someone she cares about
i saw the way you looker at her
and i know that look
picard doesnt want to argue about this to him its a pointless conversation
regardless of how i may feel about ruby
our fates lie along different paths
nothing can change that
you want some advice
dont do this again
off his look you know exactly what i mean
beverly there were many reasons why you and i
id call them excuses
and the first excuse on both our lists was our sense of duty
we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else
and you know what
she holds his look for a moment
neutral i have a ship to launch
picard turns and leaves
beverly watches him go
wondering whether her words had any affect
ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter pump
the plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid silver halide
she caps the jug picks it up begins walking up on the porch
then hesitates for a moment
looks out over the horizon
then frowns and goes inside
ruby comes inside sets down the jug
begins to pick up some more glass plates
only a few feet away is the large picture of picard
she doesnt want to look at him doesnt want to think about him
but there he is
she glances back at the open door
struggles for a moment
then makes a decision
despite herself she cant get picard out of her head
with a little frustration she grabs her camera bag and heads for the door
in earth orbit
angle on ceiling as the borg queen descends from her nesting place down towards the camera
ultimately stopping just a few feet away
she speaks directly to the camera
how do you feel
his right hand is made of flesh it has color fingernails hair sweat
its completely human in every way
his fingers move slightly and then the hand begins to rise
we follow his hand as it comes up and touches his face which is also flesh
the gold color is gone his hair is tousled and natural looking
even his eyes are real now blue
he touches his face tentatively his expression confused
the borg queen descends closer
datas arms are now free but he is still restrained on the table
the rest of his body is still android mechanical
data touches his two hands together feeling the sensations flesh against machine
he touches his face and lips discovering himself in a totally new way
my internal sensors tell me the ambient temperature in the room is ten point two degrees celsius
wondrous but my skin tells me it is cold
as he talks we can see that hes becoming seduced by his own newfound senses
my visual acuity has been reduced by seventy eight percent
and i can no longer perceive light beyond the ultraviolet or the infrared
beat but i can see its an amazing moment data riding a wave of feeling and emotion like hes never had before
the borg queen watches pleased
she hovers close to him
your emotions were trapped inside an artificial shell
you didnt know what it was to truly feel beat and theres so much more for you to experience
i will guide you into a world of sensation unlike anything you can imagine
beat all you have to do
is give us access to your neural net
data looks at her suddenly shocked back into reality
i will not betray my friends
theyre not your friends
theyve held you back
kept you from your destiny
that is not true
they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you
did they even try
do not want this
but his words have a certain hollow quality to them
he is no longer as convinced as he was before and the borg queen notes this immediately
she reaches out with a hand and gently strokes datas cheek
youre becoming more human all the time data
now youre learning how to lie
i wish to
go back to the way i was
she slaps him hard across the face
data feels the pain the shock
a small trickle of blood comes from his mouth
he looks at her in surprise but before he can say anything she moves forward and kisses him on the mouth deeply and intensely
its a disturbing and erotic moment
she pulls back
data reels trying to sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain
her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer to him face to face
have you ever know a woman
do you know what its like to feel her breath on your face
her skin against yours
flesh against flesh
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things
im your creator now
she rubs her body against his cat like
then pulls him to her and kisses him deeply
off the image of their bizarre embrace
riker worf and three security n
s are pulling on spacesuits
the suits are form fitting sleek no bulky oxygen tanks
the helmets are the same they conform to the contours of the skull and face
to riker you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo
and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation
beat theres only one torpedo left
i guess id better get it right the first time
to all the borg will undoubtedly attack
set phasers to rotating modulation
the security officers check their phasers and wait as riker and worf finish putting on their suits
riker straps a tool case to his suit
riker goes to a wall panel and activates the control
the airlock door seen earlier opens
riker turns back to troi
then he worf and the guards enter the airlock and troi close the door behind them
a tiny room separating the bridge from the outer hull
worf hits a control and the room depressurizes with a to others activate magnetic constrictors
they all activate controls on their wrists and there is a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized
riker hits another control and the outer airlock door slides open revealing the vast vacuum of space
they begin to walk out of the airlock
as riker and his team come out of the airlock on the top of the saucer section
its a spectacular sight as the small group of figures with weapons at the ready marches toward the leading edge of the saucer
the scene is lit by light reflected by the earth which hangs above the ship
as they approach the edge
worf gives a hand signal and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical deployment and drops down onto their bellies
they crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause
worf looks at riker who looks a little queasy
to riker are you alright
just a little queasy
try not to look at the stars
keep your eyes on the ship
and commander whatever you do
do not vomit in your exo suit
it would be
ill keep that in mind
riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself
to all over and under
they all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the underside of the saucer
the camera rotates and spins with them as they traverse to the underside of the hull theyre upside down relative to their previous position but theres no up or down
in space and their magnetized suits hold them to the hull
its a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to their new position
from this angle the enterprise appears to be upside down
once theyre on the underside of the saucer they can see the rest of the ship laid out above them
the deflector dish which is now above us is covered with dozens of borg drones who are working to modify it
some of them turn and see us
begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer
running is difficult they must keep one foot on the hull at all times
several borg phaser shots whip past them as the borg open fire
a dozen of them leave the work on the dish and begin skittering down which is normally up the interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes like a swarm
of ants a frightening sight
is hit by a phaser shot and goes flying off into space
riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube bends down and opens the hatch
borg phaser shots hitting all around him
the open hatch cover provides some protection from the borg fire
im going to need at least five minutes
worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin exchanging fire with the approaching mass of borg
they pick off a few borg who also go flying into space
as riker begins to work
quick cuts picard and geordi strapping themselves into the phoenix cockpit
in the control room the starfleet n
s put on st century headsets to communicate with the phoenix cockpit
cochrane sitting in his chair holding his head but rapt with attention
beverly checking him with her which is sitting open on a console nearby the blast door begins closing
geordis hands flipping switches working the controls
initiate pre ignition sequence
the phoenix engines at the base of the ship begin spewing nitrogen gas
the security n
s moving about the control room which is now humming with power
the huge steel blast door separating the control room from the silo has been closed
pre ignition sequence complete
going to internal power
off console acknowledged phoenix
youre on internal power and ready for lift off
final launch sequence checks
ready to begin final countdown
begin five minute countdown on your mark
picard geordi making final adjustments to the control panels
both are wearing st century communications headsets
picard exchanges a look with geordi
ready to make a little history
phoenix to control
hits a control initiating five minute countdown
a few monitors in the cockpit indicate that the countdown is underway
lange and the other n
s watching the countdown
suddenly a console buzzes
lange goes to the monitor seen earlier hits a switch the monitor comes alive shows that ruby is now standing outside at the hatch
lange reacts in surprise
picard and geordi working the controls watching the readings etc
we hear langes com voice phoenix we have a problem out here
theres a woman at the outer hatch
says her names ruby sloan and she wants to see the captain
picard and geordi react her timing is pretty bad
what do you want me to do sir
we cant let her in
shell see cochrane isnt making the flight
we cant leave her out there
when the ship launches
shell be killed
tell her to go back to resurrection
shes a very
to com phoenix to control
let her in
ruby standing by the hatch trying to look calm
scrimm and three militia soldiers holding her at gunpoint
the hatch hisses and pops open
scrimm shoves a gun into rubys side get going
as they start to crawl inside
lange and the other n
s have focused their attention on the countdown
ruby climbs down the ladder a tense look on her face
sloane if youll have a seat ill let you talk to suddenly the three heavily armed militia soldiers jump down the ladder from the hatch
one of the starfleet n
s goes for a phaser and a soldier blasts him backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic weapon
everyone else freezes
a tense beat then scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the room
riker in the torpedo tube frantically working
he begins to physically move the torpedo tube itself like hes moving the barrel of a huge cannon
as he struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish
are about fifty feet away from riker
from their prone positions they try to keep the borg at bay blasting them off the hull one by one
they have taken cover behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of the ship
the borg have to cross an open field of metal to get to them making then easy targets
suddenly the borg change tactics
from the deflector dish high above them borg begin launching themselves directly at the starfleet officers jumping off the dish and flying through the vacuum of space like paratroopers
this tips the balance
there are too many targets to defend from above and below
one of the flying borg crashes into a security guard and a vicious hand to hand fight erupts
the borg slashes the guards pressure suit which depressurizes killing the man instantly
worf fires a phaser blast into the borg knocking him off the hull and into space
worf turns to riker
commander youre five minutes are up
swings the torpedo tube into place aiming it at the deflector dish
he hits a control on the side of the tube
and a quantum torpedo automatically slides up from below and locks into position in the tube like a panel on the torpedo and begins working on the circuitry
troi in command watching the viewscreen which shows a different angle of the battle on the hull
the borg are charging the subspace emitters
how long until they can send a message
about seven or eight minutes
computer this is commander deanna troi
initiate self destruct in six minutes thirty seconds
authorization troi gamma six five
self destruct in six minutes twenty five seconds
monitors all around the bridge show the countdown
which says self destruct in
the sergeant is examining one of the monitors
the display says lift off t minus seconds
no good sir
theyre on internal power
we cant stop the launch from here
re blast doors what about these doors
theyre locked down tight from the inside
and those doors were made to withstand a nuclear attack
scrimm looks frustrated for a moment
then turns his attention to ruby
one minute to launch
this is lieutenant scrimm
im going to have to insist that you shut down the launch
you see i know what youre doing
and im not going to just stand by and let it happen
beat stop the launch or ill kill every one of your people out here
and i think you know wholl be first
as picard reacts in shock
scrimm is now holding ruby by the arm
he shoves the com headset to her mouth
ruby is scared but trying to keep it together
to com jean luc
remember that future we talked about
its all that matters
beat launch the ship picard reacts to her voice but keeps working the controls trying to concentrate
scrimm draws his gun
go ahead launch it
ruby will be here when you get back
but she wont have a whole lot to say
geordi and picard exchange a tense look
its a difficult moment what does he do
the countdown clock is approaching seconds
everything hangs in the balance rubys life the future of the earth picards feelings his duty
finally picard reaches out hits a control the countdown clock stops at seconds
captain to com this is picard
ive suspended the launch sequence
now why dont you join us and well have a little talk
picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset
weve got less than ten minutes before that vulcan ship leaves the system
weve got to go now itll have to wait
geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself
picard and geordi stop outside the massive blast doors which are separating them from the control room
geordi can you see into the room
geordi looks at the blast doors
and he does so the electronic pupils in his eyes rotate change shape and color
a high tech infrared view of the door but we cant see through it its opaque
the doors too thick
frustrated then well just have to assume its still there
whats still there
get a tricorder
youre going to have to track my exact position in that room
geordi moves off
clearly picard has a plan
riker finishes working on the torpedo
he closes the panel
turns and reaches for the fire control mechanism
she glances up theres a borg flying through space directly at him
riker tries to bring up his phaser but its too late
the borg slams into him
riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself trying to hold on but the momentum of the borg impact is too great they both tumble off into space
together away from the ship
a shocked troi watches riker and the borg tumbling away into space on the viewscreen
they are engaged in a zero gee hand to hand fight an incredible sight
self destruct in three minutes
scrimm still has the gun on ruby
the blast door is just being lowered revealing picard
geordi has returned to the phoenix cockpit
a console separates picard and scrimm
what do you want
the invasion plans
these people youre calling vulcans
who are they
where do they come from
how many troops
what kind of weapons
geordi is working a tricorder furiously
were not sure what hes doing
as they tumble through the void of space in a desperate fight
the borg manages to get his hand around rikers throat
begins choking him
riker looks like a goner
suddenly they are both enveloped in a bright troi in command
off console tractor beam engaged
weve got em commander
prismify the beam
get rid of that borg
as the tractor beam from the enterprise splits in two and separates riker from the borg
the second beam disappears throwing the borg off into space while riker is towed back toward the hull of the ship
as the beam moves him back toward the ship
a dizzying view of the stars and the earth as he is pulled through space
closes his eyes fighting off waves of nausea
to himself dont look at the stars
dont look at the stars
picard still stalling for time
firm there is no invasion
wrong answer mister picard
he shoves his gun against rubys head
the tension rises a notch
you want the truth
beat the vulcans
are highly intelligent aliens
geordi working the tricorder
he can hear their conversation in the other room through an open com channel
thats what i thought
the tricorder beeps and he smiles
from another planet
beat oh i almost forgot
they have green blood and pointed ears
skeptical and you know all this
because youre a space man too
im afraid youve caught me
i am a space man
scrimm smirks at him what gall this guy has
but ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in picards words
she frowns in puzzlement
hes telling the truth
picard looks at ruby and at that moment something on a console behind her catches his eye a light on beverlys surgical transporter is now flashing
no one else notices
youre an entertaining man mister picard
but youre also full of shit
scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol hes holding to rubys head
the following happens very quickly picard reaches out his hand trying to stop scrimm
the gun in scrimms hand dematerializes
scrimm reacts in shock
instantly the gun rematerializes in picards outstretched hand
he quickly pushes the barrel to scrimms forehead
actually youre full of shit
everyone is in the room stunned by whats happened
picard takes charge before anyone can recover
continuing now tell your men to drop their weapons
theres a beat but then scrimm sees he has little choice
the other militia soldiers drop their weapons which are quickly picked up by beverly and a starfleet n
picard hands his gun to lange who covers scrimm with it
ruby turns to picard
are you all ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close
he hugs her back grateful shes alive
ruby pulls away
i think you have a plane to catch
picard smiles and heads back toward the phoenix
riker slams into the hull and the beam goes off
he gets his bearings quickly and then runs toward the torpedo tube where worf and his few remaining men are still fighting the borg who are about to overrun their
self destruct in fifeteen seconds
geordi and picard strapping themselves back in
reaches the torpedo tube pulls up the firing control mechanism which shows a monitor screen with a cross hair targeting display
he activates the monitor which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish
picard and geordis hands are flying across the controls
clamps a conduit into a power junction
then grabs hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and turns it
he ducks out of the way as the torpedo is launched with a roar
as the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and slams into the deflector dish
the dish explodes in a burst of flame
blowing away the borg who were working on it
as they ignite and start pouring out sheets of flame
which is shuddering and shaking
react with smiles
they did it
troi and the other n
s react with relief
the countdown on the monitors are stopped at
as the concrete missile doors slide open and the phoenix is launched up into the sky riding a pillar of fire and smoke
this is our first real look at the ship and it resembles an oversized icbm with a specialized cockpit on top
lange and the other n
s have the militia soldiers under guard
ruby is watching the missile launch on a video monitor
picard and geordi working the controls as the ship bounces and shakes
the g forces push them back into their seats
solid rocket fuel at twenty five thousand kilograms
altitude fifty kilometers
entering the upper ionospere
theres a red light on the second intake valve
well be fine
beat prepare for first stage shut down and separation on my mark
as the phoenix rockets into space
the rocket booster shuts down as the ship leaves earths orbit and coasts on its momentum
after a beat the first stage booster separates from the ship and drops away leaving three quarters of the ship in space
close on data head tilted back eyes closed smiling
a few droplets of water fall from above onto his face
he smiles wider reveling in the sensation
data is still restrained on the table but a conduit has been placed above his head and is dripping condensation onto his face
data is now a completely new being
his entire body is now made of human flesh
its a shocking sight for anyone who ever wondered what data would look like human were now getting our first look
descends from her nest in the ceiling
she watches data for a moment
rubs the moisture into his face
a borg in all but name
data although clearly enraptured with his new sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain his own sense of identity
weak i am
grateful for what you have given me
but i still do not wish to be assimilated
a universe of sensation is waiting for you
dont you want to explore it
to his surprise data finds that he is becoming drawn to this strange creature and all that she can offer him
then take the final step
give me the enterprise
and we can be together
he struggles but ultimately theres only one answer
without taking her eyes away from data she reaches out a hand and touches a control on a nearby console
the color of datas face turns an ashen gray as though the blood has drained from his skin
another droplet of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek but this time his eyes widen in shock
the sensation of human feeling is gone
ive deactivated the sensory inputs
that flesh on your body is just meat now
she moves in close on him an edge creeping into her voice you must give me what i want
without the deflector dish we can no longer send for an early invasion
we must assimilate earth ourselves
i need this ship
she hits the control and the color returns to his face
data gasps filled with feeling once again
the borg queen runs her hand across his cheek her attitude seductive and affectionate once again
isnt it better like this
but the enterprise
is to yourself
dont make me hurt you again
she touches the control again
data is shocked back into his cold android self
hes like a heroin addict being denied his high with the flick of a switch
no its so
give it back
i need it
and i need to control this ship
let me into your mind
data struggles anguished
weve never seen him like this before
completely beaten down
finally he nods
the borg queen touches the control again
a sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to data
and the queen kisses him on the mouth
this time he responds eagerly throwing himself into the emotion of the moment
she pulls back a little looks at him softly passionately
data stares back at her breathless he seems to be completely in her thrall
in order to access my neural net
you will need to create a positronic interface
beat i will tell you how
off the borg queens smile of victory
picard and geordi work the control in silence for a few moments
the ship is floating in space now a good distance from earth
ready to deploy the warp nacelles
as they used to say
all systems are go
geordi works his console
two fifty foot long sheets of metal fall away from the ship on either side of the phoenix revealing primitive warp nacelles tucked inside the craft
the warp nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward on either side the basic designs of the nacelles should be familiar to anyone whos ever seen a star trek starship
this is the beginning of a long standing architectural design element of our ships
the vulcans should be out there right now
we need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if were going to get their attention
bring the warp core on line
ill lay in a heading
the nacelles are charged
nuclear warhead standing by
were ready to ignite the warp drive
the warp nacelles flare with power and the ship begins moving forward in space
theyre slammed back into their seats from the massive g forces
warp field looks good
structural integrity holding
picard activates a monitor which begins showing a digital display of their speed
off monitor speed
twenty thousand kilometers per second
the ship is going faster
faster troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the ensign who is working the wall panel
the airlock door opens after a beat and riker worf and one security guard enter
theyre exhausted after the pitched battle
troi smiles at them as they remove their helmets
i have to admit there was a moment there when holds up a hand hold that thought
he turns away and then doubles over behind a console and begins vomiting off screen
a light beat and then suddenly the entire bridge goes dark all power gone
console monitors everything
weve lost bridge control
the borg queen is floating in the middle of the room surrounded by borg consoles and technology
data is still on the table with some kind of specialized conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors which are inactive at the moment
he appears to be caught up in the rapture of his new sensations and his personal connection to the borg queen
all thought of his starfleet responsibilities are gone
to queen i am re routing bridge command functions to this location
data thinks for a moment and the monitors suddenly come to life and the equipment around the queen hums with power
information about critical enterprise systems flows across the monitor screens we might recognize graphics from the bridge displays
the borg are now in control
eliminate their remaining defenses
i will send borg to assimilate the rest of the crew
but then one of the consoles beeps
reacts there is a perimeter alert
a ship has entered sensor range
data tilts his head and shows an exterior space shot
the image rapidly zooms in on the distant phoenix
the ship is racing through space
reacts to data give me helm control
another console lights up
she moves to work it herself
as the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse speed
as before picard is now steering the ship with a st century joystick control
the ship is moving faster and faster trembling now a roar building
passing one half light speed
the starboard nacelles running a little hot
im on it
the cabin shakes a little
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating
i dont think cochrane built this thing for comfort
speed two hundred seventy five thousand kilometers per second
a weird distortion passes through the cabin like a wave then vanishes
theres no temporal shielding in here
were starting to pick up relativistic effects
one minute to warp threshold
the warp ship whips by
and then a moment later the enterprise roars into view chasing the tiny ship
geordi glances out the window
does a double take and looks back up in surprise
captain the enterprise
taps combadge picard to enterprise
beat picard to enterprise do you read me
their com system must still be down
well i feel a whole lot better with them out there
we may need some help
as before the queen floating above the helm control console
the warp ship is on the monitor getting closer
i have repaired the weapons array
phasers are on line
a floating crosshair appears on the monitor showing the warp ship
the queen works the console
the crosshair moves but refuses to lock onto the warp ship
the targeting lock isnt working
data looks puzzled
i do not understand
the optical data network has been repaired and all systems are functioning
the queen works furiously still cant get the crosshairs to lock onto the ship
your diagnostics are in error
i need weapons
thinks the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology
your console may not be configured to handle the data flow
can you configure it
i believe so
she hits a series of borg controls on a nearby console
and the restraints holding data to the table are released
two borg drones move to him
as he stands up and heads for the queen the specialized cable still attached to his head
closing in on the tiny warp ship
its like a shark chasing a guppy
ship shaking with power and acceleration
approaching light speed
geordi glances out a side window
theyre getting awfully close
what the hell are they doing
were crossing the threshold
the ship is really shaking hard now and the compartment is distorting slightly stretching everything becoming elongated
the ship is stretching in the familiar rubber band effect that tells us a ship is going into warp
but this effect is much slower its on the verge of hitting warp speed
the enterprise still on their tail
data is standing right next to the queen and is studying the borg console intently
two borg drones stand nearby watching closely
i believe i see the problem
in the blink of an eye borg drones
the drone is knocked off its feet
the second borg rushes at data swings his arm at datas head
this is the same borg with the deadly stiletto tipped drill spikes seen earlier
the spikes tear into the flesh of datas neck drawing blood
data reacts in pain
he grabs the borgs arm and with android strength kicks him in the chest at the same time
the borg flies backward causing the cybernetic arm to rip from its socket in a shower of sparks
the borg queen swoops down at data for the kill
but datas too quick for her
with one swift motion he turns and throws the borg arm like a javelin across the room
as the spikes on the severed borg arm puncture one of the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier
a huge explosion of bursts out of the ruptured tank
the wall of roiling gas sweeps through the entire borg hive
she lunges at data just as the gas envelopes them
as it goes into warp it shoots forward and streaks away from the enterprise
as picard and geordi are slammed back into their seats and the stars whip past the windows in the familiar warp effect
data and the borg queen tearing and clawing at each other amongst the spewing gas
the borg drones try to get away but they are swallowed by the rush of gas fall to the deck twitching in pain
data and the borg queen both fall to the deck grappling with each other
as it streaks past the warp ship flying at top speed
data and the borg queen struggling against each other
the gas swirling around their bodies
and as it does we see the flesh on their bodies start to liquefy and melt away in a horrific ooze of blood and skin
as before but the ride has smoothed out considerably warp stars streaking by
bring us about
a beat as geordi works
dropping out of warp
out the front windows the warp stars stop
the ship jolts slightly
turns to the left
earth can be seen in the distance
its a moment of victory
lets begin the landing procedure
the onrush of gas is gone
but it has affected every surface of the room like an acid wash
every piece of borg machinery is smoking and hissing
the two borg drones are lying on the floor dead all organic matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies leaving only raw mechanical skeletons
lying on the floor still locked together
data is a shocking image all of his human flesh has been stripped away leaving only his pure android self
his metallic skull gleams in the dim light
even his eyes are gone
his mechanical left arm is still intact but the right human arm is completely gone
his torso is stripped of the human flesh leaving pure android with no soft human touches
data as weve never seen him before raw and mechanistic
data rolls over
still locked around him is the mechanical skeleton of the borg queen
a metallic spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading off it
and a blinking electronic brain stem at the very top of the spine
data throws off the grotesque form
the borg queen carcass writhes and claws at the air
she speaks in a flat mechanical voice
data reaches out with one hand
grabs the metal spinal column just below the brain stem
and snaps it in two
the blinking brain stem fritzes out
two borg drones moving down the hall suddenly stop
the blinkies on their bodies go out
and they both fall over dead
their connection to their queen severed
another borg drone reacts
slumps over data releases the remains of the dead borg queen
he leans back a little as though exhausted by his remarkable experience
camera pulls back emphasizing the loneliness of this smoking scorched android sitting alone in the ruins of the borg hive
the missile doors now open the ground badly scorched from the launch
scrimm and his militia guards are sitting on the ground while lange and the other starfleet n
keep a watchful eye on them
cochrane is sitting against a rock while beverly checks him over
ruby is pacing lost in thought
isnt anyone going to say welcome back
everyone looks up to see standing a few feet away tired but triumphant
did it work
beverly lange and the n
ruby takes a few steps toward picard
smiles up at geordi
mister la forge
now id like to shake your hand
geordi smiles and walks over to him
stop a few feet away from each other their eyes locked
they drink in sight of each other
theres an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words
he smiles back
a satisfying moment
captains log march rd
the voyage of the phoenix was a success
townspeople along the main street
a sense of urgency somethings going on
and it appears the vulcan ship has detected the warp signature and is now on its way to earth
suddenly something in the night sky catches their attention
a bright light is moving down towards the city
we now realize this is what people are reacting to
just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the massive vulcan scout ship settling down onto the ground
dust flying everywhere
windmill blades spinning wildly from the exhaust
squinting into the wind trying to make out whats happening
a good distance away but with a good view of the entire scene
riker worf beverly troi and geordi watching from a distance as the vulcan ship lands
picard ruby and a bandaged but much healthier zephram cochrane watching the landing
people from town are surging around them
everyone is shocked and amazed at what theyre seeing
picard watches with satisfaction this is the moment hes been waiting for
cochrane and ruby are particularly awestruck
settles engines whining down
moves to cochrane takes him gently by the arm
this is your moment
cochrane looks a little bewildered tries to grapple with the moment
theyre really from another world
and theyre going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship
cochrane looks at him
and thats supposed to be me
zephram you had the vision to build that ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own problems
beat you flew that ship
all i did was push a few buttons
cochrane looks at him for a moment
takes a breath nods
beat and dont worry ill keep your secret
they hear a mechanical whirr and a hiss of air
as a hatch opens on the vulcan ship
the townspeople behind them react with shock and fear
a few people take a step back
picard looks at cochrane who hesitates for a moment
then finally takes a deep breath
and strides out toward the alien ship
a man alone about to change the course of human history
ruby moves closer to picard and puts her arm around him
and he puts his arm around her
as the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment
they glance at each other with excitement as they watch history unfold
cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the hatch swings completely open
light streams out into the night air
and three hooded robed figures emerge
they stand across from cochrane a moment frozen in time
watching in awe
pulls his hood back revealing the familiar slanted eyebrows and pointed ears holding himself with that austere regal dignity weve come to associate with his race
he steps forward to greet cochrane
raises his hand as if to wave
cochrane raises his hand automatically as if to wave in return
but then the vulcan splits his fingers in the classic vulcan greeting
live long and prosper
cochrane tries to emulate the vulcan hand sign
but cant quite do the awkward finger split
the vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him
the very first alien human relationship is underway
are now surrounded by townspeople who are watching the scene unfold
our heroes share a glance with each other and smile riker taps his combadge
riker to enterprise
five to beam up
the crew dematerializes
have now moved away from the crowd
no one paying attention to them
the bright lights from the vulcan ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette
picard turns to ruby
its the moment hes been dreading
this is goodbye
she looks at him
youre leaving arent you
i have to
and dont tell me san francisco
its a lot further than that
its the future isnt it
just like you told scrimm
beat i knew you werent from around here
with humor no
im from france
i dont care if youre from france or venus
just take me with you
this may be hard for you to understand
but im duty bound not to interfere with you or anyone else here
any more than is absolutely necessary
youve been interfering with my life ever since i met you
with meaning dont stop now
he doesnt want to do this but hes torn between his heart and his duty
remembering his words to beverly but our fates lie along different paths
a long difficult moment
then he lets her go
turns and starts walking off into the night
she stands where she is watching him go with tears in her eyes
picard hits his combadge
picard to enterprise
he stops where he is
captain we didnt get your whole transmission
picard turns looks back at ruby
their eyes meet
and he makes the decision
to hell with fate
say again captain
he starts walking towards her
she sees him coming
starts running to him
she throws herself into his arms and he holds her close
a magical moment then
two to beam up
they dematerialize holding each other tight
moving out of earth orbit
riker worf troi n
picard enters with ruby
everyone reacts to seeing her there
ruby stays in the turbolift staring around the bridge in amazement
picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the bridge
hows mister data
riker glances at ruby uneasily
hes in sickbay
doctor crusher says he can be repaired
but we have to wait until we
he glances at ruby again awkward
but picard finishes his thought
return to our own time
then make it so
have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex
picard sits in his chair
all going back
unless youd like to stay
ruby stands stock still staring at worf
worf looks up at her with a klingon smile teeth and all
ruby manages a weak smile in return then moves off to stand next to picard
bridge to engineering
mister la forge
initiate the temporal vortex
moving through space
and then the temporal vortex forms directly ahead of it as seen before
the ship enters the vortex
the enterprise exits the vortex and into earth orbit
incoming transmission from starfleet command
admiral hayes appears
whats the status of the borg fleet
its been destroyed
the borg threat is over
beat are you all right
the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment
were fine sir
it will take some
time to explain
i look forward to reading your report
the transmission ends
ruby turns to picard with amazement
that makes two of us
picard gives her a gentle smile
off the moment
the great ship entering a starfleet space dock
geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers as they clean up the room and repair the damage
to a couple of n
s no no well have to rip out this entire bulkhead
well need new bracing members for the deck above and below
s move off making notes on their padds
geordi turns and sees data standing in the doorway
hes now been fully restored to his original android self
geordi moves to him puts a hand on his shoulder
you look good as new
you could say that im back to my old self
geordis smile fades a little as data walks into the room
are they still here
geordi points over to a corner where some n
s are about to close a storage container
data walks over
geordi goes with him
s move aside and data looks down into the storage container
the broken mangles pieces of machinery are all thats left of the borg queen
im sending them to the daystrom institute for analysis
data stares down at the remains with a haunted look
i never realized how powerful an emotion temptation could be
you said in your report it was all a ruse
you were manipulating her
a quiet beat
a unique lifeform
in her own way
geordi smiles a little
joking it almost sounds like you miss her
data looks up at him his expression unreadable
geordis smile fades
data reaches out closes the lid on the storage container turns and walks out of the room
geordi watches him go left to wonder what data is really feeling
picard and ruby walk up the familiar hilltop and when they reach the crest we reveal
a large memorial cordoned off by a chain
a plaque on the monument reads on this spot man and vulcan met for the first time
and changed the course of history
step into view
they stare at the sculpture for a moment
picard ruby and the monument are at the gates of resurrection city as it is in the rd century
this is the place where man first reached out to the stars and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting feeling spires reaching up toward the sky
shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing
the tiny western town is now a thriving futuristic as picard and ruby walk towards the city hand in hand
