jonathan hensleigh revised an impressionistic montage a silhouetted man in front of mirror dons his marine dress blues
spit polish shoes laced
medals clipped to jacket
all in close up
we never see him fully
the man puts his hat squarely on his head
on the mans dresser marine memorabilia
three purple hearts photos of a woman his wife photos of marines in combat locales
tighter into the photos we hear panicked voices explosions noises of brutal images through smoke a desperate marine private who knows he will never be rescued
two marines walk up to a farmhouse door through the screen we see a mother and daughter who know what the news will be
images a marine colour guard carries a coffin
now we are the coffin as a flag drapes down on us
placed into a young womans hand
now were in arlington cemetery
images of the cemetery are reflected in wet puddles as the spit shined shoes walk past images of the tomb of the unknown soldier a row of graves comes into
focus a g close up on the marines hat and his eyes
suddenly an explosion and we see a marine in a jungle radioing for help you gotta get us outta here sir jesus theyre all over us
and an explosion ends the communication

hummel puts new flowers on the grave
a road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility
a canvas covered army truck blows a tire in the road
the driver gets out
inspects the tire
four marines in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor into a manhole in the road

general hummel pulls up in a suburban

general hummel sir
its an honour

held better be
this is a security inspection
waves hummel in saluting crisply
the four marines from the truck are waiting readying arms
the leader is looking at his watch
gives a hand signal to the others and up they go the four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered positions in the compound
yards away two army magazine checkers emerge from a building with clipboards on routine check
the army m

marines and spring out armed with m s with over under grenade launchers they shoot bean bag projectiles at the army guards who collapse dazed
marines and burst inside the watch tower
the guards inside spring up
boom boom theyre hit by bean bag projectiles propelling them out the windows of the watch tower
they fall feet and lie unconscious
marines and now in magazine checyeris uniforms move to the bunker door
they open the door with the magazine checkers coded cards
two army guards playing poker look up at the entering marines
marines and walk straight up to the army guards holding them at bay with m s

callahan general hummel and the army guards at bay
this is a security exercise sir
weve fully breached and infiltrated your compound
im afraid you and your men are my prisoners sir
the marines begin cuffing the army guards to the radiator and taping their mouths
sorry sir you realise the importance of these exercises
to callahan ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound colonel
here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator
this is not a tight ship
i would not want to be in your shoes in the morning
crisp hits the front gates open buzzer and follows hummel out of the room
the gate swings open
two humvees enter the compound
the marines use a rabbit tool hydraulic compact and powerful to pry open the bunkers steel doors
they rush down a hallway
chemical weapons bunker interior hallway the marines rush up to another steel door and quickly pry it open
a refrigerated storage room for chemical weapons
storage tubes are labelled v
across the room are rockets labelled using the track hook system in the bunkers ceiling the marines move the v
chem rounds and bolt rockets to the waiting humvees
its very fast like clockwork

across the room bill goodspeed and partner trainee marvin isherwood feet up on desks with toy guns
this is mans boredom
a ceiling fan circles
isherwood yawns scratches neck with his gun barrel
the dart hits a cardboard target across the room which activates a rube goldberg series of events ending in a plastic girl being ignited in a goodspeed without even getting
up casually sprays the pan with flame retardant foam
yawns i was told this was exciting work
it has its moments
a klaxon sounds
isherwood smiles excitedly
isherwood follows goodspeed down a grimy off white corridor illuminated by antiseptic light
this is an older building
hasnt been refurbished and shows it
a medium sized laboratory where f
technicians are bent over tables of beakers test tubes bunsen burners etc
the room and equipment are old and used could be rather than
along one side of the lab is a plexi glass wall
inside the plexi glass is an airlocked gas chamber
i chemists lonner and ling motion to goodspeed
points inside gas chamber a dog at j
got a whiff of something postmarked to a bosnian refugee camp
could be detergent could be seran gas
inside the gas chamber is a large wooden crate next to a table of bosnian refugee camp
i dont get it
half a million serbians reside in the u
serbians dont like bosnians
read a newspaper
its good for you
hold out your hand
isherwood does so
lets do it hold on goodspeeds uncertain look and cut to int
gas c er day minutes later the door hisses open
goodspeed and isherwood in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets enter
they go to the instrument table before the crate
a glass vessel with tiny air holes like a salt shaker descends from the ceiling
inside are cockroaches
coal miners use canaries we use those
into mike we have airlock bill
into helmet mike july
hours agent william goodspeed and agent trainee marvin isherwood
initiating exam of a wooden crate
suspicion of seran gas device inside
goodspeed grabs a pry bar from the instrument table and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid
he motions to isherwood
together they gingerly lift the lid
inside the crate its filled with unicef type stuff
goodspeed lifts out a hot plate
isherwood lifts out an egg beater
gocidspeed runs a poison sensor past each
appears to be kitchen items cleaning agents and
lifts out a sweatshirt
this is thrilling
isherwood lifts out a doll
goodspeeds poison sensors needle goes crazy
careful goddamn it marvin
the dolls eyes open
its mouth blast a pinkish spray hitting goodspeeds forearm and isherwoods palm
outside the gas chamber dr
ling stabs a button marked exhaust and another marked emergency
a klaxon sounds
technicians race for the exit
in the gas chamber the pinkish gas hovers in the air
ceiling exhaust fans begin to suck it up
in the glass vessel the cockroaches convulse flip in the air and explode guts splattering the vessel walls
ling looks at a digital clock on the control panel
dont panic bill
seconds and the gas will clear
goodspeed grabs the doll from isherwood slams it on the table and grabs a scalpel
cuts open the dolls chest
ive got some bad news and some really bad news
the bad news is the gas is corrosive
its eating our suits
isherwood looks at his rubber gloves
the rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode
whats the really bad news
goodspeed peels back the dolls plastic chest revealing a c explosive device and ten poison ampules
enough c explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building
isherwoods and goodspeeds rubber gloves are melting
the acids eating
its eating my fucking suit
yells outside dr
lonner flips on the sprinklers
the pipes knock
a few pathetic drops trickle from the sprinkler heads
somethings blocking the pipes bill
when in christs name are they gonna give us a new building
get the atropine isherwood
the atropine marvin
isherwood terrified jerks open an overhead cabinet revealing several inch needled syringes
you die we all die bill
inject yourself then diffuse it
goodspeed continues to inspect the device goddamn it bill take the antidote
isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe
get that away from me
to himself i hate needles
the pipes are knocking now theyre coughing
its coming its coming
isherwood sinks to his knees holding the huge syringe in front of his heart hari kari style hands trembling
goodspeed concentrates on the device his calm is unsettling
his hands flash grabbing instruments and performing precise deft functions
he snips a wire and splices it
sweating it out ten seconds bill
isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest
oh fuck oh shit oh fuck this is like fucking pulp fiction only isherwood drops the syringe
fumbles for another
goodspeed ice cold continues on the device
five seconds bill four seconds jesus christ
goodspeedis rubber glove is stretched to transparency
we see goodspeeds flesh through the acid eaten rubber
he makes one final cut and clamp
the detonator on the poison gas turns off
the gas is clear
outside the gas chamber green ligrts flasr on the control panel and a torrential spray soaks goodspeed and isrerwood
isherwood is wide eyed and trembling
goodspeed glares at him
next time use the atropine
i dont like needles

loud country music emanates from an apt
a young woman stands in the middle of the living room belting out a carlene carter tune in cowboy boots rhinestone blouse and skirt
carla pestalozzi s is playing guitar accompanied by a boom box
every little dream i dream about you every little song i sing about you it drives me crazy when you go away notices goodspeed wanna keep you locked up at

first i am holding eighty one civilian hostages on alcatraz island

i will call again at hundred hours and state my demands
who is this
brigadier general francis x
womack stares at the phone calls to outer office mary jane get the pentagon

hendrix before hummel
frye and darrow and sgt
crisp at attention maj
baxter at hummells side
at ease gentlemen
it is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation
the heart performs one thing the legs another the brain another all better function together or the body becomes ill is prone to disease
beat major baxter gunny crisp and i have been on the front lines since nam
captain hendrix was my adjutant in the gulf
get a haircut pete youre lookin like a beatnik
the crew cutted hendrix smiles captain frye captain darrow
you and your men are new to me
would the general like a recitation of our service records
im well aware of your service records captain they are excellent
i want to be clear on why you why all of us are here
you both stand to profit from this
profit is not my motive sir
i am here to redress a wrong
yes sir and to learn some people a lesson
this country has places where wrongs are redressed captain darrow they are called courts of law
in the military they are called courts martial
this country has places where lessons a re leaned
they are called schools
am i confusing you
well sir frankly
el i see that i am beat the only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason
plain and simple
an insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance
everyone in this room must understand that
hummel looks from face to face studying each
the question is what kind of traitor are we
coward or lion
benedict arnold or thomas iefferson
i have posed that question to myself have answered it and my conscience is clear
have all of you
within thirty two
hours you will leave this country and not return
all of you can live with that
unison yes sir
well i cannot
so regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead i will stay
the men exchange surprised glances
but general youll be prosecuted
and i plan on conducting my own defense
it will make the o
simpson trial look like an episode of perry mason
take your posts gentlemen

director milton amway
last night hummel and eleven marines under the guise of a security exercise walked off with fifteen v
it wasnt discovered until the shift change this morning
on the screen a younger hummel in vietnam
here he is in vietnam i think a major at the time
more slides of hummel in various international theaters
four tours in vietnam grenada panama desert storm
three purple hearts
two silver stars and
the congressional medal of
looks up the man is a hero
during tet he held off a brigade of v
saved his whole company
hence the nickname gunfighter
what was this book hummel wrote on vietnam
anybody read it
give me the skinny
the skinny mr
sinclair is that the u
should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of vietnam and stopped wasting american lives
i happen to share general hummells view
the door opens
a naval attache pokes his head in
general its him
the call connects to a phone on the table
frank this is albert kramer
howlre judy and the kids
im with general peterson f
director womack chief of staff sinclair security advisor lindstrom and c
youve got a lot of people worried frank
can you help us out
intercut pentagon and alcatraz as necessary
ill come straight to the point general kramer eighty three force reconnaissance marines have died under my various commands
forty seven in northern laos and southern china
we never admitted we sent troops into china
there is a pause
who is that
everyone stares at sinclair
white house chief of staff sinclair general
how old are you white house chief of staff sinclair
im thirty three
well white house chief of staff sinclair by your ninth birthday i had led over two hundred incursions into china and personally killed that many of the enemy
general put some duct tape over mr
sinclairs fat ignorant mouth
he has shit for brains and he is wasting my time
sinclairs irritation is relieved by the naval attache entering again who hands him a phone and whispers the president calling from moscow
sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone speaking sotto voice
eighteen others died in covert illegal operations in chile and el salvador
remember the gulf war
those pretty smart bomb pictures on c
my men lased those targets
ten were left to rot outside baghdad when the conflict ended and lets not even mention mogadishu gentlemen
no benefits were paid to their families no medals conferred
these men died for their country and they werent even given a coddamn military burial
beat this situation will not stand you will transfer million dollars from a grand cayman red sea trading company account to an account i designate
from these funds reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the marines families
the rest of the money will pay for my outfits expenses
am i clear
except for the red sea trading company
what is that
director womack general
youll be particularly interested its a slush fund where the pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales
frank jesus this is classified information
stunned is this true
general kramer embarrassed nods yes
if you want the money back youll have to tell the attorney general and the boys down at justice where it came from
hayden sinclair returns to the table
general ive just spoken to the president and he is clear as hell on this we will not negotiate with you and we do not care if
someone please gag that man
beat alert the media i launch the gas
refuse payment i launch the gas
it is just after midnight
you have hours all of today and half of tomorrow until noon to transfer the money
dont even consider the standard counter measure general
whats the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with v
in a dense urban area sixty seventy
well thats not so bad
one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building
get the point
what did hummel mean by standard countermeasure general
standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm
it burns it up consumes it upon detonation
the problem is that v
gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm
hummel must know about willy peter general
course he does
explaining to others willy peter short for white phosphorous incendiary device still in its test phase
it detonates at degrees enough to burn up v
dawning on him that explains hummells time frame
he knows were not operational
what would it take general
to equip a flight of f s with willy peter in hours
an act of god
off kramers look all right we can try
but view the use of willy peter as a secondary initiative
then on to our primary initiative

before anderson are aerial recon photos of alcatraz
a precision night drop is out due to the full moon
likewise on a frontal seaside attack at the first shot hummel might launch
my second in command is working on an attack from within the prison
beat the idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison undetected emerge in its center and jump the marines from behind take their rocket positions without a shot fired
but i need better intelligence
youve studied the architectural plans
alcatraz was originally a civil war fort
its been ripped up and rebuilt for years
under there is a maze of shit excuse my language
beat what i need is personal firsthand intelligence on the islands tunnels
camera focuses on f
director womack who gives a very significant look to c
the former warden
the guards we contacted are useless
there was a janitor alcatraz al
he worked there for twenty years but he died in
didnt three guys escape
i thought i saw a movie about it
its a hollywood myth
no ones escaped alcatraz and lived
director trades a very significant look with c
amway clears his throat
he is older very old school
everyone turns to him
there is someone who can help us
director and i have something to discuss in private
womack and amway rise and exit together
everyone else sits there confused
pentagon corridor night womack and amway exit into the corridor
they huddle tightly against the wall

i am very uncomfortable about this
wolfburg penitentiary cell block night a long row of cells
camera slowly dollies past cell after cell
sullen inmates stare blankly at us
i knew i knew someday this would come back to bite us
camera moves through a door marked isolation
at the end of a gloomy corridor is a cast iron door
it wont bite anyone if handled correctly
when was the last time you saw him
when he escaped from san quentin
the man was an s
two federal marshals open the cell
s steel locking bar
they push open the door
a man sits on the bed

the tunnels underneath it
real subtle sanchez
theres no harm in cooperating with us
why should i do that
maybe theres a gift in it for you
to the mirror timeo danaos et dona ferentes
goodspeed smiles slightly i fear the greeks even when they bring gifts
are you capable of reading sanchez
sanchez is getting flustered
i dont have time for this shit
pause stares at mason yes
i can read
the story of alchimadus
to himself ancient greece
alchimadus was imprisoned by his king
thomas a beckett
heard of him
to himself archbishop of canterbury
imprisoned and executed by henry the second

to himself russian poet and dissident exiled to siberia
sanchez draws a blank on solzhenitsyn
look im asking the fucking questions here
beat you can trust the f
thats a good one sanchez
what do you call and f
agent who cant tell a lie
mason turns away
as if sanchez no longer exists
suddenly over a wall mounted intercom uhm agent sanchez could we have a word with you
here call your lawyer and tell him youre going back to jail
sanchez tosses a quarter on the desk and exits
you mind if
i take a shot
hell eat him alive
hes already had you for the first course
hands goodspeed the pardon go
goodspeed takes the pardon goes for the door
hes completely out of his element has no idea what hes doing and is suddenly face to face with this
the two men regard each other
take his cuffs off
the marshal uncuffs masons wrists
mason rubs his wrists staring now at goodspeed
who the fuck are you mother theresa
so much for goodspeeds confidence
no actually im bill goodspeed
mason we really need your help
thats a pardon and release contract from the attorney generals office

he slides a ballpoint pen across to mason
mason looks at the pen then goodspeed
what do you do for the f
lying im a field agent

im a chemical biological weapons expert
mason registers this information
in the observation room f
director womack stupid stupid stupid
stares at the pardon contract thinking

with that mason picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract
he hands it to goodspeed who exits
mason turns toward the mirror staring right through
and goodspeed enter
goodspeed hands u
attorney reynolds the signed pardon contract

we cannot yet see hummel and the marines
this plays with as much tension as possible
the situation is chilling anderson here general hummel
commander anderson if you have any concern for the lives of your men you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet
on the video monitor we see the floodlights above on the mezzanine and hear hummells voice oh christ this isnt happening

its us or them reigert fuck theyre gonna waste us
get a grip on yourself
on the mezzanine pvt
coxis boot nudges a tile which has come loose from its mortar
the tile inches to the edge of the mezzanine
then it falls
boyer reacting to the falling tile brings up his machine gun and fires a sustained burst in its direction and all hell breaks loose
the marines fire in unison
a cruel withering fusillade
s in the middle of the floor take the brunt of it
they gamely return fire
but theyre hit
in the drainage hole goodspeed mason and lt
shepherd listen and watch when the view allows in utter horror to the firefight above
shepherd scrambles up the ladder
goodspeed grabs him
tries to pull him down
don t do it
let go of me
shepherd climbs the ladder
in the shower room anderson takes a bullet in his leg
his automatic blazing he takes a bullet in the forearm
three marines on the mezzanine are hit and killed
shepherd climbs out of the drainage pipe and comes up firing
he instantly takes a bullet through the visor killing him instantly
shepherd falls to his knees and pitches over falling face first into the drainage hole where shepherds lifeless eyes come face to face with goodspeed who nearly passes out then
looks away in horror
s behind the columns return fire
theyre hit picked off
one by one
marine cox and mccoy fire a cal
gun as powerful as anti aircraft or anti tank round through the column killing reigert and boyer
suddenly the firing stops
goodspeed and mason freeze
thinking fast mason rips the tac radio from shepherds helmet takes his mm pistol and machine gun and his saw toothed knife and sheath and climbs down
goodspeed indecisive at first clambers down after mason
pier mobile command trailer night on the video monitor an image transmitted from andersons helmet camera

mason and goodspeed exit the drainage pipe
goodspeed is panting nearly hysterical

she freezes her hands covering to her mouth at the sound of over tac radio god jesus were gonna die sanchez agitated exits the command trailer with director womack
they huddle speaking in hushed voices

de gaulle british members of parliament even the prime minister
the man had dirt on everyone in the world goodspeed slumped in a corner watches mason arm himself
he is a different person

pops the clip on shepherds g mil gun
unsheathes the saw toothed knife
the british sent over their best operative john mason to steal it
mason grabs shepherds machine gun pops the clip
our agents caught mason at the canadian border but with no microfilm
its never been found
so hoover held him without trial
the british claimed they didnt know him
what about the daughter
why didnt hoover use her as leverage
he died in
she wasnt born yet today its a different bureau and no one wants to touch this
my god youre not saying
mason slides the clip back in the machine gun
tests the action
obviously comfortable with firearms
john mason has been incarcerated without trial on american soil since
he knows our most intimate secrets of the last half century
the alien landing at roswell the truth about the j
john mason was an s

hummel leans down
stares into dandos video feed
pier night womack and sanchez stare at hummel on the monitor

the transmission goes dead
drainage pipe crisp bent over shepherds corpse in
the shouts to hummel general

cox and mccoy go to the drainage pipe
hummel and his men exit the main cell house and fan out in teams across the island
crisp and cpt
hendrix move toward the power plant above the tunnel traveled by mason and goodspeed
goodspeeds still trailing after mason

mason stops i dont know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail but there are a million people across that bay who might die
mason continues fuck this
goodspeed has his g gun trained on him

crisp and capt
hendrix walking toward the power plant hear something
beneath them through a ventilation grate
whispers in tac mike rodents located
hendrix and crisp begin preparing a satchel explosive
mason and goodspeed as before

goodspeed fiddles with the safety catch
with a swipe mason snatches the gun
they glare at each other
over tac radio goodspeed
goodspeed come in

now he has all the guns sir
clicks off the tac radio youve got to help me
what do you want me to do beg
save your breath and your dignity if you have any
i am leaving
i am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here
mason walks off
the satchel explosive has fallen at his feet
mason turns looks at goodspeed
and they sprint back the way they came
in the tunnel behind them a monstrous explosion blows in the tunnel and knocks mason and goodspeed to their feet
cox and mccoy attach a bundle of c to a tank of gasoline and toss it down the drainage pipe
the gas bomb detonates blowing a wall of flame through the tunnel
the fire is looking for an escape hunting and burning everything in its path
see the wall of flame roaring toward them
mason grabs goodspeed
hold your breath
they dive into a pool of stagnant water submersing as the wall of flame blows through the tunnel over their heads
mason then goodspeed drags himself out of the water
and keep your mouth shut
mason hurries off goodspeed on his tail
the tunnel leads here to the civil war era dungeon
the tunnels bricked up brick and mortar circa
mason moves to the bricked up wall
feels around the mortar
removes a brick
a whole clump of bricks falls revealing a hole
came out right through there
squeezes through the hole mutters course ive gained a few since
goodspeed follows mason through the hole
mason and goodspeed emerge to a ledge which faces a pool of dank stagnant water
its about ft
across that then yards to the morgue
off goodspeeds blank stare you said thats where the fucking poison is goodspeed
i dont get it
youre going to help me
im going to give you dancing lessons

whats bent out of shape idiot is the tunnel i was going through to freedom five minutes ago

dont call me idiot okay
mason what did i do to deserve this
what god did i offend
goodspeed begins to wade into the pool
goodspeed stops there
the water slithers with cottonmouths
mason unpack the quart of motor oil in spray bottle
they breath through their skin
oil clogs it
they hate the stuff
sprays the motor oil across the pool
the snakes scatter
the pools now coated with an oil slick
mason wades in
the cottonmouths repulsed by the oil stay away
goodspeed tries not to look at the snakes
they make it across
somethings a little off here im the f
agent youre the convict and you have all the guns
mason slaps the
mm pistol into goodspeeds hand walks off
mason and goodspeed arrive at a fork in the tunnel
down the fork in the tunnel is the prison mono rail system a single rail suspended from the tunnel ceiling upon which small carts are suspended
moves to a steel runged ladder leading to a garbage chute against the wall
mason and goodspeed emerge from the garbage chute
they hear voices in the next room
gamble and starling are guarding the poison
starlings walking around
gambles seated on a morticianis table smoking
the door bursts open
mason stands in the doorway
gamble dives away
starling whirls raising his m
masons hand flashes
the saw toothed knife flies the length of the room and buries in starlings neck
gamble fires from his position around the corner
mason and goodspeed dive for cover behind a cabinet
goodspeed fires from cover without looking his gun raised over the cabinet
mason underneath the cabinet fires at gambles foot
gamble shot hits the deck
gamble unclips a grenade
before he can pull the pin
mason fires his clip empty at the air conditioner mount on the ceiling above gamble
the mount gives the enormous air conditioner falls crushing gamble
gambles grenade still secured with the pin rolls away
looks at gamble under the air conditioner
just his legs stick out
note the rest of the scenes action plays out around gambles legs
you didnt learn that in prison
no and i used to be a lot quicker
ive got some questions for you but they can wait
goodspeed opens the corpse drawers revealing the v
chem rounds shaped like big tennis ball cans
goodspeed carefully lifts out a chem round
mason grabs one accidentally knocking it against the drawer
the second you dont respect this it kills you
goodspeed and mason set the v
chem rounds on the morticians table
goodspeed pulls out his equipment kit
begins detaching the tops of the chem rounds
goodspeed reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out
a strand of v
poison pearls ping pong ball sized glass bubbles filled with poison
i need a hand here
mason looks anxiously at the poison pearls
hands the poison pearl strand to mason
mason holds it like a string of wind chimes
exactly does this do to you
any epidermal exposure or inhalation and youll know a twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system
hands over another poison pearl strand then loss of muscular function
then you spit your guts out it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor then your skin turns black
mason stares uneasily at the pearl strands
sounds like my first marriage
goodspeed has the chem rounds guidance systems exposed
inside are tiny guidance system micro chips
goodspeed plucks the chip from each chem round and pockets it
into tac radio pier come in
tac radio goodspeed
where the hell have you been
talk to me

im removing the rockets guidance system chips
to mason without em the rocketslll fly about feet and splash down like a wounded duck
moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds
suddenly theres a beep
goodspeed and mason whirl
gambles walkie talkie is talking to them gamble starling
mason and goodspeed exchange a nervous look
privates gamble and starling come in
hummel clicks off his walkie talkie
stands there a second thinking
hummel and baxter exit quickly
goodspeed goes faster his hands are sweating trembling
its like hes lost his spine
and thinking about carla perhaps he has
goodspeed nearly drops a chem round
i thought you were cool under pressure
shut up youre making me nervous
hummel and his men race toward the morgue
goodspeed has dealt with eight chem rounds
there should be seven more but theres not
goodspeed counts them
theyll be on us in twenty seconds
wait a minute
hummel stole fifteen chem rounds
theres only twelve here
do these last four
mason raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four chem rounds
goodspeed quickly plucks the chips from the guidance systems
hummel and the marines converge on the morgue
surround the door
they burst inside guns trained
cox mccoy and darrow fire machine gun bursts at sprinting across floor bullets chewing the floor
they dive into the morgue incinerator chute goodspeed leaving the tac radio behind
goodspeed and mason tumble out of the chute
two mono rail carts are hanging there
they exchange a look and climb into the first cart
mason throws the carts release lever
the cart glides down the mono rail
hummel goes to the morticians table
sees the theft of the guidance chips
take royce and scarpetti
captain hendrix and pvts
royce and scarpetti dive into the incinerator chute after mason and goodspeed
gamble and starling are dead
hendrix scarpetti and royce tumble from the incinerator chute
mason and goodspeed are down the mono rail track
hendrix gets in the second mono rail cart
scarpetti gets in the third mono rail cart
hendrix and scarpetti pull the release levers
the mono rail carts rumble after goodspeed and mason
hendrix shouts back to royce int
alcatraz mono rail tunnel night the three carts fly down the mono rail goodspeed and mason in cart feet ahead of scarpetti in cart who is feet ahead of hendrix
in cart in carts and scarpetti and hendrix fire m s
and goodspeed duck as bullets ricochet around the tunnel walls
they pop up and return fire
in cart scarpetti arms hi over under m grenade launcher with a grenade and
the grenade projectile shoots down the monorail tunnel
duck as the grenade projectile wings over their heads continues down the tunnel and detonates against the tunnel wall
cart roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion
as it rounds a corner mason grabs a splintered timber and releases from the cart
cart with goodspeed alone continues down the mono rail
mason yanks down a ft
long broken section of sewage pipe and presses himself against the tunnel wall
as cart rounds the corner
mason swings hitting scarpetti flush in the forehead killing him and blowing him off the cart
cart without scarpetti continues down the mono rail
as cart rounds the corner mason swings again but hendrix is waiting for it
hendrix grabs the swinging pipe and pulls mason into cart
masons sprawled on the floor of the cart
hendrix levels his m
mason whipsaws the legs under hendrix bowling him over the m falling away from the cart
mason and hendrix get to their feet
they trade blow after blow as the cart roars through the tunnel
looks over his shoulder at mason and hendrix locked in mortal combat
he pulls the cart brake
cart begins slowing down
cart scarpettils rams into it
now carts and are together
and on comes cart hendrix knocks mason to the floor of the cart
hendrix dives atop mason strangling him
masons head is bent over the front lip of the cart
mason looks down the mono rail track
to his horror he sees carts and slowing down
realizes that his cart is going to ram masons outstretched head
he releases the brake and cart picks up speed
in cart hendrix draws the knife
hendrix raises the knife
with his last strength mason rolls away
hendrix plunges the knife down missing mason him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the front lip of the cart
mason screams at goodspeed
pulls the cart brake and cart slams into carts and at m
crushing hendrixls head and torso between carts and
the collision knocks mason off cart slamming his head against the tunnel wall
mason falls unconscious
to the tunnel floor while cart is shoved by the collision across
a ditch of water in the tunnel floor
goodspeed groggily gets to his feet
jumps down from the cart
in the midst of this pvt
royce runs up
sees mason concussed helpless
royce draws his glinting knife
kneels over mason
hes going to cut his throat
royce lowers the knife
looks across the ditch at goodspeed
the ditch is ft
wide and filled with dank stagnant water and weve seen dank stagnant water before
pretty easy killing an unconscious man
how about trying me
beat whatre you waiting for
i am going to fuck you up something fierce
you rolled the wrong number shithead
you crapped out
and royce begins to wade into the ditch
and goodspeed is looking at the water waiting
royce is waist deep now
royce feels something
looks down at five cottonmouth snakes fangs wide and white plunging into him
his knees buckle
he falls to his knees in the water
a cottonmouth stuck to his neck
royce shrieks again
and slides gently under the water
i rolled snake eyes
goodspeed hand over hand on the monorail eases the cart across the stagnant ditch
mason gets to his feet
the two exchange a look
its all i could think of
they stumble off down the mono rail tunnel
i think ive got arthritis
general kramer c

mason and goodspeed emerge from the mono rail tunnel
the launcher on china alley is in the b
suddenly from the loudspeaker above them loudspeaker attention navy seals attention
mason and goodspeed freeze
he thinks were seals

darrow has his
placed against larrys left temple

goodspeed turns to mason

goodspeed unpockets the v
rockets guidance chips
hands them to mason
mason heaves them into the bushes
what are you doing

i dont know if i can do this
theres only one way to find out
ill try to give you time
tosses goodspeed his atropine syringe dont be an idiot

mason moves off into the night
well thank you thank you very much
goodspeed creeps toward the china alley rocket launcher
goodspeed moves under the grated multi level structure of china alley
looks up through the grate
the rocket launcher sits on the grate on the level above him
mason walks down the middle of the cell block toward the opening to the exercise yard
darrow with his gun to larry hendersons head
hummel paces in the background
mason emerges ftom the cell block
mason walks up to hummel
the two stand there a moment regarding each other
gotta be kidding me
they send an old man
mason gives darrow a hard eyed glance
hummel takes a lap around mason sizing him up
i thought id been in the service a long time
name and rank sailor
john paul mason
stares at hummel royal navy
youre a long way from england commander mason
i feel strangely at home
you wouldnt believe me if i told you

i was a guest here
glances all around
cox mans the launcher
suddenly a voice freeze
cox freezes drop the weapon and turn around
cox drops his weapon
goodspeed one hand on his gun the other on his tools begins to unscrew the v
chem round pvt
looking down he sees goodspeed and cox
he cinches his repelling clip to the steel railing
well youre some kind of joker mason
maybe youre a lunatic
are you of sound mind mason
im not threatening the lives of a million innocent people
hummells demeanor changes
give me the guidance chips
i threw them in the bay
that was stupid of you
re hostage henderson would you have shot him the marines look at hummel wondering the same thing
china alley rocket launching station night goodspeed still holding cox at bay pulls the v
chem round from the rocket
the going is slow
he begins to lift the poison pearl strands from the chem round
his hand reaches to unclip the guidance system chip
mccoy repels to the level behind goodspeed
goodspeed grabs the chip and dashes off slamming through an old wooden door into the civil war ruins
mason and hummel
the previous question dangles in the air would you have shot him
you seem like a bright man commander
bright men understand necessity
bright men also obey the law
wherever law ends terror begins
where there is no law there is no transgression
romans chapter verse
article american constitution
treason against the united states shall consist of
the american constitution was written by traitors commander
traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity
beat i see little difference in my motivation
goodspeed inside the civil war ruins levels his gun at the door
the chip is in his free hand
the door creaks open
do you commander mason
coming from china alley
hummel and men whirl around startled
frye crisp go
goodspeed wildly discharges his gun until click the clip is spent
cox and mccoy step through the doorway
goodspeed shoves the guidance chip in his mouth
swallow that and i swear on my aunt myrtles grave ill cut your belly open and pull it out
mccoy and cox spring at goodspeed
mccoy whips the butt end of his gun against goodspeeds head
goodspeed crumples unconscious
mccoy jams his fingers in goodspeeds mouth
mccoy he bit the fuckin thing
goodspeed squints through painful eyes gaining consciousness
he looks around taking stock of the start cell on id block
gets to his feet
goes to the bars mason
no response mason
its about time
where are you
mason sits on a bed
under his breath literally and figuratively
widening we see that masons mattress has been ripped into long strips
is braiding the strips into a long rope
the rope is quite finely constructed
masons been at this several hours
intercut between the two cells and during the following mason keeps busy with his rope braiding
this is tiny
you referring to your intellect goodspeed
or another portion of your anatomy

goodspeed listens intently and technicians are frantically installing willy peter incendiary bombs under the wings of an f
across the hmgar general peterson and captain giler brief four f general peterson the target
this is not a precision strike
the entire island is to be blanketed
lwo f pilot sir we hit that island with willy peter and its going to look like iwo jima

the pilots look at each other
we jerry rigged a release lever
youll find it on the left side of the cockpit
its got two positions safety and release
throw it on release the bomb drops in five seconds

goodspeed stares blankly into space
intercut between the two cells again
thinks why didnt you just tell hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was
make a trade
theyd get the microfilm and id get a bullet in the head
i see your point
somethings been on my mind
about your escape
lifts the bed
pulls off the beds heavy rolling caster
knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope
you went down the shower drain through the tunnels to the power plant under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe that much ive got but
howld you get out of your cell
mason leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block
the braided rope tied to it plays out to its full length
contd i only ask because in our current situation it might be useful information
the result the braided rope lies across the cell block floor the rolling caster tied to it
mason holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell
trade secret billy ill tell you this it was easier than getting in
fiercely yanks the rope toward him
the heavy rolling caster jerks from the floor
the caster pulling the rope flies past masons cell shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block still pulling the rope where the caster pulled rope catches
the cell release lever against the wall
the rope coils wrap wrap whap around the release lever handle
tugs the rope taut like hes just snagged a fish
then he pulls slowly and delicately
the cell door release lever pulls down and masons cell door and all the doors on that tier open at once
goodspeed hears the doors opening above him
hey whats happening
no response mason
suddenly goodspeeds cell door opens
goodspeed exits the cell
mason stands there
youre on your own kid
your gears over there
mason motions to a heap of their gear clothes weapons flares in the corner of the cell tier
grabs his guns and gear and follows after mason

hold out their hands catching rain drops
one of them spasm
skin turns black
blood runs from pores
frye and crisp stare across the bay in disbelief
i dont believe it
he pulled the plug
frye disgusted races down the stairs
frye stalks into the infirmary
mason and goodspeed come around the corner and steal inside the infirmary
chief of staff hayden sinclair stands before the desk of the president of the united states
they need a decision mr
the president who we dont see gazes into the east garden
the president hits his intercom to the room where his cabinet is gathered
intercut with the authorities reactions as needed these past few hours have been the longest darkest of my life
this is when you wish the buck did not stop here
beat a balance between two tragedies
on one hand the fate of a million civilians
on the other frank hummel
that we have ignored or abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like frank hummel and that american boys have paid the price of that neglect in blood is equally real
and equally tragic
the glass is half full not half empty sir
no civilian casualties so far
i dont believe in half full or half empty sinclair
there are chemical weapons and there are civilians
and there are men on alcatraz wholve proved theyre willing to use the one on the other
beat we are at war with terror
fighting a war means casualties
this is the worst call ive ever had to make
takes the phone air strike approved
sanchez womack carla silent around speakerphone
the f s roar down the runway lifting into the sky
mason and goodspeed move silently down the corridor
they pass the heavy steel door of the marinets command center
voices emanate within
goodspeed and mason move inside the adjacent room
infirmary room adjacent to command center day theres a x inch slit in the wall
mason and goodspeed position themselves on either side watching and eavesdropping on the drama unfolding within
frye darrow and baxter
all staring at hummel
i knew it
the problem is now thev know it
id maintain discipline if i were you
darrow draws his
levels it at hummel
intercut with mason and goodspeeds reactions
im relieving you of your command general
major baxter looks from darrow to hummel
its over frank
to darrow im in
he cant believe this
tom i warn you
stand down general
im giving you a direct order
im not accepting it
and mason exchange a tense look
mason aims his gun through the slit
hummel draws his
but baxter fires first hitting hummel squarely in the chest
fires through the slit killing baxter as hummel gunshot reels toward the steel door behind him
he wrenches it open and lunges outside into the corridor
in the corridor mason fires into the command center sending frye and darrow diving for cover
grabs the semi consious hummel and drags him down the corridor
drags hummel inside
hummel collapses against the wall
his blood runs across the tiled floor
mason takes a defensive position in the washrooms doorway
darrow and frye attack through the infirmarys maze of rooms taking cover where they can squeezing off rounds
mason fires at darrow and frye from the doorway while goodspeed kneels over hummel
hummells dying and knows it
he stares at goodspeed through glassy eyes
my god what have i done
its not too late general
tell me where the last chem round is
gasps for air lower lighthouse
mason and goodspeed turn from hummel to each other
do your job billy
ill try to hold em off
blasts away at frye and darrow allowing goodspeed to sprint for the exit toward the lower lighthouse
as frye holds down mason with fire darrow sprints for the opposite exit
frye firing while retreating moves back inside the command center
goodspeed exits and sprints toward the lower lighthouse
crisp smokes a cigarette next to launcher
goodspeed enters gun raised
crisp spins drawing his
crisp falls dead
infirmary advances toward the command centers door
suddenly the heavy steel door creaks open and a satchel explosive flings out sliding across the corridor floor toward mason
mason turns and sprints away
frye bolts from the room s printing the other way
dives away as the satchel detonates imploding the corridor walls collapsing the ceiling
masons engulfed in two tons of plaster and crumbled cinder block
goodspeeds detached the v
chem round from the rocket
hes about ready to pull out the poison pearls when
darrow barges in
goodspeed c hem round in hand moves behind the stairway and scaffolding in the room s middle
infirmary command center day frye at the guidance control computer into walkie talkie
crisp darrow come in
thinks clicks walkie talkie to new channel cox mccoy get your asses up here
cox and mccoy standing watch leave the watch tower and hurry toward the infirmary and lower lighthouse
darrow moves one way goodspeed the other
goodspeed holds the chem round in front of him
give that to me
you shoot me ill drop this and were both dead
one of these pearlslll kill everything within feet
you know how this shit works
darrow drops his gun
pulls out a titanium bladed knifg
you know how this shit works
darrow advances on goodspeed
the only route to goodspeed is between the rocket and the window
darrow continues advancing
goodspeed eyes the launchers ignition switch
as darrow passes between thewindow and the launcher
you know the elton john son rocket man
i hate it
goodspeed stabs the ignition switch
the vx rocket lifts off hitting darrow square in the chest
the vx rocket blows darrow through the window and wings off clearing the cliffs
darrow falls from the rocket well it happens to be my favorite fuckin song
darrow plummets impaling himself on a steel fence spike
the vx rocket swerves madly across the bay second rockets away sir
confused look it went in the bay sir
goodspeeds alone now with the last v
he pulls out the strand of poison pearls
suddenly an axe blade comes through the door
lower lighthouse day capt
frye chops at the door lock with a fire axe
goodspeed looks around frantically
only one place to go
goodspeed scrambles up the interior metal stairs
emerges on the roof
sets down the chem round
pulls out the poison pearl strands his hand shaking
with the other hand he unclips the rocket guidance chip
the copper strands holding the pearls are corroded
a strand breaks
four pearls fall
goodspeed catches three
the fourth drops hitting his shoe
it rolls along the rooftop
goodspeed sets aside the other pearls and dives grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof s edge
suddenly the huge lighthouse window behind goodspeed explodes showering goodspeed with glass
on the adjacent rooftop pvt
mccoy wielding a smoking
cal machine gun
mccoy fires a wicked long sustained burst emptyinc his entire ammunition belt
the lighthouse searchlight fresnel blows to shreds
goodspeed rolls away glass shards raining down on him cutting him
hes a sitting duck
mccoy casts aside the
cal and unshoulders a sniper rifle
draws a bead on goodspeed again
goodspeed bleeding terrified cowers awaiting death
a silhouette appeares behind mccoy
its mason dirty and bloodied
mason bats the rifle aside knees mccoy in the solar plexus grips mccoyls neck snap
and hurls him off the roof
mccoy falls floors
goodspeed gives mason a thankful glance
and hears the door burst open frye roars inside
starts up the stairs
frye barges onto the roof
sees the dismantled chem round
goodspeeds at the edge of the roof looking down
give me the guidance chip
frye raises his m as goodspeed jumps
lands hard on the ground below and sprints off
goodspeed sprints toward the new industries building
frye fires form the roof
m rounds kick up dirt around goodspeed
frye curses and head back down the stairs
alcatraz in front of lower lighthouse day frye exits and sprints after goodspeed
main cell house stairwell day mason come down the stairs
cox looms on the stairs below
faces off with mason
cox draw his knife and lunges
mason catches cox wrist
cox with his free hand hits mason
on comes cox
hes huge and menacing
he hits mason again
cox has mason backed up to the stairwell
goodspeed frantic sprints across the floor splashing through puddles
he loses his footing
falls and slides across the floor clutching the guidance chip an d pear
he gets to his feet
limps behind some rusty machinery
sees ripples in puddles left by goodspeed
frye creeps across the floor
following the ripples
masons nearly through
backed up against the railing
cox comes in again
mason spits blood and teeth
masons moves to his pocket
as cox comes in for the death blow mason pulls the motor oil from his picket and sprays it in coxs eyes
the big man is dazed blinded
mason steps aside and rams cox over the railing
cox falls to his death on the floor below
mason looks down at him
snakes hate the stuff
frye creeps close to goodspeeds hiding place
goodspeed lunges from behind the machinery jamming his fingers into fryels mouth and ramming home the poison pearl
goodspeed hammers his fist into fryels jaw
we hear the glass breaking in fryels mouth
fryels eyes widen
grey smoke spews from his mouth and nostrils
his eyes bulge
goodspeed tries to step away
frye bearhugs him pressing his face close
frye open his mouth spewing forth a cloud of poison in goodspeeds face
youre comin with me
goodspeed shoves frye away
frye drops his body quivering
blood pours form his ears and nose
frye spasms in a sickening dance of death
goodspeed reels away
dizzy he falls to his knees
hes gassed and knows it
desperately he rips at his pandleg
a syringe taped to his calf
he pulls it free and hesitates
a beat then he plunges the long needle into his chest
into his heart
depresses the plunger
the f flying north along the california
coastline bank right and dive down onto san francisco bay
goodspeeds world slows down
is he dying
he sees images in slow motion he and carla together his parents moments from his childhood
slowly goodspeeds breathing normalizes
he gazes up at the dawning sky
sees something shimmering in the distance
through the heat waves sanchez director womack and the f
technicians watch from the window as the f s wing across the bay toward alcatraz
may god have mercy gn their souls
face buried in his hands you cant do this you cant let this happen
exits and kneels reaching for his other pantleg
pulls out his green flares
he cracks the flares and fires them up
the f s fly under the span of bridge just feet off the water shooting up a plume of water
alcatraz new industries building day goodspeed in slow motion waves the flares
lead f cockpit day the lead f pilot speaks on this air to air mike
lead f pilot arm up
carla watches the approach of the f s on alcatraz in horror
every second is excruciating
ten seconds to the drop zone
and now counting eight seven six
a hilltop on the marin side of the golden gate bridge
two spotters watch the action through spotting scopes
spotter watches the f s
spotter watching alcatraz nearly jumps out of his skin
a radio operator fires a message to command
on come the f s roaring over alcatraz
theyre almost on top of goodspeed now

the lead f pilot safeties the bomb release lever
rear f the rear f pilot is wrestling with his release lever

the four f s veer away from the island
but for the rear jet the order came too late
the rear f releases its willy peter canisters
they plummet to the island
the willy peter canisters land detonating on impact in a monstrous the awesome concussion knocks goodspeed off the new industries building pier into the bay
goodspeed concussed in the water tries to keep consciousness
another form appears above him
its mason swimming for goodspeed
mason gets under his arms and pulls him up
mason drags goodspeed ashore
sanchez director womack and the f
technicians stare out the window at alcatraz enshrouded in plumes of smoke
only carla weeping quietly in the corner
sanchez puts his arm around her
ushers her away
suddenly a voice crackles pier come in

director womack grabs the mike
goodspeed this is director womack

a long warm embrace
a jeep motors up the freeway
passing a sign vancouver miles
