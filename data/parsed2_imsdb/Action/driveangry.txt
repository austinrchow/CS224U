written by todd farmer patrick lussier march half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station make up the central hub of laughter colorado
shed be a ghost town a cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages ago and baled
the buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea how long ago this place went dry
suddenly an old chevy rips around the corner wheels sending plumes of dust skyward
three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab
fucking driver looks as though he may piss himself
fucking middle twists around glares through the back glass and fucking passenger white knuckles a tire iron
goddamned old man
i thought he was dead
she said he was dead
i dont see him
i think we lost him
they race through the dusty derelict little town peeling for the main road in the distance when they round a corner to face a a plymouth roadrunner beat to shit
speeding head on
this aint chicken because these three fuckers dont even have time to react before athe old mana shock of white hair drives the roadrunner locks the tires and spins the
the roadrunner fishtails slides sideways at them
the trucks gonna ram the drivers side
at least it would milton aims a shotgun through the drivers side window
the shot blooms right at us
then slows to near frozen hanging in mid air suspended like we could touch it title card appears then the shot bursts through the title
shattering the words right at us
exploding into the hood of the chevy
the hood rips up slams the windshield
truck careens out of control
milton guns the roadrunner away from truck
kraack the truck nails the roadrunners rear quarter panel
roadrunner and truck go into a spin
a tornado of dust swirls around the two vehicles
the roadrunner splinters into a boarded store front
the truck hits a ditch and upends
slams into the dirt on its roof wheels spinning
smoke hisses from the totalled roadrunner
door creeks open
milton emerges slow and sure
he crosses toward the chevy
fucking passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes milton tire iron held high over his head
milton spins and kuh foom
blows fucking passengers hand clean off
passenger screams as milton snatches the iron out of the air and slams it across his face
milton stoops removes passengers wallet digs the cash out
fucking driver scrambles from behind the wheel springs to his feet and runs
milton spins blows his knee apart from paces
driver screams and face firsts the cracked pavement
as fucking middle drags himself from the passenger side
he got the worst of it
looks like his face went through the windshield
he looks up into the barrel of miltons shotgun
ill never tell you where theyve taken her
the explosion vaporizes whats left of his face
as he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece of cartilage
he falls writhes on the ground
he looks up at milton standing over him
you took my leg you fuck
milton presses the shotgun barrel into the mans good knee
where is she
suddenly fucking passenger flattened by the tire iron sits up dazed
spots the iron
goes for it
milton spins and kafoom
blows fucking passenger to hell
i dont know where exactly
they call it wolf deer run thats all i know
milton digs drivers cell phone out
stares at it for a moment drops it finds wallet takes cash
but youre too late
you gotta know that
next full moon shes dead
nothing you can do
shes dead and hell will walk the earth milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the mans mouth breaking a couple teeth in the process
milton hisses his throat dry like a man who hasnt quenched his thirst in a decade
you tell him im coming
you got that
im coming to get her back
you tell him
tell him im gonna kill every last one of you fuckers
milton turns on his heels
walks into the dust and doesnt look back
black smoke billows from the bbq of this shithole diner
its the only building as far as the eye can see
the lot dotted with vehicles past their prime
a muscle bound a gto stands out
covered in a thick layer of cooking grease this is one of those diners where white trash goes to die
half a dozen patrons sit at bar and booth as a young american indian couple mary and dale enter with their children and
two waitresses piper and normajean stand at the kitchen pick up window
through which we can see the joints owner fat lou dripping sweat into a pile of scrambled eggs
fat lou is fat
holy fuck fat
so i tell him i says afrank thats it
no more free milk
you gonna have to buy the cow you son of a bitch
but youre not fat piper wha

hes got to marry me
im sayin i cut him off
you cut him off

and i told him if i see that big ol dick of his anywhere near my face im gonna bite it in half
normajean giggles with embarrassment
you said that
how longs it been
well its only been two days but thats like a decade in horny fucker years
so he bought you a diamond
if frank had money for a diamond i would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shithole life in the rear view
but he did get down on his knees and ask me to be his bride
normajean grabs piper in a great big hug
something yellow peppers them both
the girls look up as fat lou slams two plates of food into the window
did you just throw scrambled eggs at us
i dont pay you bitches to stand around
now get the fuck back to work
piper snatches one of the plates
she delivers it to a patron sitting at the bar then turns toward the newly arrived customers
the american indian couple scans a menu
and milton the old guy from our opening scans her
he quickly looks down at an unfolded map of colorado as normajean steps up to milton
hello beautiful coffee
thatd be great
tell me stillwater marsh around here
doesnt ring a bell
ill get that coffee
but milton makes eye contact with mary the indian mother
she quickly looks away
she knows something
milton opens his mouth to speak as piper approaches the american indian couple
hi guys im piper
can i bring you something to drink
well take this
mary points to the menu piper leans in reads
ashes a brickhousea breakfast
ten monster flapjacks for
and five waters
and what can i get for
father averts his eyes
just the pancakes
if thats okay
piper stares at them as if for the first time
coming right up
piper shoots milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen
milton rises slightly
hes clearly trying to get marys attention
shes ignoring him
piper calls through the window to fat lou
she turns and stops suddenly
stares at a pile of muffins kept fresh within a glass cake stand
mary can no longer avoid miltons stare
you know it
dale the father keeps his back to milton as he speaks
youre in the wrong state
and what state should i be in
dale turns glares at milton
catch the and cut across
its a two day drive from here
and wolf deer run
never heard of it
the year old little girls eyes brighten
yes you have daddy
wolf deer run thats where the smiling man takes the wicked children to see the mother of all things
mary shushes her little girl and pulls her close
mother of all things that sounds very interesting
oh it is
the mother of all things bleeds black tears unto those who mother places her hand over her daughters mouth
just a story parents tell to their children
like the boogey man or the tooth fairy
a plate filled with muffins thumps down before them
piper leans in with three kiddie cups
and three milks
but we didnt order whispers on the house
she winks and moves away
eyeing the kitchen window
she doesnt notice
staring at her again
an impressed smirk on his face
suddenly normajean steps in front of him
so arent you gonna ask what time my shift ends
full moon tonight
im always a little a randy during full moon
full moons three days off
she touches his hand you sure a bout that sweetie
looks outside hell of a ride out there
glances at piper hers
sure but if youre lookin for a ride
and would you be gentle
lifes too short for that sweetie
piper enters with two dirty plates scrapes them and drops them into a soapy sink
she turns right into
he glares down at her
jesus lou back the fuck off
aon the housea
on the fucking house
we gotta toss them muffins out today anyway
she sidesteps him exits the kitchen
as piper crosses toward the bar lou grabs her from behind spins her around
get your hand off of me
his fat fingers tighten around her shoulder
you get over there and you charge them for those muff
like a snake
her hand reaches beneath the fat of his belly and vice grips his balls
hell we even hear the crunch
fat lou gasps and doubles over allowing piper to slam her forehead into the bridge of his nose
i told you you fat fuck son of a bitch never to touch me again
his nose seeps blood
she slaps him across the face with her free hand
she takes a step backwards but keeps her hand clamped to his nuts
he has no choice but follow
she pulls him up to the american indian family
we see it in her face
lous eyes go wide
hes about to pass out
are on the house
she lets go
lou drops to his knees then timbers to the floor as piper turns to the family
the children are huddled terrified against their parents
im sorry your kids had to see that
put some honey butter on those bran muffins and they taste an awful lot better
piper turns and crosses toward the door
normajean is pale as she watches her go
piper brushes past miltons booth
his cup is there but milton is gone
were close on a car door as it slams
close on glass pack exhaust pipes as the car rumbles with life
an ai brake for pussya bumper sticker stands out
the back glass vibrates as music blares from within
pipers french manicured hand wraps the floor mounted gear shift like a cock and slams it into drive
with piper behind the wheel the gto tears onto the highway
and blows passed milton as he walks west duffle bag thrown over his shoulder
she grips the wheel
the rpms drop
the gto pulls off the road
white smoke hisses from beneath the hood
close on engine as the hood pops
piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours her
its clear she dont know jack shit about engines
piper slips the keys between her fingers
milton appears through the smoke
its the way he said it
milton glances at the engine
oh thats not so bad
i can fix that for you if you like
if you give me a lift
im only going as far as blackfoot falls
the truckstop there
and id be much obliged
milton leans in flicks something then rises and thumps the hood shut with a smile
piper behind the wheel focuses on the road
milton sits in the passenger seat hugs his duffle bag glances at piper
suddenly piper turns on him
get it straight old man
i aint sleeping with you
darlin my days of bedding a gal ten minutes after i meet her are over
well thats good to hear
for now anyway
several big rigs are parked near the truck stop
a few derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel
pipers gto pulls in and parks near the road
piper climbs out
milton rises stiffly and crosses toward her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder
he offers his hand gives her a smile
a preciate the ride maam
milton crosses toward an old superman style phone booth
piper inserts her key glances back at milton
hes in the booth now his back to her
piper turns the key and opens the door
first thing we see is monas naked ass and back
long red hair she is riding a naked frank
neither realizes piper has opened the door
oh frank you know how long ive wanted to feel you inside me
oh you want it faster
mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster
suddenly pipers hand clinches a handful of red hair and yanks
mona screams in pain frank yelps in fear as piper drags mona backwards off the bed
piper drags mona kicking and screaming into the lot then drops her and whirls toward the room where frank struggles desperate to find his pants
whats the matter with you
you psycho bitch from
piper spins on mona points a finger in warning
it shuts mona up
piper storms back toward the room
frank hops with one leg in his jeans
he sees her coming
although hes a big fella he looks scared
suddenly mona steps in front of piper and slaps her across the face
fuck you piper were in lo piper clocks mona
mona stands there
what was that
i didnt catch that last word
were in lo this time mona stumbles backwards and crashes into a metal chair on the motel porch
piper brushes passed her
piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes
now baby just hold on
im warning you frank

look sooner you accept this is your fault the better
piper stops turns stares
baby i cant just turn it off
now you know that
i gotta have it
at least once a day
its in the wiring
you did this
you made me cheat on you
youre lucky im not more pissed about it
piper stares for a moment
its like shes been sucker punched
then she zips her bag and crosses to the door
now cut it out
enough with the drama
milton watches pipers room
its clear the phone to his ear is a fake out
suddenly a look crosses his face
he jerks around
a grimy looking grease monkey is staring at milton cell phone to his ear
he sees milton see him quickly backs into the shadows
piper exits glances at mona sprawled out unconscious in the metal chair an asian man in a hawaiian shirt snaps pictures of her
piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall where it shatters
piper stomps across the lot as frank exits calls to her
now hold on
can we talk about this
piper keeps walking
never looks back
piper stop this
you got nowhere to go and you know it
ill go to san francisco and stay with my cousin
you aint taking my car
piper pulls out the keys twirls them on her finger
i said you aint taking my car bitch
frank grabs her by the shoulder
piper spins and punches him in the face
caught off guard frank stumbles nearly goes down
whos been making the payments you out of work skanky mona fucking piece of shit
she drops the gym bag and launches into him
a blur of fists and claws
the tears flow
heartbreak anger humiliation
frank stumble backwards
tries to block the blows
she swings but this time frank lashes out
he punches her in the face
she drops to her hands and knees
when she looks up her teeth are caked in blood
youre insane you know that
look what you made me do
she staggers to her feet sways before him
come on ill get you some ice she spits blood in his face and swings
he blocks the blow and backhands her with the force of thunder
she spins and slams into the ground
doubtful shell get up this time then frank stares as piper rolls over
im gonna tell everybody what i caught you doing with my pink dildo
her laughter becomes a hysterical fit
he drops on top of her his fingers curl into a fist
you dont wanna fuck me
when im done nobodys gonna wanna fuck you
go to hell
frank raises his fist into the air
frank looks up as a boot catches him under the chin lifting him off piper
piper stares through blurry eyes as milton drops on top of frank pounding him with his fists
the sun is a glow to the west
the horizon dances and shimmers
someone is out there
walking toward us
as if they appeared within the heat
we start close to the ground
least he sure as shit looks like an accountant in blue suit and purple power tie
not especially large
nice looking face
something trustworthy about him
he loosens his tie slips his jacket off and tosses it over his shoulder
theres a bounce in his step
normajean looks up as the accountant enters
have a seat sweetie
mary there will be right with you
indian mother mary turns
she stops in her tracks
stares at the accountant
he winks at her
a shiver runs through mother mary
she backs away then rushes from the diner
fat lou leans from the kitchen window
wheres she going
the accountant turns to lou
what did you call me
the accountant smiles
fat lou vanishes from the window then bursts from the kitchen
i said what did you call i called you a fat fuck and we had better leave it at that unless youd prefer i call you a dead fat fuck
im looking for someone
an old man
the accountant smells the air embraces it
he was here earlier
likely on foot
who are you
im the accountant
thats supposed to mean something to me
it will if i add you to the books
and if you dont tell me what i want to know
normajean opens her mouth to speak
the accountant turns to her quickly
so quickly she takes a step back
you had something to say
he was here
weve established that
im sure he was
where did he go
the gto thunders past
piper is curled up in a fetal position in the big back seat
she sits up slowly
her eyes are blackened
but clearly milton has cleaned her up
she props herself on an elbow looks at the jacket covering her
milton is driving
he gazes out the window
up to the sky
the moon hangs a few days from full
piper slides over the seat drags miltons jacket with her then slips into it wrapping herself as if cold
want me to roll the window up
you didnt kill him did you
no but hell likely piss blood for a day or two
thanks for that
he gestures through the windshield as they pass a awelcome to utaha sign
beyond there are lights ahead
you mentioned san francisco

can you get me that far
im looking for someone
you hungry or not
piper considers for a moment then yeah
i could eat
youre piper right
you try to kill me and dump me in the desert ill cut your nuts off
pool tables old pin ball machines and an odd mix of bikers cowboys and the sluts who love them
piper and milton slide into a booth
piper eyes a latino busboy nice biceps jeans too tight
roy a greasy fella in his fifties approaches big happy looking fucker owns the joint
greetings folks welcome to the bull by the balls
stares at milton mouth agape
roy doesnt even try to hide his dislike of milton
thought you were dead
you hoped i was dead

milton eyes a door marked amotel guestsa

but be gone by dawn
with roy turns his back on them and walks away
what was that all about
back in another life i used to drive a truck through these parts
and youd spend the night here
id spend the night here fucking his wife
suddenly milton twists around stares toward the bar
nothing i guess
a large breasted waitress fuckin hot for a woman in her fifties approaches with chips and salsa
start you off with some drinks
candy plops two pens and index cards on the table
and ill need to see your ids
piper pulls her license absently and slides it over begins filling out the card
what is this

you want a drink
you gotta be a member
welcome to utah mr
she takes his license

milton watches her go
drinking her up

jeez milton how longs it been
sounds like you used to stick it in anything with a crack
ive been distracted
but nobody reaches the end and says awish i hadnt fucked so much
a miltons gaze returns to candy
even a man as driven as he needs a reboot sometimes
candy catches his look smiles
piper slides from the booth
where are you
im gonna do my nails take a hot bath and sleep in a warm bed
what about your beer
you drink it
see you at dawn
but she walks right passed the amotel guestsa door and approaches the busboy whos already eyeing her
as she does our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back of the bar
jonah king steps into the light
ruggedly good looking
he wears a necklace with something bulky hidden beneath his shirt
theres an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor
he glances at milton then its roy isnt it
roy spins from the bar smiles a friendly smile
get you a drink friend
fantastic place you have here
you dont happen to rent it out for parties do you
we sure do
you planing a party
again jonah glances at milton

the television chatters away with local nightly news
frank ignores it paces on the phone
as he does we see jonah kings face on the tv
the same guy from the bar
archive footage of him preaching warm friendly

frank clicks his phone shut jerks the door open to find the accountant smiling at him
there was an old man yes
the accountant sniffs the air
angry with attitude
sumbitch kicked me in the face
who are you

i called the cops not a bean counter
the old man
where did he go
fuck should i know where he went
i woke up and all three were gone
the bitch the old man and my car
what kind of car

you aint no cop
im done talking
frank starts to close the door but the accountant grabs his wrist twists him around and shoves him into the room
frank doesnt stumble forward
lifted off the ground his toes drag the floor frank slams into the opposite wall and bounces into the dresser
you son of a frank staggers to his feet
he wipes blood onto the back of his hand
you made me bleed
frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser
you leave me no choice but to beat you with this louisville slugger
frank takes a step swings at the accountant
the accountant dodges
bat smashes down on the tv
sparks glass fly
the accountant stomps on the bat snaps it in two
slomo the short end rips from franks hands knocks him backwards
the piece spins in the air for a second hangs there until
the accountant snatches it letting his follow through gather momentum
frank can only watch as the accountant
the tip strikes frank in the shoulder with such force it impales him up to the knob
drives him backwards where it embeds into the wall
the accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat tosses it from hand to hand with a loud slap of flesh on wood
what kind of car
what kind is it
frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder
what did you do
the accountant reaches out and twists the bat
frank screams out in pain
answer the question
a a gto
the accountant turns and walks toward the door
stops to eye a framed photo of piper and frank on the dresser
just hold on
the accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat
its coming right at his face
frank tries to dodge
twists his head
the other end of the broken bat rams through his face pins his head to the wall
the words louisville slugger just visible where franks face should be
the accountant exits as two state troopers approach their vehicle parked behind them
you called about a stolen car
the accountant gestures over his shoulder
trooper moves toward the opened door
the accountant steps in front of trooper
im looking for someone
driving a a gto
hes traveling with her
he hands trooper the framed photo
the accountant pulls a shiny ancient coin worn from being worried over the years from his pocket
he tosses it the coin catching the light glinting madly
trooper stares at it
cant seem to take his eyes off it
trooper s eyes widen as he stares into franks room
he pulls his gun
points it at the accountant
keep your hands where i can see them
troopers this is your lucky day
trooper is watching the hypnotic glinting coin
angle high looking down on the trio as the coin spins right in front of us we glimpse the ancient face in the worn silver roman maybe
show us your hands asshole
to his partner whats the matter with you
draw your weapon
trooper slowly reaches for his gun until
the accountant snatches the coin from the sky thrusts it at the two cops
look at this
they dont see a coin
but a badge
youre a fed
in pursuit of a white haired man
hes travelling with the girl in this picture
trooper fixes his eyes on the photo of piper frank in his partners hand
lowers his weapon
but that guy in the room
id say its unfortunate but id be lying
world wont miss him
i need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive
if we we three can apprehend him
you are ambitious correct
yes we are
wasnt actually a question
i can tell you are
success will mean promotion
i guarantee it
now we are going to hunt this milton we are going to find the gto hes driving and when we find him you will shoot to kill
the accountants voice is velvet
promising glory with a hint of damnation
thats against protocol
this man is highly dangerous
he has killed and will kill again
he must be taken down on sight
the time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life
the accountant crosses to the cruisers back door the coin disappearing back into his pocket
were staring into two motel rooms
the wall that divides the rooms
divides the screen
the beds in each room butted up against the dividing wall
on one side we see piper on her back
at her feet on his knees and completely naked the busboy
hes painting her toenails
on the other side we see milton on his back
candy riding him like a fucking big tittied stallion
candy is a screamer
the busboy looks up timidly
uh are we gonna do it
well i dont know baby
depends on how well you do those nails
now pay attention
you might need to redo that one
he hunches over and gets back to work
as piper ties her hair up with a pink bandanna
candys sex screams are starting to annoy the fuck out of her
she twists around with frustration and pounds the wall
shut the fuck up in there
milton twist and pounds the wall right back
you shut the fuck up
piper swings her legs off of the bed
busboy wasnt prepared and topples backwards to the floor
sorry i didnt mean
someone stepped quickly away from the window
piper bursts into the room ready to kick ass and take names
the place is
food still on the plates
beer in the mugs
the tv over the bar is still on
we see footage of a nevada amber alert
ababy tabitha still missinga a photo of a baby in pink onesie
then appearing beside it
the photo of jonah king
issued an all points bulletin for jonah kings immediate detention in connection with the murder of a young married couple in loveland colorado
their infant girl is believed to have been abducted by this religious sect
a nation wide amber alert is now in full effect
piper stares at the tv for a moment then scans the bar
what the fuck
she eyes the exit sign where an assortment of athletic equipment hangs from the wall
piper exits with a hockey stick
a few cars are left in the lot
a black chevy van with flames stands out parked in front of a barn storage building
piper crosses to a window in the bar motel
busboy sits on pipers bed
he holds her nail polish to his nose
jerks his head back
piper spins grips the hockey stick
the cars are empty
the barn looks undistur
a light glows within the barn bleeding through the wood slats
barn door slowly swings open
revealing three silhouettes backlit by a hanging lamp
one holds a shovel
the other heaves an ax over his shoulder
the third holds a shotgun
the side door on the flamed van slides open
two silhouettes step out
baseball bat and machete
piper spins as three dark figures appear around the side of the bar motel
sledge hammer iron pipe sickle
all seven begin walking toward her
piper rushes back inside
piper turns toward the door marked amotel guestsa then hesitates
instead she dives under a booth table
the back door opens
beat up sneakers
cowboy boots with a duct tape patch
a door opens
piper sucks in breath
more legs appear
shadows approach the desk counter near the amotel guestsa door
theres an open guest book on the counter top
as a weathered hand comes into view
a finger traces down to the last two entries
piper lee rm john milton rm candys still on top
she is as we say in the fuck industry aclosea
suddenly miltons head jerks toward the door
his hand shoots beneath his pillow as the door bursts open
man with an iron pipe held high rushes into the room
milton comes up with a hand cannon
iron pipe is blown backwards into man with machete
milton thrusts upright suddenly candy finds herself beneath him as machete heaves iron pipe to the side and rushes toward milton as kafoom
hes blown off his feet
the window shatters as a man with baseball bat dives hits rolls and comes up swinging
milton snakes an arm beneath candy and rolls from the bed with her
as they fall the bat slams onto the mattress just missing them as
milton turns baseball bats head into a canoe
milton on bottom again as they crash to the floor still intertwined
the door adjoining milton and pipers room explodes open at his feet
man with axe and man with shotgun enter
milton presses candys face into his chest twisting his body to shield her as his thunders twice
shotguns eye vaporizes in a mist
he drops to his knees
man with axe clutches his throat
turns and flees back into the adjoining room as the bathroom door flies open
staring under the bed cowboy boots with duct tape patch appears
shells drop to dirty carpet
milton rolls candy over still connected
fumbles in his bag on the floor
cowboy with sledge hammer freezes at the carnage
cant see milton
because hes hidden by the bed
you know you cant stop whats comin that little girls as good as dead
two bullets slide into the
chamber snicks shut
milton aims under the bed
half the mans foot is blown to hell
he hops then crashes to the floor
he and milton make eye contact beneath the bed
a nanosecond before sledge hammers forehead implodes
milton rolls candy beneath him again and raises his head just in time to see
man with sickle enter
he stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at milton
the glare becomes fear
miltons already aiming the then sickle smiles raises the bladed weapon and the top of his head spatters blood as a hockey stick crashes down from above and behind
sickle drops to the floor revealing piper white knuckling the hockey stick
her face pale
apparently i shot my wad
milton stares down into candys face
her whole body quakes
she sucks in breath and opens her eyes
youre the best fuck ive ever had
piper crosses to the adjoining room
do you mind
candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings
she screams wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room
man with axe is lying face down in his own blood
but its busboy who draws pipers attention
lying beneath blood drenched white sheets
he never saw it coming
milton in pants pulls his shirt on rolls man with shotguns face with his boot
i definitely got their attention
you know these people
milton flings his duffle over his shoulder
there are probably more
jonah king slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked sedan
he pops the trunk and grabs a gym bag
as he crosses toward the drivers side door
the gym bag starts to cry
dont cry little precious
two doors shut
jonah king turns freezes
our two state troopers stand near their parked cruiser staring from jonah to the crying gym bag
for a cop this is that one in a life time event
a career maker
then the cruisers back door opens
the accountant steps out
he ignores jonah king and the crying gym bag
remember why were here
he walks by them towards the front door of the bar
both troopers turn and move around the side of building
stunned he absentmindedly scratches at the old scar on his face then leaps into the sedan with the gym bag engine roars to life
milton and piper exit into the back lot
milton im serious
i want some answers
they turn as the speeding sedan tears onto the highway
as it disappears behind the barn it reveals man with shovel
he flings the barn doors open stares at milton and piper for a moment then vanishes within
yeah we both want some answers
milton moves toward the barn as the state troopers walk around the bar
the troopers stare from piper to milton then back to piper
milton grabs piper places himself between she and the troopers as they go for their guns
milton pulls the and opens fire
the troopers emboldened and fearless stand their ground and shoot back
milton staggers clutches his side
a crimson spot spreads across his belly
piper tries to catch him as he stumbles falls to one knee his duffle tumbles to the ground clothes spilling from within
the troopers keep firing
piper stares down at miltons open duffle
theres a gun lying within the spilled clothes
an ancient six shooter
we get just a glimpse but we can tell this isnt just any old gun
theres detailed inscriptions scrawled into the metal
the steel of it is thick tarnished and somehow angry
she reaches for it
not that one
he shoves the toward her
piper snatches it without hesitation rises and trooper s chest explodes
the force spins him
he shoots trooper in the ear
both men crash to the ground
the barn doors explode outward as a big dodge truck powers toward the highway man with shovel behind the wheel
piper turns to find milton struggling toward the gto
what are you doing
have to stop him
those cops werent trying to arrest us
milton climbs behind the gtos wheel
you gotta patch me up
piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat
the car rumbles to life
they were trying to kill us
they were trying to kill you
milton floors it
as the gto fishtails toward the highway the accountant steps from the back door of the bar
hunter and hunted glare
pipers attention is still on the dead cops
christ is right
they start shooting with no warning
what are you a murderer
you escape from prison or something
the gto tears onto the highway
the accountant just stands there
fading into the darkness
which is it
piper raises the gun points it at milton
what have you gotten me into
jesus i just killed a cop
im going to prison
give me one good reason i shouldnt shoot you in the face
because im driving
you know what i mean
milton gestures through the windshield toward the distant brake lights ahead
they took my grand baby
took my grand baby and killed my
he breaks off
we see the lighted amber alert sign come into view and quickly blur passed
piper stares at milton
the little girl on the news
the baby girl theyre looking for
but the news said the babys parents were
miltons eyes glisten
he speaks in a whisper
sons of bitches killed my daughter
milton steadies himself
i busted out
and im gonna get my grand baby back
im gonna get her back and im gonna kill every last one of the fuckers
you want out ill understand
piper considers then they both slam into their seats as the gto is rear ended
its the troopers cruiser
the accountant face blank sits behind the wheel
milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails
he mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin
in the back seat
piper scrambles into the back seat as milton watches the cruiser pull up along side him
its already loaded
piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the front seat
have the other one ready
the old one
the cruiser pulls up and matches the gtos speed
after a beat the accountant turns and smiles at milton
milton smiles back lifts the shotgun shoves the barrel through the passenger window
the cruisers drivers side window explodes
the accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder
when he looks back at milton its with a face of arrogance
a cat toying with a three legged mouse
he pulls the cruiser next to milton
matches the gtos speed
its over milton
stop the car
i cant do that
what makes you think you have a choice
i got something i gotta do first
then you should have done it a long time ago
i didnt have to do it a long time ago
milton i will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you
i wont let you do that
what makes you think you have a choice
piper hands milton the ancient six shooter
milton snatches it points it across the gap between cars pulls back the hammer with a thunderous
the accountants eyes widen
its as if god tripped fell and the entire earth shook as a result
the recoil nearly rips miltons arm off
we travel with the slug fire trailing it as it slomos toward the accountant
his eyes continuing to widen
the muscles in his face contracting
the accountant cuts the wheel
he wracks his head around as the slug just kisses his cheek
the cruiser slams into the guard rail
the back end rockets forward as the cruiser goes into a spin
the gto fishtails away
milton fights with the wheel as the cruiser bucks up and over the guard rail
the cruiser spins like a top helicopters out over the nothingness and plummets to the dry valley below
and flattens sending out a dusty shockwave in all directions
milton manages to stop the gto before it slams into the rail
the gto bucks and stalls
he breathes a sigh then turns and stares in the direction theyd been going
he can just make out the fleeing cultists tail lights
the back door opens
piper leaps out
milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge
he starts the engine
piper approaches the destroyed guard rail
piper stares into the valley below
we can just make out the flattened cruiser in the light of the three quarter moon
no sign of movement
just flattened metal
hes not one of the ones who took your granddaughter is he
milton stands behind her
shakes his head
is there anyone not trying to kill you
milton stares up the road
piper considers then come on
ill help you
but were dealing with that first
she points to his blood soaked shirt
the gto thunders beneath a starry sky
the needle hovers at mph
piper behind the wheel
milton shirtless his stomach wrapped in homemade bandages grabs his shotgun reloads
my daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college
she knew him
she knew jonah king the man they think killed
she stops herself
she knew him
the world was in a fuckin tailspin and king was preaching quiet revolution
he places the shotgun on the dash grabs the
it was four months before she realized a quiet meant hiding in the basement cutting the heads off chickens
jonah king was into voodoo
milton reloads the slowly methodically
voodoo the occult not much he wasnt into
when she told him she was leaving he helped her pack
gassed up her car
cooked her a hot meal
then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron
she twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands
she learned her lessen
was a good little follower for eighteen months
thats when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in chinatown
it was chinese new year so the place was wall to wall slants
she saw her chance stabbed jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd
your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didnt know
why didnt you help her
milton grabs the ancient six shooter
its got real weight
his blood stained fingers run down the scrolled steel
the gun almost seems alive
pops the chamber
i didnt find out about any of this until
until i got locked up
only two bullets left
he snaps the gun shut
shoves it into his duffle
not gonna reload
only had three bullets to begin
and road flares
theres been an accident
milton eases the shotgun into his lap
several vehicles and an rv block the road
the passengers scramble back and forth
theres a jack knifed flatbed a crumpled station wagon and the cultists dodge truck is overturned on the shoulder
thats his truck
i wont be long
milton climbs from the gto and crosses toward the overturned dodge
he lets the shotgun dangle at his side keeping it hidden behind him
tattooed guy and skanky gal stand near the rv with man in leather jacket
business woman paces on her cell phone
milton glances at man with wig sitting in the drivers seat of his station wagon his face in his hands
lady in leopardskin hotpants kneels beside him
in the passenger seat burly dudes on his phone
theres a couple near the overturned dodge
truck driving woman gazes into the upsidedown cab
thin old man rises and nods as milton approaches
i think hes gonna be okay
is that right
in a swift move milton ratchets a shell into the chamber drops to one knee aims into the cab
the cab is empty
somewhere near we hear a muffled babys cry
but its too late
a snub nosed
appears at his temple
milton rises slowly and takes in the situation
tattooed guy comes up fast behind the gto
we get a good look at him
its man with shovel
pipers getting out doesnt see tattooed guy until hes grabbed her
presses the pistol in her ribs
let me go fucker
she goes to fight but man in leather jacket approaches her with an axe
burly dude is with him
to thin old man let her go
shes a pain in the ass you dont want
milton still hasnt let go of his shotgun
or well gut her
to emphasize the point truck driving woman pulls a rambo knife from her purse and smiles a missing toothed smile
milton drops the shotgun as man with wig steps from his car with a scoped hunting rifle
lady in leopardskin rises revealing a baseball bat with nails and spikes protruding from the end
skanky gal and business woman open the rvs door
jonah king steps from within then smiles down at milton
he cradles a baby in his arms
milton isnt it
why are you here
why are you making such a fuss
isnt that obvious you sick fuck
im here for her
milton gestures toward the baby
whats obvious is that you clearly abandoned your daughter
jonah king contd crushed her so completely that she told everyone you were dead
no milton i cannot in good faith hand over this child to you
but sacrificing her under the full fuckin moon thats okay
milton your granddaughter is unbelievably blessed
the worlds on fire
companies own our governments and the people suffer
and will continue to suffer until change comes
and change will come
thanks to your granddaughter milton
she will open the door to a new world order
your bs dont work on me
you killed my daughter but i wont let you kill my grandbaby
your daughters death was an accident
no shithead it wasnt
i saw the whole damn thing
i saw who you are when no ones lookin
and i saw what that night cost ya
jonahs armor cracks a little as milton faces the others
milton youre embarrassing your to the crowd what was it three or four days before he showed after killin my little girl
you jerkoffs didnt notice he was walking a little stiff
milton glances at skanky gal and business woman
whens the last time he shared a bed with either of you
before that night right
the girls shoot a nervous glance at jonah
you forced my daughter onto her knees you sonofabitch
and she made you pay for it
jonah stares at milton in shock
how does he know
but dont take my word for it
leather jacket was there
jonah made him swear not to tell
jonah lifts a
auto from within the babys blanket and shoots leather jacket in the forehead
the baby starts crying
jonah shoves the baby into skanky gals arms then swings the gun toward milton
put the blonde in the rv
tattooed guy shoves piper toward the rv as skanky and business woman climb in with the baby
jonah aims the gun at miltons face
im only gonna make this offer once
give me my granddaughter and ill let you liv he shoots milton in the left eye
miltons head snaps he falls to the ground on his back
tattooed guy shoves piper into the rv
skanky tries to calm the crying baby
tattoo shoves piper onto the travel couch then hands the gun to business woman
jonah climbs into the rv closes the door
you killed him
you bastard you pipers head rocks back as business woman pistol whips her
next time i shoot that mouth right off your face
jonah gazes out the window as the rv pulls away pipers sobs rising behind him
miltons body lays there
his one eye staring skyward
void of life as the rv pulls away leaving the cluster of cars the wreck and body of milton behind
man with wig pops the back of the station wagon
truck driving woman and thin old man lean in snatch two shovels
burly dude drags leather jackets body next to miltons as the others join him
they gaze down at milton his one eye open and unseeing
a single tear runs from it
the other pools blood where the bullet entered
did they just see that right
the bullet rips burlys scalp wide
he stumbles back
the others recoil
burly roars blood streaming from his head wound charges milton with the ax
milton unleashes rapid fire lead from the
burlys blown back
the others scatter as milton staggers to his feet
he grabs the shotgun leans on it for support
as milton stumbles to the open passenger door
man with wig comes from the back of the station wagon with the scoped hunting rifle
blam his shot rips into the gto blows the side mirror off
milton fires back with the shotgun forcing man with wig back behind the wagon
milton falls heavily across the front seats
ties pipers bandanna around his head covers his now gaping eye
man with wig hasnt had enough yet
he aims the rifle
moves into the road
cant see milton in the car but that doesnt matter
he knows hes there
the windshield shatters
glass splinters down on milton
he reaches for the keys
the cultists jump at the sound of the gtos glass packs
dust rips skyward as the gto barrels toward them
they scramble clawing at one another to get out of the way
all except man with wig
hes playin hero lines milton in his sights
but what he sees shakes him to his core
milton face bloody and twisted with rage
man with wig screams falls tries to roll out of the way
the wheels pound over both of his legs shattering them
milton flips open the as he fishtails the gto back onto the highway
he dangles the out the window
empty shells dance onto the blacktop several skitter down onto the cracked earth and os
angle moving fast the gtos wheels consume the frame
a bicycle tire skids to a stop before us
then a second
two teenagers sit on beat to shit mountain bikes staring
the cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof both doors shut
no windows visible
teen lights a chillum pipe inhales
holds it passes the pipe then speaks as only a pothead can
think anyones in there
inhales holds passes i guess
doors is still closed
inhales holds bet its sick
the drivers side door launches right at us
nails teen in the chest knocking him ten feet backwards where he skids on his back
the accountant rolls from the cruiser stands brushes himself off as he strides forward
carpenter and despite what youve heard prefers short hair
teen sits up suddenly coughing
you nearly killed me
not even close
i wont see you again until
he tilts his head as if reading a sign too far away
until youre seventy three
he glances at teen then you ill see in three months
and with that the accountant turns and strides away
the rv rumbles past running faster than an rv should
jonah glances through the back window
a rapidly growing black blotch on the road
in seconds that blotch reveals itself as the gto ripping up the highway gaining fast
the baby screams in the background
when jonah speaks
it is with wonder
look at this
hes still coming
whos still coming
the old man
piper tries to stand
business woman backhands her
you shot him in the face
he cant dont you see
we stand at the crossroads
did you think we would just idly change the world
the forces of evil challenge us
this is wonderful
we show ourselves to be worthy
im so very proud of each one of you
tattoo and business woman beam
skanky pulls her tit out shoves it in the babys face
the kid goes quiet as the back glass shatters
milton leans out the drivers side with the shotgun in his left hand his one good eye squinting as he fires at the rv
he ratchets another shell into the chamber takes aim then
the front end of a fast approaching vehicle
miltons head snaps back as a corvette slams into the back of the gto
lady in leopardskin behind the wheel her eyes insane
behind the corvette we see a a lincoln thin old man driving
truck driving woman in a a viper
milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside
struggles to keep the big gto on the road
distracted by the newcomers
we see what milton does not
the rv pulls off the road to the left
milton looks up just as he passes the turn off
he slams on his brakes
leopardskins eyes go wide
survival kicks in
she jerks the wheel
the corvette slams into the side of the viper
the lincoln cuts hard right
all three cars shoot pass the gto
milton cuts the wheel left and floors it
piper watches as the bucking rv forces jonah and business woman to turn their backs on her
piper leaps from the couch rushes up behind and shoves them toward the shattered back window
jonah snatches a cabinet drops his gun
it slides beneath the foldout bed
but business woman hits the giant opening and flips up and out of the rv
milton looks up as business woman slams into the ground and tumbles just out of his path
she sits up
what doesnt explode from the force kuh thumps as the gto bucks over her body
milton grits through the pain
a bloody angry smile
jonah stares out the back glass in shock
i am patient and forgiving but that was wrong of you
he turns to her
im going to kill you now
and then im going to rape your corpse
so that in the afterlife you might consider your sin this day
piper cracks her knuckles
between now and then
ima fuck you up
he takes a step and swings a punch
but she leaps at his face closing the gap too quickly
her french manicure digs in
they both go down
the baby wails
skanky crawls into the cramped sleeper bunk above the driver
pulls the baby with her tucks back into the corner away from the battle in the rvs cabin
milton is gaining when the back glass shatters
truck driving woman gains on milton in her viper
shes being blanketed in dust
she fires a
the radio and dash explode
son of a bitch
milton snatches the points it out the back glass and opens fire
miltons pov a white dot spider webs the vipers windshield left
the windshield suddenly turns red from the inside as a dot appears in front of the driver
the viper jerks right drifts off of the dirt path
the lincoln bursts through the dust cloud behind it
thin old man leans from the drivers window fires
slugs pepper the gto
milton spins in his seat
the rv has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop
milton floors it
piper on top jonahs face looks like he ran into a barbed wire fence
he howls in pain and manages to slip a hand around her throat
piper feels it
his fingers tighten
he shoves her away from him
she can no longer dig into his face
her arms flail
reaching for anything
her face turns red
she claws his shirt open
hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew
chinese in design
she snatches it and stabs it into jonahs shoulder twists it deeper in
gto rockets over the hill top clears the ground ten feet
the moment the gto touches down milton brakes
milton jolts the car into reverse
tires scream in protest
the gto jerks backwards
climbing toward the top of the hill in reverse when milton snaps the wheel
the gto s comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop
milton casually leans out of the drivers side window with the shotgun in hand
he points it skyward as the lincoln rockets over the hilltop
and passes directly over the top of milton
miltons one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank beneath the back of the car
milton squeezes the trigger
the back end of the lincoln explodes as the corvette rockets over the hilltop
lady in leopardskins face drops
the lincoln fireball slams into the ground before her
lady in leopardskin shields her face as she slams into the burning vehicle and spins out of control
milton kicks the car into drive jerks a and speeds off toward the rv
jonah sits up
he pulls at the corkscrew and screams
it wont budge
he glares at piper
she scans for a weapon
she snatches an umbrella from a coat rack
itll have to do
theres a machete hanging beneath it
she drops the umbrella grabs the machete
smiles at jonah
give me the baby and ill make the pain go away
suddenly everyone slams into the side of the rv
tattoo pulls the rv back onto highway
piper clings to the old stove
she watches in horror as jonahs gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed
it slides right up to him
he snatches it
piper leaps through the door
milton is gaining as piper swings out clinging to the door for dear life
piper slams into the side of the rv
she tries desperately to hold on as jonah leans through the door
gun in hand
jonah looks up
milton is driving beside them shotgun in hand barrel aimed right at jonah
but before milton can get his shot off the corvette slams into the back of the gto
blowing a hole in the side of the rv a foot to the right of jonahs head
jonah leaps back inside the rv
piper clings on for dear life but shes slipping
milton jerks the wheel
lady in leopardskin slows as miltons gto goes into a spin
theres a smile on her face
she thinks hes lost control
until the gto does a
milton now driving in reverse
his shotgun pointing through the remnants of windshield
directly at lady in leopardskin
her head goes buh bye
the corvette swerves off of the road jumps a ditch and flips thirty or forty times
she knows it
and lands on the hood of the gto
she looks up through the gtos windshield into miltons battered face
he stretches his hand out to her
piper snags it before slipping off into oblivion
piper nods crawls toward the windshield milton tries to pull her in as a horrible sound of grinding metal roars from beneath the gtos hood
the gto pulls to the side of the road
milton leaps out and stares
he can just make out jonah standing in the back window
holding his granddaughter
piper eases from the hood
she stares at her bandanna at the blood on his face
she pulls him close
looks at the back of his head
its still in there
i can feel it
how are you still alive
he stares back toward the rv
just a dot on the horizon now
aint got time to die
i tried milton
i tried to get her back
i know baby
jonah only had about twenty followers
we hurt him good today
fuckin devil worshipers freak me out
they mess with powers that should be left alone
turns my shit white
its all bullshit
ghosts ufos bigfoot thats the bullshit
the devil and demons
once those doors are opened youre fucked
milton rolls his one good eye
piper turns back to the gto
smoke hissing from the engine
what do we do now
i used to know a guy lived out this way
you got one of them portable phones
you mean a cell phone
yeah in my bag
as a hand slams into view fingers with dirt crusted nails curl
dig into the ground
man with wig crawls toward us
his busted mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and fluid stretching back to the highway
left hand hits the ground right hand digs into the dirt
he drags himself forward a few inches
hes crawling toward the station wagon
is humming wig turns squints
back lit by the early day sun
theres a bounce in his step
wig holds his hand out to the savior as the accountants smiling face becomes clear
scorcher today huh
he takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle
christ on a cracker
the accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into the shade of the station wagon where he flips him around into a sitting position
wigs shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above his left breast
whats that supposed to mean
its a symbol of our pact with lord satan
funny hes never mentioned you
wig stares down at his mangled legs
the accountant notices
yeah those are fucked
here have some water
wig takes the offered water as accountant kneels before him
miltons work i take it
ran me over with his
how do you
who are you
im the accountant
and i never get curious
what do you people want with milton
youre the who
the accountant smiles places his hand around wigs clearly shattered femur and squeezes
wigs body convulses
does it matter
why is he important to you
hes the one chasing us
searches for an answer
the accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists
wigs body stiffens and he screams
because of what we did
because of who we took
color me curious
what did you do and who did you take
the blood stained pink bandanna
the wind pushes it gently down the black asphalt
milton sits on the gtos hood
piper stands between his legs cleaning his wound
lemme know if i hurt you
do what you gotta do
you get used to the pain
piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack there are white skulls on it
she folds it ties it around miltons head
when she moves aside we see shes lined up a skull over his missing eye
milton slides from the hood steps protectively in front of piper as a banged up wrecker pulls toward them pulls to the side of the road
from this angle it looks as though an innocent old man and his granddaughter are having car trouble
from this angle we can see milton concealing the shotgun behind him
piper stands close her hand on the handle of the protruding from his waistband
as the driver steps out
stands half hidden by the door as like piper the driver has his right hand tucked behind his back wrapped around the handle of a
thought you were dead
now we get a good look at him
his names webster
an old black man as tough as milton is angry
why does everyone keep saying that
because he is dead
sure as shit supposed to be anyway
webster and milton eye one another for a long beat then i carried your coffin old man
i was there the day we put your ass in the ground
piper stares at milton
milton stares at webster
webster you gonna yank that
or just keep stroking it
hows this possible
you heard about my daughter
then you know why im back
back from where
are you two talking about
it true they took the little one
webster considers for a long beat then releases the
put her in neutral
ill pull the truck around
but piper cant tear her eyes away from milton
police tape half a dozen state and county cruisers
three meat wagons and a news van
humans buzz the scene like insects
the two dead state troopers lie where they fell
rookie stands out
young county uniform wide eyed
very busy at having no idea what he should be doing
he scans the ground
his eyes go even wider
sarge look at this
rookie squats to the ground as sarge leather skin approaches stares frowns
i see that
its less than twenty feet from the victims
and less than three feet from the ash bin
sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand
over a hundred cigarette butts salute the sky
pay attention rookie
but rookies attention has quickly ocdd elsewhere
cap an american indian man walks the crime scene
jeans cowboy boots a adumbledore dies on page a sweatshirt
his dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are all business
you cant be here
rookie rushes forward
sarge this joker cant just stomp around the crime scene
sarge catches up nods with respect to cap
sorry about that
cap looks up then stares at rookies feet
one of yours
yessir i wont let it happen again
get him out of here
cap hes green thats all
hes standing on evidence
rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings
cap kneels stares
suddenly a unformed officer leans from within the bar
we got a live one
several officers motion cap behind the bar toward an open cabinet
cap crosses to the cabinet and kneels
candy hides within
naked hugs her knees
get me a blanket
and get a medic in here
he turns to candy offers a comforting smile
youre gonna be okay now
i wont let anything happen to you
he killed them
he killed all of them
you dont understand we was fuckin
he killed them while we was fuckin
thats never happened to me before has it happened to you
cap turns to sarge who is standing near
lets get a shrink in here too
a giant barn surrounded by an army of muscle cars laid to rest on cement blocks
engines dangle from assorted winches
auto tools hang from the walls
stacks of tires a pile of carburetors
webster throws a lever
the wrecker winch lowers the gto
piper crosses to the front pops the hood
webster joins her stares at the engine
engines shot to hell
can you fix it
he leans close hands caress the engine searching
somewhere near a fire crackles
milton stands just through the barn doors stokes a fire within a gallon drum
how is this possible
he loved his daughter
lots of daddys love their daughters doesnt explain shattering reality
that one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him
off her stare like timmy yellin at lassie to go home
piper looks even more confused
you never watched
milton was a bad husband but he was a good father
used to say it was the only thing he was ever good at
then we went and got mixed up with the wrong crowd
power and money and once youre in there aint no gettin out
so to keep her safe he vanished the year before she went off to college
obviously you got out
webster glances at milton for a moment
the bastards we were workin for they were gonna kill us when the job was done
so the day before milton paidem a little visit
he went alone you see
i didnt know
i woulda gone with him but i didnt know
webster goes very quiet
being a daddy wasnt the only thing milton was good at
sumbitch was good at being a friend
the suns setting to the west
milton stands dangerously close to the fire
stares at the dancing flames
that fire makin you homesick
piper and webster approach with a six pack
milton gazes up at the moon
it isnt full but its close
the fire crackles pops
he stares at it
you know the pain and suffering aint the worse part right
thats what they tell ya what they want you to believe
but its all a big fuckin lie
nosir worst parts the goddamn video feed
webster and piper exchange a glance
it aint about the fire and brimstone
aint about your suffering
its about the suffering of them you love
cuz you see it
you see it all
in full goddamn detail
and there aint nothin you can do about it
milton chunks a x into the fire
sparks swirl into the air
fuckin son in law
he looked like one of them tree huggin piece of shits
what kind of man wears fuckin sandals
but i saw how he died
fought like a fuckin banshee
milton goes quiet
he loved that daughter of mine
loved that little baby too
he kept fightin long after he shoulda been dead
but some peoples better at killin than others
just how theyre wired
miltons finding it harder to speak
then them sons of bitches turned on my
nosir physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby girl
watchin those fuckers
im gonna killem
im gonna killem all
and then ill be done
milton finally goes silent
piper makes a noise
tears stream down her cheeks
shes trying not to sob
webster looks steely
milton i cant fix that car
but i can get you were you need to be
a huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a chevrolet nova l and a chevrolet camaro
milton and piper stare
milt if memory serves you were always partial to the nova yes
were staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we hear the glass packed rumble of the novas engine
jonah standing on the ridge top cell phone to his ear
yeah about that fella who killed all them people at the bull by the balls last night
the fella who killed two of your cops
i know where you can find him
the sun rises to the east burning off the utah dew
milton crosses to the nova
piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat
what are you doing
piper pops awake sits up
fuck are you doing
think you were gonna sneak off by yourself
go it alone
i need your help
if youre still willing
piper stares for a moment
well if id known that i would have slept in a bed
milton opens the big barn doors as piper drives the nova out into the sun light
webster approaches with a shotgun and a box of shells
mapquest says its an eight hour drive and we got twelve until midnight so we should be fine
and get this athe mother of all thingsa
ableeds black tears unto those who cut hera
take a guess whats really bleeding like a stuck pig from the marsh
black tears of oil
webster i need you to stay here
you went alone last time
im not going alone this time
pipers coming with me
you take that little girl over me
give me the fuckin shells
and the gun
milton snatches both and hands them to piper
he then quickly places an arm around websters shoulders and walks him out of earshot
piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares at the two men
they glance back at her several times
then webster nods
milton returns slides into the passenger seat
piper stares out the window as webster slips quietly into the barn
he does so reluctantly
hes not coming
hes too old
hell just slow us down
get himself killed
thats what you told him
thats what timmy told lassie isnt it
who the fuck is this timmy and lassie you two keep talking about
this aint gonna be easy piper
i need you
thats no lie
but are you sure about this
just drive the damn car
we see a awelcome to nevadaa sign as the nova thunders past
milton behind the wheel piper has her bare feet on the windshield as she loads shotgun shells into the slits on a hunting vest
i never knew him
momma said he was a drifter
i aint your daddy
fuck you if you are
milton notices something in the rear view
piper sits up stares
theres a state troopers car way back there
there are two
no lights yet but they are coming up fast
what do we do
the lights come on
we cant stop
milton mashes the peddle to the floor
milton this will never work
nobody gets away anymore
in fifteen minutes there will be choppers well be all over the news
she breaks off
her mouth drops
as the nova tops a ridge in the distance we see a police barricade
several state trooper cruisers line the roadway in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine
cruisers line the side of the road
thirty troopers are set up behind their vehicles shotguns and assault rifles in hand
cap the american indian police captain stands in front a radio to his mouth
just keep driving him to us
well do the rest
and make sure you peel off before the fireworks
he lowers the handset addresses the men
gentlemen these two killed two of our own
i know youd like them to pay
therefore when i tell you to aim for the tires what i mean is aim for their heads
are we clear
the men nod with steely determination
please aim for the tires
the barricade is approaching stupidly fast
for the first time on this adventure milton looks
just dont stop
too many of them
just keep driving
im sorry i got you into they took your granddaughter milton and now these badge wearing fuckers are trying to stop you
you crawled out of the goddamn abyss
and a few fat assed county mounties are giving you pause
your grand baby needs you
turns back to the road
you know what happens to her if they stop us
you lose the last connection you will ever have to this world
you gotta drive
a scowl crosses his face
you dont just drive
drive with the motherfuckin rage thatll take us through that motherfuckin roadblock
sarge from earlier approaches cap
he aint stopping
makes our job easier
suddenly a noise catches them off guard
they turn behind them
their eyes widen
a mack truck rumbles over the bridge approaching from behind them
its pulling mph at least
this is unexpected
the accountant is driving
piper and milton stare
what is that
cap and sarge scatter
several troopers leap or slide down into the ravine as the mack barrels though the barricade
several cruisers go airborne sailing directly at us
milton cuts the wheel hard as one of the cruisers rockets right at them
the cruisers front end hits the blacktop digs in and flips over
the nova screams beneath it
the radio antenna snaps
the accountant smiles
then cuts the wheel
the mack jackknifes
it slides sideways down the road toward the nova
theres nowhere to go
piper shoves the shotgun in his hand
he quickly shoves it out the window and
quickfires three blasts
the hydraulics line bursts
hydraulic fluid bleeds like a stuck jugular
the metal brackets holding the trailer in place
truck and flatbed separate
the back of the flatbed catches on a cruiser
the front flips around
we can just make out the accountants face
the nova rips through the opening between truck and trailer
and then blazes past the scattered and overturned cruisers and tears onto the bridge
cap staggers into the road firing at the nova
those men still near scramble toward the working vehicles as the mack skids to a stop behind them now parallel across the blacktop
drivers side angled back at the bridge
every gun in the area spins as the drivers side door opens
the accountant steps out big smile on his face
you want us to shoot out his tires
as he smiles and flips his coin high into the air
the surrounding troopers stare
the accountant catches it
holds it high between thumb and forefinger for all to see
hes holding an fbi badge in the air
no goddamn way
no ever loving way in gods good heaven are you a
the accountant steps down thrusting his a badge into caps face stopping him cold
need you boys to stand down
captain you know what this badge means right
not a single gun lowers
all trained at the accountant
itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes
federal bureau of get the fuck outta my way
you boys have blundered into an on going federal case
now lower your
he stops turns
sniffs the air
his focus settles on a young faced trooper
angle looking down on the accountant surrounded by armed angry troopers
he steps from the truck nudges cap aside like he wasnt there
cap cant believe it
shot continues moving down closer and closer until the accountant is face to face with a young faced trooper
the kid keeps his gun aimed nervous excited and confused
suddenly the accountant moves fast
he bats the gun aside snatches the kids uniform shirt and pulls it open popping two buttons
above the kids left breast
a pentagram tattoo
it seems youre serving two masters
the kid says nothing stares
every cops gun is sighted on the accountant
he doesnt seem to notice
take out your phone and call him
call jonah king
tell him the old man is dead
the kid stares until
go ahead trooper
do as the agent says
rest of you
the kid removes his cell phone and dials
we tear west down the highway as we catch up to the nova and dive down
toward the back glass until piper stares through the back window
i dont think
why arent they following us
milton slips into his hunting vest
a scowl on his face
theyre likely scared of you
now we drive
we pull back
out of the back glass as the nova speeds up
the sun suddenly time lapses across the sky
the landscape blurs
only the nova and the moving sun remain
until the sun dips into the western horizon and vanishes
replaced by one hell of a bright full moon
suddenly our view veers off the highway and rips toward a rocky outcropping in the distance
we slow and drop toward the ground until were mere inches above the cracked earth
we come to a stop
a boot slams into view
milton climbs from the nova
in the distance we can hear drums
piper rises and gazes at him over the roof
milton shoves the into his back waistband slides the ancient revolver into a leather hip holster then he leans in and grabs his shotgun
milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as milton moves toward a cliffs edge
milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge
a twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below
the ravine is filled with giant oil derricks like metallic t rexs rising and falling to the shriek of oiled metal
and in the center of this jurassic gathering a crowd of people dance and sway around a giant bonfire
it is celebration ritual and orgy rolled into one
brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar
on the opposite side of the oil rig ravine the battered rv sits like a mobile command post
he was expecting less than twenty followers
there are forty down there
milton walks slowly back toward the nova
his head lowered in deep thought
how does one man and a kid take on forty
suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face
he jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead
piper sits on the hood of the nova next to the accountant
get away from her
i think not
i shoot you with this you know what it means
you cease to exist
all the more reason to keep ms
piper in close proximity
you are old milton
you might miss again
you cant stop me
milton you wouldnt be here without me you ungrateful shit
that roadblock back there that would have stopped you
so i want you to drop that iron god killer and say thank you
the accountant moves
with a crisp flick suddenly theres a blade at pipers throat
i said drop it and thank you
milton puts up his hand flings the revolver into the darkness behind him
dont hurt her
th thank you
he lowers the blade but keeps piper close
youre not the first to get out and i doubt youll be the last but i gotta know how did you get out with the god killer
i just walked in and took it
you did not
im an old washed up lifer
never occurred toem that i was up to no good
wouldnt wanna be you when he finds out
whats he gonna do
not let me back in
now i gotta know
why help me
i know why
its because of those crazy fucks out there isnt it
they figured something out didnt they
somehow they know how to summon a piece of hell to earth
the accountant laughs
you havent told her
she dont listen
piper let you in on a little secret
the dark lord
simply the warden of a very large prison
quiet man actually
i happen to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly
why help me
like the warden we all have jobs to do
getting you here makes my job easier
you get what you want i get what i want
then help me now
there are forty of them down there
you and i could no
you want to save her then go do it
if you win i win
if they take you down i win
he hugs piper closer
you like butter on your popcorn
its sure to be a grand show
piper doesnt know what to say
the accountant glances back at milton
youre still here
milton the clock is ticking
then get off my fuckin car
the rv door flings open revealing jonah king
he walks with arrogance through the orgy around him his followers turn to him with reverence
his name is whispered like a secret
he approaches the make shift stone altar where skanky gal holds the baby within a bundle of blankets
high above the moon is full and ripe
its almost time
skanky gal nods
but there is hesitation in her eyes
shes grown attached to the baby
jonah takes the baby places her on the stone altar
my brothers and sisters we have come so far
to this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet
from its death it shall be reborn
as we will be
we who have survived the slings
the revulsion of those too weak to believe
we have been cast out
but no more
followers gather move in unison dance writhe fuck
tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife
it was probably elegant once
now it is worthless
he hands it to jonah
the followers gasp in holy awe
raising the knife with this sacrifice no more will we be shunned
they say the meek will inherit
we are not meek
we are chosen
the hounds of perdition will howl at our command
for now we
a howling noise
distant but thunderous
the sound echoes throughout the ravine then the nova rockets from the cliffs edge
it plummets straight at the cultists
but three are not so lucky they vanish as the giant chevy turns them to pulp
jonahs jaw drops
this cant fuckin be
skanky gal grabs the baby and flees toward one of the giant oil derricks
milton wears a mask of rage as he rips the nova into a his aimed out the window
hes shooting cultists in a barrel
but the nova is the better weapon
he floors it then locks the brakes fishtailing
the novas ass end veers like a dragons tail smacking cultists aside with bone shattering brutality
jonah grabs a shotgun from behind the altar opens fire
followers produce an assortment of firepower and riddle the nova with lead
milton sights jonah ready to blow him to fuck catches the reverend while he cocks the pump
jonah can see miltons got him
milton grits and pulls the s trigger click
jonah fires a fresh round barely missing as milton guns the engine smashes two followers head on
they fly up the hood smash the glass but shield him from another frontal assault
their bodies riddled with lead
the cultists circle him to get a better shot
a magnum is thrust into the drivers side window right in miltons face
he leans back just as the gun is fired
milton yanks the wheel reverses the nova wrenches the magnum from the fuckers hand
the cultist hangs on
claws at milton
milton twirls the magnum gunslinger style
jams the barrel into the cultists face and fires
milton runs down any that get in his way
the accountant stands above the battle piper at his side
he can hear her heartbeat
you want to help him
he chose you you know that
fast car spunky attitude
he put your life at risk and you still want to help him
she rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley below
suddenly something catches her eye
the ancient revolver
without the slightest pause piper snatches it spins and aims it right at
the accountants smiling face
hold on tight
it has quite a kick
if i kill you you cant take him
someone else will come
someone else always comes
piper considers the sounds of battle rising from below
piper he didnt steal that gun to kill me
he stole it to slow me down
hes getting what he wanted
now go to him
before its too late
piper turns and scrambles down the goat path
milton is roaring in anger as the nova is peppered with bullets and shotgun blasts
glass sparks and chaos rain down on him
steam and oil spew from the engine
ducking in the seat unable to see milton fights to keep jonah blasts the front drivers side tire shredding it
the nova pitches hard to the left pin wheeling right into an oil derrick
the scream of metal on metal rips through the ravine
the nova screeches to a halt tires spin smoke spews gas drips from the wreck
jonah and the half a dozen remaining cultists zero in around the nova guns trained on the drivers door
jonah nods to tattoo who approaches close to the ground reaches out slowly and yanks the door open
tattoo is blown backwards by a shotgun blast
jonah and his men open fire
milton screams as the novas cab turns into a warzone
he clambers deep inside the wreck
praying they dont ignite the leaking fuel
then the firing stops
jonah and his men draw closer and closer
soon theyll have a direct shot right into the novas open drivers side door
the men spin to find piper standing behind them ancient revolver aimed into their group
she pulls the trigger
the kickback blows piper off her feet the gun jerked from her hands
she lands on her back
the wind knocked out of her
the god slug slams into a cultists stomach
it explodes through him and into the battered rv behind the rv goes nuclear blows shrapnel and cultists helter skelter across the ravine shredding the remaining five
jonah is spattered with his mens blood dives behind the wreck of the nova
this has all gone to shit
he steadies himself grips the shotgun and shoves it into the novas open drivers side door
the passenger door is open
milton is gone
jonah spins in all directions
expecting a trick
he rushes around the nova to find
skanky gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick
the baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms
jonah walks up oozing arrogance
he knows hes won
he places the barrel of the shotgun to miltons chin
get over here
skanky continues to cower
i said get over here
i want him to watch me kill the kid
skanky doesnt move
then just know i promise to kill her slowly
jonah raises the barrel to miltons forehead then
someone near clears his throat
jonah turns stares
the accountant leans against the novas hulk
at jonahs feet milton scrambles forward and we realize he wasnt crawling toward his grand baby
he was crawling toward the ancient revolver
he snatches it rolls onto his back as jonah swings his gun toward milton the burning god slug hits jonah in the face
jonahs head is obliterated
the force yanks his headless body into the air spins it sky wards in a plume of flame
the accountant moves away watching as the burning corpse slaps onto the leaking wreck of the nova
flames erupt with thunder clear to the heavens the nova roars one final time living up to its name in a furious ball of fire that consumes whatevers left of
piper sucks in air
fire lighting her face
he lies on his back several yards away
piper rushes up falls beside him
hes alive mouth filled with blood
she takes his hand
skanky gal looks up to find
the accountant standing over her
he holds out his arms
she hands him the baby
would you have let him do it
she opens her mouth to speak says nothing
thats what i thought
he turns and walks away from her
races off into the darkness
his head lolls back and forth
eyes flick around
where is she
the accountant hands the baby to milton
milton stares at the tiny face
the big bright eyes
beautiful in every miraculous way
he places her in pipers arms
keep her safe
anyone tries to hurt her and ill killem
thats why i chose you
they all turn toward the high cliff
webster climbs from the camaro
webster will look after you both
as long as he can
and hell keep trying long after he cant
you cant just give up
theres gotta be something we can do to
beat the devil
never gonna happen
im askin more than i have a right to
i know it
but love her for me piper
love her and make her yours
i dont have any right to ask for your promise
and like that
the life fades from his eyes
piper holds the baby close sobs
she looks up at the accountant
but he is gone
the sun glows to the east as piper cradles the baby as she climbs the goat path where webster is waiting
he rushes to her places an arm around her
leads her toward the camaro as he twitches
his one good eye opens
it rolls around then settles on something above
how was that
the accountant stands over him
ive seen better
guess she doesnt know you can beat him slow him shoot him even stop him
but you cant kill a dead man
milton sits up slowly
he holds his hand out
the accountant takes it
pulls him to his feet
they turn and walk toward the rising sun
they walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright yellow glow
they fade into the shimmering heat
and they are gone
