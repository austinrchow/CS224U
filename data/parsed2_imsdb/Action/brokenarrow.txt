written by graham yost march the fist is in a boxing glove
it belongs to vic deakins
the face belongs to rawley hale
they are in
hale and deakins are sparring in a ring
other people are lifting weights shooting baskets
hale and deakins circle each other
hale is shaking cobwebs out of his head
you know what happened there
hell i barely know what day it is
i set you up
i fake right go left three times in a row
you expect it again i take the right in hard
thats what boxings all about
make your opponent think youre gonna do one thing then do another
like ali in zaire using the rope a dope on foreman
mimes rope a dope everyone thought alis arms were getting destroyed when he was really just letting foreman tire himself out
eighth round ali starts hitting georges got nothing left fights over
the fact that i cant feel the left side of my face thats okay right
hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly launches into deakins with a flurry of punches
take notice the fight is getting real
they move to the ring
several of hales punches land
deakins staggers back caught off guard
it looks like he might even go down
he cocks his arm back
he could finish deakins off
but he doesnt
he drops his fist
seizes the opportunity and slugs back
now deakins has the upperhand
he backs hale around the ring
dont watch my hands watch my shoulders
thats where the punch starts
deakins hits hale hard in the face sending him back
are circling the ring following the fighters cheering
you were looking at my hands
lets try it again
deakins hits hale hard
hes got hale on the run
deakins fakes left puts everything into one big uppercut
lands dazed blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth
hes in silhouette the lights above him
looks up at deakins catches his breath
deakins offers his hand
hale pushes it aside
deakins ignores hale grabs him and helps him to his feet
deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes
hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over landing on his feet
deakins gives hale a look laughs shakes his head
hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face
hale and deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers getting into their flightsuits pulling on boots
deakins is smoking a cigarette
the smoke curls up into the light slanting down across the room from high windows
is in sunlight
on the inside of his locker door are pictures of exotic planes the sr a swept wing fighter an artists rendition of the aurora etc
on the shady side of the room
nothing on the inside of his locker door
the locker is spare zen like in its neatness
slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench
i cant take that
oh shut up
i feel bad
how many times have we fought and how many times have you won
well if you insist
deakins grins folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit
you know why i beat you
because youve been boxing for twenty years and youre much better at it than i am
you dont want it enough
you had me today
i was back on my heels
but you didnt close the door
we were just sparring
life isnt sparring hale
i think i saw that on a t shirt
deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill hands it back to hale
no thats yours
if you werent giving it everything youve got then i dont want it
no i mean thats yours literally
i took it out of your wallet when you were in the shower
deakins laughs puts the money away
planes taxiing vehicles moving
deakins and hale enter to find general boone s
nods at no smoking deak
puts out cigarette whats the mission general
simulate a border penetration
hug the ground
scare some cows
see if anyone can spot you
no actually its a little unusual
youre carrying a couple of nukes tonight fellas
off their looks palmdales afraid low level gamma and x ray diffusion might screw up the peripherals
they asked us to send a couple on a run see if anything glows
shakes head big ones
a bomb truck carrying two b nuclear weapons drives under the wing of a big black plane toward the open bomb bays
ground crewmen are hurrying about
enter and walk under the plane nodding to the ground crew
hale and deakins are royalty
deakins and hale climb up the airplanes crew entry steps and disappear
hale and deakins climb into a very strange cockpit
there are two pilots seats in this plane with duplicate controls
but instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels there are four computer screens in front of each pilot
hale gets into the left seat deakins the right
they review information on their screens flip switches
being loaded into the bomb bays
when theyve been clamped into place in the rotary bomb racks
into helmet mike ready for rollout
alarm horns sound wheels roll on track and the huge hangar doors open revealing
an enormous black flying wing
deakins looks at maps on his computer screens
hale looks over sees the map of utah
you know these exercises are fantastic
i mean when that day comes and we finally go to war against utah we are really going to kick ass
bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an escarpment the colorado river a thousand feet below
near the campfire is an army surplus tent
next to it an easel holds a painting in progress
drives up stops
the drivers door open and out gets
we dont see his face in the dark
he switches on a flashlight walks over and taps on the tent
id like to talk to somebody about this fire
we hear a man and a woman jim and wanda s wake up
ill talk to him jim
wanda you stay put
jim comes out of the tent the rangers light in his face
i know no wood fires in the park
its just wandas got a cold and i wanted her to stay warm
sir you see any other hikers campers anywhere around here
not this time of year
whats the fine for something like this
but the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots jim who falls into the fire
he then puts three shots through the wall of the tent
the ranger call him baker pulls out a walkie talkie clicks on
come on and two humvees roll in and four men get out
three of them johnson a tech whiz lett gangly grim and novacek a wiry guy in a baseball cap start setting up what looks to be a high tech missile
the fourth man is
a neatly groomed man s with a perpetually sour attitude
he looks like and is a lawyer
to baker re jim in jesus
do you think maybe you could get him out of the fire
unless you like that smell
the ghost flies overhead roaring
deakins and hale check their screens
thinks of something werent you going to call taylor today about the aurora project
turns out he wants people with more fighter hours
whatd you say
what could i say
you are such a pussy
you never fight for anything
hale is stung
pissed he goes on the offensive
yeah well you know what your problem is
because i said what your problem is youre gonna
you fight too much
deakins look at him right
you said it yourself you should be at least wing commander by now
maybe you would be if you didnt insist on telling people what theyre doing wrong all the time
im usually right though arent i
hale shakes his head grins
deakins clicks on his mike
ghost to mcmurran
hey wilkins you old bag of dirt your boys in utah still awake
establishing shot of mcmurran air force base
jammed with men looking at radar screens and computer monitors
colonel wilkins s seen it all talks over a headset
ready and waiting mr
and tell our favorite hotshot hes not gonna lose us tonight
deakins covers his mike turns to hale
wilkins says you wont lose them tonight
tell colonel wilkins i could fly this puppy up his ass without him knowing
grins shakes his head into helmet hale says
if anyone can catch him itd be you
the ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen
everyone get a fix
theyre about to turn out the lights
deakins turns to hale
on your word
go to war
the left labeled take off is lighted
the other two buttons are mission and landing
hale pushes mission
everything goes quiet
the planes running lights go out
the roar of the engines quickly drops to a low rushing sound
the plane in in full stealth mode
the ghosts blip disappears
lost em on active
whos still got em
got their heat signature sir
points to computer their engines may be cold but the air is colder
half of the screen shows a waveform like a voiceprint
the other half shows a triangle moving across a map of colorado
deakins studies the maps on the computer screens
descend to feet agl
river valley approach
airspeed lock at point seven mach
blue line descent on throttle to feet agl
hale pulls back on the throttle
the plane descends
time to limbo down
how low can we go
the ghost drops away from us a stark black cut out against the moonlit colorado landscape
the colorado river is a winding silver ribbon five miles below
driving along the blacktop
the driver is not baker
pretty late s
her radio squawks
you been through the needles entrance tonight
grabs mike answers no
parker called oh god
what is it this time
ritual human sacrifice
she said she saw a bunch of trucks going through the needles entrance an hour ago and thought they looked suspicious
yes well this is a woman who chopped off one of her own fingers because itd turned on her
thing is she said one of the trucks was ours and youre the only one out
arches eyebrow she was probably hallucinating but ill check it out
we feel the ghost before we hear it
it rushes over close to the river below the ridgelines on either side of the valley
the triangle representing the ghost disappears from a computer screen
stay on it
theyre gonna have to come up for air sooner or later
deakins reads his computer screens
were under the radar
proceed to primary target
hale hits a button lets go of the stick theyre on autopilot
its a moment of peace
hale looks out
i tell people i became a pilot because i wanted to fly cool planes
its also for this
when were up here i feel
closer i dont know
is that what youre going to say
that you feel closer to god up here
hell hale with the payload were carrying we are god
deakins notices something odd on his screen
he checks between the screen and what he can see through the windshield
hale take a look out your side
i think our terrain following is off
its got us two klicks from the left flank ridge
hale turns to look out the window on his side
looking out the window
theres some movement in the reflection in the glass
quick pull focus to see distorted in the curve of the window deakins reaching inside his flight suit
turns his head back toward deakins
deak you cant smoke in here but then hale sees its not a cigarette that deakins is pulling out of his flight suit
its shiny metal
and deakins levels it right at hales head and his finger starts to squeeze the trigger
grabs deakins hand pushing up as
pulls the trigger and the gun fires
the bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet punching a hole in the window by his head
deakins goes for another shot but hale grabs the gun and pushes up sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane into the walls
deakins forces the gun down fires
tears through hales harness blowing apart a shoulder strap
hale brings deakins gun hand hard against hales own helmet
deakins yowls and the gun goes flying
then hale sees something
is banking towards a ridge line cliff wall
sees it yanks on the stick
banks hard away from the cliff just missing
baker gives a sign
johnson standing beside the missile launcher like device hits a button
instead of a missile a brilliant light shoots out
buttons include one two lock left right open close arm and release
deakins presses one and two then right
he pulls at deakins arms
graphics of bomb racks rotate the b nukes labeled and glowing red move into the bottom spot
the word release appears on the screen
next to it the word unarmed flashes
deakins hits hale with the back of his hand knocking him back
hale grabs deakins helmet yanks it off his head and smashes deakins back with it
hale keys the armament buttons
the nukes rotate out of the release position
release and unarmed disappear
deakins grabs a fire extinguisher swings it getting hale in the face
hale is almost knocked out blood running from his nose
terry is standing by her truck talking on the radio
clyde tell mrs
parker that theres nothing weird going on
no truck no ufos and except for the odd human head on a stick no sign of satan
she feels it before she hears it or sees it
rushes over terry no more than fifty feet above the ground
the jet wash rocks the truck almost knocks terry down
hale groggy hears a loud click
he looks down to see
auto to manual
deakins grabs hales ejection handle
hale tries to push the handle down as deakins pulls it up as
heads into the beacon light
hale and deakins look at each other as the plane enters the light and the light in slow motion washes across their faces
suddenly lets go of hales hand then hits hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher
his head snaps back as deakins pulls
pop hiss like a huge vacuum sealed can is being opened
the ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind
as he rockets up out of the cockpit
when the chute opens he almost spills out because of the severed shoulder harness
he grabs the straps holds on
terry on the radio with clyde
debris coffee cups flight bags anything not nailed down is whipping around the inside of the cabin
deakins reaches through the maelstrom then reaches to the armament buttons and punches them
the the clamps snap back and the two b s drop toward the earth
deakins looks around then gets an idea
he hits the landing mission mode button and the cockpit lights up
the ghost starts popping up on everyones screens
theres a chorus of i got em
and theyre ba a a ck
wilkins looks at a screen puzzled
theyre not due for another halfhour
deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject
into helmet mike this is deakins
hale lost it
i have to punch out
deakins pulls his second handle
he hear and feel the plane dropping screaming toward the earth
the ghosts blip suddenly disappears from the screen
a chorus of what the hell
thats not good
alarm horns blare
five men are running to a waiting blackhawk helicopter
waving the men on is wilkins
the last man up is
s short grey hair he could snap your neck with a look
wilkins pats rhodes on the shoulder and rhodes jumps into
and it lifts up and flies off
hale lies unconscious his parachute whipping in the wind
the helicopter glides over wind whipped sand searchlights on
rhodes sits with mckellar the pilot
lieutenants kelly reed and thomas are in the back
something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on
the lights sweep back find
sticking out of the sand
aka the war room
phones faxes computers tv monitors backlit maps and coffee
present are generals including air force general creeley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff chairman and assistants all in uniform
they turn as
baird s is the white house chief of staff
his assistant stays in the b
as baird walks in
so do i wake the president
where is he las vegas
some information superhighway crap
let him sleep for now
hands baird a piece of paper were going out with this
ricks team prepared it
the chairman nods toward rick
baird reads mumbling
united states air force
regrets to announce
c heavy lift cargo plane
down over the utah desert
status of crew not determined at this time yadda yadda
nice bullshit rick
baird hands it to rick who starts for the door
thats a mistake
the room quiets
all eyes on
bairds intensely competent assistant
aviation week has been following this planes development for years
they have stringers who spend their vacations sitting in lawnchairs all night long by the whiteman perimeter fence just in case one of these things takes off
the boys in those lawnchairs know one took off tonight
theyre going to know when it doesnt come back
giles contd and when we put out a press release saying a c went down in utah theyre going to put two and two together
aviation week will run a story everyonell know what really happened and were going to look real stupid
we might as well tell the truth
mock shock the truth
how the hell did you get this job
a few chuckles in the room
baird looks at the chairman well
the chairman thinks for a second nods
baird turns to rick
what giles just said
rick grits his teeth and hurries out
baird looks at giles
i want you in utah
giles nods heads out
baird grabs his arm
you scare me sometimes
sometimes i scare myself
and out giles goes
rhodes and his men are on the ground
wind is whipping the sand
rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed
hes yelling into a headset microphone
into mike cockpits empty
were checking the payload
wilkins talks to rhodes over the radio
watch your needles
rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the bomb bay doors manually
the doors are open a foot
rhodes signals his men to stop
rhodes steps up shines a light into the bomb bays
rhodes light plays over the bomb racks empty
into headset mike colonel
takes breath weve got ourselves a broken arrow
theyve just gotten the news
baird doesnt know what it means
thats what we call it when we lose a nuclear weapon
thinks shakes head i dont know whats scarier losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you people have a term for it
wilkins is on the radio with rhodes
find the nukes sam
but be careful
i know they say those eggs cant be cracked but if your geigers pick up more rads than youd get off a toaster i want you out of there
wilkins to the corporal
get the teams in
i want colonel rhodes and his men backed up
various views of a b nuclear weapon
creeley is briefing baird on the nukes
they dropped from a plane but they didnt go off
they have to be armed to detonate
then theyre destroyed
shakes head theyre designed to survive crashes intact
they can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any problem
how did this happen
in his last transmission colonel deakins said major hale lost control
he probably hit weapons release by accident
believe me when a planes auguring in you start pushing every button you can
baird stands looks at a picture of a ghost shakes his head
hell we should take the cost of the plane out of major hales salary
although i guess at two billion dollars a pop that could take a while
hale is still unconscious lying beside his parachute
theres the crunch of footsteps and a figure looms over hale
the figure reaches down to touch hales shoulder and
spins grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to punch
he hesitates when he sees its
she seizes hales hesitation and punches him hard
hale is stunned
terry starts to get up reaching for her gun
hale strikes out with a leg getting terry in the gut sending her back
she hits the ground still struggling for her gun
hale gets up runs sprinting off over the rocky terrain
jarring racing over rock and then
pulls up fast almost not fast enough
hes stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop
that would be the wrong way
is walking slowly calmy up behind hale pistol out
look i not interested gimme your hands
hale sticks his hands behind him
terry handcuffs them
im going to tell you something i cant tell you
terry puts away her gun spins hale around and starts marching him off
there were nuclear weapons on that plane
the guy i was flying with is trying to steal them
terry reacts to that but keeps hale moving
i have to stop him and i need your help
look pal all i know is i saw you come down i come in to help you and you grab me kick me and run away
i only ran because you punched me
what were ten years old now
you started it
no you started it
he has men on the ground
i save it
my dogs waiting for his breakfast
terry starts to push hale along again and
jumps up and through the handcuffs
reaches for her revolver but
grabs it from her puts it to her head but not before
whips a knife from her belt and puts it under hales chin
a beat while they catch their breath
this isnt a stand off okay
ive got a gun
yeah well i never keep my gun loaded
terry taps her belt
a line of bullets
terry holds out her hand
hale lets the revolver swing down on his finger
just as terry takes it
moves fast grabs terrys knife hand then kicks her legs out from under her
hale lands on top of her still holding her knife hand putting the knife to her throat
im telling you the truth
this is a good way to convince me
i could kill you now
terry nods bewildered and more than a little scared
hale lets go of terrys hand holding the knife
i need your help
terry looks at hale for a long moment
shes still holding the knife
she exhales then sticks the knife in the dirt
the helicopter flies low
rhodes looks at a device on his lap
green like a radar screen
its blank and then two dots appear on the outer edge of the screen
terry unlocks hales handcuffs
ive got a radio in the truck
we can call mcmurran and get the marines in here
shakes head deakinsll be monitoring any radio transmissions out of here
off her look thats what id do
who is this guy
a flash of the horrible betrayal he someone i wouldve trusted with my life
youve gotta get to a phone
what are you going to do
no answer she wait
youre gonna go after this guy
isnt he going to have a lot guns and shit
i dont want to sound insulting or anything but youre just a pilot
i dont have any choice
the nukes are my responsibility
pulls something from i do have one thing going for me
under a rock
the last thing in the world he expects is for me to come after him
hale walks off into the light of the rising sun
terry looks at the bill
the helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice
rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the crevice
kelly thomas and reed are waiting shining lights on a b lying in the dirt all in one piece
into mike weve got one intact
to his men lets go find the other one
rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice
mckellar is sitting in the pilots seat eating a candy bar
he turns at the unexpected sound of a truck driving up
climbs up the slope toward the helicopter
grabs his rifle hops out of the helicopter
are in the humvee
novacek sticks his head out
hey you guys need any help
its an air force training exercise sir
im going to have to ask you to leave
hey no problem
we just whips out a silenced rifle and shoots
barely has time to raise his rifle before hes hit
drives up fast
johnson wears radio headgear
pritchett is furious
picks up mckellars half eaten candy bar takes a bite
to novacek any sign of deakins
novacek mouth full shakes his head
he better be dead
sorry to disappoint you mr
they all look over to see
walk out of the shadows smoking a cigarette
while soldierly with his men deakins is courteous and polite with pritchett
you said nothing would go wrong
well point of fact nothing has
you didnt drop the nukes where you were supposed to
ah but we always planned on the search and rescue team finding the weapons for us and they have
pritchett i really have thought of everything
johnson walks up pointing to his radio headgear
two gunships just left from mcmurran and theyre headed this way
you thought of that
thatll take care of itself
what about the other pilot
we saw him eject
you dont have to worry about major hale
hes probably hiding behind a rock somewhere praying i dont find him
someone else might find him
off deakins look a ranger called her base said she saw a pilot come down and was gonna go look for him
deakins thinks it over turns to novacek
youll go when the clean ups done
novacek nods goes to the helicopter
canyonlands wd trail hale and terry are hurrying along a wd trail toward terrys truck
terry taken a look at hales ripped and torn flightsuit
is that the new uniform
the dayshift guy left some work clothes in the truck
you can have them if you want
his feet crunch on something
dont walk there
dont walk where
on that black stuff
thats cryptogamic soil
its very fragile
one footprint takes centuries to repair
thats a new one
terry gives hale a look
rhodes reed thomas and kelly move along the shadowy crevice
novacek flips switches in the helicopter getting ready to start up
deakins reaches in flips off a switch marked com link
rhodes hears the connection go dead
he taps his headset
suddenly theres a soft popping sound and reed drops
rhodes looks down sees blood on reed
before he can say another word theres a fusillade of soft popping sounds as silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them
thomas goes down
silence from the speakers
sam are you there
lett aims a snipers rifle down into the crevice
he flips a switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope
rhodes and kelly are pressed against the crevice wall
dances along the wall heading for them
raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser
lett pitches back dead
pritchett looks at deakins another part of the plan
deakins is unperturbed
hes holding an overnight bag
he unzips it
rhodes whispers to kelly
well open up the access panels put in a couple grenades
the nukes wont go nuclear but they will go dirty
i wont lie and say well be all right
but if were gonna go might as well take those bastards with us
rhodes scrambles off
just one thing sir
kelly opens fire with his rifle
rhodes is thrown back dead
kelly yells up top
kelly grabs the rope climbs fast
pritchett looks at deakins surprised
deakins putting on new clothes just grins
from his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket
climbs into view
kellys voice comes in over the speaker
who is this
its lieutenant kelly sir
what happened kelly
kelly talks over the helicopters radio mike
deakins is behind him shaving with an electric shaver
colonel rhodes is dead sir
theyre all dead
deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike
theres a wash of static
deakins pulls the shaver away nods to kelly
its the nuke sir
oh god what am i going to do
deakins puts the shaver to the mike again more static
he reaches into the helicopter and flips off the com link switch then backs away shaving
he nods to novacek who fires up the helicopter
wilkins slumps in his chair
call back the teams and get me the room
were gonna need nest in here
novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away
deakins turns to kelly and applauds his performance
brought a tear to my eye
id just like to thank the members of the academy
to deakins i hope youve got another surprise up your sleeve
if im not mistaken there are two attack helicopters headed this way
not any longer
they look at him he taps his radio headgear
theyve just been recalled
you see mr
pritchett they think theyve got an exposed core
theyll want to get a satellite to take a look but itll take ninety minutes minimum to shift the orbit
well people get a little weird when it comes to radiation
no onell have the balls to come near here unless its nest the nuclear emergency search teams and itll take the nearest team at least two hours to get out
here and we only need an hour to reach our connection with the transport squad
not that im not delighted with your presence but you really dont need to be here
hale and terry are riding in terrys truck
hale is wearing work clothes
after some silence
whats your dogs name
i was going to call him death so i could say things like i walk with death and death chewed my boots but i chickened out
do you have a name or is that classified
before hale can answer
rises up in front of them novacek piloting
novacek thumbs a button and machine guns on the sides open up
terry jumps on the brakes
she and hale bail out as
is riddled with bullets and explodes
sprint up the trail
weve gotta hide
terry leads hale up a short slope
hale scrambles over the top and is stunned
terry runs out onto an open expanse no cover
novacek grins shoots
looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in
when he turns back terrys gone
hale runs in the direction of her voice
aiming at hales back
but then hale suddenly drops from view
arms flailing drops fifteen feet to deep sand
how do you
looks back still im a ranger
ive been over these trails a million times
not looking terry runs straight into a wall smacks her head and drops like a rock
novacek cant see his prey
he gets an idea and reaches back
terry is trying to get her eyes to focus
please dont tell anyone i did that
novacek has a box of grenades beside him
he pulls the pin on a grenade and drops it
hale is helping terry to her feet as boom the first grenade goes off
chases them strafing them
a grenade goes off in front of them
they run back
hale looks around looks up
can you climb up
give me your gun
terry climbs up into view of
who sees her
pull herself up stands hands up
novacek swivels the helicopter around
this has nothing to do with me
tell me where he is
is down in the fissure pointing the revolver straight up at the helicopter hovering right overhead figuring out where to shoot
moved pilot seat back a foot
puts him right about
hale hesitates hes never shot at someone before then takes a breath and starts shooting
the bullets fly up from below
one hits novacek
he slumps pushing the joystick to one side
starts to lean over sideways
is surprised it worked
watches in horror as
angle toward her slicing the air as the helicopter tips over
dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as
hit the rock sparking grinding right over terrys head
the blades stop dead
but the torque of the motor brings
up and over in a high arc
is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her
hale runs up grabs terry pulls her to her feet as
swings down rotor spinning
it digs into the dirt and sand a split second after
deakins and pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding helicopter rise up in the distance
we dont have to worry about the other pilot
deakins shakes his head
then how come the helicopter crashed
a flicker of worry pilot error
deakins turns and walks away over to
who have taken the three foot pointed front section off each nuke
they are loading them into the back of one humvee
pritchett walks up behind deakins still nagging
tell me again how i dont need to be here
pritchett i understand your concerns
you and your associates gave me a lot of money to mount this operation
but theyre getting ten times that back if we succeed
if we succeed
all i can do is my part
weve got the weapons were
checks watch seventeen minutes ahead of schedule and everything will be in place within two hours
but i cant guarantee that the assholes in washington wont do something stupid like not pay
what if they dont
then the next census for this region is going to show a very sudden drop in population
giles enters and is brought over to wilkins
im giles prentice
they shake hands my word from your search and rescue team
picked up any radiation
wilkins shakes his head
thats kind of strange if theres an exposed core out there
i asked for a transcript of the last cockpit transmission
wilkins nods to a corporal who hands some papers to giles
giles reads them quickly
i dont know what you expect to find
we see colonel deakins this is deakins
hale lost it
i have to punch out
you know these guys
just on the radio
never met em
looks up what if this wasnt pilot error
baird has put giles on speaker phone
the people in the situation room exchange looks
no rhetorical questions giles
spit it out
in the last transmission from the plane colonel deakins said major hale lost it and made the plane crash
we all assumed that meant pilot error
but what if deakins meant hale made the plane crash
murmurs of thats insane no way fill the room
why would he do that
two nuclear weapons would be worth a hell of a lot of money
son there are easier ways for someone to buy nuclear weapons
you go to one of the old soviet republics you can get one for the price of a bmw
i meant theyd be worth a lot of money to us
how much would we pay to get them back
to make sure they werent used in this country
a flurry of looks around the room
hold on hold on
to creeley these nukes have codes or something that prevent people from using them
no one has these codes outside of the president and you guys
access to the codes requires the highest security i mean not even the pilots have these codes right
creeley starts to stammer
the chairman turns
to an assistant wheres that nest team now
they just took off
a sleek very serious looking helicopter
six very serious looking soldiers are in black radiation suits listening to colonel hunt over headsets
listen up sportsfans
word is this particular broken arrow has broken open
our eta utah is ninety six minutes
i want everyone to take that time to triple check the seams and seals on their e suits
giles looks at wilkins
you think im nuts
you dont think nest or the satellite will find anything weird
but it wouldnt hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case
wilkins reaches for a phone
the helicopter wreck burns
hale looks over the terrain
how do they get out of here
i dont think that helicopters going anywhere
deakd have a back up
hed be prepared
if theyve got trucks they could take the four wheel drive trail we were on
he wouldnt want to go towards town
he could go to the river
hale looks at terry thats exactly what deakins would do
the two humvees roll along the narrow twisting trail
kelly drives deakins beside him johnson and pritchett in back
you a fan of boxing mr
i think its barbaric
i love it
two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can
as basic as you can get dont you think
i think it should be banned
so do i
god wouldnt that make it more exciting
having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight
i bet we see eye to eye on a lot of things mr
deakins grins mr
hale and terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the wd trail
the two humvees make their way along the trail
see the one in front
it just has a driver
they wanted to keep the weight down
it has the nukes
hale takes terrys gun from her
you gonna shoot out the tires
humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch
thats why deak chose em
terry looks at hale then what is he going to do
im gonna steal it
checks gun you get to a phone and call mcmurran
the nearest phone is a two hour walk
then you better start walking
look i know my way around here
youre gonna need me
very serious i appreciate what youve done so far
but now it gets hairy
go to the phone
he scrambles off over the rock
come around a corner
the trail hugs the face of a ten foot high cliff
suddenly from off the cliff
jump down onto the roof of the lead humvee
hale looks at terry angry
but before he can say anything
baker swerves trying to throw them off
he pulls out a pistol shoots up through the ceiling
bullets punch up
hale pulls out the gun
it falls from his hand
terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends
he lands hard behind the humvee
deakins points at hale getting to his feet
run him down
sprints after the leading humvee
deakins humvee closes fast
looks back sees hales predicament
she slides the pistol along the truck roof
grabs the gun out of the air as
slams on the brakes
comes flying off the top landing on the hood barely holding on
is going to be crushed between the humvees
he jumps up turning as the bumpers come together
he lands on the tailgate facing backwards and fires into deakins windshield
kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but deakins doesnt flinch
the bullets bounce off the glass bulletproof
baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at terry and starts to pull the trigger when he stops feeling a gun against the back of his head
is behind him
hale gets into the passenger seat
gimme the gun and get out
i dont know
i think we got ourselves a little stand off
no we dont
hale shoots baker in the thigh
reaches forward and grabs bakers gun as
kicks baker out of the humvee
bad timing for him
he tumbles out right in front of
and is run over
holds the steering wheel yells to terry
climbs into the humvee takes the wheel from hale
she jams bakers gun into her belt
id yell at you for coming after me but you did just save my life
theres a look between them then hale climbs into the back
he finds what he is looking for a jerry can of gasoline and an emergency tool box
whatre you doing hale
hale keeps his back to the other humves
he pulls gaffers tape off a roll tears it with his teeth grabs
out of the tool kit
maybe hell set off a nuke
thatd show us
hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the humvee
flies through the air
theres a burning flare taped to the side of the plastic can
as the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and
but its too late and
skids to a stop showered with burning gasoline
deakins and his men bail out
kelly johnson and pritchett run for cover
coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying
hale climbs up into the front seat
terry looks at him genuinely impressed
we need somewhere to hide
i know a place
deakins keeps spraying the burning humvee with foam
terry and hale have taken the humvee to the parking area in front of an abandoned mine
the winch on the humvee strains
the cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal doors
the doors are slowly pulling out groaning
it was a copper mine barely squeaking along for years
they shut it down a few months ago when they hit an underground river
the hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip loose
hale shuts down the winch unhooks it from the doors
he motions for terry to drive it in
terry drives the humvee into the mineshaft entrance
hale uses a flashlight to look around
he finds a switch a flips it
a gas generator comes to life
another click and lights come on
now they can see the rest of the entry area including a wire mesh enclosed elevator
as terry looks around hale grabs the humvee radio tries to tune in other frequencies gives up
they hardwired in their frequency
we cant call out
what are we gonna do
hale goes to the back of the humvee pulls down the tailgate
im gonna take away deakins reason for being here
hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a panel on the side of one of the b s
theres an lcd display a numeric keypad and a clock showing the current time
the keys are oversized and brightly colored
fisher price makes nuclear weapons
theyre designed to be used by guys wearing gloves in alaska
he reaches in hits a key and the lcd display lights up
these nukes have security codes
if you enter the wrong code three times the nuke goes dead all the circuitry shorts out and shuts down
kind of like the security systems with car radios
and people say the public doesnt benefit from defense spending
hand me the radio
terry goes for the radio mike
hale sees something
sticking out from under one of the nukes
pulls it out looks at it
its from st
judes hospital radiology department
hale turns to terry as she pulls over the radio mike
the fire is out
the radio crackles
deak you there
deakins and kelly look at each other
ding ding ding deak
were starting a new round
you took the first couple but ive got you on the ropes now you son of bitch
deakins gets in the passenger side grabs the radio mike
what was that last part
there was some static
clicks off mike to find them
to pritchett and lets go
johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one rhodes used
kelly and pritchett get back in the vehicle
kelly drives deakins humvee along the trail as they talk
i know youre stalling while you try to find the nukes with your scanner but youre gonna be too late
hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers
im entering the wrong code you bastard
a couple more times and these are gonna be useless to you
you really got me there
i sure didnt think of that
hale slows down somethings wrong deakins doesnt cars
all that time we spent in the cockpit together and you think im stupid
i got some new boards and circuits from a friend at pantex
but nice try
hale curses to himself
terry looks at him
he shakes his head theyre in trouble
you know hale i thought of asking you to join me on this
you wanna know why i didnt
because i wouldve said no
i wouldve just killed you if you said no
i was more afraid youd say yes
because i knew i couldnt count on you
you can pretend youve got guts but when and if it comes down to it youre gonna run off crying like a little girl
you better hope thats true doak
because ive got the nukes and theres nothing to stop me from entering the right code if you know what i mean
flash of worry you wouldnt do that
i wouldnt have the guts
end split screen
hale drops the mike looks at the elevator
how deep is this mine
i dont know
a couple thousand feet
thats deep enough
hale opens the elevator gate
a nuclear explosion
terrys jaw drops
kelly drives the blackened humvee as fast as he can
johnson looks at his scanner grins
theyre in the mine
off their looks i could tell he was inside something
there was an echo
hale hurries to the back of the humvee
we can still hide them
hes got a scanner
hed find them
youre talking about setting off a nuclear weapon
they set them off underground in nevada all through the fifties and sixties
theres no risk
tell it to the two headed cows
hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes pulls
he can barely move the thing
he turns to terry
i am not helping you set off a nuclear weapon
we wont be down there when it goes off
this isnt a suicide mission
though i think you should know before i ejected i heard deakins say the nukes were going to be used to wipe out the last few remaining handicapped gay whales
terry looks at him you asshole
hale looks at her very serious
i need your help
terry thinks shakes her head steps up and grabs the nuke
the humvee takes the turn off to the mine entrance
hale and terry are going down with the nukes
when we get to the bottom well have to get away from this shaft
itll limit the amount of radiation released into the atmosphere
deakinss humvee comes into the clearing
the humvee stops and deakins and kelly jump out followed by pritchett and johnson
the elevator comes down
hale slides open the gate
he and terry drag the nukes out
well each drag one down a tunnel
im only going to set off one
well leave the other one here
itll be buried under a billion tons of rock
they are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them we better hurry
nods down tunnel lets try down there
they start hauling the nuke down the tunnel
deakins pritchett kelly and johnson wait by the elevator
i cant wait to see how this fits into your plan
deakins charm peels away for an instant and he fixes pritchett with a stare
pritchett shrinks back
baird the chairman and the others are watching large tv monitors
creeley walks them through what theyre looking at
a wide view birds eye thermal image of rocky terrain
this is the kh satellites infrared view of the area
an exposed nuclear core would be relatively hot itd show as a circle of bright white
as you can see theres nothing
the only heat signatures we found were these
the image changes
there are four blotches glowing a dull red
we think its colonel rhodes and his men
a look between baird and the chairman
the chairman reaches for a phone
wilkins is on the phone
giles looks at him
i understand sir
was i right
giles grins smugly for about half a second then realizes what it really means
into phone ive got ten ships ready to go
we should be hearing from nest any minute now
flying over canyonlands
deakins kelly and johnson are in the elevator
kelly holds a small metal briefcase
hale and terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel
hale has opened the guts of the nuke
hes pulling out a chip
how do you know how to do this
pilots who fly with nuclear weapons have standing orders to
quoting from the retrieve if possible disable if necessary and destroy if we must and destroy i must
he stands looks around
screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling
im gonna need your belt and one of your socks
the elevator descends into view
deakins kelly and johnson get out
they see the other nuke lying there
send it up
shakes head lets take care of hale first
in one hand hale holds terrys sock filled with sand
his other hand grips the eyebolt
terry is giving hale a log up straining under the weight
take your time
hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt
he tightens a belt around the open end of the sock
terry lets hale down
hale picks up a big rock and loops the free end of the belt around it
then he picks up a smaller rock
one chip has been pulled out of a circuit board
hale very gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip
we make a small hole in the sock and when enough sand drains out and were hopefully in new mexico the sock is pulled through the eyebolt the rock drops
re smaller rock hitting the rock on this chip closing the firing circuit and thats it
hale finishes putting the small rock in position
how much time are we going to have
i dont know precisely
this isnt a swiss sock
ten minutes maybe hale is cut off by
flying in ricocheting off the rock walls fired by
thirty yards down the tunnel
dive to the ground
they pull pistols start shooting
one of johnsons bullets cuts through it
feels sand hitting his face looks up
sand is draining out of the sock very fast
reaches up to grab the big rock but johnson sends a spray of bullets in
terry grabs hale
the sock more bullets
terry pulls hale
they run down a side passage
hale and terry fire back at johnson as they run out of sight
shoots after them then runs up to the weapon
he reaches for the rock stops maybe thatll set it off
the last sand pours out the sock is sucked through the eye bolt
drops fast toward the nuke
grabs it stopping it just in time
the hand belongs to
he looks at johnson in disgust exhales and tosses the rock
he pulls out a walkie talkie clicks on talks into it
were at the end of tunnel three
clicks off to you two get this one set
ill take the other one up
running along a tunnel
what do we do
beat em back to the elevator
stop em from getting out
they hurry off around a corner and are met by
with his uzi
run back down the side tunnel bullets winging off the rock all around them shooting back
hale starts shooting out the lights plunging the tunnel into darkness
the bit with the sock was good
i like it
still im gonna use the the field expedient tactical timer
its a little more precise
see hale you arent the only one whos thought of setting off a nuke in this mine
kelly is there with johnson
kelly flips on a lamp on a headstrap giving him better light as he opens up the metal briefcase hes been carrying
an elaborate electronic timer
deakins pulls out a fresh clip
i need a demonstration
otherwise some swinging dick in washington is going to say i dont have the balls or the ability to set off a nuclear weapon
im gonna show these puppies im ready willing and able
hell im eager
deakins jams in his clip walks into the dark part of the tunnel
in the dark waiting to ambush deakins and then
opens fire but not at hale and terry at the cable along the ceiling connecting the lights
the cable snaps and electrical sparks shoot out flooding the tunnel with light showing
suddenly exposed to deakins fire
the bullets whiz in
the muzzle flashes from his uzi give away his position and hale and terrys bullets scream in at him
he backs around a corner
its a stand off
well hale i better be going
look at it this way partner
if you wanted to get closer to god you are about to get your wish
hale hears deakins footsteps start off
youre gonna ransom salt lake city arent you
the footsteps stop
what makes you think that
thats where st
judes hospital is
youre gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they wont show up an any satellite radiation scans
how much are you gonna ask for
ive got a broker in stockholm
monday morning hes going to buy me five percent of volvo
for the rest of my days im going to live off the dividends happy in the knowledge im helping to build the safest car in the world
so thats it
youre just doing this for the money
im kind of disappointed
why would you do it hale
thats the thing i wouldnt
if you were me
if i were you
thinks starts in because
because i got passed over for promotion and goddamnit im going to show the bastards that im smarter than them all
getting angry because
everyones selling out and cashing in so why not me
because my ex wife was sleeping around
because my parents abused me
because i ate some sugar
hale contd because i dont like mondays
takes a breath its all bullshit deak
there are no reasons
theres no difference between you and the guy who shoots up the schoolyard with an m
you both think you have reasons
you both think you were wronged
youre both just fucked in the head
grim evil fades into darkness as he turns and walks off
they hear footsteps receding
hale bolts out of their hiding spot
deakins gets to the elevator drags the other nuke in shuts the gate and starts up
kelly finishes keying in numbers into the nuke timer
an amber light comes on and
starts ticking down from ton minutes
grab their guns and run
the elevator comes up
deakins drags out the nuke hits the down button shuts the gate
the elevator descends
hale and terry are waiting for the elevator to come down when
a half second of surprise is broken when
make a move toward the elevator but
unload with their uzis
back around a corner side by side shooting their pistols
is shot drops
grabs johnsons uzi and firing both guns backs to the elevator kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside
he hits the up button with the butt of one of the guns and the elevator starts to rise
step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator
seven minutes and counting
deakins and pritchett get the nuke into the back of the humvee
we can go back try to shut it down
we dont know the code and deakd have it wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny
hale looks at her
i shouldntve let you come
hale takes terry in his arms holds her
i just hope someone remembers to feed my dog
hale nods hugs terry
terry starts to say something else but hale puts a finger to his lips hes heard something a distant rushing
hale pulls terry running down the far tunnel
you said they shut down the mine when they hit an underground river
deakins slams the tailgate on the humvee shut
from the distance he and pritchett hear the whump whump whump of a helicopter
deakins motions pritchett to stay
deakins comes out looks up sees
coming toward him two miles away
hunt sees something points
in the clearing
the blackened humvee and deakins by the mine entrance
hale and terry run up
the tunnel comes to an end at a big hole
the rushing sound comes from the hole
they step up to the edge and look down
dark water rushes by ten feet below them
any idea where it goes
they look at each other
they dont have any choice
they flick on their flashlights and jump
they hit the water and are swept from view
deakins enters motions for pritchett to get into the humvee
re kelly and arent you going to wait for them
and if they get out they might talk
fortunately theres something wrong with the elevator
deakins opens fire with his uzi on the generator
sparks fly and the thing shuts down
kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim
deakins and pritchett drive out of the mine in the humvee
deakins punches the trip odometer setting it to zeroes
kelly switches on his headlamp
wrong person to screw with deak
he pulls open the gate and climbs down
kelly swings under the elevator
i know the goddamn code asshole
he grabs the cable trailing off below the elevator and starts sliding down it into the darkness
two minutes and counting
hale and terry are being sucked along through the fast turbulent water
their flashlights show
jutting down like knives ready to rip then open
dodge them push off duck under
and then they notice that
is getting lower getting closer to the surface of the water
theyre running out of breathing room
three feet two feet one foot
they take big breaths maybe their last and theyre
tumbling along pulled at by the eddies flashlights showing their faces they are running out of air
and then theres light above them in the water
lungs bursting they start kicking up
terry and hale come to the surface coughing sucking in air
deakins drives fast along the wd trail glancing in his sideview mirror at
closing in on him
is holding on tight as deakins drives wildly
i think ive finally figured out your plan
those guys in the helicopter are going to kill us but were going to rise from the dead and very suddenly and very violently lashes out
the side of his hand hits pritchett in the throat
gags silently suddenly unable to get any air
he pulls at his throat even pounds himself in the back of the neck
he slowly slumps dying skin turning blue
maybe now youll shut up
kelly is running as fast as he can headlamp lighting the way
thirty seconds and counting
hale and terry are swimming toward the bank
deakins barrels along in the humvee the nest helicopter getting closer behind him
deakins has a thought and looks over at pritchett dead held up by the seatbelt
i just realized ive never killed anyone before
i mean i dropped bombs on baghdad but never face to face
deakins contd thinks about it i dont know what the big deal is
eighteen seconds left
runs up starts entering numbers into the timer keypad
the nest helicopter closes fast on deakins
they are a couple hundred feet above him a quarter mile back
let him know were here
a line of bullets kicks up dust in front of deakins humvee
deakins looks at
it clicks over from
grins steps on the brakes
the humvee stops and deakins gets out arms above his head
a hundred feet in the air slowly coming in toward deakins
eleven ten nine
punches in the last two numbers of the code then enter
it stops with seven seconds left
the amber light goes off and the red light comes on
sits back on the floor takes a breath
deakins is watching the helicopter
strangely he is grinning
then the camera closes in fast on
hes holding a small black box
he presses a button and
kelly hears a click
he looks over at
the red light goes out
the amber light comes on
a splitsecond later the green light comes on
the screen goes white
watching the helicopter listening to hunt over the loudspeaker
do not move or you will be fired rises up beneath deakins
the ripples of the shockwave shoot out from the mine shaking dust and dirt into the air with an incredible deafening roar
fly ten feet into the air
theres a roar of static over everyones headphones and then every light every piece of electronic equipment shuts down
terry and hale are pulling themselves out of the water when the shockwave hits knocking them off their feet
wilkins and giles hear the sudden rumble and then the shockwave hits knocking stuff off desks swinging lamps
deakins and the humvee land
in the b
drops out of sight behind a rock formation
theres an explosion and a ball of fire shoots up
terry looks over at hale holy shit
the lamps are still swinging
thats all we need
a goddamn earthquake
son i was at the nevada test site in the fifties
that wasnt an earthquake
deakins picks himself up
to himself at least i know they work
wilkins grabs a phone
giles is pacing freaked
into phone get me the room
i have to get out of here
youre going to be fine
it was underground
into phone colonel wilkins for general creeley
how do you know
for one thing if it was above ground it wouldnt have caused the same kind of ground tremor
for another if it was above ground wed all be blind and dying
into phone sir weve just had a detonation
the chairman is huddling with baird
howd that happen
i dont know but thank god it happened underground
what do we do now
first thing we do is put a huge goddamn lid on this thing
with all due respect to your boy giles and his belief in honesty as the best policy from now on and until the end of time what happened in utah
tonight was an earthquake
the humvee races along the trail
deakins and the dead pritchett motor along
deakins turns to pritchett as if pritchett had just asked him a question
it was hit by emp
its released in a nuclear detonation
it wipes out anything electronic for miles
that s another reason i wanted to set off a nuke
i knew itd bring down any helicopters coming for us
itll also shut down all radio communications for a few hours which will severely screw up their response
you see mr
there really is nothing for you to worry about
pritchetts body seems to nod from the motion of the humvee
hover and dance over the water in the early morning light
hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out
he turns to see terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to her fingers are too numb
i hate these shirts
theyre ugly and stupid and terry suddenly starts crying
its not the shirt shes upset about
hale holds her
i mean we almost
a nuclear bomb went off
that it did
points at if the butterflies are okay then well be okay
it says so in the manual
if you see butterflies after a detonation you are fine
terry looks at hale
she knows hes bullshitting her but she appreciates it
they look at each other
they could kiss
but they both shy away from it
terry gets her shirt off
we better get moving
we might be able to reach deakins when he gets to the river
they start off along a trail by the river
something ive been meaning to ask
terry looks at him how did someone like you end up with a gun
i hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken
i came out here one summer during college
it was the campaign to stop the dam in the grand canyon
i loved it here
i came back worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year round
when a park ranger job came open i applied
im still waiting for the chicken
the local parks department wasnt sure how id do with the law enforcement part of the job
well one night i was coming home from the store and tommy drewson part of the local brain trust was robbing old bob kearney in front of the atm
i bear old bob yelling and i see tommy heading for his car so i tossed a bag of groceries at him at thirty miles an hour
a frozen chicken in the bag hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock
next thing i know im a ranger
hale looks at terry with a new appreciation
deakins pilots the humvee along the trail
hale and terry are crouching behind a rock looking down
a zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank
a man with an uzi sheppard waits duffel bag by his feet
get me a frozen zackys fryer and hes a dead man
theres the sound of an approaching engine
sheppard stands gun ready
the engine stops
a few seconds later
appears walking down a footpath toward sheppard
where is everyone
i am everyone
sheppard hurries to deakins
they disappear up the footpath
were the only ones who know whats going on and i dont have the faintest idea how were gonna stop them
youll think of something
why do you say that
you have so far
hale looks at terry shes right
but it almost pisses him off more than it gives him confidence
he grumbles to himself and starts off down toward the raft
they get down to the raft
they climb in
hale grabs the engine throttle slumps
hale looks around spots sheppards duffel bag lying on the riverbank
he hops out and starts rummaging through it when they hear grunting and feet approaching
hale looks around for a place to hide
there isnt any
terry tries to get out of the raft but she trips on a tarpaulin bunched on the bottom of the raft
coming down a path lugging the last remaining nuke
of the raft
hale and terry are nowhere to be seen
is alone in the water on the far side of the raft very silent
he hears deakins and sheppard load the nuke into the raft
why were you driving around with a dead guy
because i like him
he doesnt ask a lot of annoying questions
a few seconds later the engine starts up
hale ducks down under water as the raft takes off over him
he surfaces to watch the raft zooming off into the distance
he is very worried
the nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft
sheppard pilots the raft
deakins looks around sees what he wants
is lying on the deck of the raft along one side all bunched up
itd be the kind of thing youd hide under
grabs the tarp and pulls
theres no one there
throws the tarp over the nuke
as he does we pan over to
strapped to one of the side pontoons
a small triangle of cloth is sticking out from inside the crate like the corner of a shirt
its quickly pulled out of sight from within
hale climbs out of the water and looks around not knowing quite what to do
the zodiac boat is on the shore
sheppard and four man call them the gunmen are hauling the nuke to the truck
deakins walks with another man max s
max checks his watch
your friends in washington should be getting the package about now
i wish i could see their faces
baird the chairman creeley and the others are all staring slack jawed at a tv screen
camcorder shot of deakins against a black backdrop
two hundred and fifty million dollars by nine a
the depositing instructions are in the envelope that came with this tape
this deadline is not negotiable and there is no grace period
the device is on a timer
shortly after you receive this the timer will be activated
at nine a
i will make a call
if i find out youve done as youve been told i will stop the timer
if you have not complied the screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear destruction buildings being knocked sideways mushroom clouds shockwaves fires
turn that off
hale runs along the shoreline headed for
where houseboats are rented out
hales eyes focus on a sign with a picture of a phone on it
the back gate of the truck is shut from the inside
the truck starts up and rumbles off slowly at first
jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck staying right behind
she grabs a handhold and pulls herself up
she holds on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road
loud voices and crosstalk
baird is on the phone nodding
creeleys phone rings
he answers it
covers phone to the president wants to know if we know where the device is headed
if deakins had a plane waiting it could be anywhere
we just dont know
all eyes on him major hale is alive
according to him colonel deakins is headed for salt lake city
army helicopters are landing near the marina
two are already down
one has troops standing outside of it
are walking toward the second helicopter
we found the raft on the other side of the lake
tracks from a heavy truck ran out when they hit the paved road
if we get a rad scanner we can track them
a brief look between wilkins and giles
actually major were going back to mcmurran
wed just like to ask you a few questions
im not wasting time answering questions
weve got no debate major
i was given orders
now you can come with us or you can go with them
wilkins nods over at the other helicopter
the troops standing in front of it are mps
hale looks at wilkins astounded
wilkins is up front with the pilot
hale and giles are in back
all wear headsets
hale is yelling at wilkins
deakins thinks im dead
he thinks its over
youve got to let me go after him
i can help
i know how his mind works
major i know this is personal for you but i think we can handle it
were putting a wall of men and machines around salt lake city as we speak
that truck is not getting through
dusty slices of light come through the trucks slatted walls
the nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock straps running off to d rings on the sides
max is hooking up an electronic timer
what about the ranger
what about her
when you find that truck youll hit it hard
chances are shell be killed in the crossfire
regrettable but unavoidable
giles and wilkins share a look hale is right
look shes not supposed to be there
she should be checking camping permits finding lost kids
she saved my life
giles wants to help
so does wilkins but
we were ordered to take you back to mcmurran
you understand what orders are dont you major
wilkins turns away
hale sits back mind racing not knowing what to do
he quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopters weapons rack and puts it to wilkins neck
major put that away or say goodbye to your career and hello to twenty years in leavenworth
if thats what it takes
youll have to shoot me
hale thinks but theres no way he can do that
he lowers the gun sits back
giles gets hales attention then points to his own head
hale doesnt understand so giles grabs hales gunhand and puts the gun up to his head
how about this
wilkins looks back sees hale holding the gun to giles head
bad acting i swear to god ill shoot
max finishes hooking up the timer
he looks at deakins
ready when you are
wait until i get back
im going to check on sheppard
deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling
hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the window and the map on his lap
i dont know what youre looking for major
every road between here and salt lake has already been sealed
deak would know that
maybe hes not on the road
wilkins doesnt understand
they were using maps like these to set up the roadblocks
then thats the answer
wilkins doesnt understand
hale points outside down at
on the ground
old ones half covered by weeds
its an old spur
probably hasnt been used in twenty years
nobody bothered to put it on the new maps
what are you
the nuke isnt in a truck colonel
its on a train
a freight train engine a car carrier carrying a load of toyotas several boxcars and a caboose
a hatch opens up an the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and
climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck theyre in a train
the nuke boxcar has a small satellite dish mounted on the roof
are in position at points along the train ready with uzis
wilkins hangs up the radio mike
radios still down
well head north look for a phone then look for a train
hale is thinking
wilkins starts to tell the pilot
salt lake is north
hes not going to salt lake
but you said it would be salt lake
you found that hospital tag
he planted that
he wanted whoever found it to think thats where he was going
shakes head hes been doing a rope a dope
giles and wilkins look at him like hes nuts
its a boxing term
when ali look i know this guy
if everything has been saying hes heading north then hes heading south
they look at him then wilkins grabs the map
whats south of here
wilkins finger follows the train line on the map
it goes right into las vegas
what the hell is there to blow up in vegas
wilkins finger keeps moving on the map
wilkins finger stops
deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on
we angle down to reveal
crouching down between the two cars
sheppard is working with a torch welding the brake and accelerator controls
sheppard turns the torch down
deakins lights a cigarette off it
how much longer
behind the drivers compartment is the engine itself with walkways along either side
creeps up to one of the doors that lead into the drivers compartment
how long until the helicopter gets here
well leave from the boxcar roof
deakins turns to go
deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine
is hiding on the other side of the engine very quiet and still
as deakins goes out the back door of the engine terry follows
terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the ladder on the boxcar when we pull back to reveal
as he puts a gun to the back of terrys head
a rancher comes out of the mini mart with a cup of coffee and heads for his old pickup truck
he starts to open his door when he hears incongruously whump whump whump
he looks up as
comes in gets about three feet off the ground and giles jumps out
as giles runs to a payphone the helicopter pulls up and flies away leaving the rancher agog
terry comes down the ladder from the hatch followed by deakins with a gun
to terry a pleasure
to deakins what the hell is a terry and why is it still live
she asked me how i thought i was going to get away with this and i thought id tell her
to terry were going to a cabin in the mountains not far from here
when we get there im gonna make two phone calls
deakins contd the first is to the pentagon
im gonna tell them where the train is
see all their forces are up at salt lake by now
by the time they could get a f down here the train will be on the outskirts of vegas
and ill remind them about the impact trigger if they hit this train hard the nukell blow
shakes head they wont have any choice
theyll have to let the train get into the city and because of that theyll have to pay
you said two phone calls
the second will be to my bank in geneva
if the moneys in my account i use this
pulls out what looks like a modified cell and shut down the timer
if not we sit back put on some shades and get a quick tan
but radio isnt working
you saw the dish on the roof
its not affected by emp
i really have thought of everything
you kept her alive just so you can impress her with how smart you are
to max no i kept her alive because i want her to do me a favor
see if something goes wrong and this thing goes off a half a million people are going to be vaporized
i dont want that on my conscience
so im not going to arm the nuke
deakins contd puts gun to terrys she is
the room is silent
everyone is looking at video monitors showing a map of las vegas
they are listening to a nervous assistant as he uses a telestrator to diagram the blast effects
starting at ground zero and moving out we have in terms of immediate effect one hundred percent fatalities to thirty miles
ninety percent from thirty to forty miles dropping roughly ten percent for every ten miles after that
the long term cut to the chase son
looks up seared two hundred and fifty thousand in the first few seconds
the same again within a year
it sinks in good god
terry is shaking tears in her eyes as she slowly enters the numbers deakins tells her to in the nuke timer keypad
filled with tears
she blinks and
terry has visions of retirees in vegas watering potted plants outside their motor home of teenagers ragging on each other as they walk to school of children in a playground
and terry shakingly pushing each button and then
the images of the retirees the teenagers and the children each bleach out to white fast as if hit by a nuclear blast
then enter and its done
her finger hovers over the enter button almost pushes it then shifts to cancel and pushes that
the display goes blank
he shakes his head
you really shouldnt have done that
i said i would kill you and i will
im gonna be dead either way
i dont want any part of this
deakins shrugs he sees her logic
he puts his gun to terrys head
terry shuts her eyes
deakins is about to pull the trigger when max stops him
max gestures listen
they hear a helicopter approaching
max checks his watch
just then they hear gunfire
max gives deakins a look
its not a problem
set the timer then kill her
have fun with it
deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch
the gunman at the caboose is firing on wilkinss helicopter hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train
max holds a pistol on terry with one hand while he quickly sets the timer with the other
rests on maxs tool tray
her fingers creep over to a vrench
presses enter and finishes setting the timer
terry swings hard and fast with the wrench knocking the gun out of maxs hand
max spins and when terry swings at him again
max kicks the wrench out of her hand then steps up fast and hits terry under the chin with the heel of his hand
she drops straight back
thought i was just friendly old max huh
lady i was a navy seal
you should see what i can do with just my thumb
max goes for his gun
grabs onto something
its the wrench
as max turns back with the gun terry heaves the wrench
it hits max square in the forehead
he drops like a rock
well you should see what i can do with just a chicken
deakins joins his man on top of the caboose firing on wilkins helicopter
wilkins and hale are returning fire
hale points at deakins
to pilot get him
theyve got guns
youve got a helicopter
deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as
comes swooping in
sees whats going to happen and turns and runs as
drops down beside the train
the rotor blades whip about three feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward
run from the blades as fast as they can
jump from car to car
the gunman passes deakins
just when the helicopter blades are about to catch up to deakins
jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right over his head
deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut short
swooping fast over the train when suddenly
pops up out of the hatch her back to the helicopter
pulls up fast
watches the helicopter bank away
bullets start whizzing by her
has climbed up and is shooting at her
runs away from deakins shooting maxs pistol behind her blindly
appear two cars ahead of terry and start toward her shooting
is caught between deakins and the gunmen with no way out when
comes along the length of the train flying low
it rises up and theres
hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and hes firing a pistol shooting right over terry at
hes hit falls off the train
aims at terry and starts firing
the bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her
she jumps up and grabs onto
as he swings in on the cable shooting his pistol
are lifted up and over
who turns firing a shotgun
hales bullets find him
appears firing an uzi at hale terry and the helicopter
bullets rip through
wilkins is hit knocked back
is severed by one of sheppards bullets
drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar
hale shoots as they fall
is hit and drops
banks away fast making ugly sounds smoke billowing out
the engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing beside the tracks
watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on
they look at each other
you stop the nuke
ill stop the train
terry starts forward then turns
id yell at you for coming after me but you did just save my life
they hear a helicopter in the distance
they look over to see
coming in fast
any excitement turns to confusion when they see
standing in the doorway of the red cross helicopter holding a gun
thats deakins escape route
not any more
they share a last look then terry heads off
male coils up the winch cable slings it over his shoulder and heads for the nuke boxcar and his old friend deakins
he picks up
left by deceased gunman
makes her way past the toyotas
wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter
the train is way off in the distance
they hear honking and turn to see
tearing toward then along a dirt road horn honking
the rancher from the mini mart is driving giles beside him
terry comes into the drivers compartment
she tugs at the brake and accelerator levers
she looks around spots a cigarette lighter
deakins and the one remaining gunman hear the helicopter
they start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear footsteps on the roof of the car
deakins gestures to the gunman
he raises his gun trying to figure out where to shoot
then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle
the gunman opens fire on the hatch
bullets stream up through the hatch cover but hale is nowhere in sight
one end of hales helicopter winch cable is tied to the hatch cover
we follow the cable fast over to the side of the boxcar to find
standing tugging on the cable still attached to the harness
hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of the train
the gunman hears a sound starts to turn just as
swings into the boxcar on the cable firing the shotgun
is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat wall of the boxcar and out of the train
climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof
shoots at deakins misses
the shotgun clicks empty
hale tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness
he drops to the floor of the boxcar and runs to the ladder
terry has a three foot length of gasoline soaked cloth stuffed into the gas tank opening of a toyota on the lower level of the car carrier
she lights it and hurries off
deakins steadies himself as
hovers in sideways toward the train
the man in the doorway holds out a hand to deakins
is reaching for the mans hand and grabs it when
reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto deakins foot
deakins kicks free of hale holds onto the man in the helicopter and is pulled onboard
moves sideways over the train
deakins turns pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as
moves back sideways over the train
no sign of hale on the train roof
get us out of here
nods and starts to lift and bank
then he gets an odd expression
the helicopter isnt doing what he wants
is hovering over the train but it cant fly away because
is hanging onto the skids and hes hooked the cable to the skid
the other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch
strains against the cable but it doesnt snap
cross the track a quarter mile ahead
leans out of the helicopter with his uzi shooting down at
who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the train bullets plugging in all around his
he jumps down through the hatch as
sees whats coming and jumps
which snap shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopters rotor
breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on
the flame burning up the gas soaked cloth goes into the toyota gas tank and
hale gets to his feet goes to look at the nuke
five minutes and counting
looks at it trying to figure out how to disarm it
he hears the whoosh thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar
stands there trying to smile trying to be cool but
they wouldve paid and i wouldve stopped it
youve made a very very big mistake
its over deak
i beat you
if its over and you beat me you disarm it
course you are going to need this
holds cell phone all you have to do is get it
puts remote in and if you do as a special added bonus you get this
deakins pulls out
then pockets it
share a look
deakins puts up his fists
hale puts up his fists
its a chain reaction with one flaming toyota setting off the one above it or next to it
terry is looking under the car carrier
the train car axle is smoking grinding glowing red in the heat from the flaming toyotas
hale and deakins circle each other
modern boxing is a pussy sport
they want to make it about scoring points
its not about scoring points
its about this
deakins fakes a right jabs with his left catching hale on the chin
hale is jarred
blood runs from his mouth
in the old fights thered be so much blood guys would slip and fall
lets see if we cant get a little more of that red goo out of you
again deakins fakes right jabs left
hale half blocks it but is sent back
the axle is bending grinding groaning
is between the car carrier and a boxcar looking down at the axle not knowing what the hell shes going to do when she hears a horn honking
used to be every fight was to a knockout
you know what happens when you get knocked out
its your brain slapping against the inside of your skull
ill let you see what its like
deakins steps toward hale about to finish him off
hale ducks comes up hard with all hes got gets deakins under the chin and deakins sails up and back landing prone seeing stars
stands over deakins in silhouette the light of the hatch above him
jumps the tracks
hale is thrown off his feet
swings wildly in the hammock webbing
securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap
the front cars accordion sideways off the tracks down a short steep embankment
its all grinding twisting groaning metal
fly tumble explode
hale tries to get to his feet but then the floor starts dropping below him as
goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops
the sounds of the crash cease
dust and smoke
flickering light from a burning toyota comes in through the slatted walls
in this weird light hale sees
its above him at the end top of the car
its hanging in mid air tangled up in the webbing
two straps are the only things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to the bottom of the car
is lying at the bottom end of the car directly under the nuke not moving
looks around for something
he sees it on the floor
lying a few feet away
you have to push amber then red
you might have time to push amber
you wont get to red
hale turns to see
pointing a gun at him
the nuke is armed deak
if it falls the impact trigger will set it off
half a million people will die
thinks shrugs fuck em if they cant take a joke
holding the nuke tears through
one strap left
his finger hovers over the amber button
do it and i shoot
hale looks at deakins
i guess you really dont know me that well after all
hale presses the amber button
spins back blood spraying from his shoulder
falls from his hand
is about to shoot again then hears a tearing and looks up as
rips through and
drops toward him point first
grabs the remote and his finger presses the red button
mid air dropping the clock and display go blank as
his eyes fill with true terror as
punches into deakins point first crushing him
gets to his feet and stands over deakins
he reaches down opens deakins pocket and pulls out the twenty dollar bill
he heads out of the boxcar
hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the train wreckage and burning cars looking for terry
pulls up and a reporter and cameraman jump out
keeps running through the wreckage
he stops unable to breathe when he sees
in a boot sticking out from under a burning toyota
runs to the car pulls at the foot tries to push the car off the body underneath
another vehicle drives up
hale is pulling hard on the foot when
the air force pays you so little you have to steal shoes off dead people
hale turns to see
walkins over from the ranchers pickup truck
are behind her grinning
run to each other
they embrace start smoothing each others hair start wiping blood off each others faces start kissing only to be interrupted by
what happened here
hale and wilkins and giles share a look
looks at flaming somebody was trying to steal some toyotas
the reporter asks more questions
hale and terry walk off arms around each other
as they go hale sticks out his hand to terry
they shake hands and walk on as we
