xxx by rich wilkes august third draft on a hill above the city is an old cathedral
the night is spooky with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones and medieval walls
a nervous young hacker makes his way down an alley
there is a door at the end of the alley
music can be faintly heard from inside
high above the street an intruder dressed all in black spies from the roof
hes watching with night vision goggles
he pulls out a crossbow and fires
a bolt flies trailing cable
it sticks into the alley wall below
as he passes by the ominous cathedral the hacker spins sure hes heard something
but theres nothing there
he continues on
then the intruder comes sliding down the zip line from above
he kicks the hacker into the wall knocking him out
the intruder pulls off his mask revealing the chiseled features of a dashing british secret agent
his name is i hate to drop in unexpectedly
sterling searches the hacker and pulls a small black case from his coat
inside the case is a data chip
sterling tucks it away
sterling unzips his black jumpsuit revealing a crisp tuxedo underneath
he pulls out car keys
in a quick insert we see the aston martin logo
as he strolls back out the alley he hears something and flattens against the wall
a blacked out suv screeches to a stop blocking his exit
the suvs headlights illuminate the slumped hacker
bad guys get out to investigate pulling out weapons
cornered sterling heads deeper into the alley staying in the shadows
he gets to that door the hacker was heading towards
as he picks the lock sterling can hear music from inside
he smooths his hair and prepares to blend in with the crowd
sterling comes through the door and his face falls
hes stepped into a loud metal concert
we see a go go dancer in latex
onstage is rammstein a bizarre german industrial metal band
the tattooed young crowd slam dances and swings glo stix over their heads
some wear rubber brain skullcaps outfitted with fiber optic lights
its a sea of spiked hair and bondage sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd
with his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken coop
on the balcony above the crowd stands a wild haired young gangster with pierced brows
with him is a street tough girl with multi colored hair
they look like a post apocalyptic bonnie clyde
they are yorgi and petra
yorgi checks his watch
his delivery is late
then his cell phone rings
hes getting the news from outside
he looks down spots sterling amidst the moshing crowd
with that look that tux theres no mistaking what he is
they make eye contact and sterling gives a little nod
yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone
immediately viktor starts moving in sterlings direction
viktor is huge with a mohawk and a six inch goatee
sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit pushing through the freaky crowd
sterlings aston martin vantage screeches away from the curb
sterling is at the wheel of his spy car
he plugs the data chip into the dash and punches buttons
a computer screen says data downloading
he sees a blacked out suv racing up behind him
he accelerates and hits a switch
armored plating slides up over the rear window
the suv is right behind him
viktor rolls down the passenger window readies his pistol
the rear bumper of the spy car opens
smoke bombs drop out
they explode in massive clouds obscuring the narrow street
sterling skids around a corner
the blinded bad guys drive straight into a storefront
glass and merchandise flies as the suv gets stuck
the aston martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop
blocking the road ahead are two more suvs
a motorcycle slides to a stop in front of them
the rider is anders a leather clad biker who looks half viking
anders pulls out a silenced sub machine gun and starts bullets slam into the aston martin cracking the bullet proof glass shattering headlights and blowing out the front tires
sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on the rims
sterling notices an error message now flashing on his computer screen transmission error data partially sent
sterling looks around desperately
somehow hes got to get this data out of here
straight ahead is the river
chugging up the river a party partygoers in formal attire dance to an orchestra
a swimming pool is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing
time for a slow boat to china
he hits a button
the rear license plate folds down revealing a rocket engine
flames spew as he jams down the accelerator
sterling is pushed back into his seat by the g forces
sparks fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at ever increasing speed
anders fires with his gun but sterling is getting away
but then kirill steps around the corner
hes academic looking a chain smoking intellectual with coke bottle glasses
hes also a highly proficient and cold blooded kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a surface to air missile launcher from his shoulder
the aston martin reaches the riverbank and goes airborne
it rockets through the air towards the party barge
we see the car reflected in kirills glasses as he aims
on a little screen we see the missile launcher home in on the heat source of the jet engine
the missile locks in and fires
we see a green car with all its hot spots glowing red
camera roars towards the flying car
sterling sees the missile streaking at him
oh bloody hell
the aston martin explodes in mid air
partygoers shriek as the axle and flaming rims rain down on the deck
kirill takes the cigarette from his ear puffs it
finally sterlings flaming bow tie flutters down and lands on a leaping salmon ice sculpture above a tantalizing seafood a strafing shot over the city
we make a sudden left turn and speed out of town
we shoot over to the blue ridge mountains of virginia
in the middle of nowhere we dive towards a complex of black inside its modern cold and high tech
an elevator counts down to a deep basement level
the doors open and a tall man man with a prosthetic leg strides down the empty hall
agent gibbons is african american a battle scarred warrior
even with a limp he looks sturdy confident deadly
at the end of the hall is a metal door
gibbons walks into the information room of the national security agency nsa
there are world maps satellite images on computer screens techies monitoring everything
if a nuclear war broke out you could run the country from down here
gibbons takes an elevator up
the office is expensive yet devoid of personality reflecting the shadowy nature of its owner
one wall is glass looking down on the information room
sam tannick grizzled nsa chief looks down at the activity below
gibbons enters stands by the desk
sam remains in shadow
what do you have
not a whole helluva lot
his final transmission was mangled
about something or someone called ahab
whatever it is it cost him his life
he was the best there was
that makes three agents lost
theyre ruthless and they have a lot of firepower
its only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night
then were gonna have a catastrophe on our hands
silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys were gonna have to step in sam
those cia boys couldnt find a clown in a field of cactus
let me take care of it
how will you fix it
ill go in with a team
but first im going to need some intel
ill have to put someone inside someone new someone they wont see coming
one of their own
so youll dredge the bottom again
youve done that before
the results were
you wanna find out about rats ask a rat
ive had my people put together a talent pool
i downloaded it to your desktop
gibbons snaps on the giant flatscreen on sams desk
he starts cycling through photo after photo of tough looking men
the usual prospects
convicts contract killers murde
the scum of the earth
ive seen enough
turn it off
gibbons clicks off the screen
theres not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over
thats exactly why we need them
sam sighs stares out at the information room
get these scum mr
gibbons bring them in
find your man
the huge arco tower rises up towards a moonlit sky
we see accomplice travis pastrana sneak up and take position behind a fountain
accomplice carey hart sneaks across a roof and takes position overlooking the fountain position of
accomplice dave mirra takes up position in the second story window of a flophouse hotel down the street
a messenger bob burnquist skates up to the front of the skyscraper with a package
he gets the attention of the security guard inside
the security guard unlocks the door and lets him in
just then a van pulls up and accomplices shaun palmer and mat hoffman hop out
they open up the back and a bicycle is rolled out of the back by a man in a hooded jacket
jacket man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the lobby
the security guard is checking his computer
im sorry no one by that name
k the guard glances up as jacket man gets into an elevator
you cant go up there
the security guard rushes to intercept him
the messenger kicks his skateboard out tripping up the security guard
the messenger hauls ass out the door
the security guard pulls out his walkie talkie
weve got an intruder in the express elevator
the button for roof access is lit up
jacket man waits patiently
this fancy office is empty for the night
the stairwell door opens and a platoon of security guards rushes in
they take up position in front of the elevator doors armed with billy clubs and tasers
the elevator arrives and the door swings open
but theres nobody inside
one guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle swings down from the ceiling tagging him in the face
he falls back tasering another guard
jacket man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the chaos before the guards know what hit them
theres a curvy piece of art in the room some kind of modern art statue
jacket man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a tabletop aerial over a divider
he hits the ground pedalling the guards hot after him
jacket man enters a huge open room with a field of cubicles in the middle
he bunny hops onto a desk and slides to a stop
he tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him for the first time
he is xander cage
hes got a shaved head bizarre tattoos all over his body and multiple piercings
hes lean and heavily cut even dangerous looking
the guards charge at him and he hops up onto the top of the cubicle wall
this thing is maybe four inches wide and five he pedals across the top of the cubicle wall the guards scrambling after him
xander bunny hops over one guys head onto the next set of cubicles and pedals hard
the guards fall all over themselves trying to catch him
at the other end xander catches air and lands on a conference table
he does a wheelie across its length with guards closing in
xander springs up and does a tail whip knocking them back with his rear wheel
he lands and pedals to the stairwell untouched
xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the tallest building in downtown la
he climbs on a raised platform
from here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn with satellite dishes and microwave relays
guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him
xander tears off his jacket revealing a backpack on his back and video camera on his chest
he pulls out a road flare and sparks it
we see there are soaked rags tied to his he lights them with the flare
then he tosses the flare off the building
the accomplices see the flare drop
s pull cameras out and start filming
xander races around the roof like a trapped animal
he evades security guards picking up speed
with guards right behind he drops off the top platform and lands on a massive satellite dish
using the dish as a ramp xander launches himself off the top of the building
were talking some stories here
he spins through the air his bike on fire
hes doing end over end backflips
hes looping through space on his bike a crazy man on a flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and night lights
the stunt is covered by the various accomplices and xanders own chest camera in super and digital video from four different angles
xander ditches the bike kicking it away from him and plummets towards the ground
at the last moment he throws out a bucket and his parachute the bicycle comes flying down and smashes into the pavement
it bounces a full two stories back up before coming to rest
xander glides down and makes his landing
accomplices and rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the van
sirens approach as the van makes its escape
as cop cars screech up to the skyscraper one of them runs over the smoking wreckage of the bike
title sequence hardcore music plays as we see a flowing tapestry of florid tattoos
silhouetted against this backdrop we see the outlines of nude women riding bmx bikes in a half pipe blading ever obstacles sky surfing and doing street skate tricks
its a collision of outlandish imagery that tells you one thing this aint your daddys spy movie
xander now on a motorcycle zips through traffic
hes smiling leaning it way over on the turns
hes got another backpack on his back
xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building
a freight elevator rises up bringing xander and his motorcycle into the loft
there are extreme sports action posters on the walls motorcycle parts and barbells on the floor and everywhere theres extreme sports equipment of every description
sky you there
start packin cause we are out of here
theres a neatly folded flag hanging in a slightly crooked frame on the wall
xander straightens it as he goes by
he hears her in the sectioned off bedroom and heads back there
did i promise you a fat vacation or what
get ready to get down in paradise
he comes into the bedroom to find sky his long suffering girlfriend
shes a wannabe artist type
shes got suitcases and boxes scattered around and shes packing
hey you dont need all this just to go on vacation
unless this aint for going on vacation
im through xander
i can see that
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert you break bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs all with no health insurance
its insane i cant take it anymore
im having fun whats the problem
you have all this talent and you waste it
you wont take a single endorsement deal
meanwhile those other guys have their own video games
but no youve got too much integrity for that
i dont wanna go mersh you know that
but hey if this is about money
he opens up the backpack revealing wads of cash
i got an advance on the next bootleg
lets get out of here just you and me
well chill out in bora bora for a couple months
she sorts through the money
this wouldnt last us a week in a cheap hotel
do you know how expensive it is down there

he pulls off his shirt
pierced through his nipple is a what

you cant just propose to me out of nowhere
you think thats going to solve our problems
im sorry x
it was a kick for a while but its over
youre just not going anywhere
youre not exactly going anywhere yourself
youre wrong about that
im heading out that door right now
she heads towards the front door
just then the door blows in
the windows smash in too
then the lights go out as stormtroopers in black body armor rush in weapons drawn
its a blur of flashlights pistols and jack boots
its scary as hell
a professional take down
they slam xander against the wall
just like that its quiet again
sky hyperventilates a gun in her face
she had nothing to do with the tower jump
i just met her last night
with meaning i hardly know you
the stormtrooper looks at sky
the stormtroopers take their guns off her
sky grabs up here stuff
she looks back at xander
keep the ring
it looks better on you anyways
she heads out
god i hate cops
whats the charges this time
the stormtrooper pulls out a dart gun and shoots xander
he pulls a chrome dart from his chest examines it
xander slides to the floor
a sideways image an out of focus coffee creamer
xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a diner
he shakes out the cobwebs
what the hell
whip pan as a waitress walks by
where am i
how did i get here
i dont know you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down
i told you we were closing
xander looks around sees a trucker chewing with his mouth open
a salesman buried in his newspaper
xander gets up
where the hell is he
he takes a step towards the door
want some coffee
the waitress pours him coffee
quick push to her hands are shaking
smiles fine just fine
come on and sit
ill get you something to eat
when he swigs his coffee he notices something written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint s
what the hell
he looks at the trucker
the truckers staring at the waitress
quick push to the trucker has a bulge underneath his vest
then push to the salesmans eyes darting about suspiciously newspaper pulled up to his nose
something is going down
he hears a slowed down voice and glances back at the trucker whos now fixing him with a death stare
xander snaps from his reverie
i said you got a problem boy
no no problem
you go right ahead
i said go right on ahead with what
the trucker and the salesman look at each other
suddenly they jump up
the trucker pulls a pistol from his vest the salesman brandishes the shotgun he had behind the paper
the waitress cringes
alright nobody make a move
to xander shoulda walked away when you had the chance dumb shit
forget him buck lets just do it
in xanders face you keep still or im gonna make damn sure you stop breathing today
xander stays strangely calm his senses now fully focused
shrugs alright buck whatever you say
the waitress lets out a whimper
keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register
couldnt just let him leave could ya
you know what im gonna do to ya for that
she goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor
xander springs into action
he chops down on the truckers arm and elbows him in the face
xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him
the salesman pumps on his shotgun but it seems to be jammed
better shoot me quick
the salesman fights with his gun but cant get it to work
xander advances on him
he unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw
the salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors
xander turns to the terrified waitress
alright bitch whats going on
she stares at him unable to speak
he raises the gun
whats the game
who are you people
the front door bell jingles
a guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in
there a problem mr
who the hell are you
the names gibbons
you were saying
what is this place
looks like a diner
let me tell you what the problem is
i wake up drugged to find what
youve got a salesman over here reading a three week old newspaper
hes pulling a with a trucker who happens to be packing a cop issue h k mm
i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note
hows that for twisted logic
how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i walked in
and if thats true whyd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money
then i notice how beefy they both are
hell even the waitress is cut
all three of them look like they went through the same training program
ergo they aint strangers and this isnt what it seems
thats how i knew yo yo wouldnt get a round off even if i gave him all day
he aims at the waitress and fires
shes startled but unhurt
cuz theres nothing but blanks in these guns
and no offense but their performances were terrible
xander tosses the gun on the counter
gibbons gives a sly smile
not bad at all
have a seat
gibbons sits in a booth
xander sits across from him
in the background the waitress helps the trucker and salesman up
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place
i expected you to do the same
that shows me already that you dont have a clue
whats it to you anyway
whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct
that tells me something about your character
good for you
now why dont you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want
you didnt go through all this for my benefit
its your lucky day
you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy
a fed i shoulda known
who else would have this kind of budget
now youre gonna hit me with the sales pitch
alright cage youve got me
this is one of those moments
many are called few are chosen that kind of thing
your government needs you
are you up for the challenge
if youre trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy
why is that
look at me dude do i look like a fan of law enforcement
forget the tests you shoulda just asked me
i woulda saved you a lot of trouble
oh i dont know i think the tests work pretty well
sometimes they give me answers you wouldnt admit to in a million years
are we done now
youve got nothing on me
so if you aint booking me im walking
youve got this wrong
youre not under arrest youve been abducted
and until i say different you belong to me
is that a fact
sure as gravity
ive had a feeling about you from the start cage
smiles you know what i hate
any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think theyre god
smiles you know what i hate
its always the assholes that pass the tests
theres a pop and xander clutches his stomach
gibbons tosses his dart gun onto the table
xander blinks at him
he pulls another chrome dart from his gut and examines it
you bastards love to see me sleep
he goes face down on the table
he comes to blinking in low red light
hes shocked to find that hes
xanders on the floor of a military aircraft
two other tough guys are waking up next to him
ones a greaser named virg the other is t
xander notices as they each pull out chrome darts
they sit up looking at each other
whats so damn funny
been to any good diners lately
the three laugh realizing theyre all in the same boat
we must be the final candidates
they quiet down as they notice for the first time they are sitting silently on benches facing them are soldiers dressed in black
they wear black masks over their faces
they are a nasty looking black ops team
nobody told me this was a costume party
the black ops team just stares
ive worked with guys like this before
serious government spooks
virg notices something strapped to his body
they all have them
heads up man
whats this thing on my back
this does not argue well
then the red light switches to green
one of the soldiers opens the jump door
the rest of the team advances on xander virg and t
this is bullshit
they drag virg to the door and throw him out
goes next kicking and fighting
then they turn on xander
i get the picture
xander jumps out on his own
we see him tumbling away from the airplane
far below his chute blossoms open
we see three chutes coming down
the first two hit hard
we rocket in on the last chute as xander lands like a pro
the other guys run up to him
then they hear shouting in jee zus man
what the hell now
another damn test
we should head for those trees
dont look at me brother
its every man for himself
they wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as they take off in different directions
xander runs low down a culvert
theres shouting all around
he flattens down and crawls up over the rise
what he sees stuns him
you gotta be kidding me
we crane up to reveal a field of pot plants
theres a cocaine processing plant along the fields edge
the whole place looks exactly like a central american drug farm
narco terrorists run around with ak s
xander sneaks past equipment covered in camouflage netting
a squad of narcos runs by and xander makes his move
he rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the headlights of a truck
narcos hop out and charge forward
xander raises his hands
you boys are too good for me
guess i failed this one huh
they grab him and haul him away
we see a rusty meat hook
a chain is wrapped around it
attached to the chain his arms over his head is xander
hes in the middle of a bleak looking room
there are bloodstains on the wooden walls the floor strewn with filthy behind him against the wall xander sees t
and virg both so much for every man for himself
nice to see you again fellas
they really went all out on this one
this is a pretty gnarly setup
check the table in the corner
theres a blood stained towel covering a table near the door
this oughta be good
then they hear talking outside and the door is unlocked
a very nasty looking marco comes in
by his look hes the this must be el jefe
hows it goin jefe
some weather were havin
narco guards bring in one of their parachutes and toss it on the floor
they exit closing the door behind them
jefe goes to the table throws back the towel
beneath it are hideous blood encrusted torture devices a hack saw a bolt cutters knives chisels a blow torch
whats on the menu tonight
the old blowtorch to the family jewels routine ill bet
hey you want roasted nuts lets break out the planters
and virg both crack up
jefe gives them a withering look
do you know what we do with people come round here
you know what we do with people come in our business
jefe passes his hand over the various tools
he finally settles on a crude machete
he walks amongst them brandishing it
we cut the achilles tendon
your feet flop around like a marionette
you aint walkin nowhere no more
sound good tough guy
or maybe instead you wanna tell me something
he stops in front of xander
whatchu doing here
oh i dont know
it was an accident
thats some accident hombre
you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard
he backhands xander across the face
we seen this kind of parachutes before you know
you got some friends here jump out with you guys

we dont have any friends
jefe slaps him again
no friends huh
thats funny i dont know no u
army that comes without no friends
thats cuz u
army is pussies
they always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see in the dark glasses
so dont you tell me you all alone out here my friend

xander looks over at t
whos writing this dudes dialogue
hes a pretty good actor though
makes the diner look like a sixth grade play
hes even got them crazy eyes
you aint begun to see crazy yet amigo

you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls you got your torture tools
its all very cute
but come on lets quit while youre ahead
im only trying to save you a beatin
you saving me
you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling
you wanna eat through a tube be my guest
now youre gonna make me enjoy this funny guy
now im gonna take the whole foot off
whatchu think of that
a low thumping is heard outside
its the sound of approaching helicopters lots of them
then the night erupts in gunfire
it sounds like a full scale assault outside
whats that eh
i thought you didnt have no friends
jefe goes into a fury
he swings his machete at xanders legs
xander jumps up grabbing on to the chain above and kicks jefe in the chest
jefe falls back and xander climbs up to the roof beam
he grabs onto the beam with his legs and unhooks his chain from the meat hook
he drops down six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed wrists and jefe comes charging at him
xander dodges a few wild swings
he grabs jefes pant cuff and dumps him on his ass
jefe scrambles to his feet drawing his pistol
xander swings his chain and whips the gun out of jefes hand
with another swing he wraps the chain around jefes neck and pulls it taught
you got em
jefe nods choking and reaches into his pocket
hand em to me
instead jefe hurls them out the window
i hope youre getting paid extra for this
xander jerks the chain slamming jefe head first into the wall
jefe drops knocked out
outside it sounds like a full scale firefight
xander gets the machete and cuts the ropes holding t
then a hail of bullets sprays through the room
all three guys hit the deck but t
he clutches his side blood all over his hands
theyre shooting for real
this is all real
xander knows this is true
he checks out t
help me with this guy
its like you said every man for himself
virg bolts for the door
that only works if youre a man
narcos are shouting running to and fro
tracer rounds cut through the air
they are trying to repel an unseen assault force
overhead six military helicopters buzz the compound like apocalypse now their night suns lighting up the place
xander comes out of the torture building holding t
in a firemans carry
his hands are still cuffed the length of chain dragging
xander crouches behind some equipment putting t
on the ground
i used to be a seal its not the first time ive been shot
keep your head down ill be right back
im gonna steal us some wheels
xander moves on finds cover under the camouflage netting
he can see narcos shooting into the trees at the unseen enemy
looking the other way he spots virg running back his way
hes been corralled by one of the helicopters
hes zigzagging trying to stay out of the beam of its night sun
xander darts out and grabs him pulling him under the camouflage netting
theyre all over the place
what the hells going on
looks like were in the middle of the drug war
the helicopter lights up the camouflage netting
theyre pinned down
free for all you go that way im gonna go this way
they cant follow us both
they squat down in runners stances the helicopter kicking up dust all around them
they jet off in opposite directions
xander books running for all hes worth
his cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult
hes heading straight into the field of pot plants
suddenly the massive spotlight picks him out
the chopper swoops down after him
its big gatling guns turn aiming right at him
the guns cut loose tearing up the ground right behind him
xander sprints the chopper after him like cary grant in north by northwest except instead of corn fields xanders running through a field of huge marijuana plants
xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him
xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants
all around him its a chaos of helicopters and gunfire
two choppers attack the factory building blasting it with their guns
narcos run terrified
xander notices a fat purple bud on the plant right in front of him
he snaps it off
im gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this
he tucks it into his shirt and takes off through the pot xander finally spots a vehicle
its a truck laden with bails of cocaine
he heads for it
then the spotlight finds him again and the chopper swings around
the gatling guns rip the plants to pieces all around him
xander hauls ass heading for the truck
bullets chew up the dirt all around him
as the helicopter passes overhead its guns rake the truck
there is a flash as the gas tank goes up
a supernova of fire and high grade coke erupts into the night air
xander dives into a drainage ditch
he tumbles down into a powdery cloud washes over him dusting the trees white
near him is a big drainpipe leeching sewage
xander crawls inside
the chopper makes another pass overhead
the big spotlight plays over the area then moves on
xander gives a sigh of relief
he crawls out of the drainpipe
jeeps race by on the road right above him as military men flood the compound
theres no going back
xander turns and makes his way along the tree line
the chopper and gunfire are in the distance now
things are quieter here and he starts to relax
as he goes by one of the trees moves
he takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on explodes upwards
arms reach out tackling xander from behind
another team of black ops soldiers bursts from the weeds the bushes all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape
they fall on him like a curtain
soldiers hold him down while a black hood is pulled over his head
as the massive hanger doors close we can see choppers taking off and landing
mexican soldiers load jefe and his narcos onto a federale bus
virg resists and is beaten
can be seen being loaded into an ambulance
the hanger doors slide shut with a thud
we see xanders hands as the chains are cut away
xander sits in a chair with the black hood still over his head
he blinks when the hood is torn off
a black ops soldier smirks as he walks away
xander looks around sees the black ops team unpacking some strange gear
two of them are dumping bottles of a clear liquid into a rusty clawfoot bathtub
nice of you to draw me a bath
is it saturday already
the black ops guys grin knowingly
on the other side xander sees a flight crew readying a gulfstream for travel
gibbons steps up from behind him
congratulations youve just graduated at the head of your class
youre a cold piece of work
you almost got three people killed out there
good thing you were there to save the day
come walk with me
xander gets up and gibbons leads him on a stroll around the youve really got me confused cage
on the one hand you showed leadership courage under fire a willingness to protect men you hardly knew
and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic
help me out here
im not following your evolution
you want the cheap backstory
the runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes
gimme a break
youre not interested in my past youre interested in my future as some kind of spy
youre perceptive too
i forgot to add that to the list of surprises
im with the national security agency
and unlikely as it may sound i need your help
im not interested
ive already got a job
youre an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary
you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and youre not getting any younger
i plan on getting a lot older
and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead
thats too bad
i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge
as they walk by the black ops guys xander sees theyre getting busy
one spreads out a plastic dropcloth
another plugs in a bone saw
youre gonna try to scare me now
gibbons grabs a chicken leg from a guy eating lunch
do you know the reason why i try to recruit guys like you
theres no risk
he tosses it into the tub
instantly it starts to sizzle and bubble
the tub is full of acid
theres nobody back home whos gonna ask questions if you just
disappear for a while
in seconds the entire leg has been consumed leaving only a oily cloud of residue
gibbons eyes him coldly nailing the point home
now im the one whos nauseous
so whats the deal
what do you need me for
theres some folks i want to keep tabs on
dirty tattooed uncivilized
your kind of people
what do i get out of it
if you find out what i want to know and if im able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life
if not you take a bath
youre one sick bastard
a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission
i think no matter which way i go im likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic
so heres my answer kiss my ass hop along
gibbons kicks the back of xanders leg and dumps him on his ass
gibbons was so quick xander never saw it coming
the black ops guys clap and cheer always interested in a fight
not bad for a gimp
whats with that x on the back of your head
does that mean youre extreme
ive got some news for you mr
x youre a three time loser
so maybe you should tattoo another couple of xs on your head
xander gets up
ill take that under advisement
maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and bars
i bet the flags a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs
gibbons lunges and grabs xanders throat in the vice like grip of his thumb and middle finger
one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus
believe me mr
x ive put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i dont feel the urge to stop just yet
so think carefully before you tell me is kiss my ass hop along your final answer
the fingers are so powerful that xander is paralysed
he looks over sees the bone saw start revving
gibbons releases his grip
i thought you might see it my way
then xander starts walking away
where you going x
i said where you going
the black ops guys grab weapons ready to stop him
you tell me
xander climbs up the steps of the gulfstream
there better be a movie on this goddam flight
xander sits with gibbons in big leather chairs
they are surrounded by nsa agents in suits
a nerdy agent snaps an anklet around xanders ankle
how about a pedicure as long as youre down there
wherever you go on the planet ill find you
theres no quitting
if you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground
is all that clear
yeah i spy or i die
orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge
theres a fully stocked bar a snack table all unused
thats because its been sealed off for nsa use
note perfect product placement opportunity for an airline
xander gibbons and his men are all silhouetted against the smoked glass windows
the nerdy agent hands xander a palm pilot sized electronic this is your communicator
youll identify yourself by a call sign
from here on out youre bulldog omega
you must stay up late to come up with shit like that
i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports
fine but im not gonna be no bulldog omega
gibbons checks his watch
they get up and start walking
the phalanx of agents surrounds xander and gibbons as they walk to the gate
the nerdy agent hurries to catch up
call signs derive from the parameters of the mission
if he doesnt like it we can make an exception just this once
well call him triple x
they walk past the gate down the jet way the agents flash badges to the gate workers
crude and defiant as always triple x
it fits so well because youre obscene
xander is the last one to board the plane
is that all
just remember ill be watching
as the door closes he looks back at gibbons and his phalanx of agents
ive got something for you to chew on
next time you send someone to save the world make sure they like the planet the way it is
the jets door closes
xander is in the last row against the bulkhead
hes got a personal dvd player and headphones and hes reviewing his mission
the high tech screen shows photos maps cool graphics
the kid sitting across the aisle leans over for a look
what game is that
slick graphics huh
see these dudes
theyre called anarchy theyre the bad guy bosses
do they have any special powers
the bosses always have special powers
you wanna check it out
the kid moves to the seat next to xander
onscreen see photos of the five bad guys from the opening sequence
we dive in to the computer as xander describes them
for each of the baddies well see d photos and video clips all enhanced with computer graphics and pop up menus
first weve got anders the psycho looking biker
in charge of transportation and smuggling
controls every trucking union in eastern europe
dont look too clean either
we see anders the wild eyed and unclean swedish biker against a backdrop of motorcycles and muscle cars
next we got a siberian redneck viktor
into snowmobiles and snowboarding
so naturally he covers prostitution and the drug trade
we see viktor with the goatee and belly doing some hairy snowboarding
this guys kinda dorky lookin
kirill the sniper
looks like a bookworm but he had confirmed kills in chechnya they called him the finger of god
assassination and weapons
we see kirill in uniform with his well used sniper rifle
whos the hottie
he indicates petra the tough gangster chick
with her leather and tattoos she looks like she could mop up the floor with lara croft
you like her huh
she runs their finances money laundering computers
joined the gang after spending some time as the girlfriend of this dude yorgi azar zimin
capo of anarchy
finally we see yorgi the unlikely looking mafiya don
we see crime scene photos that illustrate his exploits
yorgi masterminded the take over of three red mafiya clans
cops called it blood week
he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate anarchy
what are you gonna do
theyre euro trash
what weapons do you have
xander clicks on inventory
he scrolls through a staggering array of weapons and vehicles
just about anything i want it looks like
this is gonna be tough though
theres no way to save this game
i gotta get it right the first time through
what do you get if you finish
my guy is just doing it to stay alive
i bet by the end he gets something out of it
he gets to be the hero
the kids mom calls him back to his seat
xander looks at the kid then gets back to his research
we crane up from the cobblestone street as a beat up car races by
we rise up revealing prague in all its glory
xander sits in the back wedged between two identical looking tough guys
if you were to call central casting and ask for a couple of cold war spy types this is what theyd send
theyre both have sloppily cut hair square jaws wrinkled overcoats
this is bullshit man i wanna see some id
the two tough guys flash their cop ids
xander studies them
ivan pedgrag and ivan podrov
youre both named ivan
thats gotta be confusing on valentines day
so where we headed
fellas i said where we headed
beat yeah whatever
he looks out the window sees a grand hotel
they drive right on by
its a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town
xander shakes his head
james bond never had to put up with this shit
ivan pulls xanders gear bag from the trunk and throws it on the sidewalk
xander picks it up and carries it into the building
dumpy furniture roaches cracked windows
xander is ushered in
theres another guy in a ugly suit waiting
he is sit down
ive been on a plane for twelve hours i think ill stand
ivan shoves him into a chair
my name is slovo czech secret police
when you are here you are under my jurisdiction you take my orders you do what i say

three if you had the authority to shoot me you wouldve done it by now so just ease up on the machismo bitch
now that weve got that sorted out im gonna get some rest
xander lays down on the bed
slovo stares burning with hatred
he heads to the door
be ready in three hours
ivans stay staring at xander
a fancy flashy disco with an extreme sports theme
a big bouncer in a leather coat works the door
this is a highclass expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous
xander and slovo walk up to the place
xanders wearing a tshirt that says ron jeremy american legend complete with a photo of the hedgehog
a stripper that looks like a runway model slides across the stage on skateboard knee pads while patrons cheer
the disco is a combination strip club and concert venue
all the strippers are outfitted in helmets elbow pads g strings and belly shirts
theres a warped tour band playing on a stage
on either side of the stage are two mini half pipes that the girls are cutting back and forth on
wealthy businessmen sit in plush booths getting table dances while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed young xander gets a beer from a buxom cocktail waitress on in
line nice hops
slovo points them out in the far corner
theyre surrounded by straight faced bodyguards
what anarchy is doing in their booth with the strippers looks like led zeppelin on tour
booze broads good times
these guys are living like rock stars
theyre all here anders the biker viktor kirill
in the middle sit yorgi and petra
petras wearing an i am evil tshirt
see the one with the funny colored hair
crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee cap
there they are american
the low rent millionaire criminals
and you thought only your country had white trash
he looks around but xander is gone
he heads for the exit pushing his way through the crowd
but then he spots him not by the door but deeper in the club
he sees xander walk right up to the anarchy booth and start talking to them
slovo cant hear a thing but theyre obviously interested in what he has to say
next thing he knows xander is pointing at him and waving him over
horrified what the hell
slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth
yorgi looks him up and down
thats the guy
never seen him before
to slovo who you workin for
what do you do for a living dickhead
i work in insurance
xander grabs slovo and starts searching him
panicked whisper what the hell are you doing
he slams slovo up against the wall and pulls out slovos police badge
look what we have here
czech on the mack
the bodyguards pull out guns and slovo rushes for the emergency exit in a panic
in seconds hes out and gone
like a plague
no matter how many you pay theres always another with his hand out
how did you pick him out
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink
i appreciate you bringing this to our attention
whatever you want the rest of the night consider it on the house
yorgi waves over some strippers
thanks but im here on business
i heard youre the g around here
im looking for some cars expensive ones
a lot of them
sorry man dont know what youre talking about
im talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here
if you dont know about em who does
yorgi nods and the bodyguards step in front of xander
i guess i heard wrong
xander turns to leave
thats when anders notices the x tattoo on the back of xanders head
he gets excited and alerts yorgi
suddenly their whole demeanor changes
all five guys get up awed and push the bodyguards out of the way
the x man
we seen your bootleg videos
you sick crazy on a board on a bike
this is insane man
xander cage in prague
come on sit
sit with us
yorgi signals for more drinks
i remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour
when else are you gonna do it
you almost died on that one
cops arrested me while i was still in surgery
did two months
we seen all your shit
so you want cars
we get whatever cars you need
what are you looking for
high end pasta rockets
ten to start
we do that no problem
petra elbows anders
ten is hardly worth the effort
were talking a lousy million five u
i have japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet if you have the quality of merchandise theyre after
and its a mil two max
petra glances at yorgi who nods
do you know what a wire transfer is
is she for real
honey maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation
my goodness a word with four syllables
i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot
just chisel some off your heart
smiles so cute
he shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife
xander looks to yorgi
laughing dont look at me x she handles all the details
itll work faster if i have an account number
petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin
youll have forty eight hours to complete the transfer
dont waste our time
xander snatches the napkin
wouldnt dream of it
im even gonna throw in a few extra bucks to send you to charm school
petra glares at him
alright now that business is finished we party
we have a drink and toast the deal
yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth
anarchy lifts their glasses
xander joins in the toast
i believe i can hang with you fellas for a while
we see the feet of agent polk sprinting down the hallway
agent polk looks around spots gibbons
he rushes to him waving a communique
gibbons grabs the communique reads it
he looks up stunned
xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator into phone i guess you got my e mail
i set up a purchase
if youre trying to push my buttons youre on the right track
dont make me question my own judgment x
buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money
one point two million dollars
i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars
im already on a first name basis with these dudes i got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not
were not after car thieves here
what the hell am i after
youre telling me dick
that information is classified
youre there to gather information on their operations period
call me crazy but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side
you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too
my friend if youre planning on crossing me
i know poison needles in my shins
youve got hours
xander hangs up
gibbons stands before sams desk
sam scans over the communique
cut him off
im sorry gibbons you pulled up a shark this time
i think we should send him whatever he wants
a wire transfer of this size
if it means getting silent night back absolutely
youre talking about a very expensive risk here
hes gotten closer in hours than all of the other operatives combined
he got us an account number to boot
now even if hes just dumb and lucky i say we back his play
beat i put him out there sam
if he doesnt come up with the money theyll kill him
i cant let that happen
you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid werent you
alright do what you want
but keep the screws on him
hes a wild card
that could be either good or bad
so the odds are up to fifty fifty
i can deal with that
a helicopter comes flying in a man standing out on the strut
hes a disgruntled gadget wrangler from the nsa
his name is slovo and xander watch from a distance as a series of metal cases is unloaded by czech cops
slovo lets out a low whistle
your government must know something we dont
shavers walks up to them
hate those russkie choppers
rattle trap pieces of garbage
im agent shavers
toby lee shavers
im looking for whats his name
three x s
thats would be me
shavers gives him a disapproving look
you got someplace we can spread out my gear or what
i mean today
slovo gestures towards the stairs and shavers marches off muttering to himself
ill leave you two alone to talk
yeah thanks a lot
down in the basement there is a shooting range along one wall
a squad of czech cops is blasting away
they become distracted by the noise in the middle of the room
one of the metal boxes has been dropped by a cop
the rest are spread out in front of xander slovo and shavers
back off just go away you klutz
alright heres the story
the items in these cases belong to me
i designed them built them and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up
i stole your beat huh
guess you forgot to brown nose the right people
is that supposed to be funny
im not laughing
ive worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent funny boy
and ar the last minute i get bumped by you some reject from the ozzfest
why dont you show me some gear before you get hurt
listen to you
right away sir anything you say sir
shavers pops open the first metal case
inside are various gadgets laid into the molded carbon fiber lining
what is all this
i didnt even order some of this stuff
shavers holds up a small metal ball
youre gonna need it rookie trust me
the metal ball unrolls into a six legged robot insect
an all terrain mobile video monitoring system for surveillance
i call it the roach cam
see the little camera its got for a head
xander picks it up
kinda looks like you
shavers snatches it back
he puts on a metal glove its fingers are sharp talons
terminator climbing claws
he clamps the claw onto the metal case
it holds fast
miniature power cams set in on contact giving you a sure grip on any surface
they come in any other styles or colors
he tosses the glove aside pulls out a dart gun
this is your standard dart gun
that one im real familiar with
shavers displays a case of darts
youve got your chromium knock out dart microphone listening dart explosive dart even one with a splatter blood packet whatever you need
they also come in a special mm casing for use with your service pistol
xander pulls out some super binoculars
multi view binoculars
nine different enhanced vision modes plus a digital camera
xander looks through them starts cycling through the different modes
we see the various modes as xander scans the grounds
even a special penetrator mode to see through walls curtains almost anything
xander aims at the shooting range
we see through the clothes of the female cops on the shooting range
pg style of course
we can even see the inner workings of their guns
one of the female cops turns and gives xander an approving look
i think ill hang on to these
think again thats government property
you have to sign for everything
ive got one more that wasnt on your list
shavers pulls out a jumpsuit
from the beastie boys collection
its a stakeout suit
its got food water recording gear anything you need for covert spying
its all weather fire retardant and if you give this buckle a sharp pull the whole outfit deploys into a parachute
youre joking right
shavers just gives him a deadpan look
now that ive given you the overview were going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail
i thought that was in detail
as shavers drones on xander hangs his head
the ten black market european sports cars are loaded on two transport trucks
mafiya bodyguards keep watch
the ivans in teamster garb inspect the cars while xander supervises
anders hovers around him
so what you think
sitting in an office watching are yorgi kirill and petra
petra has a laptop
has it arrived yet
petra checks her computer
on screen shes monitoring their nothing
he had two days
perhaps he is not all he says he is
outside the ivans nod approval and xander heads to the office
yorgi looks to kirill who puts his hand on his pistol
xander opens the door
im somewhat less so
we seem to have a bit of a problem
just then petras computer beeps and the money floods into their account
xander holds up a cell phone and smiles
i had to inspect the merchandise first
he nods for kirill to stand down
outside the two transport trucks are driven off by the ivans
as they pull out they reveal another car under a cover
this is a gift
from me to you
anders pulls off the cover revealing a cherry pontiac its a little nothing you take it
xander checks out his new ride
yorgi gets in the passenger seat
come on get in
xander sits behind the wheel and starts it up
the big engine youre alright yorgi
next door to the warehouse sits an abandoned building
up on the sloped roof slovo spies down on the transaction
hes got a camera with a big zoom lens
slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured
to get a better vantage he jumps down onto a lower part of the roof
his foot breaks through the shabby roof tile
down below kirill hears the noise
they all look to the abandoned building
through the second floor window they can see slovos leg poking through the ceiling
xander is taken aback
what in the hell
yorgi turns to xander goes for his pistol
thinking fast xander does the same
they draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each others heads as they sit in the car
petra kirill and anders draw as well all of them covering xander
whats going on my friend
you tell me
you got a sniper up there or what
hes not with us xander
he must be with you
he cocks the hammer bullshit
you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god im gonna give you another hole to breathe out of
yorgi stares finally believes him
he lowers his gun
find out who he is
by now slovo is down the fire escape
he hits the ground and goes running down the street
the anarchy crew heads for their cars
xander spins the cylinder on his revolver
ive got him
the gto peels out
slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when xander comes skidding around the corner
he looks back and sees the speeding gto
thats the cop from the club
xander does the only thing he can
he puts the car sideways and aims out the window as he slides to a stop
slovo turns and blam
xander shoots slovo right in the chest
in slo mo a spray of blood erupts from his chest and slovo falls backwards his face frozen in a look of shock and betrayal
the smoking shell clatters to the ground
slovo blinks up at xander gasping for words then lays still
xander hops out rifles through slovos pockets
the other anarchy cars pull up the whole group looking on
what are you doing
get in the car
xander heads back to the gto and the cars peel out
the rest of anarchy follows behind the gto
i dont believe it
you cant shoot a cop in the middle of the street
grim had to do what i had to do
he pulls out the roll of film
you say you get a million you get the million
some cop gives us shit hes dead
jesus christ man youre hard core
the ivans pull up in their transport trucks
they see all the blood and rush towards slovo
but something doesnt look right
ivan tastes the blood and spits it out
ivan pulls a chrome dart from slovos chest
its a crowded basement rave club
hot and sweaty ravers dance in provocative outfits
the anarchy group is standing on the best booth right on the packed dance floor
surrounding them are a handful of mafiya bodyguards who stand at attention like the secret service
anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table smashing glass
a drunk guy tries to pull petra onto the dance floor and she punches him
the bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper thrashing
yorgi shatters a bottle against the wall
total chaos man
welcome to anarchy
its all this craziness
its what weve been living since when we left the army
one of our brothers died in grozny and we said the hell with this shit
he dies for what
you wanna see my politics
xander shows him a tattoo on his arm
it shows planet earth with a giant screw through it
screw the world
if im gonna die for something it better be bitches and money
thats what im talking about man
thats why anarchy was born
yorgi rolls up his sleeve revealing an anarchy tat a circled a with underneath
to us it means no walls no speed limits no jails
its everybody does what he wants
people think democracy is freedom but they dont have a clue
theres an old punk song
it says america stands for freedom but if you think youre free
try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese
anarchy burger by the vandals
you got it man
its stupid but its true
true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want
thats when you know youre living man
how you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere
you get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss
yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor
the xed out ravers swat it around like confetti
you hang with us buddy taste some freedom
dance with this guy
yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd leaving xander alone with petra
she gets up grumpily and starts dancing
xander joins her but she wont even look at him
this is great dancing with the back of your head
she reluctantly turns around
if you got a problem with me why are we dancing
yorgi asked me to
you do everything yorgi says
go to hell
its gonna be like that huh
you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else
mind your business
did you guys used to date
thats it right
he broke your heart and youre still soft on him
thats funny it dont seem to fit with a tough broad like you
she glares at him and walks away
where are you going
why are you still hanging around
your business is finished you should go home
i was invited
whats your story
i dont know who you are or where you come from but i dont like you
you ask too many questions
theres a big line outside the ladies and no line at the mens
petra heads into the mens room
some dude whistles at her
she pushes him out of the way and enters a stall
xander leans on the sink
come on dont front like that
youll put a guy right off you
dont even bother x man im not your type
the stall door flies open and petra marches out
my chest is too small and my brain is too big
she shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall
xander walks back out shaking his head and laughing
across the room viktor shoves the d
out of the way and puts on anarchy burger by the vandals
the rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat
xander check it out
the revolution begins
viktor and anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit
xander cant help it he actually likes these guys
lets get some air man
yorgi and xander head outside
a moment later kirill hurries out another door
yorgi and xander stroll along the river
you got a great set up here yorgi
you really know how to live
its a beautiful town prague
its been good to me
ive been here before when i was a kid
my old man was in the service we used to live on the army base in hamburg
you an army brat
i dont see that one at all
did you join the service as well
my dad was a straight up tin soldier
somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged
had a court martial and everything
the charges were total bullshit so he was sure hed get his name cleared but it didnt happen
connections and politics its the same everywhere
my old man he bought into the system and it screwed him
so he swallowed a bullet
me i dont believe in nothing i cant see and touch
the camera suddenly zooms across the city flying over streets and houses until half a mile away it finds kirill in a window with his sniper rifle
through scope xanders head is in the crosshairs
the scope pans over to yorgi who looks into camera and gives a small signal calling off the hit
yorgi looks up at a prague peace conference banner
next week these idiots are having a peace conference here
what the hell are they going to talk about
its the system itself that causes all the worlds problems
youre okay buddy
come on its getting early
they stroll off and kirill stands down
a flotilla of vehicles xanders gto among them drives through the gate in a massive stone wall
its a big manor house in the middle of town
the gto sedans suvs park in the courtyard
xander sees a row of motorcycles parked here as well
xander also sees a guard hit a switch that lowers the heavy yorgi corrals a bunch of strippers hes brought home
this way girls lets go
he leads the whole troop inside
as they go down the hall xander sees rooms full of office workers and mafiya goons
diversified global operations
the sun never sets on our empire
xander takes in world maps fax machines banks of computers
for all their screwing around its clear anarchy runs a large operation
with leaded glass windows overlooking the river this place is beautiful
inside its done up more like the house from mtvs real world except trashed
theres cool fish tanks a pool table ps on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes all over the walls
servants welcome them with food and yorgis secretary gives him important messages
sorting through messages not bad yes
the original owners they just one day decide to move out
anders starts pounding on a drumset
petra kicks a soccer ball at him
yeb vas zopa
yorgi paws at a stripper
ive got meetings this afternoon ive got to get some sleep
just pick a girl
thats alright im kinda tired
you want to insult me
this is my hospitality
xander points at one of the strippers
shes wearing a fashionable flak jacket
good now find a room to crash in
petra show him
the surly petra opens a door revealing a hall of doors
xander and flak jacket follow
you gonna tuck us in
she just gives him a nasty look walks into her room and slams the door
xander scratches his head and picks a room
the others shuffle off to their beds with their strippers
flak jacket is out of sight in the bathroom
xander talks to her while he gets undressed
listen no offense but im not in the market right now okay
you can stay here but lets not he trails off as she steps out of the bathroom
shes wearing just a g string and the flak jacket
you dont understand a word im saying do you
she just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off
she looks at the engagement ring still pierced through his nipple and gives a puzzled look
thats what i was trying to tell you
i just got out of this heavy thing
she kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall pg style
the things i have to do for my country
he gives in and starts making out with her
xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail
behind him we can see flak jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets
anders is snoring on the floor
xander skirrs around him and goes through another door
xander finds an office and starts going through the desk
he finds a palm pilot and snaps a recording device to the bottom
in seconds hes copied everything on it
he moves on to some drawers
what are you doing
he turns sees petra standing in the doorway with a gun
looking for a phone book
i want to call a cab
unless you wanna give me a ride
she shuts the door advances staring him down
who are you
we hung out last night remember
i also remember you drove your car here
who are you really
make no mistake i will shoot you and not feel bad about it
who are you working for
hey take it easy
im just a dude trying to make a buck
she slaps him hard
i see you look at everything study everything ask questions
i know exactly what youre doing
empty your pockets
youve got to relax baby youre paranoid
she slaps him again and xander goes for her gun
before he can pry it from her hand shes pulled another gun from nowhere and has it jammed against his neck
he lets go
hey youre good
maybe we should start again yes
i know so little about you except that youre not what you say you are
that makes two of us then sweetheart because i aint buying your bullshit either
youre not like them i can see it in your eyes
so you tell me whos bullshitting who
there are three strippers asleep in bed
yorgi is sitting at his computer in his underwear
hes hacked in to the czech police network
something bothers me about you mr
he looks around a bit doesnt find what hes looking for
he sits up getting pissed
she heads out
yorgi goes to the bathroom splashes water on his face
kirill enters still half asleep
whats the problem
im inside the police mainframe
do you see anything
kirill studies the screen while yorgi pulls on clothes
ive searched their e mail
no funeral announcement no obituary no call to arms
nothing on the news even
i swear i saw a cop get shot yesterday
how come no one is talking about it
kirill looks back at the screen
i also check the wire transfer
i follow the money back to its source but there is no source
it comes from nowhere
first they bring cia then british sas now maybe they plumb the lower depths
maybe now they send someone who looks like us
maybe someone like our houseguest mr
petra still has the gun on xander
i dont know what youre talking about
the eyes dont lie
all this has gotten to you hasnt it petra
you came in as yorgis girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun
now you dont like it so much but youre in so deep you cant get out anymore
tell me if im wrong petra
go to hell
look at you
youre helping run things now
youre a gangster
i bet that snuck up on you
you woke up one day and you were a criminal
she pulls back the hammer on her gun
its cool i feel you
i might even be able to help
here let me show you something
you wanna see whats in my pocket ill show you
he makes a move and she jabs the gun at him
she reaches into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data recorder
what are you
im an information gatherer
you wanna go somewhere and talk about it
yorgi creeps down the hall kirill in tow
they both screw silencers onto their pistols
they flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to burst into xanders room
they kick in the door and aim their guns around
flak jacket sits up terrified
yorgi and kirill lower their guns
viktor stumbles by in his underwear
where is he
they went to breakfast
this is a beautiful and historic prague location with windows and a nice view
its rather fancy and packed with upscale patrons
petra and xander sit in the middle of the room sticking out badly in their grungy clothes
a waiter takes their order
perogies potato pancakes fried goose livers the sausage plate and a pot of turkish coffee
xander shakes his head
im just gonna have a garden salad
oil and balsamic vinegar on the side
the waiter takes off
petra puffs on a cigarette staring at xander
thats how you eat
its like a gerbil
shrugs im from l
so why dont you tell me something about who you gather information for
they obviously have very deep pockets
are you from a rival clan
lets just say im freelancing and leave it at that
whoever sent you knew what they were doing
you and yorgi are practically twins
two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but dont say much
dont judge a comic book by its cover
you agree with a lot of what he says dont you
i know where hes coming from
the only thing i really dont get is why he dumped you
up until i found that out i thought his judgment was pretty sound
dont even start
ill be honest i dont trust you
bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that i want to leave
what can you do about it
the people i know want facts the kinds of things an insider would know
theyre interested in putting anarchy out of business
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts
we could work together
then maybe we could both get the hell out of here
theres a beach in bora bora with my name on it
a beach named x
that id like to see
so there you have it
i guess you just have to ask yourself how bad to you want out
she thinks on it
then her cell phone rings
into phone da
on phone listen very carefully petra
we think cage may be an american agent do you understand what im telling you
into phone yes
on phone dont worry ive got your back
im right across the street above the bakery
just bring him outside and let me do the rest
kirill hangs up
she looks back at xander shell shocked
is there a problem
she studies his eyes decides to risk it
they tell me youre an american agent
what are you talking about
theres no more time for games
they made you
theres a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye
tell me if its true
its a long story but yeah more or less
youre going to have to go out the back
the data that you copied with your toy
tomorrow at six oclock
look it up
were taking a trip
be there at six and youll have plenty to tell your people
if i go out the back hell know youve warned me
thats alright ill figure something out
not an option
just get up slowly like everythings cool
petra trust me
you just hung yourself out to dry for me im not gonna let you down
kirill lays on his stomach peering into the scope of his p
through scope he can faintly see them inside the crowded restaurant
xander and petra are making their way towards the exit
nice and easy petra
they work their way through the lunchtime crowd
i cant let this happen
i want you to go out the back
ill make up some excuse
theyll kill you you know they will
besides there is no back door
xanders timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the door a bus passes by
kirill keeps focused waiting for the bus to pass
through scope xanders head is sporadically visible through the bus windows
kirills finger tightens on the trigger
as soon as the bus passes he fires
but xanders not there hes ducked down to tie his shoe
the glass door behind him shatters
feigning surprise xander punches petra in the face and sprints down the block
he runs bent low the parked cars protecting him from the sniper
kirill fires anyway taking out car windows
at the end of the block is a long staircase with a metal rail down the middle
as he runs by an outdoor restaurant xander snatches the serving tray from a startled waiter sending food and drink flying
he hops on the serving tray like its a skateboard and does a rail slide down the length of the stairs
hes moving too fast for kirill
he jumps off at the bottom and the tray pops up into the kirill blasts it like a clay pigeon
by now xander is out of sight
kirill pounds his rifle in frustration
petra gets to the top of the stairs
she gives kirill a where did he go
her nose is bloody helping to sell her performance
then she turns and looks off after xander
she sees his gto speeding away
were looking down at a ship moving through the fjord seen from high above
its towing a smaller boat behind it
no were at the top of the trollveggen norways legendary troll wall
its a near foot sheer drop to the ocean
six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff
they wear webbed squirrel jumpsuits helmets and parachutes
on each thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced mp sub machine guns
together they stare down at the ship
petra is among them
she looks down at her watch
it is precisely pm
she glances around
the top of the cliff is rocky and flat
xander is nowhere to be seen
fifty yards away we see xander sneaking forward military style
hes got his stakeout suit on and is keeping low
the members of anarchy put on their goggles and without saying a word they leap off the troll wall
xander runs to the edge and looks down
he sees the group freefailing down the sheer cliff face
the six plummet away from him at incredible speed
in a hard arch they peak at m
then using the webbed wings under their arms and between their legs they go into aerodynamic track positions and rocket away from the wall
like dark angels they soar out over the water in formation
the ship below is a scientific research vessel
on the deck a few sailors and scientists watch the sun set
the six dark figures close in rapidly
at the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide towards the ship
a sailor looks up and spots them
before he can shout hes shot in the leg and goes down
seconds later theyre on the deck tearing off their rigs
they race across the deck taking over the ship in a surgical manner
they herd everyone back heading for the bridge
petra hangs back
she looks back at the cliff up towards xander
through his super binoculars we see them storming the bridge
as they head inside they disappear from view
xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars
lets see whats going on inside
now he can see through the walls of the ship
he sees the crew herded into a room and locked in by anarchy
anarchy seals the door locking the crew away
they slap five and bump chests still totally amped up
angle on a large submersible vehicle
its white and twelve feet long
there are motors on either side and a panel of solar cells on the top of a periscope like projection rising from the back
this is the ahab device
it sits in the wet well at the back of the ship ready to be launched out the back sea doors
ready the boat
there is a smaller boat moored to the back of the ship
kirill and viktor hop onto its deck
they start to whistle as they work
sounds like the andy griffith theme
he takes digital photos of the ahab device
what the hell are you guys stealing
the smaller boat is launched and ready to do
yorgi goes to the wet well controls and hits a switch
the aft doors open letting water into the wet well
in seconds ahab starts to float
anders loosens it from its moorings and they tie ahab to the back of the smaller boat
yorgi hits another switch opening the ballast doors on the port side of the ship
air flows out causing the ship to list to one side
what are you doing
it all happened so fast
such an unfortunate accident
yorgi machine guns the wet well control panel
they climb onto the boat
petra is the last to board
she looks up towards xander and machine guns the panel some more making sure he notices
he sees the smaller boat pulling away the ahab device being towed behind
he pans over and zooms in on the shot up control panel
what the hell
he pans over to the wet well and sees its flooding
with the ballast open on only one side the ship starts listing
the thing is going down
he pans over clicks into penetrator mode and sees the crew pounding on the walls below decks
theyre trapped their wrists and ankles bound with plexi cuffs
xander puts down the binoculars and gets up
no way man no way
im just supposed to be an observer
this job sucks
he pats his jumpsuit checking for the buckle
toby lee shavers if this thing dont work your ass is kicked
xander steels himself takes a few deep breaths
then he sprints to the edge and jumps off the cliff
and thats it
one mile straight down
suddenly were falling with him
we hear the rush of air as he free falls a dozen feet from the craggy rock face
the force of the wind ripples his cheeks
he streamlines himself into a track position and jets away from the cliff like superman
before he gets too low he rips the buckle
immediately his jumpsuit tears off his body in multiple layers unfurling into a full sized parasail
xander looks up at his parasail relieved and glides towards the ship
petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep yorgi from spotting it
she grabs him suddenly and kisses him
what was that for
id forgotten how exciting it is working together
youve been so quiet lately petra i thought you no longer cared
why dont we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline
stay the course
yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below
xander comes in for a perfect landing
he lands on the listing deck and undoes his harness
he sees several wounded scattered on the deck
son of a bitch
he looks across the water sees the smaller boat far away
petra looks back one last time catching sight of xander on the deck of the ship
she smiles relieved
then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the price
xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in
with the ship listing like this the water is pouring below decks
xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold
here is where the entire crew has been left to drown
they are struggling to stay above water their hands and feet bound
as the far end of the room is another hatch
water pours in from this one and xander has to get it shut
he swims through the struggling crew spots the captain holding his young son above water
the water is rising rapidly filling up the compartment
xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and pushes but the force of the water is too much
hes got to wait until the room floods before he can close that door
he watches as the crew goes into a panic the water rising up to the ceiling
they are gasping in the last foot of air thats available
he sees the captains son crying and clutching at his father
xander takes a deep breath and dives down
he grabs the hatch door braces his feet and pulls
his muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings xander surfaces and swims to the ladder
he cuts the captains plastic cuffs
is the boy alright
i will cut the others loose you must run the bilge pumps
the captain takes the knife and swims to free his men
xander takes the captains son and climbs up the ladder
xander scans the controls but has no idea what hes looking for
the captains son shows him the right switch
the son nods and xander flips the switch
motors start to the bilge pumps spew out water furiously
crew members come up from below decks
they are soaked and grateful
they go about tending to the wounded as xander slumps down next to the exhausted captain
you get a lot of broads with that uniform
they both laugh relieved as the ship slowly rights itself
xander is in a room with the scientists from the ship
they have blueprints of the torpedo spread out
the captains son is wrapped in blankets shivering
xander is talking to gibbons on his communicator
into communicator they call it ahab its a solar powered submersible
it can circumnavigate the globe on its own
they use it to track and study the migration patterns of whales
gibbons jots down the information furiously
you did say ahab
youre sure about that
yeah i sent you pictures
heres what im thinking
if they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing
you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later its swimming up the potomac
this is good work x damn fine work
you need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this ahab
hey one miracle at a time
theyre on to me now remember
im gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you
just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives
you done yourself proud helping those people today
xander tussles the hair of the captains son
youre a grungy little phoenix you know that
keep up the good work
you aint seen nothing yet
the gto screeches into the lot
shavers is on his way out with his suitcase
weve got work to do
pan over weapons theyre all laid out on the floor
machine guns mines rockets belts of ammo
we finally arrive at xander leaning on his gto
he sparks a blowtorch and lights a cigar
i want all that
he pats the gto in there
shavers looks on in shock
hes got a crew of mechanics with him
xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away
this is a beautiful open air market in a town square surrounded by old buildings
the place is packed
in the midst of it all we make out petra moving through the crowd
she stops to look at some vegetables when xander passes by her
right behind you
they keep talking pretending to shop
so whats the plan with this ahab
are they selling it or what
no something worse
he says its a surprise but i know him
this is his masterpiece
weve got to find out what it is
can you handle that
beat theres something i didnt have time to tell you before
im a agent as well
ive been undercover for over a year
what the hell have you been doing
i dont know
eight months ago i stop hearing from my people
no explanation just silence
so i stay and i wait like i was told
soon im in so far theyd kill me if i left
now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was
im like you said a criminal
im busted up for you but jesus what the hell are you doing
those people almost drowned on that boat and you didnt lift a finger
this stings her
she knows well the price she paid
no i guess ive been no help at all to you
get your head back in the game
there are lives at stake here
ill do what i can
i have to go before they notice
when can i see you again
you cant its too risky
im not much help anyway remember
then shes off into the crowd
the craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows
xander approaches and flattens himself against it
hes all in black packed with weapons and sporting a combat vest
he grabs a toehold on the wall and zoom
he speed climbs up the side
he reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house
video cameras patrolling guards
its not gonna be easy
xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below
xander places an explosive on a control box
he waits for a guard to stroll by and then slips through a basement window
xander makes his way through a series of rooms
finally he finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the cavernous basement of the manor
laid out below he can see the ahab device hanging from chains
techies are working with the anarchy crew to retrofit the thing
they are installing a launcher rack of ten tubes
xander cant hear a thing through the thick glass
he takes a metal ball from his pocket
theres a sink in the corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain
we follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and down into the wall
the pipe zigzags around like a rollercoaster and then levels off
the ball rolls past a t intersection stops and unrolls like a pill bug
six metal legs appear and we see its the roach cam
it scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn
were close on a sink as the roach cam comes up the pipe
it scurries into hiding just as a hand reaches in to turn on the water
the roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we push in on its video camera head
we see a handheld video image of viktor
okay fire one
viktor pushes a button on ahab and a vodka bottle launches from tube one shattering against the ceiling
pull back to reveal xander watching the image on his communicator
using a joystick hes able to control the roach
he steers the camera towards petra gets a low angle shot of her legs in a punked out catholic school girl skirt
he smiles enjoying himself
great piece of hardware
he plugs his earpiece in and listens in
petra works on a computer controller
the roach scurries across the floor circling to get a better look at ahab
anders pushes a cart holding ten glass canisters of liquid
each canister is separated in two with a black liquid on top and a white liquid on the bottom
he hands the canisters to viktor one by one
singing silent night
holy night viktor laughs and joins in
then kirill looks down and spots the roach cam
he stomps it with his boot
xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear
he looks down into the room sees kirill bending down to examine the roach
time to go
kirill lifts the dead roach and sees its wires
theres some bullshit going on
yorgi hits an alarm switch alerting the guards
the anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the house
the anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced close combat maneuvers
cueing each other with hand signals they run through each room weapons ready
xander sprints down the hallway
with the anarchy boys and guards roaming the house hes having a hard time finding his way out
he runs into a darkened dining hall sprints across only to find the opposite door locked
he hides behind one of the many columns as his pursuers enter the room
kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of night vision goggles
he scans the big room but sees nothing
xander hidden at the opposite end waits breathlessly
kirill advances slowly his buddies covering him from the door
xander my friend that can only be you
why dont we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends
how would you like to come to work for us instead
we could rage against the machine together
across the room xander sees a small window leading to the courtyard
he has to run across open ground to reach it
he calls out to yorgi
speaking of people that are full of shit funny you should mention those guys
xanders voice echoes around the empty hall making it impossible to pinpoint
they put their records out through sony one of the biggest corporate machines on the planet
some revolutionaries huh
he pulls out his gun as kirill creeps ever closer
against the far wall xander spots a fire extinguisher
come on youre the one whos fooling yourself
why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a future that is truly free
kirill is almost on top of him
xander sights up and fires
the fire extinguisher explodes blinding kirill
xander makes a run for it
everyone fires wildly except for petra bullets tearing tapestries off the walls
xander dives and crashes through the window
xander tuck and rolls comes up running
guards are running around unsure just what the hell is going on
xander hops on one of the trials motorcycles parked nearby and fires up the engine
he hits a remote switch and blam
the explosive charge he left earlier blows up
he points the bike at a set of stone stairs
they form a ramp that he can use to jump the wall
he guns the engine
a guard races across the wall with a rifle taking aim
xander races and jumps the bike over the wail
as he goes by he does a can can aerial kicking the guard off the wall before he can shoot
the anarchy guys run outside just in time to see him go
he blew the gate control
get the bastard
anders fires up the other trials bike slings a submachine gun across his back and goes up and over
petra watches him go hoping for the best
note action will be re choreographed based on actual locations
any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated by a physical reason xander blazes down the street anders racing right behind him
a wrong turn sends him into a dead end
at the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall
xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of the truck and onto its roof
balancing on the rear wheel he hops onto the wall
the machine gun blasts again
xander drives off along the top of the wall
anders shoulders his gun and follows
they are riding a high wall thats only a foot wide
they make several degree turns racing above a sleeping neighborhood
xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes a detour
he hops onto the second floor balcony of a building under construction workers bolt out of the way as the motorcycle leaps into their building
xander pops a wheelie and slams through a blueprint table
anders follows demolishing their snack table
xander darts through the building between beams and x s until he reaches a skeletal staircase
more workers appear at the bottom of the stairs so xander goes up
he cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes onto the roof
xander looks around for a way out
the next building isnt that far away
he revs up and jumps across
anders jams another magazine into his sub machine gun and follows xander
they jump from roof to roof down a descending series of rooftops towards the river
anders pulls up alongside as they race towards that last apartment building
neck and neck they head for the brink
at the last jump xander pulls up behind anders
they hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel
anders clamps on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop xander right behind him
they skid to a stop at the very edge with anders balanced on his front wheel
he looks down sees street five stories below
he glances back at xander sweat beading struggling to keep his balance
xander observes him coolly totally in control
anders reaches for his machine gun
xander pops a wheelie and rams anders over the edge
the bike tumbles and pancakes into the pavement
anders tears through several awnings before slamming into the ground
xander turns and rides to the next apartment building
he hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually take him to street level
as he makes his way down anders stirs
the guy is a bloody broken mess but he gets to his feet
he sees where xander is headed and he scurries off to intercept him
xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley
the only way out is fenced in
but theres a ramp leading up to a loading dock
xander will have to use that ramp to jump the fence
anders climbs to the second floor of the building
there is a small crane arm loaded with metal
if he pushes it at the right time it will swing out and knock xander from his bike
he giggles maniacally blood dripping
xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump
anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out
in slow motion the bike leaves the ramp and soars up over the fence
the crane arm swings out on a collision course with xander
xander sees it and throws himself off the bike grabbing onto the back in a superman seat grab
he passes right underneath the swinging crane arm
anderss face falls when he sees xander go by hanging on with one hand
in his other hand xanders got his pistol
xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands
he stops sees anders bloody helmet come bouncing into the alley
he tucks his pistol away and roars off
xander comes up the stairs and sees lights on in his apartment
he draws his gun and pushes the door open
slovo is sitting in the armchair
dude what are you doing here
you killed me remember
now i have to hide out here with you
where have you been
xander holsters his gun searches around for his communicator
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with
theyve got a of nerve agent theyre gonna unleash
is this what youre looking for
xander turns to see slovo waving the communicator
yeah give it here
slovo raises his pistol
stunned beat whats the deal
oh come on dont feel bad
you got played so what
youre new at this
did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out
why you dogging me up
shrugs they came and found me
they said theyd kill me unless i help them
plus they offer me a lot of money
no big deal
these things happen
dump your gun on the floor
xander does so
where do you want it
the head to be quick
or the chest for an open casket
suddenly gunfire blasts through the closed door
bullets shatter a lamp a picture and finally tag slovo in a wild salvo
slovo crumples never knowing what hit him
the door creaks open
its petra her gun still smoking
shes with the ivans
are you alright
what the hell are you doing
you couldve killed me
shrugs i heard you talking
i could tell where you were in the room
i dont know whats going on anymore
i thought i was square with that dude
now everybodys switching sides like its the wwf
the ivans go to slovos body kicking the gun from his hands
one of them spits on his corpse in disgust
what are you doing with the ivans
i know which cops are good and which are bad
come with me
come on right now
she drags him to the door
the beautiful and historic st
charles bridge spans the river
there are banners hanging in celebration of the coming prague peace conference
petra leads xander across it
where are we going
were getting out of this place
weve done enough
wait a minute whoa
we cant go now
whats yorgi got planned with that nerve agent
it doesnt matter anymore forget it
of course it matters
hey hold on
what do we owe our governments
yours kidnapped you mine abandoned me
petra this aint about the people that sent us here you know that
no now its about us
lets do something for us before we both get killed
dont you want to get to bora bora xander
we cant leave now
we have to do something
youre the one who believes in nothing
screw the world or whatever you said
xander grabs her by shoulders
alright so i was full of shit
i thought believing in things was wrong
turns out believing in nothing is worse
you might as well be dead
im not thrilled with the world but im not gonna let those idiots start killing people
come on youre a cop weve got to get these guys
hes gotten through to her
she nods in agreement
to a fortress in the mountains
well have to go after them
arent you afraid
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head
maybe thats my problem
if you dont feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you cant imagine
i must be healthy then because im scared to death
i guess id better get back to yorgi
you dont have to do that
yes i do
i cant just let him go free
besides i can help you from the inside
arent they gonna wonder were youve been
shrugs i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop
theyll believe me
beat ive been lying for so long one more time wont hurt
when this is over were just gonna take off the two of us
take a vacation
what the hell are we doing
were doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we havent even slept together yet
xander kisses her
that gives us something to live for
together they walk back across the bridge
we crane up revealing the prague peace conference banners all over a big building on the river
we see a craggy gnarly mountain
the front side is a rock strewn near vertical drop
then we see xander come scaling up from the back side
hes got gear strapped to his back and it looks like its been a helluva climb
xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath
its beautiful up here
he pulls a collapsible snowboard off his back hits a switch and the thing switchblades out to full size
he clamps it on his feet
xander moves to the edge and peers down
at the bottom of the mountain he can see the castle an imposing medieval fortress in the snow
he leans over the edge and starts down the mountain
he doesnt get far before he notices something else
he slides to a stop on the near vertical face clinging to rocks for balance
on the mountain below him between him and the castle is a guard outpost
right now hes in full view and hes been spotted
he sees guards scrambling out hopping on snowmobiles
from up here they look like ants
viktor the goateed cold weather warrior strides out of the outpost and looks up the mountain
he shouts orders to his men
a guard runs up and brings him his weapon a flame thrower
viktor straps it on and
climbs onto his snowmobile
all around him the guards are driving into position
they form a gauntlet of ak s
there must be a dozen of them
viktor rides up twenty yards and waits his engine idling
he squints up at the speck that is xander
xander pulls a concussion grenade from his jacket
nothing like fresh powder
he puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade
then he tosses it over his shoulder
the grenade lands in the snow above him and starts rolling downhill towards him
xander pushes off and starts bombing down the mountain
the grenade bounces after him and then wham
it goes up with a tremendous shock
there is a shift in the snow a groan of shifting weight then the entire cornice cracks loose and topples over the brink
xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at his heels
from down below its an awesome sight
the slack jawed guards watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them
shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer they can see xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face
theres a mad scramble as guards turn their snowmobiles and ride for their lives
a furious viktor spins around and makes a run for it as well
nobody has a chance
the avalanche is coming like a freight train frothing like white water
xander blazes right through the scrambling guards and hits a jump
he goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof of the outpost
the avalanche is right behind him slamming down everything and everyone in its way
guards are swallowed up and tossed snowmobiles go tumbling under the onslaught
xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over the outpost
he holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a stop
then its all quiet
above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble
theres nothing moving up there anymore
xander pulls himself free
then he hears a gushing sound and a deep beneath the surface he sees the warm orange glow of flame
its viktor and his flame thrower
theres another spurt and the glow fades for good
xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath
hes right above the castle now
then his communicator starts to into communicator gibbons long time no talk
you wouldnt believe my day
what the hell has been going on triple x
how about a status report
xander looks down on the castle
there seem to be mafiya henchmen all over the grounds
snow covered fortress
army of bad guys
im on the way with a team to relieve you
whats the latest
they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher
they were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate
something tells me this it that classified stuff you didnt want me to know about
does the song silent night mean anything to you
yes it does
come on gibbons you can do better then that
silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent
the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated
the black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud
when it settles down to earth itll kill everything in the vicinity
jesus christ gibbons this is something we came up with
yeah thats right
so now that you know you understand why its important that we get it back
kinda funny though isnt it
were not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway
guess we shoulda played by the rules
somebody else makes those decisions not guys like you and me
youve done your job x head back to prague
ill be landing in minutes
this is my operation now
we dont have that kinda time boss i dont think pragues gonna be around much longer
ive gotta go now
ive got a lot of bad guys to kill
xander hangs up and heads down the hill
a guard patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle
he stops for a smoke when xander walks right up to him
with two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps walking
hes a man on a mission
he runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall
theres no hand holds its a perfectly flat climb
a canyon of rocks is below
xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the terminator climbing claws
he pulls on the metal gloves and claws into the solid rock
just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface
we see him outlined against the mountains steadily making this impossible climb
at the top is an overhang
its a gnarly transition
as hes rounding it his feet slip
his legs dangle over the rocky chasm below
using all his strength he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws
at the top a guard leans over aiming his gun at him
xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge
the guard falls into the chasm
xander rolls onto the parapet exhausted
then another guard rushes him grabbing for his rifle
xander springs the claws lashing out and tears the gun from his hands
with the other hand he slashes taking the guard down
he pulls off the claws and heads into the guard tower
xander exits the guard tower at the ground level
as he crosses the courtyard an explosion rocks the tower he just left
there is shouting as guards race around the parapets unsure where the attack is coming from
a guard runs up to xander
in russian whats going on
xander clotheslines him and catches his ak as he drops
up inside the castle he can see yorgi at a window
yorgi appears mildly shocked as they make eye contact
xander takes aim
from up above kirill has xander in his sights
the bullet hits xanders ak sending it spinning
xander rubs his sore hand but stays put
kirill could have killed him and he knows it
from a doorway comes yorgi with some guards
yorgi walks up and smashes xander in the face
that was for anders
dont forget goatee boy
i greased him up on the diamond run
yorgi punches him again
petra sits at a desk working on a laptop
yorgi enters with xander and kirill
look who we found playing outside
petra looks up
she can barely hide her shock
petra my sweet dove do you notice anything strange about x
he looks slightly less than dead
kirill aims his gun at petra
yorgi i thought he was yorgi slaps her
do you think i didnt know about you all along
my contacts in the kgb told me you were coming
you show up undercover and i must admit you play your part to the hilt
when its time to be cruel you are cruel
when its time to be passionate you are very very passionate indeed
petra is devastated by this revelation
i could have killed you but i thought this would be so much more fun
to twist you and use you how i see fit
and to be honest you went much farther than i ever expected you would for your country
he runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to xander
why do you have such a problem staying away my friend
did you miss us that much
i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls
not bad man not bad
you put things together quick
prague it is
the peace conference
nice place to start dont you think
whats the gimmick yorgi
thats the part i dont get
you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs
i didnt think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche
you think im after money
i told you my friend
time for a change
money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves
so all by yourself youre going to destroy every government in the world
easier than that buddy
ill get them to destroy each other
you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay
then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour
london cairo beijing
pretty soon everyones involved
these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys
soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days
no rules no law everybody free to do what they want
including rape pillage murder
sure if thats what you want
its all human nature
so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it
and here i thought anarchy was just something cool to put on a tshirt
come on xander
you used to stand for something
what happened to you man
i thought youd get it
dont you see x
for the betterment of humanity hes going to start world war three
hes a regular humanitarian
and all this time i thought he was just a tool
you both could have been a part of it
you could have ridden with us into a new day the dawning of a new age of oh just shoot us already
im sorry i asked
yorgis eye twitches
screw you too buddy
he raises his gun and suddenly booooom
a massive explosion rocks the whole castle
shrapnel shatters the windows spraying glass and yorgis shot goes wide
the front gates have just been blown apart
through the smoke and wreckage come ivans with a platoon of crack czech secret police
their submachine guns rattle in threeshot bursts sweeping guards from the parapets
kirill looks down at the carnage below
xander takes advantage of the distraction and charges at yorgi
yorgi goes to shoot but his hand wont work
theres a huge shard of glass sticking through his forearm
by the time he pulls it out xander is on top of him
he body checks yorgi sending him flying over a desk
kirill spins and starts firing
xander ducks for cover
the czech secret police are having their way
they cross the courtyard and burst into the main building
the police whip through the building like lightening mowing down everyone in their path
one czech secret policeman is wounded and the others retaliate with a volley of rpgs that evaporates a pocket of resistance
in the main room upstairs kirill is blasting away
yorgi starts rounding up the computer gear
hurry up kill him
before kirill can do so cops burst into the room spraying bullets everywhere
xander and petra are pinned down but yorgi and kirill manage to make a fast exit out another door
were on your side
the cops keep shooting
ivan is talking on the radio when yorgi appears behind him and shoots him in the back
they step over him and enter a garage
the ahab device is in the back of a flatbed truck
yorgi and kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear
the truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across the courtyard
police open fire but the truck tears out the gate and starts heading down the mountain
meanwhile xander and petra are still pinned down
tell them something
petra starts calling out in russian
finally the cops stop shooting
xander and petra are brought outside
they see the police working on the wounded ivan
ivan walks up
he is okay
thanks for coming man you guys were right on time
we are always on time
two have escaped in truck
yorgi and kirill
let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them
your friend the angry one he send something for you
a big truck pulls to a stop
its ramp lowers and xanders blown out gto comes rolling out
well be right behind you
xander and petra both strap on grenades and pistols
did you do your homework
nods if they launch it i know how to bring it back
lets do this
they both climb in and the gto peels out
xander drives all out trying hard to catch up
he passes several of ivans police jeeps at a furious clip
up ahead they see the truck winding its way down the mountain
wheres he headed
he owns a big industrial complex on the river
hell launch it from there
xander floors it
up ahead in the flatbed truck yorgi drives
he can see the gto gaining on them
in russian subtitled theyre coming
get back there
kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab
he lays down resting the rifle on the ahab container
as the gto comes into view he sights up and fires whack
the first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows the headrest off xanders seat
you get down
ill take care of this fool
he pulls out an mp out and hangs it out the window
hes hiding behind the nerve agent
another shot blasts through taking off the rear view mirror
hes gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable
kirill laughs and takes aim once again
he puts petra in the sights
xander jerks the steering wheel and blam
the shot goes wide
the gto veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain
xander fights for control as they slide around the turns
the road flattens out and they can see the industrial complex up ahead
they cut across a field heading right for it
the truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex
quickly the gates are closed again
armed guards can be seen up above
the gto comes at the gates at full speed
lets see what my man put together
xander opens a dash panel revealing a row of switches
he flips one
the headlights eject revealing a mini gun in each fender
the mini guns spin
the metal doors are getting shredded
empty shells spill down the sides of the gto
the metal doors come apart falling in chunks
the gto slams through the wreckage without slowing down
a guard comes tumbling down and bounces off the trunk as the gto zips inside
the anarchy guys seem to have a whole other army in here
guards spill onto the road shooting at them from everywhere
a belly panel on the gto opens and ping pong ball sized minibombs dump onto the road
the bombs send the guards scattering
the gto sizzles away
whered the damn truck go
go to the water its that way
a tactical a pick up with a
cal machine gun attached pulls up behind them and opens fire
toadies right behind
petra punches another button
the rear hubcaps pop off
they roll along the road on their own
inside they seem to be lined with spikes
as the tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they blow up spraying spikes at both sides of the tactical
all four wheels blow out and the tactical goes out of control
it crashes through a fence and pitches into the water the men going sprawling
at the riverbank yorgi and kirill pull ahab off the truck and prepare for launching
they remove it from its box and carry it waist deep into the water
yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on ahabs insides
ive got it go
kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off
he climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building on a wharf
from here he can shoot and not be seen
he takes his lit cigarette and tucks it behind his ear
when the gto rounds the corner he fires
the bullet goes through the window and slams into the steering column
xander jams it into reverse
they retreat behind a building
petra clutches her arm wounded
a piece of shrapnel hit me
im sick of that guy
lets stop playing nice
kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make their second approach
the gto comes roaring out spinning in circles wildly
xanders is just doing donuts as fast as he can
kirill aims but with all the dust being kicked up he doesnt have much of a target
what are you doing
he doesnt notice petra pop up from behind a fence with a angle on the missile launchers computer screen
the green display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window
its the glowing point of kirills lit cigarette
the launcher beeps as it locks in and she fires
kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at him
he gets it immediately
in a panic he fumbles for the cigarette
the missile zeroes in on his head
the entire wooden shack blows apart
xander walks up to petra
i guess the surgeon general was right
angle on ahab as yorgi flips a switch and lets it go
the electric motor purrs to life and ahab zips out into the river
xander and petra run to the waters edge in time to see yorgi escaping in a motorboat
in the opposite direction they see the ripples of ahab as it speeds towards its destination
petra finds the controller in the cab of the truck
she presses buttons desperately
hes shut out the communication circuit
you cant talk to it
no its like a safety
we are going to have to access the manual controls
a manual control on a moving torpedo
this day keeps getting better and better
xander starts running towards a second moored motorboat
tell him whats going down
have them evacuate downtown
yorgi is motoring away smiling when he glances back and sees xander and petra take off after ahab
he pounds on his steering wheel and turns around
his bigger boat closes on them and he reloads his weapons
xander drives while petra checks her controller
its running three meters down
it has to surface to release the nerve agent right
by then its too late
the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water
the chemicals will break down and dissipate
use your grenades
maybe we can blow it up underwater
theyre heading into downtown prague now the riverbank getting more and more populated
yorgi is closing fast
down below them petra can see the white streak of ahab beneath the water
there it is
hold it steady
petra pulls the pin on a grenade
she tosses it out in front of ahab
a jet of water goes up but too far behind
she pulls another pin and is ready to throw when yorgis boat pulls up alongside
yorgi aims and fires and the bullet grazes petras arm
she loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment
xander grabs petra and jumps
together they land in yorgis boat
the grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters
they are in the heart of the old city now
we see piazzas full of tourists markets packed with locals children playing in front of cathedrals
and on the river yorgi and xander battle it out while petra steers the boat
its coming up
xander glances down sees ahab nearing the surface
yorgi clobbers him and xander falls to the edge of the boat
petra tries to help but yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm
xander can see ahab just a few inches under as yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold
this is going to be exciting buddy
front row seats to the apocalypse
come on sing with me
singing madly i am an antichrist i am an anarchist i
wan na be
xander elbows yorgis gut and breaks the chokehold
he flips him and they both topple overboard
they land on ahab and both grab on
they punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo
it surfaces as it approaches the magnificent st
on the bridge is a chaos of cops firemen and crowds of people
they are desperately trying to herd people away from the river
xander pounds yorgis face and dunks him underwater
yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section dragging along in the torpedos wake
ahab starts making noise and its payload doors swing open
inside xander can see the row of glass cannister containing silent night
the first one rises up into firing position
no you dont
he pries the first rocket off its launcher
the thing is beeping menacingly
in slo motion xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands
he looks over at petra
shes shouting at him but he doesnt hear a thing but his own heartbeat
he looks the other direction to the mass of people on the bridge above him
the fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist
through the crowd xander sees gibbons break through with his squad of agents
gibbons and xander make eye contact
then yorgi lunges onto his back trying to pull him into the water
xander hits buttons on the control panel and ahab starts to dive
with yorgi hanging on his back xander turns the rocket upside down and stuffs it back in the launcher
ahab heads down to the bottom of the river the two men fighting
we see one man get thrown free the other is caught up on ahab and continues downstream
then the booster rocket fires giving off sparks and bubbles
its all in silhouette now as wham
the rocket explodes setting off a chain reaction
ahab and its unfortunate passenger are disintegrated by the blasts
the chemicals belch out in harmless clouds
a funnel of water blasts into the sky
the crowd recoils
ivan helps petra off the motorboat
they look down at the water but theres no sign of xander
gibbons and his men push through the cordon of police scanning the water
tears well in petras eyes
even gibbons looks dejected
then petra lets out a gasp and they look downstream
theres a boat ramp leading into the water
at first they see a ripple then the top of a shaved head emerges
the whole crowd looks on as xander rises from the water walking up the boat ramp
his shirt is tattered his tattooed body battered
but theres a look on his face a calm a self confidence we havent seen before
the phoenix has risen
petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him
xander shakes ivan s hand and then turns to gibbons
thought you bought the farm down there x
glad as hell to see you
im pretty happy to see me too
so are you done with me yet
youve kept up your end of the bargain ill do the same
but you really should consider staying on you make a decent agent
but i hate cops remember
except for her
cut the crap x i saw you down there
youre a hero
dont be afraid to join the good guys
who says youre the good guys
he starts walking off with petra
you know what they say the only way to change the system is from the inside
why dont we start by taking this thing off my ankle
the poison needles
on come on x
did you really think we were that barbaric
no needles huh
what about the acid bath
all for show
just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing
smiles youre a jerk off you know that
well be talking soon youll see
youll be back
xander and petra move off through the crowd arm in arm
i cant believe my mission is finally over
i dont even know what to do with myself
you cant welch on me now
we had a deal
angle on a big x spelled out in seashells on the sand
the camera shoots up into the sky showing a perfect white beach a perfect lagoon a lush green island
then we hear the buzzing of a tattoo needle
his ink done xander walks out onto the back deck
craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water
xander steps out of a hut built over the water
we see petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini
shes got a bucket of hinano beer chilling down
its a vision of heaven
he lays down next to her starts pulling her bikini bottom off
laughing what are you doing
its about your next mission
you need to be debriefed
from underwater we see the two of them dive into the lagoon nude
theres too many bubbles to see any real skin but we know what theyre up to
back on the surface we see bubbles rising and catch glimpses of their outlines beneath the water
the camera pulls back to the deck where we see xanders communicator on the table next to the beers
we hear them surface and start splashing off camera
then the damn communicator starts to beep
