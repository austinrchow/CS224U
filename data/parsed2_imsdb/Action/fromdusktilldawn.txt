countess in la comtesse noire by jess franco a convenience store in a texas suburb
no other businesses surround it
close up a light switch is flipped on
the sign on top of the store lights up
it reads bennys a texas ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and a real live texas ranger earl mcgraw steps out
mcgraw is in full ranger uniform button shirt cowboy hat boots mirrored shades tin star and a colt revolver on his hip
its about an hour and a half before sundown and mcgraw is off duty for the day
the only other car in the parking lot is a plymouth a young hawaiian shirt wearing man named pete sits on a stool behind the counter
a few close up stomers fiddle about
a man wearing a black suit black tie and wire rim glasses holds hands with a pretty blonde girl in cutoffs and bare feet
they look through magazines
another black suit wearing man holds hands with a red headed girl in a prep school uniform
they look through the beer cooler in the back of the store
both girls are around seventeen
mcgraw enters the store

mcgraw walks over to the beer cooler as if done ritually every night it is takes out a beer pops it open and joins pete by the front counter

pete doesnt say anything
theyll probably make a run for the border which would bring em this way
and if we get our hands on those shit asses were talking payback time
well get em all right
i gotta piss
im gonna use your commode
knock yourself out
mcgraw drops his last drip of beer crushes the can and exits in the bathroom
the black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and with the prep school girl in tow walks rapidly toward pete
we see that the girl is crying
to pete do you think im fuckin playing with you asshole
points to the tearful prep school girl do you want this little girl to die
pointing to the blonde with the other guy or that little girl
or your bosombuddy with the badge
i dont wanna do it but ill turn this fuckin store into the wild bunch if i even think youre fuckin with me
the two men in black suits are the notorious abilene bank robbers seth and richard gecko the gecko brothers
and the other customers are all being held hostage
seth is the one with the prep girl
richard is the one with the blonde
everybody speaks low and fast

hes used my toilet a thousand times
if i told him no hed know something was up

richard holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl leans next to seths ear and whispers something
seth looks at pete
were you giving that pig signals
are you kidding
i didnt do anything
richard whispers something else in seths ear
he says you were scratching
i wasnt scratching
you callin him a liar
pete controls himself
im not calling him a liar okay
im simply saying that if i was scratching and if i did scratch its not because i was signaling the cop its because im fuckin scared shitless
richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to seth
the rangers taking a piss
why dont i just go in there blow his head off and get outta here
dont do that
look you asked me to act natural and im acting as natural in fact under the circumstances i think i ought get a fuckin academy award for how natural im
you asked me to get rid of him im doing my best
yeah well your best better get a helluva lot fuckin better or youre gonna feel a helluva fuckin lot worse
the toilet flushes
everybody be cool
everybody goes back to what they were doing
mcgraw steps back out of the back
he appears to be unaware of the situation
yeah and im gonna be right back at it tomorrow
so tonight im gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze
how much is the bottle
out of nowhere richard whips out his forty five automatic and shoots mcgraw in the head
mcgraw goes down screaming
richard stands over him and shoots him twice more
seth charges forward
to richard what the fuck was that about
in a low monotone he signaled the ranger
hysterical i didnt
to seth you gotta believe me i didnt
to seth when they were talkin he mouthed the words help us
you fuckin liar i didnt say shit
richard shoots pete and pete falls down behind the counter
seth grabs richard and throws him up against the wall
what the fuck is wrong with you seth he did it
you were by the beer cooler with your back turned
i was by the magazines i could see his face
and i saw him mouth richard mouths the words help us
while pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding from his bullet wound he opens his floor safe and pulls out a gun from it
seth releases his brother
start the car
you believe me dont cha
shut up and start the car
richard walks away from seth and crosses the counter
when pete springs up gun in hand and shoots richard in the hand
richard falls to his knees howling
both pete and seth spray the store with gunfire
seth dives down an aisle
pete ducks behind the counter
richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle
the two girls have run out screaming
yelling im not dead but im definitely shot
i told you that bastard said help us
yelling i never said help us
yelling well that dont matter now cause you got about two fuckin seconds to live
yelling when i count three shoot out the bottles behind him
the two brothers start firing toward the counter
they hit the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind pete
pete is crouched on the ground as glass debris and alcohol rain down on him
seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf
richard keeps firing
seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid sets it on fire with his zippo then tosses it
the flaming roll of paper towels flies through the air
the fireball lands behind the counter
the entire counter area immediately bursts into flames
pete screams from behind the counter
seth smiles to himself and stands
richard shakes his head in amusement and stands
pete runs out from behind the counter engulfed in flames still holding his weapon and firing
seth and richard hit the ground firing their
pete the human torch falls like a tree into the hostess pastry display
seth and richard rise from the rubble
they exit the store squabbling
the store is bursting into flames
what did i tell you
what did i tell you
buy the road map and leave
what am i supposed to do seth
he recognized us
he didnt recognize shit
both seth and richard stand on opposite sides of the car
seth im telling you the way he looked at us you especially i knew he knew
they both climb in the car seth behind the wheel
seth starts it op
the souped up engine roars to life
we can hear seth mumbling under the motor
do you know what the words low profile mean
the plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards hits the street and speeds off down the road
we crane up high to see the car leaving a trail of dust behind it as the store burns out of control
raunchy honky tonk music fills the theater
the plymouth tears ass across texas plains
as titles play over we see seth and richard enjoying their getaway road trip
seth behind the wheel pops open a bottle of prescription pills empties out four of the red capsules in his hand pops them in his mouth and washes it back
with a slug of jack daniels from a pint bottle
richard looks at seth through the hole in his hand
like a boxer richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffers tape
the camera leaves the boys as they woosh down the street and goes along the length of the car to the trunk
it hangs on the trunk
then we see through the trunk like superman an older woman tied up and helpless in the trunk
the rest of the titles play over black as the song continues
emma and petes gravy train is a truck stop off of highway
emma and petes patrons are made up of regulars truckers cowboys and road weary travelers
the camera dollies through the maze of tables patrons and waitresses
it stops when it gets to a table occupied by the fuller family
the fullers definitely fall into the road weary category
the members of the unit consist of the father jacob age an ex preacher a good man with rough edges and his two children kate age is a young beauty
who possesses what can only be described as an apple pie sensuality
she is dressed like a nice christian girl complete with crucifix
scott age is a jacobs vietnamese adopted son
scott is a likable long haired kid who always wears a t shirt with the name of the heavy metal garage band he plays guitar for precinct
the three of them are wolfing down a late lunch
we got about two more hours of day light left
thatll get us into el paso which is right next to the border
well stop at a motel stop
were not going to actually stop at a motel are we
scott and kate speak together obviously repeating something that jacob has said about three hundred times
weve got a winnebago
we dont need those over priced roach havens
were self contained
okay okay maybe i was a little overzealous but give me a break i just bought it
scott and kate continue the impersonation
why just look at all this
you got your kitchen you got your microwave you got your sink you got your shower see this television
feel this real wood paneling
thats real wood too not that fake stuff
unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking what say we drop this
to kate the truth hurts
to scott its the bitterest of pills
you two ought to start a stand up act because youre just wasting your humor on me
aint it the truth
why do you want to stop
lie in the back dad ill drive us into mexico
jacob gives scott a look that says you arent touching my new motor home
i just bet you would
dont even thin about it
besides i want to have one nights sleep in an honest to goodness bed
the beds in the home are okay but theyre not like a real bed
hey if we go to a motel we can swim
ill be right back
im gonna go to the bathroom
scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the restroom
jacob and kate are left alone
theres an awkward moment of silence before
dad when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist
franklin said he wouldnt permanently replace you until we came back
he said when we come home if you still feel the same way thats very nice of ted but ill call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting
i didnt want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset
but you dont believe in god anymore
not enough to be a pastor
look i know this is hard on you kids
after jennys death this is probably the last thing you need
but i cant do it any longer
my congregation needs spiritual leadership
well they cant get that from me anymore
my faith is gone
to answer your question yes i do believe in jesus
but do i love them
after jenny died i just thought whats the point
pushing him its just all our lives youve been a pastor
for twenty years youve preached trust in the lord
and then one day you wake up and say fuck him
i didnt say fuck him
im just not connected anymore
that happens youll get it back
kate give your old man a little credit
every person who chooses the service of god as their lifes work has something in common
i dont care if youre a preacher a priest a nun a rabbi or a buddhist monk
many many times during your life youll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself am i a fool
weve all done it
im not going through a lapse
what ive experienced is closer to awakening
im not trying to shake your faith
ive just decided not to devote my life to god anymore
what do you think mom would say
moms got nothing to say shes dead
close up counter bell
a hand slams down on it
seth stands at the front desk of the dew drop inn
a standard issue texas motel
richard sits outside in the car
nobody responds to the bell
seth bangs it impatiently five times
hold your horses
an old timer walks through a curtain behind the counter
hes eating a bbq rib
rough whatcha want
whatcha think i want ya mean old bastard

richard sits in the car listening to merle haggard on the radio
he watches from his perspective seth taking the walking outside and getting in the car
seth starts it up and drives them to their room
do they have cable
do they have an x rated channel
do they have a waterbed
they dont have anything except four walls and a roof and thats all we need
their car drives up to room but they park backing up the trunk close to the door
the two brothers get out of the car
tossing richie the motel keys open the door
we gotta do this fast
richie opens the door
seth goes to the trunk looks around the court yard
close up key going into the trunk lock turning
trunk pov seth looking into the camera
seths pov a woman in her late forties is lying scrunched up in the trunk
she is the hostage bank teller from abilene
shes stiff scared and looks an absolute mess

the two brothers quick as lightening yank the woman out of the trunk and whisk her into the motel room
seth closes the trunk looks around for any johnny eye witnesses doesnt see any slams the door
seth turns from the door sees the hostage woman standing

she sits down in the chair

she shuts up
richard slowly takes off his jacket
he winces from his wound

he helps him get his jacket off

richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it
seth takes the pillow and stacks them for richie to prop his back up against
i got both rooms on either side of us so we dont gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes
hows that feel

he heads for the door
seth goes into the car takes out a big suitcase
he scans the perimeter with his eyes goes back inside
seth comes back in lays the suitcase on the bed
richie has the tv remote control in his hand and hes flipping stations
seth looks at his watch

richard looks to the tv then looks to gloria sitting across the room in the chair

you can tell she doesnt want to
he pats the empty space next to him
she gets out of her chair walks across the bed and sits next to him
a phone booth outside of a gas station
seth is in the middle of a conversation with the party on the other end
things are real hot here
crossings gonna be a bitch
pause dont worry well get across

pause can we make it as close to the border as possible
texas wants our balls
the quicker were in your protection the better ill feel
pause okay where
pause the titty twister
he laughs i love it already
okay carlos ill see you and your men at the titty twister tomorrow morning
pause bye my friend
seth hangs up the phone lights up a cigarette with his zippo lighter and exits frame
after seth exits leaving the frame empty a subtitle appears richard lies on the bed by himself propped up by pillows watching tv taking on hits from a water bong
in the shape of a wizard
a local newscaster named kelly houge is reporting a story about the brothers
talking to camera this bloody crime spree started just a week ago today
the oldest of the two brothers
seth gecko was serving time in rollings kansas state penitentiary for his part in the scott city bank robbery in which two law enforcement officers lost their lives
having served eight years of his twenty two year sentence seth gecko was brought to wichita municipal court house for his first parole hearing
it was while at the court house that this man
his younger brother richard gecko a known armed robber and sex offender pulled off a daring daylight escape
resulting in the death of four wichita law enforcement officers and this woman
heide vogel sixth grade teacher who was run over by the geckos during a high speed pursuit through downtown wichita
a red line travels from wichita to oklahoma
from there the brothers traveled from kansas through oklahoma
the red line enters texas and the camera moves into texas
into the great state of texas and then finally
we zoom in on a red circled abilene
we hear gunfire and screams
kelly houge walks down the courthouse steps of the criminal courts building of abilene
she talks to the camera
cops lawyers and citizens bustle in the background
the list of the dead climbed up three more notches since our last telecast
photo officer sherman goodell in full police uniform
officer sherman goodell who was in intensive care following the gun battle outside of the valley federal bank building
kelly houge standing on the court house steps talking into the camera
died about forty five minutes ago at hopkins general hospital
and about six hours ago during a daylight liquor store robbery in big springs the gecko brothers killed another texas ranger
photo earl mcgraw in uniform
photo pete in a hawaiian shirt holding up a big fish
and liquor store clerk pet bottoms
video footage of bennys world of liquor burning down
then they proceeded to burn the store down to the ground
video graphic picture of the gecko brothers with a tally underneath that changes the death toll to fifteen
it changes under death toll five texas rangers
it changes eight police officers it changes three civilians
it changes and one hostage
bank teller and mother of four gloria hill
heading the case to bring these fugitives to justice is fbi agent stanley chase
we talked with agent chase earlier this afternoon
kelly houge interviewing stanley chase of the fbi
for the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty eight hours
the bureau local law enforcement and the texas rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare seth and richard gecko
agent chase does it appear that they are heading for mexico
yes it does kelly
we have already alerted the mexican authorities
they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice
are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in abilene gloria hill
weve received no news one way or the other
we can only hope for the best
what about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot
this cant be confirmed at this time but we do believe it to be true
we have reason to believe it was the youngest brother richard and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the stores clerk
is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers that the bureau the rangers and the police force are
taking this manhunt personally
i would say thats a very safe assumption
newscasters voice is it safe to assume since the law enforcement authorities in the great state of texas are homosexuals of a sick and deviate nature that they will be
too busy fucking each other up the ass to actually catch the gecko brothers
in an fbi voice i would say thats a very safe assumption
he changes a channel on the television
we see a casper the friendly ghost cartoon on the screen
would you play with me
a big burly cop turns around
sure little boy
the cop heads for the hills
seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two take out bags of big kahuna burgers
shit i started to get worried
where the fuck ya been
whatd ya see
didya look at the border
seth dumps the burgers on the bed
both men pop open beers and richard goes to town on a hamburger
seth flips off the tv yeah i saw the border
through binoculars from on top of a high building
thats about as close as i risked getting
whats the tv say
theyre going to apprehend us in forty eight hours
seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer
to himself i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border
longer we fuck around el paso our lives aint worth a shit
look fuck the border
lets just dig in and wait for things to cool down
richie its gonna get a lot fuckin worse before it gets any fuckin better
we showed our ass in texas
we killed texas fuckin rangers
they aint gonna stop lookin till they find us and when they find us theyre gonna kill us
texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers
the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us
how do you know
i heard it on the radio
we gotta get our asses into mexico tonight
carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and seth stops talking and
wheres the woman
seths out of his chair
whatd ya mean what
the fuckin woman the hostage
where the fuck is she richard
shes in the other room
what the fuck is she doin there
he goes to the door of the adjoining room
seth before you open the door let me explain what happened
seth stops and looks at his brother
he knows what he means
he cant say anything only point at his younger sibling
then he bursts open the door
the dead naked body of gloria hill lies on the bed
its obvious richard raped her and killed her
seth covers his eyes with his hands
he slowly enters the room with the dead body
to himself oh richard whats wrong with you
richard rises from the bed
now seth before you flip out let me just explain what happened
seth slowly turns to his brother then walks toward him
richard backs up
yeah explain it to me
i need an explanation
whats the matter with you
low and calm theres nothing wrong with me brother
that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do
pause that woman wouldnt of said shit if she had a mouthful
wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
once you left she became a whole different person
slowly approaching is it me
is it my fault
its not your fault its her fault
seth grabs richard and throws him in the corner of the room holding tightly to his wrist
is this my fault
do you think this is what i am
this is not me
i am a professional fucking thief
i steal money
you try to stop me god help you
but i dont kill people i dont have to and i dont rape women
what you doin aint how its done
do you understand
seth if you were me just say yes
nothing else just say yes
yes seth i understand
yes seth i understand
seth hugs his little brother
whispers in richies ear we get into mexico its gonna be sweet rosemary hundred proof liquor and rice and beans
none of this shits gonna matter
scott and kate are in the front seat of their parked motor home
the motor homes parked in front of the dew drop inns front office
we see jacob inside getting a room from the old timer
i cant believe hes stopping here
this place looks totally cruddy
jacob walks out of the office
kate yells from the motor home
dad why are we stopping here
he opens the meter home door and climbs in
theres nothing wrong with this place
its a flop house
its not a flop house
its basic and simple
that doesnt make it a flop house
if it doesnt have a pool were looking for a new place
starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the courtyard
it has a bed
thats all i care about
other places have beds they also have cable tv a gym room service
seth walks out of room with a beer in his hand
hes thinking about how hes going to get over the border tonight
lost in thought he steps out in the path of the fullers motor home
jacob slams on the brakes
seth jumps back startled
both kate and scott are tossed out of their seats onto the floor
owww my head
jacob pissed honks his horn at seth and yells out the window
watch where youre going
seth just stands right in their way without moving gazing up at the giant motor home
kate and scott join him up front looking at this weirdo
whats this guys problem
i have no idea
seth continues standing in their way making no attempt to move
not threatening just looking at them
the horn snaps seth back to this world
a smile breaks out on the escaped fugitives face and he politely steps to one side to let them pass
pass they do
the sword of damocles is lifted from above seths head
hes just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable
he knows exactly how hes going to cross the border
whistling a happy tune he turns and walks back into room
the fullers are in room
its identical to the one that the gecko boys are in except that the paintings above the beds are different
jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes on the bed
scott sits in a chair headphones on playing an unplugged electric guitar
kate is nowhere in sight
on the door
scott doesnt hear shit but his music
jacob stirs a bit but doesnt wake up
on the door
jacob springs up
he looks over at scott who lost in guitar heaven is oblivious of the knocker then to the door
from the other side of the door comes a friendly voice
im your neighbor in room i hate to disturb you but id like to ask a favor
jacob swings his feet to the floor stands up and walks to the door
as he passes scott he says in his direction i hope none of this is disturbing you
scott cant hear him but when he sees his dad look at him he smiles
jacob opens the door and sees
richard gecko standing in the doorway looking like the nicest guy in the entire world
hi there im from room my name is don cornelius
no not the don cornelius from soul train
me and my lady friend need some ice and we dont seem to have an ice bucket
could we possibly borrow yours
ill bring it right back

we follow jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket
he grabs it turns back to the door takes a couple of steps towards it then stops in his tracks
he sees richard and seth both inside the room with the door closed both with
s in their hands both aimed at him
what is this
seth slugs jacob in the mouth knocking him to the ground
its called a punch
scott suddenly becomes aware of whats going on around him and instinctively stands
richard shoves his
in scotts mouth
scott lowers himself back down onto his seat
jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip
he looks at his opponent who stands over him
to jacob whats your name
okay jacob get up and sit your ass down on the bed
make a wrong move and ill shoot you in the face
jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed
to richard okay move the jap over there
keeping the gun in scotts mouth richard makes scott rise
guiding him over to the bed by his father
richard removes the gun from scotts mouth and stands next to his brother looking down at their two hostages
to his hostages whats the story with you two

how does that happen
you dont look japanese
neither does he
he looks vietnamese
oh well excuse me all to hell
whats this about money
its about money all right but not yours
you see me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance
the door to room opens and a dripping wet bikini clad kate walks in
the brothers spin their guns in her direction
kate startled screams
jacob and scott get on their feet and move forward
seth spins back towards the two men gun ready to spit
to scott and jacob stop
jacob and scott freeze
richard moves like quicksilver shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified kate
whats going on

to kate its okay honey
everythings going to be all right
just listen to daddy sugar and dont do nothin stupid
he turns to jacob and scott who are still standing you two simon says sit the fuck down
they slowly sit
richard cant take his eyes off the dripping wet kate
both jacob and seth see this and neither men like it
both for their own reasons
to jacob where are the keys to the motor home
on the dresser
richie take the keys
start that big bastard up and drive it up front
richard doesnt move from his position behind kate
kate feels his eyes on her
she slowly turns and looks at him
he looks in her face
she smiles at him
richie will you do me a favor and eat my pussy
richards eyes go to seth
everybody is where they were
kate never turned around
not when you get around to it now
without saying a word he takes the keys and leaves the room
pointing at kate you gidget go in the bathroom and put on some clothes
she grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the bathroom
seth grabs her wrist

she goes into the bathroom

seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages
sorry pops it aint gonna be that easy

jacob shakes his head no

but my kids arent going anywhere with you
sorry i need everybody
my children are not going with you and thats that
angry thats not fuckin that
holds up his gun this is fuckin this
he calms down and looks at scott go sit over there
scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room leaving the two men alone
seth speaks in a quiet conversational tone
i aint got time to fuck around with you so ill make this simple

he cocks the gun and puts it right in jacobs face whats it gonna be yes or no answer
jacob looks at him

seth bangs on the bathroom door
times up princess
the bathroom door opens
kate stands there wearing a t shirt jeans and bare feet
okay ramblers lets get to rambling
the motor home with the powder keg interior drives through the lone star night
richards in the back bed area with a gun trained on kate and scott
the two scared siblings hold hands
richard zeros in on her
where are you taking us
whats in mexico
he doesnt smile
in the front part of the motor home jacob sits behind the wheel driving into the night
seth sits in the passenger seat going through jacobs wallet and talking to him calmly
reading his drivers license jacob fuller
jacob thats biblical aint it
what am i askin for of course it is
motioning behind him what are their names
scott and kate
seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet
scott and kate
kate and scott
seth comes to a snapshot of jacob and his wife
where is the little lady
yes she is
howd she die
come on gimme some more details
howd it happen
some fuckin drunk kill her
it was a rainy night the brakes on the car werent great
she had to stop suddenly
she slid on the road she crashed she died
she was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on
those acts of god really stick it in and break it off dont they
yes they do
seth looks back at the wallet
he sees jacobs ministers license
is this real
ive seen one of these before
a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion
away to fuck the irs
is that what youre doing or are you the real mccoy
youre a preacher
i was a minister
as in not anymore
whyd ya quit
i think ive gotten about as up close and personal with you as im gonna get
now if you need me like i think you need me youre not gonna kill me cause i wont answer your stupid prying questions
so with all due respect mind your own business
i seem to have touched a nerve
dont be so sensitive pops lets keep this friendly
but youre right enough with the getting to know you shit
now theres two ways we can play this hand
one way is me and you go round an round all fuckin night
the other way is we reach some sort of an understanding
now if we go down that first path at the end of the day ill win
but we go down the second well both win
now i dont give a rats ass about you or your fuckin family
yall can live forever or die this second and i dont care which
the only things i do care about are me that son of a bitch in the back and our money
and right now i need to get those three things into mexico
now stop me if im wrong but i take it you dont give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice or the bank getting its money back
right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter your son and possibly yourself
am i correct
i thought so
you help us get across the border without incident stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny and in the morning well let you and your
that way everybody gets what they want
you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico
how do i know youll keep your word
jesus christ pops dont start with this shit
you want me to sit here and be passive
the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe youll let us go
im not there yet
you have to convince me youre telling the truth
look dickhead the only thing you need to be convinced about is that youre stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters
i dont wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin night
and i dont think you wanna be worrying about my brothers intentions toward your daughter all night
you notice the way he looked at her didnt ya
didnt like it did ya
no i didnt
didnt think so
so as i was saying im willing to make a deal
you behave get us into mexico and dont try to escape
ill keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning
you wont let him touch her
i can handle richie dont worry
the two men look at each other for some measure of trust
seth sticks out his hand
i give you my word
seth cant help but think about the last time he gave his word
hand sticks out my words my law
better you not take it and thats just where we are then take it and not mean it
jacob takes his hand but looks right into seth
if he touches her ill kill him
i dont give a fuck how many guns you have nothing will stop me from killing him
you break your word ill kill all of you
calling to the back kate honey
you must have a bible in here dont cha
yeah we got a bible

kate goes into a drawer pulls out a bible and brings it up front
hold it right there sweetie pie
to jacob put your hand on it
swear to god on the bible you wont try to escape and youll get us across the border
i swear to god i wont try to escape and ill do my best to get you into mexico
you best better get it done pops
seth places his hand on the bible
i swear to god ill let you loose in the morning
and your daughter will be safe
and i also swear if you do anything to fuck me up ill slit all your throats
richards in the back with kate and scott
richard expressionless looks at kates bare feet
ex close up kates toes
his eyes go to her hands
his eyes go to her neck
ex close up kates adams apple
his eyes move up
back to richard

kate turns to him
in the room

seth and jacob
i told you to watch those kids i didnt say talk to em
you guys aint got nothin to say to one another
so cut the chatter
richard turns to kate
quiet well talk later
kate still hasnt a clue what he means
automobiles are lined up waiting one by one to go into mexico
cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing are all over the place
border patrol men and police are stopping all cars
pulling up to the end of the line is the fullers mobile home
jacob at the wheel seth in the passenger seat
seth jumps up and goes into action
okay everybody its show time
richie take kate in the bathroom
richard grabs the terrified kate and drags her in the bathroom scott you come up front with your daddy
seth keeping low gets behind jacob
im telling you dont hurt her
as long as youre cool shell be cool
whatre ya gonna say
i dont have the slightest idea
well you just keep thinkin of that gun next to kates temple
seth disappears into the bathroom with kate and richard closing the door behind him
father and son are alone for the first time since this whole thing began
what are you gonna do
im gonna try and get us across the border
no dad you gotta tell em that theyre back there
jacob is surprised to hear scott say this
the bathroom which consists of a shower a toilet and a small sink is a tight fit with three people in it
richard has his back against the wall with his arm around kate holding her in front of him
one hand is over her mouth the other holds a
against her head
kates eyes are wide with fear
in hand ready to fire if the wrong person should open the door
everybody talks low and quiet
this isnt gonna work
its gonna work just fine i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea
now shut up
everyones quiet for a second till richard breaks it
to himself theyre gonna search the van
offhand as long as you dont act like a fuckin nut well be just fine
what does that mean
richard lets kate go she quickly moves to the side
you just called me a fuckin nut
no i didnt
yes you did
you said as long as i dont act like a fuckin nut implying that ive been acting like a fuckin nut
take a pill kid
i just meant stay cool
you meant that but you meant the other too
kate cant believe what shes watching
neither can seth
serious as a heart attack this aint the time richard
his voice rising fuck those spic pigs
you called me a fuckin nut and where i come from that stops the train on its tracks
real quiet and violent keep your voice down

have you forgotten about your sister
theyre gonna kill us
they get us across the border theyre gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us
if they get over the border theyre gonna let us go
dad i watch those reality shows
they never let anybody go
any cop will tell you in a situation like this you get a chance you go for it
this is our chance
what about kate
theyre gonna kill her anyway
at least now with all these cops weve got a fighting chance
son i have this situation under control
i know exactly what im doing
youre going to have to trust me on this
if trusting you means trusting those fuckin killers i cant do that
if you dont tell the cops i will
jacob grabs scott by the front of his shirt and yanks him to him
now you listen to me
you aint gonna do a goddamn fucking thing you hear me
nobody cares what you think im running this show i make the decisions
hes running the show
im running the show
i make the plays and you back the plays i make
stop thinking with your fucking balls
kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose aint the time to go for it
i need your cover
cover my ass
theres a honk behind them
they both look out the window
its their turn with the border patrol guards
jacob takes the wheel and drives up
a stern border guard approaches jacobs window
how many with you
just my son and i
what is your purpose in mexico
im taking him to see his first bullfight
what was the nuttiest thing i did
this aint the time
oh i know was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out
yeah youre right that was pretty fuckin nutty
not to mention stupid
but you know what
i can fix that right now
seth hauls off and punches richard smack in the head
richard hits the floor guard jacob and scott hear richard fall in the bathroom
what was that
oh thats just my daughter in the bathroom
you said it was just you and your son
i meant me my son and my daughter
open the door
im coming aboard
we can only see kates face
we hear rustling around the bathroom but we dont know what it is
then its quiet
then we hear talking outside the door but we cant make it out
then we hear a knock
im in the bathroom
its the border patrol
we hear the door open and see the light change on kates face
shes looking up
border guard in the doorway looking in
he sees kate by herself pants around her ankles sitting on the toilet
do you mind
shut the fucking door
he closes the door
kate lets out a breath
we wait a beat seth pulls back the curtain in the shower we see richie on the floor of the shower knocked out
seth and kate meet eyes
he gives her the o
we see through the back window of the motor home the border getting smaller as we drive away from it
scott knocks on the bathroom door
seth bursts out of the bathroom
goddamn that was
seth goes to the back window
he sees the border getting farther and farther away
no cars following
to himself we did it
pause were in mexico
seth throws his head back and screams for joy
kate emerging from the bathroom reacts to seths scream along with scott
seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of the van
everybody else is still tense as shit
but seth lets go of all his tension and becomes a new man before our eyes
he turns to kate
loud and happy come here kate
kate nervous takes a step back
he charges for her
grabs her hugs her around her waist and spins her around
when he lets her go she stumbles dizzily onto the bed
to kate you were magnificent
you told him to shut the fucking door
im hiding in the shower and im thinking to myself did i just fuckin hear what i just fuckin heard
and what does he do he shuts the fucking door
kate kind of half smiles
if i was a bit younger baby id fuckin marry you
seth goes up front and slaps jacob on the back
i gotta hand it to ya pops you raised a fuckin woman
jacob doesnt share seths enthusiasm but he is relieved
we did our part we gotcha in mexico
now its time for your part letting us go
pops when youre right youre right and you are right
suddenly brightens youre gonna let us go

scotty help me pick richie up and lay him down
jacob keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says digayo
when you get to digayo turn this big bastard left go on down for a few miles then you see a bar called the titty twister
from what i hear you cant miss it
then stop cause thats where were going
he slaps him once again on the back and leaves to attend to richard
close up richard without glasses
unconscious seth slaps his face
cmon kid wake up
dont make a career out of it
richard starts coming to and opens his eyes
seth sits at the foot of the bed
disoriented yeah i think so
i dont know you just passed out
yeah we were just standing there
you said something about your shoulder hurting then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes
yeah when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard
it scared the shit outta me

im just a little fucked up
well let me tell ya something gonna clear your head right up
we are officially mexicans
singing south of the border down mexico way
were heading for the rendezvous right now
we get there we pound booze till carlos shows up he escorts us to el ray
and then me and you brother kick fuckin back

slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head
pause where are my glasses

yeah like a mexican hole in the walls gonna have my fuckin prescription
its not a big deal unless you make it a big deal
now im real happy richie stop bringing me down with bullshit
jacob calls to the back
a neon sign that flashes hiker trucker bar dusk till dawn underneath the joints proud name on the sign and on top of biker trucker bar dusk till dawn is
a well endowed woman whose breast is being twisted by a neon hand
the neon sign sits on top of the rudest sleaziest most crab infested strip joint honky tonk whorehouse in all of mexico
the titty twister is located out in the middle of nowheres ville
it sits by itself with nothing around it for miles
a plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are parked out in front
the walls almost pulsate from the loud raunchy music within the structure
signs cover the walls outside reading things like athena and danny the wonder pony and the sleazy titty in the parking lot a biker and a truck driver beat the
shit out of each other one with a pipe the other with a hammer
a second biker fucks a titty twister whore against the wall
a greasy man known as chet pussy stands in the parking lot soliciting customers through a mr
pussy pussy pussy
all pussy must go
at the titty twister were slashing pussy in half
this is a pussy blow out
make us an offer on our vast selection of pussy
we got white pussy black pussy spanish pussy yellow pussy hot pussy cold pussy wet pussy tight pussy big pussy bloody pussy fat pussy hairy pussy smelly pussy velvet pussy
silk pussy naugahyde pussy snappin pussy horse pussy dog pussy mule pussy fake pussy
if we dont have it you dont want it
the fullers recreational vehicle pulls into the parking lot and stops
whats left of the fuller family and the gecko family look out the windshield onto the sight that is the titty twister
to the group okay troops this is the homestretch
heres the deal this place closes at dawn
carlos is gonna meet us here sometime before dawn
which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three or four hours from now
so were gonna go in there take a seat have a drink have a bunch of drinks and wait for carlos
that could be an hour that could be three hours i dont know which
but when he gets here me and richie are going to leave with him
after we split you guys are officially out of this stewpot
let me just say im real happy about where were at
we got a real nice i dont fuck with you you dont fuck with me attitude going on
now if everybody just keeps playin it cool and im talking to you too richie everybodys gonna get what they want
everybody nods and mutters in agreement
okay hard drinkers lets drink hard
the camper door flies open and the two brothers and the fuller family step out into the night
they look across the parking lot at the titty twister
it literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell
out of the stew pot and into the fire
shit i been to bars make this place look like a fuckin h club
i gotta say im with jacob on this
i been to some fucked up places in my time but that place is fucked up
seth cant believe it
in a baby talk voice aww w whatsa matter is the little baby too afraid to go into the big scary bar
the two brothers square off not like strangers fighting but like brothers fight
they talk real quiet but real personal
thats what you think
thats how youre lookin richie
im lookin scared

youre just not used to seein me happy cause its been about fifteen fuckin years since i been happy
but my shit is forever together
richard believes seths response
okay just checkin
they walk toward the bars entrance
chet pussy talks into the microphone
yelling into the microphone take advantage of our penny pussy sale
buy any piece of pussy a tour regular price you get another piece of pussy of equal or lesser value for a penny
now try and beat pussy for a penny
if you can find cheaper pussy anywhere fuck it
chet notices our heroes especially young kate
in microphone towards kate whats this
a new flavor approaching
apple pie pussy
step aside asshole
chet pokes his finger in seths chest
not so fast slick
seth grabs hold of chets finger bends it backwards till the bone snaps in two
chet lets out a scream
seth violently brings his head forward pulverizing chets chet falls to his knees in front of seth
seth hooks him with a powerful fist under his chin that snaps chets head back and throws him on his back
after hitting the ground seth sends a savage kick straight to chets face rolling him over
chet is out
the whole altercation took two seconds
everyones in shock and looks at seth
seth looks back at everyone
now is my shit together or is my shit together
richard and seth laugh with each other
slappin seth five your shit is forever together
they head for the door
richard stays behind for a second and gives the fallen chet a few swift kicks if the titty twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside in
the immortal words of al jolson you aint seen nothin yet
this is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum the blood and the beer at closing
in the back topless dancers do lap dances with customers while a sleazy sexy stripper strips to raunchy music played at ear drum bursting level
two men are in a savage bareknuckle fight surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers
one of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back his name is danny the wonder pony
the woman on his back in the saddle feet in the stirrups hands on the reins is athena his rider
they dance around to the cheers of the crowd
bikers and truckers play pool in the back
fights break out here about one every ten minutes
the customers may start em but the bouncer big emilio ends em
seth richard jacob scott and kate walk through the door
they each individually take in the sights and the smells
seth is the first to say something
now this is my kinda place
i could become a regular
the man behind the bar is razor charlie
he eyes the group as they approach
their difference from the usual road waif nomads who populate the twister disturbs him
he exchanges a knowing look across the room with big emilio as the group bellies up to the bar
in english you cant come in here
what dya mean
this is a private club
youre not welcome
are you tellin me im not good enough to drink here
this bar is for bikers and truckers only
points his finger to seth you get out
big emilio almost magically appears behind seth and places his big beefy sausage fingered hand hard on seths shoulder
to seth in spanish walk pendaho
seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder
low take your hand off me
spanish im going to count to three
no im going to count to three
jacob jumps in the middle
now wait a minute theres no reason to get ugly
theres just a misunderstanding going on here
you said this bar is for truckers and bikers well im a truck driver
everybody looks at jacob
as jacob talks he takes out his wallet
if you look outside your door parked in your parking lot youll see a big ass recreational vehicle
in order to drive that legally you need a class two drivers license
that is the same license that the dmv requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck
he takes the license out of his wallet and lays it on the bar that is me and this is my class two license
this is a truck drivers bar i am a truck driver and these are my friends
everybodys a little stunned after jacobs speech
razor charlie picks up the license looks at jacob looks at everyone in the party and smiles
to jacob welcome to the titty twister
what can i get you
seth brushes off big emilios paw
bottle of whiskey and five glasses
razor charlies eyes go to seth
even though he has a big smile on his face he looks like hes going to kill seth
but instead he just says coming right up
razor charlie goes for the bottle
big emilio gives the party one last look and walks away
richard gives jacob a buddy punch on the shoulder
good job pops
seths still frying an egg on his head
thats just fuckin typical
biggest number one problem with mexico its not service oriented
i was feelin so good and those fuckin spies brought me down
richard puts his arm around seth
fuck em shake it off
razor charlie brings the bottle and the glasses
seth looks at the guy still pissed
you serve food jose
razor charlie knows seths taunting him with a racial slur but he just smiles and says best in mexico
i kinda doubt that
were grabbin a table send over a waitress to take our order
seth walks away and the group follows him
we just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of razor charlies head
the five of them move across the floor to a table
as they walk kate attracts stares wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons
jacob keeps near his daughter
the dancers do their sexy routines
a big chested wild haired blonde catches scotts eye
she winks at him
richard leans over and whispers in scotts ear
anytime you want a lap dance with that broad say the word
its on me kiddo
he gives the boys neck a squeeze
jacobs eyes survey the surroundings
big emilio and razor charlie quietly exchange words about the party in spanish
in spanish theyre not the normal road trash we normally feed on
but itll be okay
no one knows theyre here
the five of them find a table and sit down
seth still in a bad mood takes the cork out of the whiskey bottle and tosses it
he pours richie and himself a glass
picking a fight why not against your religion
wont be baited no i do drink im just not drinking now
suit yourself more for me
to scott scotty
scott shakes his head no
to kate how bout you
pointing at scott and kate are safer in here with us than wandering around a mexican border town all night long
just dont do nothin stupid and well all get along fine
to scott scotty you sure you dont want a drink
okay ill have one
no you wont
seth pours scott a shot
sorry pops but im drinkin and i dont like drinkin alone
bottoms up boy
scott takes the drink and he too experiences an on drinkers tremor
seth turns to kate
how about you cutie pie
ready for round two
seth just passes her the bottle
she pours her own shot and knocks it back
to seth hey dr
frankenstein i think you just created a monster
jacob turns to seth and asks quietly
why are you so agitated
im still stewing about that ape laying hands on me
and that fuckin bartender sticks a weed up my ass too
he backed down
hes smilin at us
but behind his smile hes sayin fuck you jack
i hear that loud and clear
what are you going to do
picking up the whiskey bottle im gonna just sit here and drain this bottle
and when ive drunk the last drop if i still feel then the way i feel now im gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head
before we stepped in here you told all of us to be cool
that means you too
tossing it off i never said do what i do i said do what i say
are you so much a fucking loser you cant tell when youve won
richard kate and scott both turn to jacob
nobody can believe what he just said
neither can seth who calmly lays down his drinking glass
what did you call me
i didnt make a statement
i asked a question
would you like me to ask it again
are you such a loser you cant tell when youve won
pause the entire state of texas along with the fbi is looking for you
did they find you
they had every entrance to the border covered
theres no way you could get across
yes you did
youve won seth enjoy it
seth looks at jacob then picks up the bottle
jacob i want you to have a drink with me
jacob slides his empty glass over to seth
seth pours booze in jacobs glass and his own
both men pick up the glasses
to your family
they both knock em back and slap the empty glasses down
now is your shit together
seth turns to scott
in that camper out there i saw a guitar
i take it thats yours
yeah its mine
go out and bring it in
i feel a song coming on
seth sitting at the table playing guitar singing mexican songs
some bikers truckers and whores have gathered around their table
seth finishes the song
razor charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone that he uses to announce dancers
announcer voice in spanish and now for your viewing pleasure
the mistress of the macabre
the epitome of evil
the most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth
lowly dogs get on your knees bow your heads and worship at the feet of the lights go down low
a light hits the stage
the opening notes of the coasters down in mexico fills the room
the crowd hushes up
and on the stage steps santanico pandemonium
this mexican goddess is beautiful but not the beauty that stendhal described in as the promise of happiness but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom
she dances to the raunchy music not like she owned the stage but like she owned the world
and if the patrons of the titty twister are her world the world is proud to be her possession
all activity in the bar save santanico stops
even the fuller gecko table falls under her spell
especially richard scott and kate
seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar
when the music builds to its explosive section
santanico leaps from the stage landing in the middle of the room
she does an eyes closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat
as the music continues to play a very fucked up looking chet pussy walks in
he goes over to razor charlie and points at seths table describing what happened
as the last verse plays santanico like a snake comes up from the ground on top of the fuller gecko table
richard kate and scott are enraptured
santanico scans the table zeroing in on our boy richard
she stands over him
while moving her body to the music she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table and pours the whiskey down her leg
she lifts up her foot with the whiskey dripping from her toes and sticks it in richards face
to richard in spanish drink up
richie mesmerized sucks the whiskey off her toes
the crowd goes wild
santanico smiles master of all she surveys
jacob and scott are embarrassed
kate oddly enough is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man shes deathly feared
seth laughs out loud a mexican yi yi yiii laugh keeping the beat with his guitar
across the room razor charlie chet by his side motions over big emilio
he begins explaining with pointing what seth and company did to chet
richard continues to suck her toes
the song ends santanico extracts her foot from richards mouth
steps off the table
takes a drink of whiskey
looks down at the seated richard
she grabs the back of his hair yanks his head back
his mouth opens because shes hurting him
she leans her face over his like shes going to kiss him
then lets the whiskey from her mouth fall into his
they never touch
the crowd applauds
she lets go of richards hair
except for jacob and richard both for their own reasons the table applauds none louder than seth
now thats what i call a fuckin show
one of santanicos flunkies brings the naked woman a robe which she puts on
richard still in a daze looks up at his new friend
snapping his fingers earth to richie
dont you wanna ask your new friend to join us
well then ask her dumb ass
looking up at santanico por favor senorita
would you care to join us
to richard muy bien gracias
santanico sits down next to richie
seth pours her a drink
richie you lucky bastard
to santanico now little lady you could of just as easily done that to me
who a nelly
you got my dick harder n chinese arithmetic
the table laughs
which reminds me of a joke
little red riding hood is walking through the forest and she comes across little bo peep and little bo peep says little red riding hood are you crazy
dont you know the big bad wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you hes gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties
then little red riding hood hitches up her skirt and taps a
magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says no he wont
as seth tells his joke jacob notices razor charlie big emilio and chet moving rapidly towards their table
to himself oh shit
to seth seth seth waves him away
so finally she comes across the big bad wolf and the big bad wolfs laughing and says little red riding hood you know better than to be walking around these
you know im just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties
then little red riding hood whips out her
cocks it sticks it in the big bad wolfs face and says no you wont
youre gonna eat me just like the story says
seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously
richard kate scott and santanico join in too
before jacob can say anything the titty twister trio stand over the table
to chet in spanish which one
pointing at seth this piece of shit broke my finger and my nose
pointing at richard then this fag kicked me in the ribs while i was down
thats all big emilio has to hear
to the gecko brothers up
fuck off ape man
big emilio leans in with his beefy hand grabs richard by the shoulder
richard lets out a howl as blood pours from his wounded shoulder
santanico steps back from the table
seth jumps to his feet and fires a round from his
into big emilio sending his bullet ridden body to the floor
razor charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake and slashes seth across the face
seth screams at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to his laid open cheek
richard who has fallen to the ground holding his wound brings up his
and starts blasting
razor charlie takes a bullet in the head chest and belly before he hits the floor
jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay out of gunfire
the bikers truckers waitresses and whores all stop what they were doing
the music continues to play though the dancers stop dancing
santanico whos closest to the two brothers smells something
her nostrils flare
richard moves to his brother who takes out a handkerchief and puts it to his face
how are you
scarred for life thats how i am
seth looks up and sees chet still standing there
you thought it was pretty funny didnt you
both brothers fire on chet
chets blown left
then drops pointing their guns towards the crowd
everybody be cool or youll be just as dead as these fucks
slow motion blood drips down the side of seths face
slow motion it splatters to the floor
the camera scans the crowd
the patrons are scared but the waitresses whores and dancers lick their lips
slow motion blood drips from richards shoulder
it falls to the floor splattering
we move into santanicos face
a special aroma fills her nostrils
her eyes lock on richard
the look on her face could easily be read as intense sexual desire
looks up and watches eyes wide with fear santanicos transformation
her nose recedes into her face like a rodents
the whites of her eyes turn yellow
the fangs of a beast protrude from her mouth
kate yells from the floor
yelling richie look out
before richie can turn around
santanico leaps across the floor lands on his back and sinks her fangs into richies wounded shoulder
richard lets loose with an agonizing scream
seth turns to his brothers cry
he sees santanico pandemonium like a mongoose attached to a cobra legs wrapped around richards waist fangs buried deep in his shoulder and richard screaming and slamming about trying to
knock her off
richard screams to seth shoot her
get her off
seth tries to aim his gun but theres too much movement
he cant get a clear shot
jacob and his children cant believe what theyre seeing
richard cant take it anymore his knees buckle
santanico rides him down to the floor
seth gets a clear shot he takes aim and fires hitting the vamp in the head blowing her off his brother
richard whos on all fours tries to stand and gets about half way before he stops saying with his dying breath fucking bitch
he tumbles over a corpse
suddenly the eyes of big emilio razor charlie and chet pussy pop open
the dead men sit up with evil grins on their faces
the patrons scream
a whore locks the front door which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground turns toward the bar and yells dinner is served
the bikers and truckers who have been transfixed watching the impossible realize that the waitresses naked dancers and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago have turned into
yellow eyed razor fanged drool dripping the vamps attack
what follows is a shark feeding frenzy
whores who had been sitting on customers laps sink their teeth into unshaven necks
naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other
truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size
the patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the monsters chairs chair legs broken bottles switchblades anything
jacob kate and scott make a dash and dive behind the bar
they hide and watch
seth stands where his was limp dick of a
in his hand too freaked scared and stunned to do anything
he stands motionless watching what he cant believe
behind him santanico who lies next to the dead richard eyes pop open
she rises in her snake dance way
seth feels her and spins in her direction gun raised
lets see if you taste as good as your brother
she approaches seth who fires at her
she laughs and gives her hair a toss back
seth moving backwards is terrified
santanico gives seth a swinging round house punch to the jaw that sends him flying over a table sliding across the floor and into the wall
a bad ass biker named frost with a hideous burn on the side of his face stands on top of a pool table swinging a pool cue left to right
fending off vamps
big emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other
the biker winner of the bare knuckle fight sex machine goes head to head with a stripper
the vamp might have superhuman strength but sex machine has close to superhuman strength and hes matching the vamp bitch blow for blow
then he grabs her by the waist lifts her up over his head and brings her down hard on an upturned table impaling her on the wooden leg
frost is still swinging his pool cue when razor charlie appears straight razor in hand
frost jumps off the table to meet the challenge
razor charlie swings at him frost leaps back swinging his pool cue at him
they do this dance till frost cracks charlie upside the head with the pool cue breaking it in half
charlie feels the hit
frost plunges the splintered end of the cue in razor charlies heart
green blood comes out of his chest as charlie screams the vampires death scream
seth comes to and finds santanico standing over him
he tries to rise but santanico places her bare foot on his chest pinning him down to the floor
he tries to move but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest
im not gonna drain you completely
youre gonna turn for me youll be my slave
youll live for me
youll eat bugs because i order it
because i dont think youre worthy of human blood youll feed on the blood of stray dogs
youll be my foot stool
and at my command youll lick the dog shit from my boot heel
since youll be my dog your new name will be spot
welcome to slavery
slow motion a whiskey bottle flies through the air sailing end over end
looking down at seth her face contorts to feed mode when the bottle hits her square in the head shattering
we see that jacob behind the bar threw it
santanico bathed in whiskey and broken glass is momentarily dazed
she looks down at seth
seth sits up
in hand and fires
santanico is hit in the chest
the bullet from the gun makes the liquor soaked robe ignite
santanico screams as she goes up in flames
big emilio sees santanicos fiery death
he lets out a cry
he turns his hateful gaze on the two humans
seth and jacob see big emilio zeroing in on them then they see him move his big frame in their direction
seth turns to jacob
we may be in trouble
big emilio walks steadily through the bar like godzilla walks through tokyo
tipping over tables knocking fighting vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out seth and jacob
a trucker jumps in his path to attack him with a quick swing of his hand the trucker is brushed aside receiving a broken neck for the effort
big emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off seth and jacob
seth and jacob both grab pieces of wood holding it like a weapon but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent
big emilio stands in front of them
the two men hold their wood tight
fangs grow in big emilios mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark
just when big emilios ready to strike he hears behind him hey you monkey man
big emilio turns and sees sex machine across the room
anything you gotta say to them say to me first
both seth and jacob attack big emilio from behind
he effortlessly knocks them away
they both hit the ground
sex machine gestures with his hand to big emilio to come ahead
big emilio charges towards sex machine like a runaway locomotive
sex machine stands his ground waiting for impact
the two huge men collide
what follows is literally a war of the gargantuans
the two mastiffs pound each other till one buckles
finally the one who buckles first is big emilio who hits the floor
once on the floor seth and jacob stand over the huge vamp beating him with clubs and pipes like l
the vamp can do nothing except squirm on the floor from the savage beating
jacob and seth stop
sex machine holds a pool cue in his hand
he snaps off the end tip making it jagged and like a spear sticks it into big vamps fallen body
big emilio screams twitches and dies
the pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp
chet pussy spies ms
apple pie pussy herself kate
he breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his mouth
kate and scott are cowering behind the bar when chet appears over the top
they both let out a scream
scott goes to protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his trouble
chet dives at kate
you know what everybody says about me
chet goes to bite kate grabbing at her t shirt and sees her crucifix
he recoils backwards
scott grabs hold of his head from behind
kate jumps up from the floor rips off her cross and grabs chet by his beatnik beard opening his mouth
she shoves the cross inside
chets eyes roll up back into his head
scott slaps chet hard on the back
chet has swallowed the crucifix
a sizzling sound is heard moving down from his throat to his belly
he opens his mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle
he jumps up from behind the bar doing a wild dance from pain
he jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling screaming all the while
kate and scott watch him from the bar mischievous grins on their faces
chet is on his knees arms stretched out yelling at the top of his lungs like a vamp king lear
chet breaks off a chair leg muttering to himself
stop the pain stop the pain stop the pain stop the pain stop the pain
he plunges the stake into his own heart but instead of the vampires cry that escapes from the others upon being staked chet lets out a sigh of relief
by this time there are not too many people left
most of the vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the customers have been butchered or drained
all thats left on the vampire side are two naked dancers and two whores
on the human side are seth jacob and his kids sex machine and frost
aside from the children who are hiding behind the bar all the humans are holding wooden stakes
the four human men group together
the four female vampires charge teeth exposed snarling and dripping with blood
seth jacob sex machine and frost raise their weapons and slam almost simultaneously the four vamps
all four staked bodies hit the floor
kate and scott run from behind the bar to their fathers side
they all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken place
the floor is littered with dead bodies
aint they supposed to burn up or something
at that moment a bright flash erupts illuminating everyones face
the sound of quick burning flames fills the air
everybody shields their eyes from the intense light which lasts only a split second
it vanishes along with the bodies of the vampires
all that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay
they all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then run for the door
they bang on the door but its useless
it aint budging yet they all go on banging
except for seth
he never ran for the door
he walks over to his dead brothers body and kneels beside it
he takes his dead hand
richie im sorry i fucked things up
youd really like it in el ray
wed find peace there
i love you little brother ill miss ya bad
seth goes to kiss his brothers lips when richard s eyes pop open
seth raises his head in surprise
im glad you feel that way seth
i love you too
richard grabs seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him down to him
fangs are now exposed
seth tries to pull away
he screams for the others to help
richard pulls seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite when sex machine grabs seth from behind and yanks him from richards grasp
jacob frost and the kids have surrounded richard and proceed to kick him and stomp his head
sex machine picks up a chair and smashes it against a wall
he picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to where the others are holding richard down
richard sees the wood in the bikers hand
he knows what that means
seth whips out his
and points it at sex machine
touch my brother with that stake biker and vampires wont need to suck your blood theyll be able to lick it up off the floor
he aint your brother no more
thats a matter of opinion and i dont give a fuck about yours
jacob frost and the kids continue to hold richard down to the ground
dont be an idiot hell kill us all
seth aims his gun at the group
yeah shut up
seth still holding the outstretched gun takes the stake out of sex machines hand
seth lowers the
hold him down
the smile evaporates from richards face
richie heres the peace in death i could never give you in life
seth puts the stake over richards heart
using the butt of his
like a hammer he pounds the stake into richards heart
richard screams and dies
they all stand around the body as it bursts into flames and disintegrates into goo
seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar
he grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it
kate of all people walks away from the group and joins seth at the bar
are you okay
why shouldnt i be
the worlds my oyster except for the fact that i just rammed a wooden stake in my brothers heart because he turned into a vampire even though i dont believe
aside from that unfortunate business everythings hunky dory
im really sorry
you hate us
if you had half a chance youd feed us to them
then why didnt i
jacob walks over to seth
i saved your life
i didnt have to but i did
and im sorry you lost your brother
im sorry hes dead
im sorry everybodys dead
now if were gonna get out of this we need each other
and we need you sober and thinking not drunk and
as jacob has been talking a sound has started that has grown louder and louder
jacob stops in mid sentence to identify it
what the hell is that
at first i just thought it was birds
no its more of a gnawing sound
birds peck they dont gnaw
seth puts the bottle in his hand down
the outside of the titty twister is literally covered with hats clawing flapping gnawing trying like hell to get inside
everybody listens to the bats scratching and clawing all along the walls the roof and at the front door
everyones scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to do next
the door begins to crack and splinter little claws poke their way through
give me a hand
jacob runs to a table top
he grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through
the others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door
as the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows a dead biker that the vampires fed on pops open his yellow eyes
he sits up and sees all the furious activity
everyones so busy they dont notice their new friend
the dead biker vamp sets his sights on kate whos putting a board into place
he springs to his feet and pounces on her just as sex machine turns from across the room in her direction
watch out girly
the biker vamp grabs kate from behind
she lets out a scream
the vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug but shes moving around so much he cant get a clear bite
the others hear the scream and look toward kate
sex machine big emilios baseball bat in hand is halfway to the rescue
as the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of kates shoulder kate rams her head back hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his
he releases her and spits out his teeth just as sex machine runs up and swings the baseball bat upside the vamps head breaking the bat in two and sending
the vamp to the floor
as the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars sex machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and shoves it in the vamps heart
he dies and bursts into flames
at that point three other dead victims rise to a sitting position
sex machine grabs a chair and throws it to the ground breaking it
he grabs the four legs
mumbling to himself goddamn fuckin vampires
the biker has turned into captain sex machine vampire hunter
he stakes two of the vampires as they get to their feet
both spew green blood scream die and burst into flames
the third a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap smacks sex machine in the mouth which sends the biker for a loop
as cat cap runs toward the fallen sex machine kate jumps on his back from behind
both of them go tumbling into a stack of whiskey cases
sex machine runs over and grabs kate by the hand pulling her up and out of the way
cat cap is lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey
sex machine raises his stake as cat cap dies and drives it in the vamps black heart
cat cap dies and bursts into flames which hits the whiskey starting a giant fire
frost and jacob stop barricading and run to the fire
to sex machine well put this out
you stake the rest of these fuckers
way ahead of ya
to kate whats your name girly
kate whats yours
pleased to meetcha
kate lets stake these blood sucker fuckers
kate and sex machine give each other a high five and go to work staking the dead bodies
jacob and frost beat down the fire with their jackets and whatever else is at hand
a hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered over
little claws scrape their way through
scott stands in front of the window
yelling we got a problem
seth who is barricading doors and window looks in scotts direction
the hole in the plaster cracks open and out pops a little fleshy vampire bat rat head
the bat rat which is squeaking and hissing its head off tries to squeeze its body through the newly formed hole
seth gun in hand runs to the window
he points the
point blank range at the head of the bat rat
the bat rat sees this makes an oh shit face and yanks his head back through the hole
seth was ready to fire he lowers his gun in bewilderment when
the bat rat bursts through the hole like shot out of a cannon hitting seth in the gut and sending him flying landing hard on his back
once seth hits the ground the bat thing which has the body of a fat rat with a bats large wingspan lickity split runs up seths body to his juggler
seths hand grabs the bats neck and tries to push it away
but the bat thing has its claws dug in seths clothes
the bat thing is just inches from seths face
its mouth is snapping
get this bastard off of me
frost leaves jacob with the fire comes from behind and grabs the bat thing and yanks it off of seth
sex machine and kate are a green bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies
sex machine kneels by a dead body raising the stake in his hand to spear him
the body springs up and bites sex machine on the arm
red blood squirts all over
sex machine screams then brings the stake down in the bodys chest
it dies burns and turns into goo
sex machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt
he quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit
nobody saw it everybody was too busy
frost holds the flapping fighting snapping bat thing in front of him at arms length
he struggles with it for a while then
bashes its head against the bar
the first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker so
frost bashes his head against the bar six or seven times
he then throws the bat thing on the bar turns it over garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register and rams it in the bat things heart
the bat thing coughs and dies
theres a flash of flames followed by a pile of goo
sex machine and kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while frost scott and seth wrestle with the bat thing
jacob has put out the fire
everybody comes together exhausted and takes a breather
outside the bats continue to try and claw their way in
is everybody okay
everyone mutters yeah
okay does anybody here know whats going on
yeah i know whats going on
we got a bunch of fuckin vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin blood
thats it plain and simple
and i dont wanna hear any bullshit about i dont believe in vampires because i dont fuckin believe in vampires either
but i do believe in my own two fuckin eyes and with my two eyes i saw fuckin vampires
now does everybody agree were dealin with vampires
you too preacher
im like you
i dont believe in vampires but i believe in what i saw
good for you
now since we all believe were dealing with vampires what do we know about vampires
crosses hurt vampires
do you have a cross
in the winnebago
in other words no
what are you talking about
we got crosses all over the place
all you gotta do is put two sticks together and you got a cross
peter cushing does that all the time
i dont know about that
in order for it to have any power i think its gotta be an official crucifix
whats an official cross
some piece of tin made in taiwan
what makes that official
if a cross works against vampires its not the cross itself its what the cross represents
the cross is a symbol of holiness
okay ill buy that
so we got crosses covered moving right along what else
wooden stakes in the heart been workin pretty good so far
garlic holy water sunlight
i forget does silver do anything to a vampire
i know silver bullets are werewolves
but im pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires
does anybody have any silver
then who cares
jacob looks at his watch
about two hours from now
so all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door
yeah thats true but i doubt our barricades that door those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin with em
has anybody here read a real book about vampires or are we just remembering what a movie said
i mean a real book
you mean like a time life book
in a cowboy voice john wesley hardin so mean he once shot a man for snorin
i take it the answers no
okay then what do we know about these vampires
aside from theyre thirsty
well one thing they might got super human strength but you can hurt em
yeah that bottle upside the head of santanico didnt kill her but it didnt feel too good either
another thing you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human you better be one strong son of a bitch
the human body is one rough tough machine
but these vamps got soft bodies
the texture of their skin is softer mushier
you can push shit right through em
conceivably if you hit one hard enough you could take their fuckin head off
you could take their head off
actually our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man
he points at jacob hes a preacher
frost and sex machine look toward jacob
as far as gods concerned we might just as well be a piece of fuckin shit
but hes one of the boys
only one problem his faith aint what it used to be
jacob punches seth in the mouth sending him to the floor
jacob stands over him
ive had enough of your taunts
seth looks up from the floor
im not taunting you
we need you
a faithless preacher doesnt mean shit to us
but a man whos a servant of god can grab a cross shove it in these monsters asses
a servant of god can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon
i know why you lost your faith
how could true holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your children
now i always said god can kiss my fuckin ass
well i changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago cause i know without a doubt whats out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell
and if there is a hell and those monsters are from it theres got to be a heaven
now which are you a faithless preacher or a mean mother fuckin servant of god
jacob has to laugh at that
so does everybody else
jacob sticks out his hand and shakes seths
im a mean mother fucking servant of god
the laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing
it immediately reminds the group of the deep deep shit theyre in
i dont know if i can take two hours of that noise
youll take it cause ya got no choice
howd ya like twenty four hours of it lying in a muddy ditch with only the rotting corpses of your friends to keep you company
what are you talking about
back in i was in nam trapped behind enemy lines lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead
they thought they killed everybody and except for me they were right
but it wasnt for lack of trying
a grenade blew up right next to me thats why im so pretty
they thought i was dead so i played dead
they dumped all the bodies in a ditch
all i could do was lie there playing possum
dead bodies under me dead bodies on top of me listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour
as frost goes into his monologue the sound fades out and the camera moves to sex machine
hes having a hot flash
he cant hear anything
hes looking at frost speaking but he doesnt hear any sound
then he hears a deep male voice say thirst
who the fuck was that
he thinks to himself
he turns around nobodys there
no one else in the group seems to hear it a female voice seductively says thirst
we hear sex machines thought in a voice answer
stop fucking saying that
that bite werent nothin
it just hurt like a son of a bitch thats all
it barely punched the skin
sex machine looks at frost whos acting out his story
the biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing
hes describing all the while but we cant hear anything
all we hear are many voices male female children saying thirst
sex machine begins looking at the other members of the group in a thirsty way
he stares at each of their necks closer and closer until he can see the veins on frosts neck actually pulsating throbbing beckoning to him
sex machine has turned into a vampire
the sound comes back as frost finishes his story
and then when i came back to my senses i realized i had killed the entire v
squadron single handedly
my bayonet had blood and chunks of yellow flesh on it like some cannibal shish kabob
and to this day i dont have the slightest idea how i sex machine lets out a hideous cry
frost screams as sex machine grabs hold of him and bites into his neck
the group tries to pull the two men apart
jacob gets his arm around sex machines neck and tries pulling
sex machine takes his teeth out of the bikers neck and sinks them in jacobs arm
jacob screams and lets go
seth kate and scott react to jacob being bit
sex machine grabs jacob and tosses him effortlessly over the bar crashing into a shelf full of liquor bottles
frost hops around the room mad as a hornet holding his bleeding neck
i been bit
he fuckin bit me
sex machine punches seth in the face dropping him like a sack of potatoes
he smacks the shit out of kate
she goes flying into a table
sex machine turns seeing frost breaking off a big table leg
frost looks at the big vamp
to sex machine youre dead mother fucker
youre gonna bite me
you just turned me into a vampire asshole
what are you gonna do about it
frost table leg in hand runs screaming his head off straight at sex machine
sex machines nostrils flare
he raises his meaty fist and pulls it back so he can really haul off
frost top speed stake raised screaming
sex machine lets loose with his punch seth scott and kate look up from the floor
jacob rises from behind the bar
frosts face collides with sex machines fist
sex machine hits frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air
seth sees where frost is heading and says oh shit
frost in mid air hits the barricaded plastered overwindow and crashes through it
sex machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh
hundreds of bat things fly into the bar
seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom
behind the bar jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground
ten bat things are in hot pursuit of seth kate and scott who are running for their lives
they get to the door of the back room whip it open dive in and slam it behind them
an ugly fleshy bat thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes
kate and scott push on the door as hard as they can
the bat things head which is inside screams howls and snaps in fury
seth turns toward the bat vamp in the door
he sticks his in its big mouth
you wanna suck something suck on this
he fires four shots that blow the bat vamps head all over the wall
kate yells we have to go back for daddy
she spins and grabs the door knob ready to fling the door and help her father
scott grabs her and pushes her up against the wall
hes right kate
he was too far away
if flinging that door and filling this room with those bat things would save him id fling it
the only thing itll do is turn us into one of them
he needs our help
hes beyond our help
you saw him get bit
i saw him get bit
we all saw it
you cant help him
ive got no one left to lose but you
i cant be alone again
were sticking together
just then they hear jacobs voice booming from the bar room
jacob holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting appropriate verse from the bible is keeping the vampires at bay
but as seth predicted it is the shining power of his restored faith that is his mightiest weapon
jacob is making his way through the vampires toward the back door
a lot of the bats have transformed into bat devil human creatures
the creatures stand at the edge of jacobs force field of holiness
many bat things fly around the bar like mad whirling dervishes
a cluster of bat things over above and in front of jacob
they all growl and hiss at the man of god
for every one step forward jacob takes the vampire stake one step back
jacob recites the verse from the bible in a threatening mean mother fucking servant of god tone
as he speaks with authority and strength he sees frost lying on the ground bat things on him like ants on a candy bar
but jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant sight trip him up
jacob has backed himself up by the door
open the door
the door flies open
jacob jumps inside
the door slams shut
jacob hugs daughter and son
as he hugs them we see his bloody arm
when he releases them they cant help but notice
seth explodes knocking over boxes busting chairs tipping over tables and cussing a blue streak
fuck piss shit
mother fuckin vampires
mother fuckin vampires
goddamn mother fuckin vampires
seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the creatures on the other side
you all are gonna fuckin die
im gonna fuckin kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit
to seth you bet your sweet ass you are and im gonna help you do it
but we aint got much time
kate is crying she knows whats happened to her father
youre gonna be okay arent you daddy
no im not
ive been bit
in effect im already dead
scott and kate crying grab their father and hold on for dear life
jacob wants to cry but if he breaks down the kids will never have the courage for what they must do
to his children children listen to me
i love you two more than anybody
and i just want you to know youve made me proud all your lives
but never more so than tonight
and i wish we could sit here and cry till i pass on but we cant
because im not going to pass on
im going to turn into a monster
and when i do im going to be dangerous
but before that happens just know i love you
to seth and the kids now id say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door
and ill probably turn into a vampire within the hour
now you have two choices
you can wait for me to turn then deal with me then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them
or we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit em with everything we have and carve a path right through em to front entrance
but if were gonna go at em we gotta go at em now
i confused them i scared them i took them off guard
but theyre going to get unconfused theyre going to get unscared theyre going to get together and theyre going to hit that door like a ton of bricks
and when that moment arrives we gotta be ready
jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled with boxes and crates
whats this stuff
my guess is that this little dives been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime
this is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks
well i say lets tear this place apart for weapons
so when they burst through that door well make em wish they never did
i dont give a shit about living or dying anymore
i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can
the survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates
a lot of what they find is bullshit
pantyhose coffee teddy bears etc
but a few of the boxes are just what the doctor ordered
cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats
meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment of uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons
and captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools saws and jack hammers
seth and scott saw the bats into wooden stakes
kate fills the uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink
jacob with seths knife etches a cross into every bullet in the
automatics last full clip of ammo
vampires all start converging on the back room door getting their courage back
kate makes water balloons
scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools
seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer
jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons turning it into holy water
our heroes work together preparing for the battle to come
the back room door barricaded with crates and boxes begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side
the room tone is a combination of chewing scratching pounding squeaking and screaming
finally theyre ready
jacob turns to his kids
before we go any further i need you three to promise me something
ill fight with you to the bitter end but when i turn into one of them i wont be jacob anymore
ill be a lap dog of satan
i want you three to promise youll take me down no different from the rest
the kids cant say the words
yeah i promise
jacob doesnt believe them
why dont i believe you
he picks up the
im gonna ask you two again then i want you to swear to god that youll kill me
if you dont im gonna just kill myself right now
now since you need me i think you better swear
kate do you swear to god that when i turn into one of the undead youll kill me
kate doesnt answer
jacob places the
barrel against his temple
kate we dont have all day so im only gonna count to five
okay okay i promise ill do it
not good enough swear to god
i swear to god our father that when you change into one of the undead i will kill you
now scott we have even less time so im only giving you the count of three
you dont believe in suicide
its not suicide if youre already dead
okay ill kill you when you change i swear to god in jesus christs name
thank you son
okay vampire killers lets kill some fuckin vampires
the vampires bat things and what have you start breaking down the door
they are in a mad frenzy
they burst through the door
waiting for them are scott and kate holding uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades
jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the
with the cross bullets
seth is holding the jackhammer
the survivors walk out of the back room into the bar
the vamps back up letting them inside
what we have here is a mexican standoff a la the wild bunch
a moment of peace before the battle
the vamps just watch the humans
the humans just watch the vamps
then like the bull in the china shop seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer
kill em all
jacob holds up the cross the vamps react
the kids spray the crowd with uzi fire burning vampire flesh
the pack of vamps retreat while the fuller squad walk forward
they are attacked on all sides but they keep moving towards the door
seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps it speeds in and out of vampire chests each time spraying him in green vamp blood
jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and shoots three vampires with blessed bullets with the other
flame bursts from the vampires chests when the bullets hit
kate and scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd
they burst and fry several of the vamps who fall screaming in pain
from its perch on a wood ceiling beam a bat thing drops and hurls toward the group
jacob sees it raises his gun and fires
the bat thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire
seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests
the front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk
yelling why did they block the door again
yelling to keep the daylight out
this is where they sleep
get to the door
seth tries to get to the front door when sex machine now a half bat half devil vamp about six foot seven drops from above in front of him
seth rams the stake in its chest
the sex machine thing screams out lifting the hammer and seth off the ground
seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room he crashes into a table
the sex machine thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest dead
kate spraying uzi fire like rambo sees seth fall
she screams seth
seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires on all sides
with no weapons he puts up on dukes
okay dead boys come on
take a bite and feel all right
kate clusters with her father and scott
yelling im going for em
everybody goes home
kate turns into a squirt gun firing water balloon throwing one woman army as she breaks from her father and heads in seths direction
screaming die monster die
die monster die
kate mows down the group by seth they lie on the floor burning in agony
kate takes seths hand and gives him a couple of water balloons and a stake
to seth watch my back
cutting through vampires the two make their way across the bar
jacob firing the
takes out several more vampires in fiery death
scott fires the uzi and chucks more water balloons
as jacob fights all of a sudden the sound goes out
he cant hear anything
he wonders if hes gone deaf
he starts to hear the words thirst thirst thirst
he notices the vampires have stopped attacking him
they look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces
fangs begin to grow
his eyes are yellow
scott turns to his dad
he sees his father is a monster
jacob with a devilish grin on his face grabs scott and sinks his teeth into scotts forearm
scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood
scott takes one of the water balloons hes wearing and smashes it against jacobs head
the holy water melts half of jacobs face away
he lets go of scott screaming and drops the
on the floor
scott drops to the ground picking up the gun
he brings it up to fire
a totally evil jacob with only half a face matches stares with the boy he once called his son
scotts eyes turn to steel
i swear to god in jesus christs name
he fires sending a holy bullet into jacobs forehead creating a hole from which fire shoots out
jacobs entire head bursts into flames then explodes
from across the room fate sees her daddy ignite
she cries out
in the thick of the battle seth yells fight now cry later
kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon which melts his head
a bat thing lands on the back of scotts neck
he screams as it bites into him
he drops the
kate sees scott get bit
oh my god
another bat thing lands on scotts arm and takes a bite
she goes to spray them when her uzi runs out of water
now seven bat things are on scott biting and sucking blood
scott is in agony
kill me kate
kate runs for her brother does a dive and a roll coming up by the
snatching it in one motion and firing three times
three bat things are hit shoot flames then all of them explode blowing up scott
the remaining vamps approach
all the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon
how many bullets left kid
well when you run out of weapons just start cold cocking em
make em sing for their supper
the two survivors are backed up against a wall
two bat things do a kamikaze dive from the air toward seth
seth throws the holy balloon at them
the two bat things burst into flames and spiral to the floor
the two survivors look at the vampires who stand before them
a moment of stillness before the attack
kate stands holding the
to seth should i use the last bullets on us
you use em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you
the vamps begins to close in
kate lines up the
sights on the face of an approaching vampire
seth holds the uzi like a club ready to bash in the first vampires head that gets in swinging distance
beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that kate shot through the wall
approaching vampires burn
the scorched vamps scream like theyve never screamed before
shoot more holes
kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him daylight comes through providing kate and seth with a safe lighted area
the vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them
the two survivors hold hands when
all of a sudden the door to the titty twister is pounded on from the outside
the vamps look towards it in horror
from the other side of the door we hear a voice with a spanish accent
in spanish im looking for my friend
is seth in there
in spanish help us bash the door
bash the door in
in spanish danny manny knock down the door
the vamps are totally fucking freaked out
they run and fly around the bar in a panic
crying howling grabbing onto each other
the front door is torn apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside punching holes the size of basketballs in the door
the table in front of the door gives and falls forward
the door caves in and sunlight invades the bar
many vamps are instantly fried bursting into flames
the mexican gangster carlso and his two henchmen danny and manny are horrified at what they see
they cross themselves in fright
vampires search for dark corners but all is lost
sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room
vamps try and dodge the beams
all around the vamps combust in fiery explosions
the titty twister is now on fire burning out of control
seth and kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot
carlos danny and manny help them to their feet and walk them away from the blazing bar
they catch their breath by carloss mercedes
to seth what the fuck was going on in there
seth signals carlos to wait a minute while he catches his breath
then he hauls off and punches carlos square in the kisser
danny and manny aim their shotguns at seth
in spanish whatsamatter with you

and this girls familys dead
carlos stands up again
im sorry to hear that

danny and manny react to the vampire news by crossing themselves again
oh seth how can i ever make it up to you
you cant but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at el ray is a good start
jesus christ carlos my brothers dead and hes not coming back and its all your fault
they look at each other then shake hands saying in unison

seth gets the suitcase and gives carlos
seth walks over to a red porsche

carlos danny and manny pile into carlos white mercedes
seth by his porsche looks back at kate
kate stands alone
the whole desert seems between them
so much to say
but no words
seth turns his back on her
just as he opens the door kate says behind him seth
seth turns around

kate honey i may be a bastard
but im not a fuckin bastard
he blows her a kiss across the desert
she blows one back
seths in his car and gone
kate turns around faces endless desert before her and begins her long walk home
