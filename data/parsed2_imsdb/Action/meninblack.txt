men in black by ed solomon a million stars wink in the night desert sky
down here on earth an insect one of those big beautiful multicolored four winged jobs glides effortlessly on the breeze wafting along through the crisp texas air
the insect dips it banks it does loop the loops and then splats unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van thats tearing down the road
the driver of the van a fifty year old american turns on the wipers smearing the remains all over
he squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass which clears it up a bit but now he sees something worse up ahead
its a grouping of headlights eight of them all pointed at him sealing off the road
he bites his lip and calls over his shoulder to the back of the van
he speaks in spanish which is subtitled
deja me hablar
let me do the talking
the van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars all government issue four doors with ins stenciled on the sides
seven or eight ins agents stand in front of the cars imposingly
their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window
the driver rolls it down
agent janus blonde haired blue eyed also government issue looks at him and sighs
nick the dick
what a surprise
where you comin from
i was fishing in cuernavaca
sure you were
what do you say we have a look at your catch
the agents fling open the rear doors revealing a dozen frightened mexicans hopeful immigrants without official permission
agent janus looks at the driver whos now held by two other agents and shakes his head
me i woulda thrown em back
to the passengers in spanish vamanos
hagan una lina
form a line
they pile out of the van
some are parents with small children
what do you get nick
hundred bucks a head
i hope you saved it all for your lawyer pal cause youre gonna need he stops in the middle of his sentence as another car is approaching fast its engine
whining as it barrels down the road toward them
several agents pull their weapons
the new car pulls a hard right goes off the road spins around the ins cars and squeals to a sideways halt silhouetted in front of their headlights
its a boxy black ford ltd
two men get out dressed in plain black suits crisp white shirts simple black ties shiny black shoes
kay fiftyish is the apotheosis of world weary his partner dee mid sixties is just weary
they approach the ins agents
well take it from here
who the hell are you
kay and dee flash some form of id
i never heard of division
kay and dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants
whatre we thinking dee
tough call kay
he walks down the row studying the faces greeting each one cheerily in spanish
que pasa coma estas
whats up how are you
no se preocupe abuela
bienvenida a los estados unidos
dont worry grandma
welcome to the united states
next a donde vas
buscando trabajo no
where are you going
looking for work arent you
next es un placer verle aqui
its a pleasure seeing you here
one by one their faces relax reassured by kays calm demeanor
when he reaches the fifth guy he keeps the same cheery tone but que dices si te rompo la cara
what do you say if i break your face
the guy smiles and nods
his own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the guys shoulder
no hablas ni una palabra del espanol verdad amigo
you dont speak a word of spanish right friend
again the guy smiles and nods
kay looks back at dee
we got a winner
to the others los restos estan libres a irse
the rest of you are free to go
tomen el camion y vayeuse
get on the road and go
sir you cant just dont sir me
you have no idea who youre dealing with
silence on the road
the driver grins jumps back in the front seat of the van
the others pile into the rear and they tear out of there
to janus were gonna have a little chat with our friend here
you boys can hit the road
and keep on protecting us from dangerous aliens
kay and dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise leaving the stunned ins agents standing alone in the roadway
you ever heard of division
there is no division
who are those guys
kay and dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush
dee pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two off covering him
kay has an arm draped around the mans shoulders
i think you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town amigo
in fact ill bet dollars to pesos that youre not he pulls out a small laser device which he zips neatly down the front of the mans clothes
from anywhere near here
the mans clothes fall to the ground revealing what he really is underneath a scaly space bastard about four and a half feet tall with a snouth snail like tentacles
and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head
the only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the humanesque head which he still lamely holds in one of his hands
its propped up by a stick like a puppet and it continues to make expressions as he holds it
when did they let you out of jail
mikey replies an unfathomable combination of grunts squeaks and saliva
you know how many treaty articles youve just violated
mikey makes a lame squeak
one my ass
from unauthorized immigration to failure to properly inoculate prior to landing
off mikeys objections okay thats enough
hand me your head and put up your arms
from behind mikey they hear a terrified gasp
kay and dee both look over quickly
one of the aliens eyes on a tall stalk whips around too
all three of them see agent janus standing just over the rise staring in frozen amazement
agent janus screams
mikey rips free of the rest of the mexican disguise knocks dee out of the way and takes off straight at janus screeching a horrible space bastard screech
janus freezes terrified
dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground
dee for christs mikey keeps moving covering the last few yards to janus quickly
he steps on a rock launches himself into the air his dripping jaws cranked wide open there is a sizzling sound a brilliant white flash and mikey erupts in a
geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground the trees and agent janus face
behind where mikey was kay stands smoking weapon in hand
on the road the ins agents pull their guns and run toward the rise
kay has an arm around janus whom he is leading further into the clearing
janus is white shaking eyes like silver dollars
th th th helping that
that wasnt wasnt wasnt human i know
got some entrails on you
he takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the agents face
as he does janus looks back to where mikey blew up
then at kay
and then up at the stars
the other ins agents burst over the rise shouting questions
okay everybody situations under control calm down
if youll just give me your attention for a moment ill tell you what happened
from over the rise car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them
kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder
he checks his watch figures in his head then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to
this is called a neuralyzer
a gift from some friends from out of town
the red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain
more specifically the ones for memory
behind him six more men in black all wearing black suits and sunglasses come over the hill
kay barks a few orders to them
gimme a splay burn on the perimeter please holes at and
what in the hell is going on
exactly the right question
and the answer lies right here
who are you really
im just a figment of your imagination
he holds up the neuralyzer
the agents peer closely at it
kay reaches into his pocket puts on his own black sunglasses and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer
a blinding flash a tenth of a second long sears the agents eyeballs
they stare blankly
god were a gullible breed
behind him tongues of fire blast from a flame thrower held by one of the men in black
kay looks back at the ins agents who are just coming around as if awakening from a concussion
i mean it fellas you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that
the agents look around confused
kay gestures behind him where the men in black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started
underground gas vein genius
you guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms
he jabs a finger into janus chest
dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock staring up at the night sky his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand
kay steps away from the group and finds him
he sits down next to him
didnt used to
he holds up his hands which tremble with age
the spirits willing kay but the rest of me
he looks up at the million stars shining overhead
theyre beautiful arent they
we never just look
back to kay ill tell ya kay
i will miss the chase
kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it
a shot of the clock on the stations stately southern exposure
we pan a pair of feet running
they belong to a man we will know as the perpetrator
as we track with him he speeds up and out of frame
a new set of feet come into frame
these belong to james edwards a nyc cop in undercover street clothes
in the background about ten feet behind are two other cops trying to keep up
edwards is a lot faster though
he pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt
he continues running out of frame and we stay on one of the other cops overweight who gives up the chase and drops to his knees heaving air
all yours edwards
the cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes
as they run down the bridge that traverses park avenue in the low forties
the perp veers to the left and seemingly oblivious to the fact that its a thirty foot drop he hurdles the guard rail and drops to forty first street below
edwards is surprised by this maneuver but doesnt waste a second
he too hurdles the guard rail and lands on
a double decker bus one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic
the bus of course is completely filled with japanese tourists and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera
edwards pushes through the crowd
grand central station off to your left folks
with the bus still moving he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs out through the side door
he spots the perp sailing east on forty first street
dammit man youre making me sweat up my gear
edwards spots one of those new york post delivery trucks the kind with the open back door rumbling by
he runs and jumps into the back
the perp meanwhile is running at top speed when edwards glides into frame leaning off the back of the truck
yo man your luck just ran out
he leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the perp
the perp now straddled by edwards is terrified
and when he gets here ill kick his ass too
edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him when the perp blinks
nothing unusual about that but then another set of translucent milky white eyelids underneath his regular eyelids blinks also
edwards is thrown for a moment which is all the time the perp needs to pull out
his weapon which is the strangest looking gun youve ever seen
reacting quickly edwards bats it out of the perps hand
the weapon smashes into the stone wall surrounding central park and shatters into a million pieces
the perp kicks him in the nuts then scrambles to his feet and takes off again
edwards staggers after him in pain
the perp leaps over a moving car towards the guggenheim museum
edwards tries to follow but a bus pulls in front of him
after it passes the perp is gone
edwards runs over to the museum leans over the wall that surrounds it and in the next instant
the perp flies past him having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the guggenheim
he scrambles up and over the ledge
he runs to the front door of the museum shoots it open and runs inside
he runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the guggenheim
on the roof the perp reaches the top climbs over the edge and crunches to the gravel surface
he leaps to his feet and races over to a door
he tugs on another
its locked too
he pulls on a third
it swings open revealing edwards on the other side breathing hard
he aims his weapon at the perp
the perp screams inhumanly and panics
he backpedals toward the edge of the roof
hes coming because i failed and now hell kill me too
you dont understand
your world is gonna end
but the perp has backed right into the edge of the roof and now he starts to fall over
the perp blinks
what are you
the perp looks down
and he falls screaming to his death
edwards sits on one side of the table a police inspector and a uniformed sergeant the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier sit across from
perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids
you mean blinked with both eyes
he blinked once with one set then again with another completely different set
sort of a low beam high beam
was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces
and why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events
cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection
and they couldnt keep up sir
hey edwards if you were half the man i am what do you mean
i am half the man you are
what the hell is your problem
my problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time
i think he threw him off the roof
ten minutes your best shot
cutting off the sergeant sergeant
i want to talk to you outside
you need ten minutes on a stairmaster you pudgy bastard
a woman sneaks into the room
doctor laurel weaver thirtyish dark haired dark eyed general aura of darkness around her stands above him
laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed which she was and saw a spaceman which she did
she looks over her shoulder once then whispers to him
deputy medical examiner
i believe you
i opened him up
find me at the morgue
ill tell you what i found
wait a minute
wait a minute
turning at the door you have really pretty eyes
she hurries to turn the corner but is stopped by someone who remains just offscreen
weaver from the coroners office
working on the john doe
edwards twists in his chair to get a better look
all he sees is laurel facing whoever it is in the hallway
would you look right here please
the someone says something else and laurel steps forward now also out of edwardss line of vision
edwards stretches even further in his seat when there is a blinding flash from the corridor
really curious now he starts to get up when kay steps into the room and closes the door behind him
edwards rolls his eyes
some night huh
oh yeah some night
he crosses to the door
they were gills
who are you
did he say anything to you
scoffing yeah sure
he said the world was coming to an end
did he say when
youre kidding right
would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again
lets take a ride
wait a minute
i got a ton of paperwork
its all done
at that point the inspector sticks his head in smiles and gives edwards the thumbs up
good work edwards
edwards looks at the inspector then at kay
as they leave
you ran that guy down on foot
thats double tough
in a plain boxy ford kay drives silent
he raises his hand and nods to a black mib truck coming in the opposite direction
edwards in the passenger seat is still in his undercover outfit
so who you with
kay says nothing
you got the plain clothes the government issued wheels
kay remains utterly silent
referring to the car yeah well whoever it is youre short on funding
nothing is what it seems kid
oh yeah my bad ford ltd
thats a luxury ride
cmon who ya with
kay pulls the car to a stop
im part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth
kay opens the door and gets out of the car
edwards looks around
sees theyre standing in front of a pawn shop
this is where were going
they get out of the car
guy buys from chain snatchers
doesnt even sell guns
all right you think its worth shaking him up fine
ill do my thing
then i want some answers
do your thing kid
edwards goes inside
jack jeebs is the sleazy sarcastic proprietor of the pawn shop
hes not easily intimidated
oh hey geez howd these get here
i thought i turned em in to the proper authorities
he casually brushes some rolexes off the counter
way i hear it jeebs you into something a little hotter than some stolen rolexes
sure im a big crack dealer now
i just work here because i love the hours
this pisses edwards off
he grabs jeebs by the collar
getting angry im talking about guns jeebs
high tech stuff
cmon edwards whatcha see is what i got
why dont you show him the imports jeebs
at the sound of kays voice jeebs suddenly pales a look of fear coming over his face
h hiya kay how are you
the imports jeebs
you know i got outta that business a long time ago kay
why do you lie to me
i hate it when you lie
he pulls his own gun and aims it at jeebs forehead
whoa whoa kay hold on a minute here
im going to count to three
edwards seeing that kay is getting somewhere joins in the routine
hell do it jeebs
ive seen him do it
talk to me jeebs hes crazy when hes like this
hes always crazy
to kay take a cruise
get a massage three
kay blows jeebs head off and jeebs body collapses to the floor
edwards is shocked
edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at kays head
put down the gun and put your hands on the counter
i warned him
drop the weapon
you warned him
you are under arrest
you have the right to remain silent
will you relax
irritated dont do that
edwards whirls around to see jeebs body growing another head
only takes four or five seconds
kay calmly shoves his gun up against jeebs baby soft new cheek
do you know how much that hurts
show us what you got jeebs
or ill use up another one
jeebs panicked hits a button on the underside of the counter which promptly flips over revealing yet another dusty shelf piled high with junk but this is all alien junk
weapons mostly bizarre otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes
edwards still dazed by jeebs regrown head glances down at all the weapons
this is what i saw
kay looks at jeebs pissed off
you sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid
he looked all right to me
a carbonizer is an assassins weapon jeebs
who was the target
i dont know
kay raises the weapon again threatening
i dont know
kay lowers his gun gestures to the shelf full of weapons
this is all confiscated
all of it
i want you on the next transport off this rock
or ill shoot you where it doesnt grow back
jeebs nods point taken
ill be by tomorrow for those rolexes
shaken edwards follows
edwards staggers out of the shop trying to get the days events straight in his head
the eyelids fine
and the jumping thing and the gun
okay but the head
searching for a handle on the moment here
a place to file all this
see a head doesnt do that it doesnt just grow back
looking up whats going on
cant help you kid
only comfort i can offer is that tomorrow you wont remember a thing
this im gonna remember for a long long time
kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket
he hesitates for the briefest of moments as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the others
then he puts on his sunglasses
ever see one of these
the flash dims on edwards and kay sitting at a table in a chinese restaurant
finishing a joke and the wife says yeah harry i know but this ones eating my popcorn
he busts out laughing
edwards across from him is completely disoriented
he looks down
theres a half eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him
kay checks his watch
thanks for the egg rolls
where am i
see what i mean about tequila
youre a bright young man james
just lay off the sauce
ill see you tomorrow nine a
he turns and walks out
edwards checks his watch
a waitress appears
she walks off
edwards looks at the table
there is a business card lying next to his plate on which kay has handwritten james d
edwards saturday a
edwards looks at it puzzled
he turns the card over and looks at the other side
theres not much there no name no phone or fax number no e mail address
just three little letters dead in the middle of the card a lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate new york farm country
several lights are on and through a window we can see the silhouette of a man sitting at the kitchen table the silhouette of a woman hovering over him bringing
things to him
the man edgar waves his arms ranting
i go out i work my butt off to make a living all i want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on
the table but instead i get this this i dont even know what you call this
in the sky above its one of those brilliant star fields
but something strange is happening with one of those stars its getting bigger
ill tell you what it looks like it looks like poison
dont you take that away im eating that damn it
it is poison isnt it
no that star isnt getting bigger its moving
it goes from a pinpoint to a dime to a nickel to a quarter and works its way into fruit metaphors
i swear to god i would not be surprised if it was the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much or aint been hit enough
i cant make up my mind
okay were way past watermelon now that thing is huge and its starting to glow hot red as it enters the earths atmosphere headed straight toward us coming here to
beatrice and edgars place
the blazing fireball barrels through the sky snaps off a couple trees youre useless beatrice
the only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck
and slams right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway
a concussive blast follows then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts
the silhouette of edgar leaps to its feet races to the door and throws it open
edgar is everything his voice led us to expect a nasty bug eyed redneck carrying a twelve gauge shotgun
his mouth agape he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck
the skeleton of the truck is still there but theres a huge smoldering hole in it a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground
he walks to the truck and touches the door handle
using his shirt tail he opens the door and peers down into the hole
in the hole he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights
embedded into the ground is indeed a spaceship maybe eight feet across
beatrice calls from behind him standing in the doorway fearfully
what is it edgar
turns to her get your big butt back in that house
beatrice does as shes told closing the door behind her
edgar turns back to the smoldering rock raising his shotgun in defense
an otherworldly voice comes from deep in the hole
place projectile weapon on ground
edgar staggers back a step terrified
but then he regains himself raises the weapon and steps forward pointing it menacingly down into the hole
you can have my gun when you pry it from my cold dead fingers
there is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer
finally it responds in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to edgars
your proposal is acceptable
a long hairy pincer flashes out of the hole grabs edgar by the head and pulls him down into the hole
from deep in the hole we hear a terrible ripping sound like a bedsheet being torn in half
there are some disgusting gushy sounds then a moment later something flies out of the hole and flops onto the ground next to the truck
well sort of
his body parts still hang together face arms legs even clothes but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there flat and empty like a tuxedo on
the floor after the prom
the shotgun flies out and lands beside him
beatrice sits at the kitchen table terrified still wiping away tears from edgars diatribe
the door opens and edgar comes back into the kitchen seemingly fleshed out again leaving the door hanging open behind him
he carries the shotgun
she looks up at him anxious
but his face is a blank
what on earth was it
he looks at her strangely
when he speaks his voice is different than before
she looks out the window at the smoking truck
ive never seen sugar do that
give me sugar
puzzled beatrice gets up goes to the cabinet and grabs a bag of sugar
she holds it out to him
frightened she takes a glass of water from the table
she dumps some of the sugar into it
she puts more till the glass is brimming
she stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him her hand trembling
edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp
beatrice stares at edgar no idea what to think
she notices something odd about the skin on his neck
edgar your skin
its its just hanging off your bones
edgar drops the glass and looks in a window to catch his reflection
he reaches up and twists his whole face as if adjusting a ski mask then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar
he looks at her
a loud scraping sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship
the nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit wavers keeps moving and finally crunches to the ground outside the pit
edgar climbs out of the pit breathing heavily
he dusts himself off and continues pushing the ship along the ground off into the darkness
the next morning
edwards holding the small mib business card in his hand compares the address written down by kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him
its seven stories high gray windowless perfectly square squatting on a bridge over a road like a fat guy on the john
edwards steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long bizarre room
one wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake
there is an elevator at the far end of the room and an old security guard the rent a cop kind reading a comic book on a folding metal chair
edwards walks across the room his footsteps echoing
the guard looks up
maybe im not sure see i got this card elevator
push the call button
and he goes back to his comic book
edwards maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point walks across the room toward the elevator
as he draws close the elevator doors whoosh open expecting him
edwards steps inside and turns around
the doors close
he pushes the call button and waits but the elevator doesnt move
instead doors on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him
edwards waits unaware
from behind him somebody clears their throat
edwards turns around and finds himself standing in this back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway
standing at the front of the room is zed a wire haired career g man an old school bureaucrat wearing the exact same kind of suit kay had on last
six other hot recruits sit in egg shaped chairs staring at edwards
one chair is empty
edwards takes the remaining chair
the elevator doors slide shut
zed continues addressing the recruits
my name is zed
youre all here because youre the best of the best
marines navy seals army rangers
they all turn and regard edwards a little smugly
he gives it back
and were looking for one of you
what will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills hand eye coordination concentration stamina i see we have a question
edwardss hand is indeed up
why uh im sorry its just no one really asked this but why exactly are we doing this
then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand
zed calls on him
loud and formal jake jensen west point graduate with honors
were here because youre looking for the best of the best of the best sir
edwards tries to stifle a laugh but cant
whats so funny edwards
i i dont know sir
best of the best of the best of the best of the realizing nobody is with him on this it just struck me as totally serious humorous
then zed continues
lets get going
the recruits scribble away at the written test
its a thick document reasoning skills general knowledge diagrams
the recruits seem to be really powering through it filling in answer after answer
but no desks have been provided for them and theyre all still in their chairs writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees
edwards is really struggling
he writes two words on one answer then decides to erase it
the lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy his pencil even tears through the page
he looks up
in the middle of the tile floor there is an unused table
edwards gets up goes to it grabs hold and drags it screeching deafeningly back to his chair
everybody looks up wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room
edwards sits back down now writing on the table
zed raises an eyebrow
he stares at edwards then looks up toward a smoked glass window
behind the dark glass a figure stands staring unemotional
seven weapons rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty triangular room
the seven recruits stand in front of the table
theres an odd moment where everyone sort of looks around at each other at the blank walls
any of you guys know what were doing here
clipped unquestioning looking for the best of the best of the best
cant help but smile well yeah i know but
suddenly the two far walls pull apart
the whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images both human and alien
everywhere is color light and movement a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously
the recruits lunge for the weapons snapping them up and taking aim
six shots are fired at once
and then a second later a seventh shot is fired
everyone sort of looks at edwards who puts his gun down last
theres an awkward silence
then the door opens
light pours in and zed with it
even the highly competitive cadets cant help but feel some sympathy as zed walks straight to edwards
the hell happened
zed looks into the gallery
most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging snarling beast which has three bullet holes in its chest
next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head which also has three holes in it
in the back corner of the gallery there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight year old girl
may i ask why you felt little tiffany deserved to die
she was the only one who actually seemed dangerous
at the time
and how did you come to that conclusion
hook head guy
you explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head
answer its not his head
his head is that butt ugly bean bag thing over there
cause if you look at the snarling beast guy hes not snarling hes sneezing hes got tissues in his hand
no threat there and anyhow the girls books were way too advanced for an eight year olds
and besides from where im looking she was the only one who appeared to have a motive
and i dont appreciate your jumping down my throat about it
sideways glances from the other recruits
or uh do i owe her an apology
zed and kay stand behind smoked glass staring at the recruits who are still in the shooting gallery waiting for a decision
hes got a real problem with authority
so do i
the guy ran down a cephlapoid zed
that i can use
i hope you know what youre doing
zed turns and walks away
kay stares through the glass at edwards who stands alone on one side of the room apart from the rest of the group
zed reappears on the other side of the glass coming through a door and into the shooting gallery
as he talks kay turns and walks off
congratulations youre everything weve come to expect from years of government training
now if youll just follow me we have one more test to administer an eye exam
the recruits follow zed out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway
zed motions them off to the left
edwards is the last one out of the room but he stops as he steps into the hallway
kay is outside the door waiting for him
edwards recognizes him from last night
hey whats goin on
the other recruits continue down the hall with zed
kay doesnt answer just gestures to edwards to follow him down the hall which he does
back in the mid fifties the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet
as they pass an alcove edwards notices the six other recruits who have been herded into a corner
zed addressing them pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket
now if youll look directly at the end of this device
he holds a neuralyzer up in front of them and the recruits stare obediently at it as zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses
edwards stares fascinated but kays hand reaches in and yanks him away just as zeds neuralyzer flashes white
as kay leads edwards down an impossibly long corridor he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs
he hands jay the first picture a shot of eight or nine men in plain black suits standing around a fifties style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights
dee and zed are there much younger
everybody thought the agency was a joke
except the aliens
they made contact on march nd outside new york city
another photograph a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering in the night sky classic flying saucer shapes
there were nine of us that night
an amateur astronomer
and one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road
yet another photograph this one showing a young kay in a shirt and tie holding a bouquet of flowers staring at the open door of the landed flying saucer
alien shapes are visible within
you brought the aliens flowers
kay steers edwards to the right down another corridor just as long as the first
they were intergalactic refugees with a simple request
let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet
ever see casablanca
same thing no nazis
so we masked all evidence of their landing
another picture this one of the worlds fair grounds still under construction
giant models of rockets mark the fairs theme of space travel most prominent in the construction are two tall towers with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of
the worlds fair was a coverup
why else would we hold it in queens
another hallway now left
more nonhumans arrive every year
they live among us in secret
not to change the subject but when was your last cat scan
every six months its company policy
well thanks for the very amusing morning but im hopin youll show me where i came in
cause this is where i go out
they have stopped next to an unmarked door
kay throws it open and steps inside
yeah sure hang on i wanna grab a coffee while were right here
as kay walks into the kitchenette edwards jaw drops his eyes widen and he stares in wonderment at three worm like aliens standing around a water cooler
tall impossibly thin most certainly not from new york the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of esperanto and microphone feedback
to the aliens dont tell me weve only got that powdered shit for cream again
one of the worm aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter
he finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated dumps some in his coffee and comes back outside closing the door behind him
he reaches up and gently pushes edwards jaw up closing his mouth
for future reference this is a better look for you
edwards thrown for a major loop sits like a zombie alongside kay on a bench in battery park
kay drinks his coffee while they talk
any given time around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet the majority right here in manhattan
most aliens are decent enough just trying to make a living
not as many as youd think
humans for the most part dont have a clue
dont want one either
they think theyve got a pretty good bead on things
why the big secret
people are smart they can handle it
a person is smart
people are dumb
everything theyve ever known has been proven to be wrong
a thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact that the earth was the center of the universe
five hundred years ago they knew it was flat
fifteen minutes ago you knew we humans were alone on it
imagine what youll know tomorrow
so whats the catch
what youll gain in perspective youll lose in ways youre too young to comprehend
you give up everything
sever every human contact
no one will know you exist
youre not even allowed a favorite shirt
thats the speech i never heard
thats the choice i never got
you track me down put me through those stupid ass tests now youre trying to talk me out of it
i dont get it
you got til sun up
is it worth it
you find out you let me know
almost nighttime now and the park is empty
edwards is still on the bench
and still thinking
above him the stars are coming out
slowly he looks up into the vastness of the heavens
the next morning
a door opens on a garage and an orkin man steps inside carrying a tank of toxic gas
the morning light spills on an abundance of spiders crawling everywhere big ones small ones hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place
the orkin man sighs and sets down his tank
well well well
movin right in are we
think we own the place
he unfurls a hose from the side of the tank
got a little eviction notice for you boys
he raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank
lethal gas starts to hiss from the end of the hose
just what exactly do you think youre doing
the orkin man turns around
edgar stands in the doorway to the garage staring at him disdainfully
shrugs takin care of your pest problem
you got a hell of an infestation
edgar advances on him slowly
you know i have noticed an infestation here
everywhere i look in fact
nothing but undeveloped unevolved barely conscious pond scum
so convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short pointless lives
dont you want to get rid of em
in the worst way
edgar lashes out quickly jerking the mask off the orkin mans face with one hand and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other
the orkin mans car keys drop to the garage floor and edgar picks them up
a six by ten sheet of plywood thuds to the driveway outside the garage
edgar raises one end of it so its hanging off the back end of the orkin mans van now its a ramp
he walks off and we hear that familiar scraping sound again
edgar grunting with the effort slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into the back of the orkin truck
edwards stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room the same one he first came into yesterday
the elevator doors open and kay obviously summoned by the old security guard stands waiting for him
one thing you gotta know right now
edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with kay
inside the elevator the doors whoosh shut kay turns a key in a certain floor number and the descent begins
im in because theres some next level shit going on around here and im with that
before you beam me up there are a couple of things we need to get straight
you chose me cause you recognize the skills
so as of now you can cease with all of that calling me son or kid or sport
now about those skills of yours the elevator doors slide open on men in black headquarters
as of this moment they dont mean much
its unlike anything weve ever seen huge multileveled of sixties design polished steel and glass
the workplaces are sleek and uncluttered manned by both humans and aliens
most of the aliens stay in the background like the upside down guy who walks on the ceiling shuffling papers
kay and edwards step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place
kay leads him down into the complex
first they walk past a sort of passport control center where a human bureaucrat at a desk is checking the documents of a line of aliens whove just arrived
there are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line chatting in half a dozen different alien tongues
edwards slows as they pass listening to the passport control officer as he addresses an arquillian a large humanoid visitor
purpose of trip
duration of stay
carrying any fruits or vegetables
edwards just stares fascinated but kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along
hes a little
kay moves him into the central hall
a couple of hours wait after a light year flight would get on anybodys nerves
what branch of the government do we report to
they started asking too many questions
so who pays for all this
oh we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out of state visitors
at a storage cage kay turns a key in the lock of a caged in area and throws the door open
inside there are piles of sophisticated looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops
picking something up here
a new recording device to replace cds
so now i gotta buy the white album again
something else this is amusing
he holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone
were not supposed to have it
ill tell you why
human thought is so primitive its considered an infectious disease
makes you proud doesnt it
edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves
dont touch that
the ball zings out of edwards hands it flies out into the main complex hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room faster than the eye can follow various shots
of humans and aliens ducking dodging and jumping out of its way
on kay as he calmly a little wearily slips an odd looking metal glove over his right hand
he raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it kay catches the ball calmly
caused the new york blackout
practical joke by the great attractor
he thought it was funny as hell
they leave the room
on the main floor they walk briskly across the room reaching a giant screen on the far wall
observation the heart of our little endeavor
the screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe log lines of data flashing next to them
this map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time
some of them we keep under constant surveillance
he hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of boxes each with smaller video images
everyone on these screens is an alien
in public normal
in private youll get the idea
on the screens we see live images of aliens
aliens who look alien are in spots where they cant be seen
aliens who look human are functioning right out in public including sam donaldson
and tony meet the twins
kay gestures to two small bony creatures with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads
they turn around and wave two or three arms each
i gotta be honest about something
it makes no sense
it makes perfect sense
when i was a third grader in philadelphia they told me i was crazy cause i swore that our teacher was from like venus or something
edwards stunned looks at kay as eyes boots her onto the screen mean face cat glasses
extremely well hidden tail
well one of the moons
with their remaining arms they punch button after button on the enormous console
zed who was standing up close to the screen walks over to edwards sizing him up
whats your jacket size edwards
uh forty regular
then lets put it on
put what on
the last suit youll ever wear
like the rest of the place the mib locker room is all white
white walls white floor white ceiling white lockers
zeds voice comes over from now on youll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by mib special services
edwards reaches out and opens a white locker revealing a black suit hung from a hanger in the middle
above it on the shelf a black hat and a pair of black sunglasses
on the bottom a pair of shiny black shoes
kay is at a computer terminal
on screen are edwardss birth certificate drivers license social security card library card everything
zeds voice continues youll conform to the identity we give you eat where we tell you live where we tell you get approval for any expenditure over a hundred dollars
edwards stands in a cramped white booth
he holds both his hands on a ten fingered keypad pressing down hard
the pad glows red a searing sound comes from his hands and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and not at all painlessly change his fingerprints
you will have no identifying marks of any kind
you will not stand out in any way
one by one kay deletes edwardss identity cards
on the computer screen is edwards full name james darrel edwards iii
kay punches a couple keys and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of edwardss name
your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter
pants come off the hanger
the white shirt is removed
more letters are eliminated from his name
it reads james darrel ed
then james darr
youre a rumor recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly
you dont exist you were never even born
the coat is removed
the hat comes off the shelf
anonymity is your name
silence your native tongue
you are no longer part of the system
were above the system
feet slip into black shoes
a belt is buckled
a tie pushed up
on screen all thats left is the letter j
as the coat is buttoned we notice the sleeve
monogrammed on the cuff is simply the letter j
we are the men in black
looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit james d edwards iii or rather jay steps into the doorway from the locker room
he reaches into his pocket takes out the sunglasses and looks at kay
the difference between you and me
he slips on the sunglasses
i make this look good
we are looking at a telephoto shot of manhattan in all its splendor
we see the orkin van topping a hill heading towards manhattan
zeds office is a circular windowed room elevated above the main floor of mib headquarters
jay and kay sit across the desk from zed
there are five video monitors on a wall behind zeds desk and on each monitor is another man in black in different parts of the world the city name and
a clock ticking in a corner of the image
while zed talks he goes through paperwork on his desk
okay lets see
to one of the monitors bee we got the deposed sur prefect of sinalee touching down in the forest outside portland tonight
im pulling you down from anchorage to do a meet and greet
bee an agent on one of the monitors nods
bring a sponge
going through memos what else everybody we gotta keep rolling fish goat out of the sewer system hes scaring the rats
and bobo the squat wants to reveal himself on unsolved mysteries
bee make sure he doesnt
he turns a page coming across a red memo
red letter from last night we had an un authorized landing somewhere in upstate new york farm country
keep your ears open for this one kay were not hosting a galactic kegger down here
next to him his computer screen beeps importantly
zed looks over at it
well well well we got a skimmer
to jay landed alien out of zone
to zed who is it
hes not cleared to leave manhattan but hes way out of town right now stuck in traffic on the new jersey turnpike
why dont you take jay
this is a good one for him to warm up on
jay and kay come out the front of mib headquarters
yo wussup with zed
imitating him go get em tiger
were not hosting an intergalactic kegger
zed was saving the world before you were born son
show some respect
an mib mechanic pulls up in kays black ltd and hops out leaving the door open
jay sizes up the car
we got the use of unlimited technology from the entire universe and we cruise around in this
kay glares at jay
hes getting annoyed
they get in and slam the doors
kay starts the car and the engine hums quietly
you know yall gotta learn how to talk to people
you could be a little kinder and gentler
kay grits his teeth
buckle up please
now did that hurt
kay shifts the car into reverse
the awesome power of the car kicks in and jay sails forward thwacking into the dash
kay shifts into forward and taps the gas slamming jay back into his seat
makin fun of my ride
a lighted panel rotates into place between the two front seats
jays hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel
never push the button jay
jay jerks his hand away
the ltd is now stopped by the side of the road dust swirling around it
ahead of it another car has pulled over
kay gets out jay follows a moment later shaky legged
kay walks up to the window of the car theyve stopped
the driver a guy in his mid thirties with a wife in her mid thirties rolls the window down
license and registration please
the driver hands over some documents
kay flips through them
other license and registration please
the guy digs out two other cards and hands those over
jay peers over kays shoulder
the photographs on the resident alien id cards are of two friendly looking reptile types husband and wife smiling atthe camera their long skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort
kay hands them back
your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only
where do you think youre going
its my wife
shes shes well look
kay leans down and looks in the window
redgick is in front moaning in pain holding her swollen belly
kay straightens up fast
redgick screams in pain
for the first time since weve seen him kay is nervous
no big deal
to jay you handle it
sure its easy you just sorta catch
redgick screams again
redgick gets out of the car worried
are you sure he knows what hes doing
yeah hell sure he does this all the time
cmon let him work redgick i wanna ask you something
kay gives jay a supportive slap on the back and leads redgick away to the rear of the car
jay stays in the background and opens the rear door tentatively
he leans down into the car
i see it i see it i see it
a few yards from the car kay turns redgick to face him
croagg the midwifes back on th and th
you were headed out of town
well were uh meeting someone
suddenly a tentacle whips out from between mrs
redgicks legs cracks the whip once and wraps around the door post grabbing hold
oh sweet jesus mother of god did you see that
still to redgick so
who you meeting
well its a ship
i didnt see a departure clearance for today
uh well it was an emergency
now a second tentacle whips out but this one wraps around jays neck and pulls tight
he gasps choking
guys guys doin fine ace
back to redgick what kind of emergency
whats the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden
choking to death help
he starts tugging for all hes worth but the fight is sort of going against him as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to pull the
we just dont like the neighborhood anymore
some of the new arrivals
redgick looks at kay clearly concealing something but darts his eyes away
what new arrivals
this have anything to do with the crasher from last night
screaming can you guys do this later
but in that moment jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame acquires leverage and rips the baby free
he falls flat on his back in the dirt the multi tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest
oh oh oh man
kay turns and claps redgick on the back
its a lizard
jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest
misty hey you know it is sorta it vomits on him
back in the car jay wipes the last of the puke off his suit while kay starts up the car
anything about that seem unusual to you
jay just looks at him very jack benny
what kind of new arrival would scare redgick so bad that hed risk a warp jump with a newborn
thinks lets check the hot sheets
close on on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them
there are headlines like pope a father
and top doctors baffled baby born pregnant
and man eats own house
the subhead on that one is and thats just the appetizer says neighbor
kay and jay are at a downtown newsstand
kay is furiously searching through the tabs jay is standing behind him a little embarrassed
these are the hot sheets
kay pulls a copy of the weekly world news from the stand and gives the guy a buck
best damn investigative reporting on the planet
but hey go ahead read the new york times if you want
they get lucky sometimes
youre actually looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid
not looking for
he smacks the paper down on the hood in front of jay the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the
second coming farm wife says a flap of skin now getting gray and crusty with age hangs off edgars neck as he sits in the front of his orkin van
he sucks as hard as he possibly can on a straw stuck into a jolt cola double the sugar
triple the caffeine
one of a six pack that sits on the dashboard
across the street edgar sees a short older man come out of one of the jewelry shops on thirty fifth street
edgar drops the soda and stares
the older man rosenberg is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box
carefully he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive shop
that finished he picks up the cat then the box then waddles off down the street one under each arm
edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him slowly trolling along behind him
on the street rosenberg walks happily along humming to himself
he gives his cat a little peck
as he rounds a corner we recognize the tune hes humming ive got the whole world in my hands
the orkin van rounds the corner behind him
the ltd pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to beatrices farmhouse where the alien ship landed
the wrecked pickup truck is still there
jay and kay get out very undercover cop
jay starts up the driveway
not so fast
walk up slow
part of the routine
makes it look like were sizing up the situation
gives her time to get the wrong impression
beatrice appears in the door to the house curious
puts some fear into her
makes things go smoother
beatrice calls to them
can i help you gentlemen
beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her more nicely dressed a touch of makeup a smile on her face
kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws close
as she reaches for it the card reforms into an fbi badge
how do you do maam im special agent manheim this is agent black fbi
had a few questions about your visitor
are you here to make fun of me too
we at the fbi dont have a sense of humor that were aware of
mind if we come in
in the living room kay sips some of her lemonade and winces
jay moves through the room checking it out as beatrice tells her story
and they said to me if he was murdered how could he walk back in the house
and i must admit i was a little stumped by that one
but i know edgar
and that wasnt him
it was more like something else that was wearing him
like a suit
an edgar suit
a little giggle escapes her at the thought
jay over by a bookcase notices a framed photo of edgar kneeling in the woods proudly about to skin a deer
if he was this ugly before he was an alien
anyway when i came to he was gone
did he say anything
he asked for water
sugar water if i remember
did you taste her lemonade
kay nods puts on his sunglasses
takes out another pair hands them to jay
kay draws his neuralyzer
beatrice freezes staring straight ahead as if hypnotized
kay takes jays glasses off and hands them back to him
pulling off jays sunglasses okay beatrice
there was no alien and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasnt a ufo
swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from venus whoa
that thing erases her memory and you give her a new one
standard issue neuralyzer
and thats the best you can come up with
on a more personal note beatrice edgar ran off with on old girlfriend
go stay at your mothers for a few days and get over it
decide youre better off
butting in yeah and youre better off cause he never appreciated you anyway
in fact you kicked him out and now that hes gone you ought to buy some new clothes maybe hire a decorator or something
kay is in the hole where the ship landed investigating
he holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth
the analyzer shifts colors
from up outside the hole hey
when am i gonna get one of those memory things
the spectral analyzer turns blue
when youre ready
re analyzer please not green
and then green
kay closes his eyes and sits back leaning against the dirt
above him jay leans over staring down
kay looks up at him
do you know what alien life form leaves a green spectral trail
wait dont tell me that was the question on final jeopardy last night
at the car kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone
softly into mic zed we have a bug
he turns off the radio and sighs
jay stands next to him
im gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad
bugs thrive on carnage tiger
they consume infest and destroy
they live off the death and decay of other species
so basically you have a racial problem with all insect based life forms
listen kid imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than albert einstein four times stronger than an ox nine times meaner than hell strutting his stuff around manhattan island in
his brand new edgar suit
does that sound like fun
what do we do
with a bug in town
watch the morgues
rosenberg the jewelry store owner steps out of a cab in the meat packing district still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat
he heads into leshkos a russian diner
a moment later the orkin van pulls to a stop across the street
rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant squinting in the relative darkness
at a table in the middle he sees a man eating alone an enormous dignified yet profoundly strange looking man in his mid fifties
rosenberg walks carefully over to the table but does not sit down
the man an arquillian and if were eagle eyed we recognize him as the alien on a diplomatic mission from passport control rises from his chair
he steps forward to face rosenberg who sets the ornate box on the table
immediately rosenbergs cat jumps on top of it
rosenberg and the arquillian stare at each other for a long moment and then embrace each other
the embrace has an odd formal quality to it like mafiosi coming to a sitdown
they hold on long and hard and both seemed choked with emotion
finally they break apart and take their seats
they speak in a bizarre alien tongue which is subtitled
rosenberg wipes away tears
sorry im late
the cab drivers on this planet are terrible
your majesty you are in grave danger
yeah and they overcharge you every time
sir a bug landed here
we must get you off the planet
he must know why im here
we think he does
noticing the ornate box on the table is that what i think it is
no just some diamonds for your children
do we have time to eat
the arquillian relaxes
i ordered you some pirogi
in the kitchen the russian cook slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter table six is up
and turns away back to the grill
a hand reaches in takes the plates and sets them on a tray
we follow the tray but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it
he carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant
the doors swing in as another waiter sweeps into the kitchen and our waiter heads out into the dining area
as the doors swing closed behind him they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice cans of stewed tomatoes and a dead waiter literally folded in half and stuffed
in among the shelves
rosenberg and the arquillian raise their glasses in a toast
to the continued reign of the arquillian empire
to the safety of the galaxy
they clink glasses and drink just as the waiter arrives
still we see only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the plates of pirogi
he carries them to the table and sets them down
rosenberg setting his glass down next to the plate catches a glimpse of the waiters hand just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiters sleeve and scurries
across the table
the glass slips out of rosenbergs hand dumping wine all over the table
he looks up slowly and sees the waiters face
another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of edgars sleeves and scurry across the table
rosenberg and the arquillian freeze paralyzed with fear
they seem to know what dire implications edgars presence holds
in english again you can kill us both but you will not find it
youre right about one thing
suddenly a long stinger whips out from under the back of edgars apron and zips under the table
first rosenberg and then the arquillian lurch forward their chairs their faces contorting in pain
they both pitch forward their faces slogging into fresh pirogi
the stinger snaps out from under the table and whips back under edgars apron
he moves quickly searching their pockets but he doesnt find what hes looking for
the cat still perched on top of the ornate box hisses at him
edgar reaches out and bats the cat away with one vicious swipe of his hand
the animal howls and flies across the room landing in a womans lunch
the woman screams
now other diners attention is drawn to edgars table where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter
there are shouts of outrage a few men rise out of their seats
edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it but finds it locked
with the furor rising around him he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for the door
rosenbergs cat leaps back onto the table and snarls at him as he goes
later and the russian diner is now a crime scene clustered with cops and flashing lights
three bodies now on stretchers and covered with sheets are being loaded into the back of ambulances
rosenbergs cat races out of a uniformed cops arms and leaps onto one of the stretchers meowing mournfully
the uniformed cop turns to a police inspector who is questioning the woman from the diner
what am i supposed to do with the cat
i dont know
send it with the stiff
let family claim it
the cop nods and follows the stretcher with rosenbergs body into the back of one of the ambulances allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its dead owner
for the time being
the doors of the wagon slam shut
the stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters
rosenbergs cat still on his chest meows curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with city morgue written across them
the words split in half as the stretcher bangs through the doors
the city morgue is a crowded brightly lit tiled place with corpses parked left and right
busy day in the apple
the cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the coroner whos hunched over another body
where do you want contestant number three
the coroner turns around
laurel weaver the woman who tried to speak to jay before
she sighs and waves a hand
by the wall i guess
noticing whats with the cat
oh the cat
theres a problem with the cat
laurel signs his clipboard
whats the problem with the cat
laurel gives him a dirty look but he laughs and leaves
she goes over to the stretcher and bends down petting rosenbergs cat gently
are you having a bad day baby
of rosenberg his is worse
she sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights
laurel is hunched over the corpse the only light in the room coming from the overhead spot that illuminates her work
fascinated by something she digs deeper
and looks up her face a mixture of alarm and excitement
oh my god
kays ltd pulls up in front of the morgue
two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue
they hasten down the hallway their shoes clicking in perfect lockstep headed for those swinging doors at the other end
jay and kay
men in black on a mission
in the morgue laurel has fallen asleep on her desk her head in her arms
rosenbergs cat sits on the desk next to her licking its paws
suddenly the cat looks up meowing urgently
laurel looks up and following the cats gaze turns around slowly in her chair
jay and kay stand in the doorway staring at her
kay steps forward holding out that black card again
it reforms into another kind of official id this time it says department of public health into recorder approximately degrees at time of autopsy indicating quite impossibly a post mortem
increase in body temperature
examiner attempted to verify result rectally only to find subject was uh without rectum
which can only be described as
leo menville department of public health
this is dr
she looks up
jay and kay are standing there
yeah well whoever you are im afraid im going to need to see some id
he hands her his carte noir which changes to read dr
menville department of public health
she hands it back
checking her watch you boys must not have much of a home life
we watch the morgues very carefully
youve got something unusual
id say so triple homicide
she gets up and goes to the arquillians body which is still out on a table under the lights
the first corpse was perfectly normal except that he was broken in half but when i opened up the other two well look
she throws back a sheet revealing to them only not us the fully dissected arquillian
kay raises an eyebrow jay nearly retches
theres a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything ive ever seen
kay steps past her going straight to the body
he begins to examine it
ill have a look at this one
white why dont you and dr
weaver check out the other body
this way doctor
jay and laurel cross the room to where rosenbergs corpse lies out on another gurney
this ones even stranger
i did a full laparotomy
i started with the lesser curvature of the stomach though if you want we could begin at the gastro esophageal junction
i think uh we should start at the same place you did
jay hears a meow and looks down
rosenbergs cat is rubbing up against his leg
guess it is now
came in with the bodies
she snaps one of her rubber gloves and reaches down out of frame sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside
just by the look on jays face one can imagine how disgusting it is
laurel digs in up to her elbows
she pulls one bloody glove out to wipe a strand of hair out of her face
he looks at her and she winks at him
dive right in
god knows he wont mind
jay is reluctant so she rolls her eyes and helps him taking him by the hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse
you have very pretty eyes
thank you but is this really the time to uh you know come on to me
hey just walking the dog
continuing feel that
where the piloric junction would be
now push that aside
notice anything strange
doctor theyre all missing
quickly well of course they are
what im pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left
so theyre intact wherever they are
that we can be sure of
have we met before
i have the strangest feeling of deja vu
you know i was just going to ask you the same thing
laurel looks at him sideways skeptical but also intrigued
she whispers to him
confiding in him
you wanna know what i really think
re kay but dont tell that guy
he looks like hes already under enough stress
then this body is not really a body but its actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether
the question is what
jay just looks at her intrigued
by the way stop me if im freaking you out
not at all
after a particularly gross gushy sound he looks away toward her
shes staring at him
laurel leans over and lowers her voice just for him
you know what i like to do sometimes
when its really late
freaked out no
from the other side of the room kay clears his throat
he walks across the morgue to kay who is still examining the arquillian
but jay never takes his eyes off laurel
what do you think
of laurel very interesting
got a real queen of the undead thing goin on
of the body
the dead body
not a clue
keep her occupied
try not to sound too dumb
across the morgue laurel is still examining rosenberg now bent down next to his head carefully studying his left ear
she notices something strange turns and calls over her shoulder to jay
jay in conversation with kay does not respond to what is not his name
still louder dr
he still doesnt answer
shouting kay nudges jay
youre up slugger
jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her
look at this
jay leans down
there is strange stitching around the base of rosenbergs ear
what is that
he reaches out touches the ear then he actually turns it
with a soft it pulls away from the head
like a latch
jay and laurel look at each other astonished
jay pulls again and rosenbergs entire face pushes out with a mechanical hum then hinges open the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull
though not quite dead the tiny little green man is gravely wounded
he staggers up out of a small control room inside rosenbergs head with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull
far freaking out
they lean in closer
the tiny little green man a baltian forces words out of his mouth
must to pre prevent searching for the word contest
to prevent its all right what are you trying to say
the baltian nods vigorously
faltering galaxy on or or orions thinks what is word
the baltian nods again falls and dies
jay and laurel look at the little dead alien then at each other
to prevent war the galaxy is on orions belt
the hell does that mean
turns around hey
i mean dr
uh whatever come here
kay begins over
laurel looks at them
youre not with the department of public health are you
jay shakes his head but is now paying more attention to kay as he leads him toward the little man
kay looks at the mess the body the little dead man
you knew him
one of the few i actually liked
exiled high prince
i was right this is an alien life form and youre from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps
kay and jay are not paying attention to laurel
he said to prevent war the galaxy is on orions belt
this make total sense
how else do you explain new york
the other night im in a cab this guy
without even looking at her kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out
he said theres a galaxy on orions belt
that makes no sense
thats what he said
to the dazed laurel didnt he
right after he realizing oh for christs sake you did the flashy thing already
as if awakening uh hi whoever you guys are im afraid im going to need to see some id if youre going to be in the morgue okay
sure thing sweetheart
here you go
he neuralyzes her again
jay slaps his hand
stop that to laurel ignoring jay typical day too much caffeine get a life
that thing probably gives you brain cancer
never hurt her before
never hurt her before
how many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman
arent you worried about you know long term damage
more evasive little bit
what the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch
i took this job
he heads out
hey you never flashed me with that thing did you
jay and kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car
hey kay i really think i should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department
not while im around slim
yeah well youre a menace with that thing
an mib containment vehicle pulls up and four men dressed in black suits get out
to an mib agent weve got two dead aliens in there and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory
the orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown
from inside throaty wails of frustration can be heard
two passersby hear the racket and hesitate wondering if they should get involved
but an inhuman growl rattles the whole van and they wise up hurrying on their way
inside the van the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred its various locks holding tight against edgars repeated attempts to claw his way into it
crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the rest of the box and smacks
it with his right fist
he bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van where it finally cracks a hinge
edgar snaps it up pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver and wrenches the top off the box
inside there are dozens of precious glittering diamonds which he promptly tosses aside as worthless
but the rest of the box is empty
no no no noooo
he rips the box apart with his bare hands
theres nothing else there
as lower manhattan is waking up jay and kay enter the building
despite the early hour the headquarters is going full blast
the large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the constellation jay and kay hurry in kay peels off to one of the monitors jay heads for zed
doesnt anybody believe in sleep around here
the twins keep us on alpha centaurian time a hour day
give it a few months youll get used to it
or youll have a psychotic episode
he points up at the screen with a laser pencil
heres orion the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky
pointing and heres orions belt he indicates the three stars that make up the belt
thats what the little guy was talking about to prevent war the galaxys on orions belt
there are no galaxies on orions belt
the belt is just these three stars galaxies are huge made up of billions of stars
switches off the laser pointer you heard wrong
youre attracted to me arent you
jay starts to cross over to another monitor where kay is sitting alone tie loosened slightly disheveled
on the screen the word searching blinks encouraging patience
the image changes to a satellite view of north america which quickly zooms in on the southwest
on screen the satellite view zooms down to arizona then a city then a neighborhood then a block then a back yard
the printout changes to the image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular where we get a good look at a middle aged woman
whoever elizabeth ann reston is shes lovely
shes setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment unaware that shes being watched by an eye in the sky just as kay is unaware that jay
is standing behind him
jay notices the monitor with the middle aged woman on it
he looks at kays expression then back at the monitor
kay clicks off the picture of her
jay drags a chair and sits down
you were the guy with the flowers in the photo the night the aliens arrived
what you were on your way to a dance or something and you got lost
and she never got those flowers did she
kay doesnt answer just stares at the screen
elizabeth looks up as if she knows shes being watched but shes just looking at the sky wondering how many starsll be out tonight
grumpy guys story comes into focus
she ever get married
its more than kay can bear
he reaches out and flicks a switch
the monitor goes blank except for a data screen kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely
jay looks at him is this me in thirty years
a moment goes by
finally well its better to have loved and lost than never to have try it
jay and kay cross back toward the lad landed alien display where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering light
some lights are starting to go out
quietly with dread theyre leaving
weve had twelve jumps in the last hour
redgick was just the beginning
what do they know that we dont know
kay looks to his partner then to the screen
another light flickers out
why do rats desert the ship
to the twins go to lem sat iv
put up a forty field view of manhattan
on the screen new york city is just a bright spot of light on the eastern coast of the united states
now theres a view of the earth from space
now were looking at earth from far far away and from here we can see something that doesnt belong in this picture a battle cruiser far off to one side
of the earth
the words level four flash in red letters on one side of the map
thats an arquillian battle cruiser
and weve got a dead arquillian prince
a communication starts coming over the speakers a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender
message coming in
the communication continues
speak of the devil
the communication continues
they sound pissed
to the twins translate that and step on it
to kay meanwhile get down to rosenbergs store and see what you can turn up
kay and jay walk away
and kay take a lot of fire power
in the equipment locker kay pulls out the enormous many barreled hand gun
a small clear canister sprouts from underneath it malicious swirling gases visible through its walls
i like that
series four de atomizer
kay pulls out another weapon the tiniest gun weve ever seen
we call this the noisy cricket
you get a series four de atomizer and i get a noisy cricket
looks at the gun im afraid im going to break it
jay follows kay out glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the arquillian battle cruiser hum and whir as they swing around into position pointed down at the
unwitting planet below
the window in the front door of rosenbergs jewelry shop collapses in a shower of glass
edgar reaches in and fumbles with the locks undoing them one by one
he gets them all and steps inside
out the window behind him we can see his orkin van double parked in the street in front
all the gems and jewels are under glass counters
edgar starts smashing the glass grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside
outside a new york city tow truck pulls up to the front of the orkin van and starts to hitch up
edgar in his rage starts to smash anything breakable even the framed pictures on the walls
he stops at one particular picture staring intently at it
its a glamor shot of rosenbergs cat provocatively posed on a satin pillow
there are a half dozen more pictures of the cat some posed with rosenberg some by itself
this animal was important to rosenberg
from outside the roar of an engine distracts edgar
he turns around in time to see the orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the ground
edgar rushes outside as the tow truck driver gets the van up on the hoist
thats my truck
and make sure you tell them that at the impound
edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge
he points it at the tow truck driver
the tow truck driver looks at him with disdain and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean looking gun
i got worse
he keeps hitching up the van
two pedestrians walk past the dispute very fast ignoring the debate headed right for the shop
we go with them and realize that its jay and kay
they stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and exchange a glance
kay pulls a very menacing looking weapon nods and they step inside
they look around and see the recent demolition caused by edgar
jay furrows his brow
who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels
someone whos not looking for jewels
jay moves behind the counter
on the floor is an ornate empty bowl and a bag of cat food next to a scrumptious pillow
there are several photos of a cat on the wall
there is also a pile of bejeweled cat collars
jay picks up one of the collars inspects it closely shaking his head
this guy had a serious crush on his cat
jays attention is broken by something through the window
outside lumbering straight for the store is edgar
jay thinks for a moment where does he know that face
suddenly edgar raises his arms pointing both the farmers rifle and the drivers shotgun
before edgar can shoot jay yells
and then jay fires shattering the storefront window and blowing up a car on the street
the blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet slamming him into the wall with tremendous force
edgar turns and rushes away down the street as jay picks himself up
the bug in the edgar suit
the ugly redneck from the picture
jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after edgar
picking himself up damn it
kay runs out after jay
edgar doesnt bother sticking around to continue his fight
he jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck starts it up and hits the gas
the engine roars
jay sprints after him firing his noisy cricket
he is thrown back into some pedestrians while his shot
hits the rigging between the orkin van and the town truck separating the two
jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck but it accelerates too quickly
edgar is just about to turn the corner when jay leaps onto a parked car to try and get some height
as jay prepares to shoot edgar disappears around the corner and a hugh truck backs into his line of fire
jay fires the truck explodes and jay flies backwards hurtling through the air and crashing through the window of a car his rear end right in the woman drivers face
when jay looks up kay is standing before him
he yanks jay out of the car
we do not discharge our weapons in view of the public
can we drop the cover up bullshit
theres an alien battle cruiser thats gonna blow up the world if we dont
theres always an alien battle cruiser
or a korlian death ray or
an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they dont know
kay gestures to a group of onlookers drawn by the curious blasts from the store
theres smoking rubble everywhere
dont worry about the bug
hes not leaving town
weve got his ship
after gesturing to the back of the orkin van where edgars spaceship is neatly stowed kay pulls out his cell phone
into phone zed were gonna need a containment crew down here at mcdougal south of houston
back at men in black headquarters the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens locations are going out one by one about one every five or ten seconds
a warning buzzer is sounding over and over and human staffers are rushing left and right
zed is in his office
containment may be a moot point my friend
the exodus continues
its like the partys over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check
zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor
you sorry little ingrates
what about the arquillians
weve only translated a part of the message so far deliver the galaxy
no they dont want much do they
oh it gets better
theyre holding us responsible
he looks up at the screen
it reads another contestant has entered the ring
as kay puts away his phone turns to jay all right kid
the arquillians want the galaxy whatever the hell that means
we need help
someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics
i just hope the little prick hasnt skipped town
the tow truck squeals to a halt at a curb
edgar gets out and walks away fast cursing under his breath
he rants livid thinking hard
as he passes a newsstand he grabs the news vendor by the collar
where do you keep your dead
thinks i dont have any dead
i dont know the city morgue
edgar shoves him away roughly
but before he leaves his eye catches a postcard display marked landmarks of the new york city area
edgar stares fascinated but we dont see what hes looking at
he reaches out and picks up a color postcard
he raises it to his face thinking then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off
kays ltd screeches to a halt in front of the kiosk on orchard street
jay and kay leap out and jay spots the vendor closing up the shop
hes wearing a dirty cardigan watch cap and fingerless gloves his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms
he has a small dog in front of him
jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter
of course that guys an alien
thats gotta be the worst disguise ive ever seen
a voice answers him but not the vendors
you dont like it you can kiss my furry little butt
jay looks down
the voice is coming from the dog
this is frank the pug
kay approaches motioning to jay to make sure no one hears
you busy frank
sorry kay i cant talk right now my rides leaving in kay grabs frank
he yelps like well a dog
call the pound
we got a stray
get your paws off me
passerbys glare at kay who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog
jay tries to explain
dog owes my friend some money
to frank arquillians and bugs
what do you know
i know nothing
not a thing
kay shakes frank the pug trying to force an answer
rosenberg wasnt some two bit arquillian
he was the guardian of a galaxy
they thought he would be safe here on earth
and the bug had other plans
the galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe
if the bugs get their slimy claws on it kiss the arquillians goodbye
ask him about the belt
to frank rosenberg said something about a galaxy on orions belt
whats he talking about frank
kay shakes frank the pug once more
to a person passing by theyre rehearsing a ventriloquist act
the galaxy is here
the galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets
hows it here
if a dog can smirk frank does
you humans whenre you gonna learn that size doesnt matter
just cause somethings important doesnt mean its not very very small
like the size of a marble
or a jewel
now if youll excuse me i need to be walked before the flight
kay lets go of frank turns to jay who is lost in thought
to frank the pug get out of here
then to jay the galaxys here
its not on orions belt
jay suddenly notices frank the pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk
in the morgue laurel is working at a desk when suddenly rosenbergs cat leaps up onto it from nowhere the way cats do landing right in the middle of the
file shes studying
boy when you want attention she pets the cat
as she does the cats collar shines in the light
laurel turns the name tag to face her
as it is written across the collar of the cat
thats a pretty name
from out in the corridor a bell rings ding ding
laurel notices something dangling from the cats collar a circular icon of a strange and beautiful metal
the center is some sort of hardened translucent material light green in color
she peers into the jewel and her face washes over with amazement
its as if laurel is sucked into another universe
her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield millions of stars billions of green verdant planets all racing by her at the speed of light
outside the bell dings again
orion looks up as if knowing whos out there and not liking it
she snarls at the door and leaps off the desk scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment
jay and kay barrel through town
so two galaxies have been fighting for years
and the only people whove been benefiting are a race of creatures called bugs
then the two galaxies decide to make peace
and the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops
by killing the emissaries and stealing the galaxy theyve been fighting about
and if we dont get it back before he leaves the planet
were not even history
cause history implies theres someone around to remember it
on a counter in the morgue corridor a gray peeling hand bangs on a bell on a countertop over and over
the hand belongs to edgar who is carrying his shotgun concealing it behind one leg
the morgue attendant tony emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of atlas shrugged and a fly swatter
thank you for making sure the bell works
suddenly quick as a gunfighter tony snaps the fly swatter down on a buzzing fly
to edgar whats up farmer john
a man came in here earlier
a dead man
and this means what to me
he was a very dear friend of mine
and i believe he had an animal with him
a gift i gave him a pet cat that means worlds to me
i would like it back
ill need a picture id written proof of ownership of the cat or notarized proof of kinship with whack
tony flicks the fly swatter again sending another bug to meet its maker
edgar grits his teeth
dont do that
still another fly goes down
tony looks down to where edgars hands rest on the counter
half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve
he ducks under the counter and comes up with a can of raid
edgars eyes bug out
kays ltd pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and jay and kay jump out
ill handle this one you wait outside
what the hell for
because all we have to do is walk in and get a cat its not that hard
but if you go in youre gonna lay your jack webb on her and flash your brain ray in her face and shes gonna end up with leukemia or some
the womans a doctor she doesnt need you erasing half her med school classes
take me five minutes
and he continues into the morgue leaving kay waiting outside
laurel slams into a wall on one side of the morgue thrown there by edgar
he leans in close furious
where is the animal
i told you i dont know it ran under some equipment
he grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue toward the equipment she pointed to
as they draw close orion the cat bolts from underneath it races between their legs and leapfrogs over several small cabinets landing on top of a very tall one with
only six inches clearance between it and the ceiling
a very tough hiding place
edgar just starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice from the corridor outside
edgar looks up at the cats hiding place
no time to get it
the bell dings again
roughly edgar pulls laurel close and puts a finger to his lips shhhhhhh
in the corridor jay looks around
no tony no answer to the bell
he dings once more then heads into the back
jay comes into the morgue
laurel is in there standing right up next to an examination table but there is no corpse on the table just a sheet draped over it
she just stands there in the middle of the room staring at jay
flashes a badge im sergeant friday from the twenty sixth precinct
they brought a cat in here with a corpse the other day might have said orion on the cats name tag
right well the cat is uh the cats a witness in a murder case and im going to need to take it with me
i dont know where the cat is at the moment
lowers her voice to a whisper maybe you could take me with you instead
jay looks at her
i said maybe you could take me with you instead
damn you do start fast dont you
id really like to go with you
jay just looks at her amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman
he looks over his shoulder to make sure he has a few more seconds alone
and uh why exactly is that
laurel rolls her eyes
she seems irritated with him but it doesnt go with what shes saying
i just do
kay comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor
he checks his watch then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes
jay is thoroughly enjoying himself but laurel seems to be going crazy
i have something i need to show you
she looks down pointedly in the direction of her waist
now slow down you dont have to hit the gas like that
she leans in and lowers her voice
you dont understand
you really need to see this
and i will
but we gotta get something straight here im gonna drive
its not some kind of macho trip its just the way im used to doing things okay
kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side
he raises it to his cigarette but as it draws close the match goes out with a sharp kay furrows his brow
laurel is at the end of her rope
look stud i dont know how many more times im going to get to tell you this
theres something she points sharply at the examination table directly in front of her
that you have to help me with
jays smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out
he starts to reach for his gun
kay raises another lit match to his cigarette but as this one gets close a big glob of goo drops from the ceiling and onto the match dousing the flame
kay looks up sharply
above him tony the counter guy is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous dripping fluid
hes dead a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of raid still clutched in his hand
from inside the morgue laurel screams
kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the air revealing edgar who was hiding beneath it
now everything happens at once
jay leaps back and draws the noisy cricket kay pulls out his series four deatomizer and edgar holds his shotgun under laurels chin using her body to shield his own
freeze it bug
to jay christ are you thick
how was i supposed to know
what did i have to do sing it for you
maybe if you didnt come on like a drunken prom date
oh thats so typical
any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence men just everybody shut up
let her go shit eater
listen monkey boy i may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe but compared to you humans im the top rung on the evolutionary
ladder so can it all right
youre breakin my heart
move six inches to your left and ill solve all your problems
orion the cat suddenly attacks leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on edgar hissing and scratching and clawing for all shes worth
edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off
the cat squirms in his arm the icon jangling
edgar grabs the icon holds onto it and flings the cat away across the morgue
the icon comes free remaining in his hand
he drops it into his mouth and swallows
he shoves the gun hard against laurels cheek
now put down your weapons
kay freezes teeth clenched gun still in front of him
have you ever pulled the wings off a fly
edgar cranks one of laurels arms behind her back hard and she cries out in pain
would you care to see the fly get even
how far you think youll get without your ship
if thats what you call that hunk of space crap weve got back at our office
put the weapons down
never gonna happen insect
edgar backs away with laurel further into the morgue toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft
jay and kay advance slowly cornering him
its okay laurel
how is it okay
i mean its going to be okay
dont bet on it meat sack
and with that he turns leaps and crashes right through the window into the air shaft
edgar still clutching laurel explodes up over a railing
nobody looks twice as edgar dragging laurel with his arm over her mouth races toward the nearby busy manhattan street
jay and kay duck into the air shaft and look up too far to climb and the walls are smooth anyway
they turn and run out of the morgue
edgar with laurel runs right in front of a cab which screeches to a halt inches from them
the cabbie sticks his head out and yells something in an unknown language
and keeps yelling as edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the cabbie out the door cigarette and wooden seat beads and all
the cab driver is still yelling as edgar leaps in pushing laurel in before him leaving her behind the wheel
he removes a postcard the one he took from the display on the newsstand
take me here
edgar just cranks the car into gear opening his mouth and swallowing the icon and in so doing revealing a triple row of serrated bug teeth he slams his foot
on the gas pedal
laurels head snaps back as the car rocks forward
she has no choice but to grab the wheel and start steering as the car screeches out into traffic swerving wildly as laurel is forced to make a degree turn
the car fishtails wildly swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic
the furious cab driver runs off after it still yelling as he disappears around the corner
a second later kay and jay rush out into the street
the cab is nowhere to be seen
jay runs into the street noticing the wooden beads the ripped pine scented green deodorizer and the still burning cigarette
theyre in a cab
and jay starts running down the street where dozens of cabs are waiting at the intersection
hes running from cab to cab pounding on windows scaring the living shit out of people hey
but laurel and edgar are nowhere to be found
up ahead the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away leaving jay on the street
he turns as a car screeches up behind him its headlights shining in his eyes
as it gets closer jay sees its kay in the ltd
stop wasting time
hes not getting off the planet in a cab
jay and kay rush in from the door under the worlds fair mural and head toward the main display screen all around them the mib staffers are in frenetic activity
in response to the threat from above
to tech at a desk come with me
put up a bio net all the way around manhattan if its not human its not leaving the island
whatve we got from our friends upstairs
same thing deliver the galaxy
yeah well the bugs got the galaxy but weve got his ship
hes got to be looking for a way out
just then a loud alarm wails
at the main viewing screen a green line shoots out from the arquillian ship striking a region of planet earth
headquarters where every bell whistle and light imaginable is going off
arquillian battle rules kid
first we get an ultimatum then a warning shot then we have a galactic standard week to respond
a galactic standard week
how the hell long is that
viewing the screen it now reads to keep the bugs from getting it the arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet its on
youre talking about us
sucks doesnt it
pull up the locations of all land based interstellar vehicles
theyre all gone
frank the pug took the last ship on the planet
as kay and zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data jay walks back towards the center of the room deep in thought
over him we hear atlantic city
that landfill on the jersey shore
gone thank god
kay and zed both look up at once scowling
do those still work
they follow his gaze up over the computer terminals
there on the wall in front of them where it has loomed for the entire movie is the enormous mural of the worlds fair grounds
most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground topped by the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact
as they stand there wide eyed staring at it we the real live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in flushing meadows
a taxi screeches to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away
edgar shoves laurel out through the drivers door and follows behind her still holding his weapon on her
youre coming with me
its a long trip
ill need a snack
and he shoves her ahead of him off in the direction of the space ships
behind him abandoned on the front seat of the cab we finally see the front of the postcard hes been carrying around
flushing meadows site of the worlds fair it says with a distinctive photograph of the spaceships
so thats how he knew
nighttime now and the city hums along just another thursday night
the clock in columbus circle says its
tvs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of cheers
the news ticker in times square announces the latest shattering news earthlings pass left and right blissfully unaware of their impending doom
kay and jay leap into kays ltd and slam the doors
kay jams the key in the ignition the car roars to life and he turns to jay
whaddya say we bag us some bug
he hits the gas and the car rockets away from the curb
the ltd tears through the city
kay turns sharply to the right smacking jay around
looking up ahead he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel
youre taking the tunnel
you know a better way to queens
its usually jammed
the ltd races through the tunnel at top speed
its clear driving for a few seconds but then they round a bend and theres a traffic jam up ahead
kay approaches the line of cars at top speed with no intention of slowing down
jay terrified holds on for dear life
i told you
push the button jay
a lighted panel rotates into place between the two front seats and that red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again
jay flips back the plastic cover and jams his finger down on the red flashing button
and you may want to throw on a seat belt
as the ltd rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead it begins to evolve its shape actually changing
the sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the normal panels out
it becomes a larger wirier machine held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons
kays car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side a sucking sound coming from underneath it
instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel the ltd actually clings to it
it swerves up onto the wall and hangs there racing by the traffic below
it keeps going turning all the way over and driving upside down wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel
jay falls from his seat with a clunk onto the upside down ceiling of the car
balled up on the back of his neck he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel zooming over the bottlenecked traffic underneath
as they race through the tunnel they have a minute to kill
mind if i smoke
in the car i mean
i dont care
hey just a common courtesy
it bothers some people if you smoke in a car
he lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely one hand on the wheel just waiting out the tunnel
jay gives up struggling to right himself and closes his eyes suffering through this
from outside the car we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel
we can hear kays voice as he goes on
yeah its harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days
hell i suppose i should quit
never took though
im beginning to think i lack self control
and they disappear out the other end of the tunnel and flip over banging back down onto the road on the other side
jay falls off the ceiling and slams into his seat
well back to work
he flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left
approaching a toll booth the ltd shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth shattering the gate
traveling at about two hundred miles an hour kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window and it chinks in the basket as their taillights disappear
edgar climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships pushing laurel up ahead of him headed for the saucer at the top
come on let me go you dont want to eat me
im a very important person on my planet
like a queen
a goddess even
there are those who worship me yes
im not trying to impress you with this im just letting you know
it could start a war
war means food for my family all seventy eight million of them
thats a lot of mouths to feed your highness
youre a wonderful dad
and with that she kicks him squarely in the face
he reels momentarily losing his grip on her
she takes advantage of the moment and flings herself out into the air
edgar flails but she is beyond his reach
she falls tumbling through the air and lands in the branches of a tree
she hits hard the branches rattling and reaches out and hangs on for dear life high above the ground
above edgar just keeps climbing
over at the fence the ltd comes to a looooong skidding stop at the fairgrounds
at the trunk jay and kay flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous
kay grabs a black box unsnaps a row of latches and opens it revealing the most wicked looking shotgun on the planet
three feet long triple barreled over and under and under plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells
the shells themselves are solid glistening like polished steel
kay loads up the clip
you know how to work that
kay pumps it once with extreme confidence
no idea whatsoever
he slams the trunk revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance
lets bag us some bug
as if on cue one of the saucers begins to hum
then it starts to spin faster and faster
the ship begins to rise
laurel sits in her tree watching with amazement
at shea stadium a mets game is in progress
behind the home plate side the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky plainly visible
but at that very moment the batter cracks into a fastball hard
the crowd rises to its feet shouting staring out at center field where the ball is headed
all eyes in the house are on the mets center fielder except for his eyes which are on the flying saucer behind home plate
his eyes widen his jaw drops and the catchable ball sails over his head thudding into the wall behind him
the crowd boos viciously
kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk looks over at jay
set it to pulsar level five sub sonic implosion factor what
press the little green button on three
jay raises his weapon they press their green buttons
they pull their triggers
for a moment nothing happens as if it were a misfire
but then there is a vacuum whump like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime and a tremendous shock wave
rolls out from the barrel of the guns
jay and kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force thudding to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator
the shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship then it hits the ship and it too is sucked back down
hurtling back toward them
she flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead
the saucer crashes through the unisphere an enormous steel globe and thuds to the earth crashing through brush dirt and rock
jay and kay come to their feet
in front of them the dust clears
trees uprooted stones and dirt thrown everywhere
a dumpster has been cast to their left
and the saucer is there embedded in the earth tipped off kilter in a mound of debris
a hatch comes up
revealing edgar walking slowly toward them with contained fury
you dont get it
you are under arrest for violating number of the tycho accord
please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying
you milk suckers
you dont matter
in a few seconds you wont even be matter
move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head
he pumps the gun for emphasis
put my hands on my head
edgar stares at him
then flexes his arms still encased in flesh
his giant pincers rip free of the rotting skin
he extends both pincers to the sides and my god his reach must be twelve feet across
now the skin and clothes on edgars legs begins to crack and shred
they burst apart revealing two hideous doubled over insect legs
the bug raises himself aloft on his legs
he sucks in a deep breath of air and now the rest of the edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs
the torso explodes in great rendering of cloth and skin and finally edgars head simply bursts apart spattering against the walls
edgar now reveals himself as he really is a hairy bug like exoskeleton a scaly tail with a long stinger a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a
small nose and two horse like feet with three toes each
he raises his pincers in the air resting them on his head
the galaxy hangs on a chain around his neck
kay and jay pump their guns and aim at the bug
suddenly the bug spits
and a huge slimy wad of goo shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns
the bug snorts it back tearing them from jay and kays grasp then swallowing them
jay and kay have only a second to react before the bug swipes at them with the back of his clawed hand like someone brushing aside a gnat and sends
them flying fifteen feet in the air
she flinches as she sees them hit the ground
she starts to climb the tree
jay and kay hit the ground with loud grunts
that did not go at all like i had planned
they look up to see the bug moving for the second tower and the second flying saucer
kay gets to his feet
this guys really starting to bug me
kay starts walking after the bug
whatever happens jay dont let him get on that ship
where are you going
getting my gun back
kay steps forward and yells at the departing bug
the bug just keeps moving toward the ladder
im talking to you bug
you know how many of your kind ive swatted with a newspaper
the bug turns toward kay
kay steps up to him the small human facing off against the giant alien hug
she quietly makes it to the ground hurries off to the darkness of the woods
kay has himself in the bugs face its dripping fangs inches from kays face
youre just a smear on the sports page to me you slimy gut sucking intestinal parasite
the bug reacts cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening hiss lunges forward and sucks kay into his mouth
the bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back
kay slides down the bugs throat bending it sideways as he kicks and screams his way down into its abdomen
jay looks on in stunned horror
as the bug turns to jay and stretches to its full height and lets loose a laurel is still watching
jay watches as the bug continues its howl of triumph
he feels totally defeated
he can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the bugs stomach
close on bugs stomach
through the leathery pouch of the bugs stomach we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers
and just a few inches from it a human hand is reaching toward the gun
kay swimming in the bugs intestinal fluid tries to make his way to the gun holding his breath
jay knows what he has to do
he picks up a good sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the bug
come over here and try that
the concrete thunks off the bugs shell he doesnt seem to notice just keeps moving
jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the bug
stop right there or ill start wailing on your waxy pointed ass
jay starts pounding on the bug with the metal pole
kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun the pounding on the outside distracts him and he turns the gun shifts away
the bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of jays hands
he swings at jay jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass
the bug slices down with razor sharp claws at jay jay rolls out of the way just as the mean looking claws dig into the grass
jay rolls right underneath the bugs legs
his hand falls on something in the grass another piece of debris a sharp metal spike gleaming like a dagger
he grabs the metal spike and looks up at the bugs apparently vulnerable underbelly right above him
he grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up into the bugs gut when the bug bends its head down between its legs
bugs pov of jay there upside down from this perspective lurking between the bugs legs
the bug opens its jaws and snaps at jay who propels himself backward out of harms way
the bug starts climbing the tower
jay howls in frustration
what are you afraid of me
stand and fight like an arthropod
in frustration jay screams and throws himself on the bug hanging onto its back trying to drag it down
you want a piece of this huh
maybe youre a badass in your hive but this is new york city
youre just another tourist here
the bug flicks him off with his tail sending him sailing twenty feet through the air
jay crashes into the dumpster landing on a heap in front of the garbage
but scratched and beat up jay still doesnt quit he stands to yell at the bug extending his arm at the creature
youre messing with the wrong species bug he notices something on his arm
a cockroach running down his sleeve
he flicks it off
looks down at the ground
sees another roach
looks over to the dumpster behind him
there are more of them
a whole mob in fact
fifty or sixty of the critters climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster
jay has one last desperate idea
he kicks at the dumpster part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces
tens of thousands of roaches pouring forth from the dumpster crawling like a black glittering river away from the garbage
jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects
close on jays foot as he steps on the roach
on the bug as he flinches on the ladder he hates that sound
if im not mistaken that was a cousin of yours
he knows hes getting to him
he steps toward the bug moving his foot over another roach
he crushes another one
that had to hurt
and what dyou know heres your old uncle bob
he steps forward again crunch
on the bug
he turns around anger burning in his eyes
kays hand reaches closer and closer to the gun
jay keeps moving toward the bug finding new roaches to tread on holds his foot over another one
can you hear what hes saying
on the bug as he starts climbing down the tower and moving toward jay
they are moving toward each other in a show down jay moves on poising his foot over another roach
theres a pretty one
that one looks kinda familiar dont you think
i know who that is
the bug is right over jay now jaws dripping ready to gobble him up
dont do that
jay stares right back at the bug
inside he sees kays hand closing around the trigger of the shotgun
he brings it around pointing up straight at the bugs head
thats your momma
he moves to crunch the roach the bug moves to chomp jay jay stares up at him unflinching
didnt she ever teach you not to bite off more than you can chew
and at that very moment
kay blasts a hole right in the middle of the bugs midsection
the front of the bugs thorax explodes in a shower of bug juice all over jay
the bug flies into two pieces the butt end sailing one way the head flying behind jay
kay falls out of the bug in a mess of goo gasping for breath dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers
the other gun sails off into the darkness
the icon drops to the ground rolls over to jays feet and clatters to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor
he calmly bends down and picks it up
jay is pissed and starts in on kay
you son of a kay holds up a finger in a wait a minute gesture pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number
get a message to the arquillians
we have the galaxy
zed is standing at the console a smile on his face
he glances over at the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth
the red lights are coming back on
i think the words already out
our friends are coming back
then got an authorized landing at times square
you and jay check it out on the way back
and pick me up one of those soft pretzels while youre at it
i feel like celebrating
kay flips the phone closed
you were saying
that was your plan
as they argue behind them unseen the front half of the bug raises itself up on its forearms eyes gleaming with hate jaws dripping ready to lower itself onto kay
after i got the shit beat out of me
and i almost got digested
it goes with the job
you coulda told me what you were doing
there wasnt time sport
the bug attacks swinging its head down on them
they turn to see it and just before the jaws snap down on their heads
the bugs head explodes into a million bits
bug juice showers down everywhere bucketsful of goo drenching kay and jay even further
they turn to see
laurel standing behind the dead bug the other atomizer in her hands the barrel smoking the weapon and laurel dripping the bug innards
interesting job you guys got
on the sky
bits of bug juice still flying through the air
the driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield
the driver grimaces at the mess
he reaches down and hits a button
wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere
kays ltd is parked outside men in black headquarters
laurel leans her back against the car
we see jay and kay walking away in the distance
look i know we got rules but she did just bust the bug for us
and so maybe you dont have to flashy thing her
kay pulls out the neuralyzer
whos she gonna tell anyway
she only hangs out with dead people
looking up at the sky theyre beautiful arent they
i never just look anymore and theyre beautiful
kay youre scaring your partner
i havent been training a partner ive been training a replacement
oh no i cant do this job by myself
walking towards them hey guys were nowhere near my apartment
were not even on the right island
maybe you wont have to
kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer
always face it forwards
he hands the neuralyzer to jay
taps his pocket
indicates for him to put his glasses on
ive just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach
thats one of a hundred memories i dont want
jay takes the neuralyzer
slips on his glasses
see you around sport
jay raises the neuralyzer
with a brilliant flash the screen turns white
no you wont
close on various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them
heres one mets centerfielder says and heres another one secret tests in n
s tunnel and a third returns to girl he left behind a large photograph shows a smiling kay arm in arm with elizabeth reston his long lost fiancee in her
back yard in tempe arizona
she holds a large bouquet of flowers the same kind he brought but never gave her thirty years ago
jay whos reading the paper smiles
at the curb jay hurries back to the ltd with the newspapers
elle formerly laurel is waiting leaning against the hood
tailored black suit
short cropped hair
the look never looked better
the high consulate of regent emissary wants floor seats to the knicks bulls game
ill talk to dennis rodman its his damn planet
both car doors slam jay drops it in gear and the ltd blasts away from the curb
the ltd is just one of many cars in a jam packed manhattan city block
manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl
the east coast of the united states is just part of a much larger land mass
north america is just a small portion of the planet earth
earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system
our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field
the milky way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals
there seems to be an edge to what we see a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters until everything that exists seems to be
contained in one tiny ball which is actually a marble resting on a strange looking patch of red dirt
an alien hand reaches down and flicks the marble sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt where it clicks into a dozen other big blue balls just like it
