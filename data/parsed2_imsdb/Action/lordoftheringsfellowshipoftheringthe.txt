for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race
but they were all of them deceived

the ring came to the creature gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains

the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life
for five hundred years it poisoned his mind
and in the gloom of gollums cave
fade up bathed in cold moonlight the world lies dark and still
the unsettled quiet before the storm
darkness crept back into the forests of the world
rumor grew of a shadow in the east
whispers of a nameless fear
and the ring of power perceived

it abandoned gollum
slow motion unseen by its keeper
the ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel
but something happened then the ring did not intend

it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable
to himself whats this
a youngish looking bilbo baggins peers down at what lies in his hand
perplexed by what he has found
bilbo baggins of the shire
surprised a ring
a voice screams
its anguish ringing through the lost
my precious is lost
frightened bilbo quickly pockets the one ring and hurries on
for the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all
resting on a small rock
rising out of the long overgrown shire
years later camera tracks to a figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree
white flowers are scattered among the well seeded grasses
an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer
the figure is reading a book
on the soundtrack in the distance growing louder
over the gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the humming of a deep voice to the tune of the road goes ever on and
the figure in the grass sits up
looking straight at camera is a handsome young hobbit with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes
this is frodo baggins
his eyes alight with excitement
tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth frodo runs off
the cart rattles along a leafy lane driven by a stooped figure in grey
the shambling old pony snorts and rears as
suddenly frodo appears on a bank above the cart
close on gandalf glowers at the young hobbit
a wizard is never late frodo baggins nor is he early
he arrives precisely when he means to
they look at each other a moment
then both start laughing as frodos face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart
its wonderful to see you gandalf
next to gandalf we see how small hobbits are
frodo is foot inches tall
you didnt think id miss your uncle bilbos birthday
wide on the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by what news of the outside world
tell me everything
gandalf looks down at frodo a twinkle in his eye
far too eager and curious for a hobbit
wide on the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace
well what can i tell you
life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age
full of its own comings and goings scarcely even aware of the existence of hobbits
close on gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him
for which i am very thankful
hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon inn
wide on the party field
where scorcs of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night
ah the long expected party
so how is the old rascal
i hear its going to be a party of special magnificence
you know bilbo
hes got he whole place in an uproar
that should please him
half the shires been invited
good gracious me
hes up to something
frodo shoots a knowing look as gandalf averts his eyes
keep your secrets
before you came along we bagginses were very well thought of
never had any adventures or did anything unexpected
if youre referring to the incident with the dragon
i was barely involved
all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out the door
whatever you did
youve been officially labelled as a disturber of the peace
odo proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by deeply suspicious
as the cart rattles into the small village of hobbiton
a quaint rustic settlement nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees
the hobbits live in hobbit holes neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside with round doors and cute front gardens
excited children chasing after the cart
gandalf ignorcs the childrens cries
the children stand deflated watching gandalf disappear up the lane
at that moment spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart fizzing over the heads of the delighted children
gandalf smiling to himself well pleased with his joke
odo proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle
frodo stands up in the cart as gandalf reigns in the horse
im glad youre back
frodo leaps expertly from the cart
so am i dear boy
so am i wide on gandalfs cart pulls up outside the gate to bag end
a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside
there is a sign on the gate which reads no admittance except on party business
gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag end
he raises his staff and raps on the front door
a voice calls out no thank you
we dont want any more visitors well wishers or distant relations
and what about very old friends
suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him
he is a hobbit of indertiminate age with a mischievous twinkle in his eye
wearing a dashing brocade waist coat he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman
my dear gandalf
gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend
its good to see you
one hundred and eleven years old who would believe it
gandalf looks at him more keenly
you havent aged a day
gandalf and bilbo laugh together and enter bag end
come on come in
bilbo leads gandalf into bag end
cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of bilbos travels
gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling
bilbo hangs up gandalfs hat on a peg and trots off down the hall
or maybe something stronger
ive a few bottles of the old winyard left
a very good year almost as old as i am
it was laid down by my father
what say we open one eh
bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks around
enjoying the familiarity of bag end
he turns knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam
i was expecting you some time last week
not that it matters you come and go as you please always have done always will
youve caught me a bit unprepared im afraid
weve only got cold chicken bit of pickle some cheese here
ooh no that might be a little risky
gandalf stops in front of a framed map charred in one corner
it is thorins map of the lonely mountain gandalf smiles to himself
er weve got raspberry jam and apple tart
got some custard somewhere
not much for afters im afraid
ive just found some sponge cake
nice little snack
hope its enough
comes into view i could do you some eggs if you like
bilbo jumps a half eaten pork pie in his hand as gandalf mysteriously appears behind him
just tea thank you
you dont mind if
no not at all
a sudden loud knock on the front door
bilbo baggins you open this door
i know youre in there
im not home
gandalf watches amused as bilbo tries to hide
ive got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day never giving me a moments peace
i want to see mountains again
and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book
so you mean to go through with your plan then
its all inhand
all the arrangements are made
frodo suspects something
course he does hes a baggins
not some block headed bracegirdle from hardbottle
you will tell him wont you
hes very fond of you
hed probably come with me if i asked him
i think in his heart frodos still in love with the shire the woods and the fields
bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window
i am old gandalf
bilbo looks at gandalf sadly
i know i dont look it but im beginning to feel it in my heart
bilbos fingers close around his waistcoat pocket
gripping a small unseen object
i feel thin
sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread
i need a holiday
a very long holiday and i dont expect i shall return
in fact i mean not to
gandalf and bilbo are sitting on the bag end porch
below them final preparations are being made on the party field
bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe
old toby the finest weed in southfarthing
bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air
a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of bilbos smoke ring
ohhhh smiles gandalf my old friend
this will be a night to remember
a firework explodes into the night sky high above hobbiton
in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches
tilt down with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches
evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party goers hobbits feasting and drinking carts of beer and wine are scattered about and the tables are piled high
with steaming scones and savories
gandalf hurries about lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff
bilbo is greeting visitors
frodo and sam sit at a table drinking ale
frodo notices sams eyes keep flicking to another pretty hobbit rosie cotton sitting some distance away
go on sam ask rosie for a dance
horrified i think ill just have myself another ale
oh no you dont
sam goes to drain his glass
suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers
as he is swept away
frodo laughs and finishes sams beer
gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests
close on bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children
melodramatic so there i was
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls
have you ever heard of a troll
do you know what a troll is
great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things
and theyre arguing
arguing about how they were going to cook us
her eyes growing larger and larger
whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly
but they spent so long arguing the whether tos and why fors that the suns first light crept over the top of the trees
and turned them all to stone
stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat
close on merry and pippin two mischievous young hobbits in their late teens
pippin scrambles on to the back of gandalfs wagon snatching up a small firework urgent whisper no no
the big one
the big one
pippin grabs a huge rocket
close on firework fuse crackles with flame
merry is holding out the big rocket
he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that pippin has just lit
worried whisper youre supposed to stick it in the ground
it is in the ground
merry fearfully tosses the rocket to pippin
the fuse sizzles angrily
it was your idea
pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to merry
the two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power
the rocket zooms over the party
it suddenly bursts apart forming the shape of a great red golden dragon
fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and flies low towards the startled crowd
close on frodo watches the fireworks dragon with alarm
but bilbo is oblivious to the panicking crowd and impending danger
watch out for the dragon
hasn t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years
as he hurriedly pulls bilbo to the ground just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train
hobbits dive to the ground tables overturn tents collapse food flies everywhere
the fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang
this gets the biggest cheer of the night
clothes and hair smoking
that was good
lets get another one
large hands suddenly clamp down on merry and pippins ears
low angle gandalf looking down sternly
meridoc brandybuck and peregrin took
i might have known
are leaning over a barrel washing dishes in soapy water
with gandalf sitting nearby smoking his pipe and sipping an ale
cries of speech
speech erupt from the party
bilbo stepping on a stool
he bows in gratitude at the applause
clearing throat my dear bagginses and boffins tooks and brandybucks
grubbs chubbs hornblowers bolgers bracegirdles and proudfoots
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday
yes and alas
eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits
tremendous outburst of approval
i dont know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less than half of you as well as well as you deserve
scattered clapping as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not
close on frodo and gandalf smiling to themselves
close on bilbo
a strange hum seems to fill his head
a bead of sweat rolls down his brow
bilbos hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back
things to do and i have put this off for far too long
close on bilbos knuckles turn white as he tightens his grip on the small object behind his back
i regret to announce this is the end
i am going now
i bid you all a very fond farewell
bilbo looks across at frodo hesitates
bilbo instantly vanishes
the party explodes into an uproar
the crowd leaps to its feet
staring at the empty stool in disbelief
the party is still in an excited uproar
some yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of bag end
door opens pulled by an invisible hand
the door quietly closes
bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger
bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air then places it in his pocket
bilbo emerges from the passage carrying a walking stick
he finds gandalf looming over him
i suppose you think that was terribly clever
come on gandalf
did you see their faces
there are many magic rings in the world bilbo baggins and none of them should be used lightly
it was just a bit of fun
oh youre probably right as usual
you will keep an eye on frodo wont you
im leaving everything to him
what about this ring of yours
is that staying too
close on bilbo
he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece
yes yes its in an envelope
over there on the mantelpiece
gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece
bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise
its here in my pocket
isnt that odd now
yet after all why not
why shouldnt i keep it
i think you should leave the ring behind bilbo
is that so hard
now it comes to it i dont feel like parting with it
i found it
it came to me
theres no need to get angry
well if im angry its your fault
my own my precious
its been called that before but not by you
what business is it of yours what i do with my own things
bilbos voice shape and manner have suddenly changed
i think youve had that ring quite long enough
you want it for yourself
gandalf rises to his full height his eyes flash his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room bilbo baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks
bilbo cowers from gandalf disarmed by his power
a frightened hobbit
gandalfs expression softens
i am not trying to rob you
i am trying to help you
sobbing bilbo runs to gandalf and hugs him
all you long years weve been friends
trust me as you once did
let it go
youre right gandalf
the ring must go to frodo
bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door
its late the road is long
yes it is time
the ring is still in your pocket
reaches into his pocket
close on bilbo pulls out the ring
he stares at it in his palm
with all his will power bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor
close on the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor
bilbo staggering out of bag end
he braces himself in the night air pale and trembling as if his loss of the ring has weakened him
gandalf steps up behind
ive thought up and ending for my book
and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days
im sure you will my dear friend
bilbo walks away from bag end disappearing into the night softly singing the road goes on and on
softly until our next meeting
close on the ring
glinting on the floor
gandalf circles around it a puzzled look on his face
gandalf slowly reaches for the ring
his fingers barely touch the ring
the creepy hum rises on the soundtrack
gandalf is sitting in front of the fire with his pipe
staring into the flickering flames
its mine my own my precious
to himself riddles in the dark
frodo rushes into bag end
he stops and picks up the ring at his feet
gandalf continues staring into the fire as if locked in thought
to himself my precious
quietly hes gone hasnt he
frodo steps into the living room
he talked for so long about leaving
i didnt think hed really do it
mutters to himself my own
his eyes locking onto the ring in frodos fingers
gandalf sorts hurriedly through bilbos papers
hes gone to stay with the elves
hes left you bag end
gandalf holds out the envelope
frodo drops the ring into it
along with all his possessions
gandolf seals the envelope with wax
he hands it to frodo
the ring is yours now
but it somewhere out of sight
gandalf rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things
where are you going
i have some things i must see to
questions that need answering
youve only just arrived
i dont understand
gandalf is already at the door he turns to frodo
neither do i
keep it secret keep it safe
gandalf hurries out the door
leaving frodo standing alone in the bag end
the camera pushes in
the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack
the camera pushes through the white paper to the ring
beneath the hum the whispered murmur of black speech can be heard
the jagged ruins of barad dur
the dark tower
teasing images the huge dark tower of barad dur is being rebuilt
thousands of orcs crawl over the surface hauling stone and iron up the towering heights
grows and spreads across the red streaked sky
casting a shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape
nine black riders burst out of minas morgul and charge toward camera
wide on a lone horseman gallops to the crest of a hill on the west road
the main highway south to minas tirith
he looks toward the saw toothed mountains of mordor
seeping out across the blood red sky his face grave
he spurs his horse on
making is way down into the lower depths of the citidel
close on pages flipping as gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table
his eyes settle on one old parchment
he murmurs hurriedly to himself reading
reading the year of the second age
here follows the account of isildur high king of gondor and the finding of the ring of power
reading it has come to me
the ring of power
it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom
all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for i will risk no hurt to the ring
it is precious to me though i buy it with great pain
reading the marking upon the band begin to fade
the writing which at first was as clear as red flame has all but disappeared
a secret now that only fire can tell
farmer maggot is chopping wood in his garden close on snorting horse nostrils
as the shadow of a black rider looms over a hobbit house
terrified farmer maggot cowers in his doorway
fang his dog whimpers and backs away
terrified theres no bagginses around here
they are all up in hobbiton
the black rider gallops away at speed bids the last of the patrons goodnight
sam meets her eyes for a moment as he and frodo leave the inn
wide on frodo farewells sam outside bag end and heads towards the front door
creepy pov from inside bag end frodo coming up the path
frodo enters bag end
he immediately pauses sensing that something is amiss
all is quiet
frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room
a large figure looms out of the shadows reaching for frodo
frodo lets out a startled cry pulls himself free and spins around to face his assailant
gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight
paranoia blazes in his eyes
his clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling
hair and beard much longer an unkempt
urgent whisper is it secret
is it safe
frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest
gandalf suspicious alert
without a word gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace
bewildered what are you doing
flames instantly consume the envelope
revealing the ring as it sinks into the red hot embers
gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs
he lifts the ring out
hold out your hand frodo
it is quite cool
gandalf drops the ring into frodos hand
he reacts to its weight
what can you see
can you see anything
close on the gold band of the ring as fiery letters begin to appear
a tiny inscription glows red
as if burning from within
these are markings
its some form of elvish
i cant read it
ominous there are few who can
the language is that of mordor which i will not utter here
in the common tongue it says one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
close on the ring lies on frodos simple kitchen table
this is the one ring forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mt doom
taken by isildur from the hand of sauron himself
quiet realization bilbo found it
in golloms cave
for sixty years the ring lay quiet in bilbos keeping prolonging his life delaying old age
but no longer frodo
evil is stirring in mordor
the ring has awoken
it has heard its masters call
of black speech emanates from the ring
frodo looks at gandalf each knowing the other has heard it
but he was destroyed
sauron was destroyed
lies between them on the table
the spirit of sauron has endured
his life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived
sauron has returned
his orcs have multiplied
his fortress of barad dur is rebuilt in the land of mordor
sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness
he is seeking it seeking it all his thought is bent on it
for the ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master they are one the ring and the dark lord
frodo he must never find out
suddenly frodo scoops up the ring
hurriedly entering the living room
thinking fast we put it away we keep it hidden
we never speak of it again
no one know its here do they
gandalf shifts uncomfortably
do they gandalf
gandalf looks at frodo sadly
there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum but the enemy found him first
close on a teasing glimpse of gollum being tortured by the orcs
the wretched creature screams in pain
i dont know how long they tortured him
but amidst the endless screams and inane babble they discerned two words
that will lead them here
image on a dark country lane a hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm
who goes there
out of the darkness thunder two black riders
a lethal sword swings down at the small hobbit bounder
frodo thrusts the ring at gandalf
you must take it
you cannot offer me this ring
im giving it to you
dont tempt me frodo
i dare not take it not even to keep it safe
i would use this ring from a desire to do good
but through me it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine
but it cannot stay in the shire
no no it cant
what must i do
throwing clothes into a knapsack
gandalf watches him making plans
you must leave and leave quickly
get out of the shire
where shall i go
make for the village of bree
what about you
i will be waiting for you at the inn of the prancing pony
frodo packs his food into his knapsack
and the ring will be safe there
i dont know frodo
i dont have any answers
i must see the head of my order
he is both wise and powerful
trust me frodo
hell know what to go
frodo is preparing to leave
youll have to leave the name of baggins behind you
for that name is not safe outside the shire
gandalf helps frodo into his coat
travel only by day and stay off the road
thinking i can cut across country easily enough
gandalf looks at the young hobbit moved by his courage
my dear frodo hobbits really are amazing creatures
you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you
a sound from outside
he moves quietly towards the window eyes wide with tension
he raises his staff above the window and slams it down on the intruder
there is a yelp of pain
gandalf hauls a small figure into the room
sam gamgee sprawls across the floor
he looks up in terror as gandalf looms over him
angry confound it all
samwise gamgee have you been eavesdropping
i aint been dropping no eaves sir
i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me
its a little late for trimming the hedges dont you think
i heard raised voices
what did you hear
panicked nothing important
that is i heard a good deal about a ring
and a dark lord
and something about the end of the world but
gandalf sir dont hurt me
dont turn me into anything unnatural
ive thought of a better use for you
wide on hobbiton
shrouded in a white veil of mist
wider to reveal gandalf frodo and sam hurrying across a ploughed field away from hobbiton
gandalf leads his horse
frodo and sam are carrying knapsacks
come along samwise
gandalf leads frodo and sam under the cover of woods
be careful both of you
the enemy has many spies in his service many ways of hearing
gandalf takes frodo to one side
low voice is it safe
he pats his pocket
never put it on for then the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power
always remember frodo the ring is trying to get back to its master
it wants to be found
gandalf wheels his horse and gallops away
montage frodo and sam hiking over the gentle shire countryside
wading through a shallow stream
heating a kettle over a small fire
clambering over stone walls
sam stops short
taking stock of his surroundings
sam looks back from where they came
this is it
this is what
if i take one more step itll be the farthest away from home ive ever been
frodo gives sam a pat on the shoulder
come on sam
sam takes a deep breath and steps forward
close on sams brown furry foot hits the ground
remember what bilbo used to say
its a dangerous business
frodo and sam continue their journey
its a dangerous business frodo going out your door
you step onto the road and if you dont keep your feet theres not knowing where you might be swept off to
gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of fangorn
nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant misty mountains the tall black tower of orthanc is clearly visible gandalf gallops through the gate into the fortress of
a great ring wall of stone a mile from rim to rim encloses beautiful trees and gardens watered by streams that flow down from the mountains
smoke rises once more from the mountain of doom
the shadow takes shape in the darkness of mordor the hour grows late
and gandalf the grey rides to isengard seeking my counsel
the strange tower of orthanc
hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian
rises up in the center of the isengard circle
gandalf arrives at the foot of the orthanc stairs
he sweeps down the orthanc stairs
for that is why you have come is it not my old friend
gandalf moves quickly towards him grimy and weary from his long ride
gandalf and saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of isengard sarumans clean white robe contrasts with gandalfs dusty grey robes
are you sure of this
beyond any doubt
so the ring of power has been found
all these long years it was in the shire under my very nose
and yet you did not have the wit to see it
your love of the halflings leaf has clearly slowed your mind
we still have time
time enough to counter sauron
if we act quickly
what time do you think we have
saruman and gandalf are seated in a small cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber
sauron has regained much of his former strength
he cannot yet take physical form
but his spirit has lost none of its potency
concealed within his fortress the lord of mordor sees all
his gaze pierces cloud shadow earth and flesh
you know of what i speak gandalf
a great eye lidless wreathed in flame
softly the eye of sauron
he is gathering all evil to him
very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon middle earth
you know this
i have seen it
gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth
a palantir is a dangerous tool saruman
saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir
why should we fear to use it
they are not all accounted for the lost seeing stones
we do not know who else may be watching
gandalf throws the cloth back over the palantir
saruman sits upon his throne
the hour is later than you think
saurons forces are already moving
the nine have left minas morgul
shocked the nine
they crossed the river isen in midsummers eve disguised as riders in black
alarmed they have reached the shire
they will find the ring
and kill the one who carries it
gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door
horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut
you did not seriously think a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron
there are none who can
gandalf slowly turns to saruman
a look of dawning horror
against the power of mordor there can be no victory
we must join with him gandalf
we must join with sauron
it would be wise my friend
deadly tell me friend when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness
at that moment gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room
he slams against the wall
pinned there by some unseen force
with sudden effort gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on saruman
blasting him off his feet
gandalf and saruman battle powerful blasts throwing them across the room
saruman screams eyes blazing
gandalfs staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp
it flies across the chamber into sarumans hand
gandalf is flung to the floor
i gave you the chance of aiding me willingly but you have elected the way of pain
gandalf is breathing hard on the floor his eyes look into the madness of saruman
commanding two staffs saruman sends gandalf into a sickening spin
gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber
as if falling in reverse
rushing pov the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera
wide on frodo and sam walking along a country lane which borders farmer maggots fields
sam is looking up
frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane
frodo turns surprised as sam comes running towards him
worried i thought i lost you
frodo looks at sam suspiciously
sam glances down embarrassed
teasing what are you talking about
mumbling its just something gandalf said
what did he say
dont you leave him samwise gamgee
looks at frodo intently and i dont mean to
were still in the shire
what could possibly happen
a figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending frodo flying
frodo picks himself up only to be knocked back down again by pippin
merry its frodo baggins
hello frodo merry pippin and frodo picking themselves up
a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere
whats the meaning of this
sam hold this
merry gives sam a large cabbage
accusing youve been into farmer maggots crop
a large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow
angry shouts from farmer maggot
whos that in my field
get out of it
get out of my field you young varmits
ill show you
get out of my corn
merry and pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away
with frodo and sam on their heels
looking behind him i dont know why hes so upset its only a couple of carrots
and some cabbages
and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week
and then the mushrooms the week before
yes pippin my point is hes clearly over reacting
the baying of large dogs sounds
frodo sam and merry and pippin tumble head over heels down a bank onto a dark wooded road
close on a winded pippin his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings
that was close
frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly
i think ive broken something
pulls a large carrot almost broken through in the middle out from his back pocket
turning on merry and pippin trust a brandybuck and a took
that was just a detour
a shortcut to what
pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road
close on small brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth
sam merry and pippin race toward the mushrooms
frodo is tense and watchful
he realizes they are on a wooded road
scattered leaves rise into the air whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind
i think we should get off the road
a long drawn wail comes down the wind like the cry of some evil and lonely creature
more urgency get off the road
sam grabs merry and pippin as the hobbits quickly scramble down the bank hiding under a mossy log
the sound of hooves is close
a sinister mounted ringwrath steps into view
hooded and faceless mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes
frodo freezes in terror
the ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place
he sits very still with his head bowed listening
from inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent his head turning from side to side
beads of sweat gather on his brow
the ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse leaning over the mossy log peering suspiciously into the woods
he is drawing the ring out of his pocket with trembling hands
his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle
the sound of sniffing intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party
merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road
the ringwraith spins around at the sound and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed
frodo instantly slumps
as if a psychic link had been broken
what was that
frodo is staring a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand
frodo sam merry and pippin hurry through the trees
slipping and sliding on the muddy ground
what is going on
merry moves past pippin toward frodo watching intently
sam keeps looking around nervously
the black rider was looking for something
the silhouette of a black rider looms against the skyline
the four hobbits
sprawled on the ground holding their breath
the black rider turns and departs
i have to leave the shire
sam and i must get to bree
merry looks at his friend
realizing frodo is in deep trouble
the hobbits break cover
suddenly a ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them
theres another one
frodo this way
the hobbits run the ringwraith shrieks
black horse hooves
snarling horse mouths
a fleeting black cowl
frodo follow me
frodo sam merry and pippin are running towards the wide placid brandywine river
and the ferry
get the ropes sam
four ringwraiths are speeding through the fog
converging on the ferry crossing
the hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry
frodo races across the wooden wharf followed by the ringwraiths
he leaps into the ferry
sam and merry shove off with the poles
the ferry slides out into the river just as the ringwraiths arrive
they pull up on the end of the wharf
shrieking with rage
the hobbits cover their ears
the ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and gallop away along the river bank quickly disappearing into the fog
how far to the nearest crossing
the brandwine bridge
lights of bree
a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill
a thick hedge surrounds the village
a great gate bars the western entrance
frodo sam merry and pippin approaching the gatehouse
wild eyes ragged and out of breath
a surly gatekeeper glances down at them
what do you want
were headed for the prancing pony
the gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight
four hobbits and whats more out of the shire by your talk
what business brings you to bree
we wish to stay at the inn
our business is our own
to frodos relief the gatekeeper unlocks the gate
all right young sir i meant no offense
the hobbits gratefully enter bree
the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light
its my job to ask questions after nightfall
theres talk of strange fold abroad
cant be too careful
the tall bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as frodo sam merry and pippin make their way through the narrow streets
tall buildings tower above them
lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains
close on the sign of the prancing pony inn
frodo sam merry and pippin hurry toward it
frodo sam merry and pippin come rushing in
frodo attracts the inn keeperss attention
good evening little masters
if youre seeking accommodation weve got some nice cozy hobbit sized rooms available mr
my names underbill
were friends of gandalf the grey
can you tell him weve arrived
recognition oh yes
big grey beard
frodo nods with relief
butterbur shakes his head
not seen him for six months
frodo is shocked
worried whisper what do we do now
wide on the noise smokey inn
it is dimly lit cheifly from a blazing log fire
and crowded with a mixture of big folk local hobbits and a couple of dwarfs
frodo sam merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall
clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous
sam cant help himself
he keeps casting nervous glances around
sam hell be here
merry ploinks himself down at a table carrying a very large mug of beer
this my friend is a pint
it comes in pints
im getting one
sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar
youve had a whole half already
merry watches pippin go
a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at frodo then quickly look away
tense that fellows done nothing but stare at you since weve arrived
sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
frodo gestures to butterbur
excuse me that man in the corner who is he
hes one of them rangers theyre dangerous folk they are wandering the wilds
what his right name is i never heard but round here hes known as strider
to himself strider
beneath table frodos fingers are nervously toying with the
sweat runs down his brow
the strange hum of the ring spills into the soundtrack
a creepy whisper seems to fill frodos head
sound that dissolves into pippins loud voice baggins
sure i know a baggins
hes over there
sitting at the bar chatting with locals
frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar
loudly frodo baggins
hes my second cousin once removed on his mothers side and my third cousin twice removed on his fathers side
if you follow me
frodo grabs pippins sleeve spilling his beer
steady on frodo
pippin pushes frodo away
he stumbles backwards and falls to the floor
at that instant the inn goes silent and all the attention turns to frodo
in agonizing slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second
then crashes down onto his out stretched finger
there is a sharp intake of breath
followed by total silence
the ringwraiths turn sharply in their saddles
instantly aware that the ring is being worn
they spur their horses towards the distant lights of bree
sam looks sick pippin instantly sobers realizing his folly the brooding stranger frowns
and the inn erupts into excited babble
frodo as he finds himself in the twilight world of the ring the excited crowd are suddenly moving in slow motion
a weird photographic negative quality
frodo is moving in real time against the slow motion background
he suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images
of a great eye
an evil cat like eye wreathed in flames
there is no life here in the void
frodo is terrified
he rolls under a table desperately pulling the ring from his finger
frodo materializes into the real world
at that moment a large hand reaches under the table and grabs frodo by the collar and drags him away
frodo is roughly pushed against the wall
the brooding stranger looms over him
you draw far too much attention to yourself
underhill frodo is pushed into the hobbits room by strider
what do you want
a little more caution from you
that is no trinket you carry
i carry nothing
i can usually avoid being seen if i wish but to disappear entirely
that is a rare gift
who are you
are you frightened
not nearly frightened enough
i know what hunts you
frodo jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor
strider deftly draws his sword
the door bursts open and sam merry and pippin appear on the doorway
sam is squaring off with is fists merry brandishes a candlestick and pippin a chair
angry let him go or ill have you longshanks
strider sheaths his sword a slight smile playing on his lips
you have a stout heart little hobbit but that alone wont save you
you can no longer wait for the wizard frodo
the gate keeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern
a look of fear on his face
he approaches the closed gate with great apprehension
close on the gatekeeper peers out of his peephole
the gate crashed down on the gatekeeper
as four ringwraiths ride into bree
the four ringwraiths fly done the empty streets like horsemen of the apocalypse
low angle the front door flies open
the four ringwraiths rush into the prancing pony with wicked swords drawn
close on butterbur hiding behind his bar
trembling and sweating in terror
insert pippin stirs slightly then settles back to sleep
wide on the door creaks open
the four ringwraiths silently slide into the hobbits room
the loom above each bed raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits
quick insert sams eyes open wide
in unison the ringwraits stab the hobbits in a slashing hacking frenzy
strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room
wide on the ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph
close on a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow
the ringwraiths shriek with rage
inserts sam sits up with a start
close on another shredded pillow is revealed
more shrieks of rage
insert pippin and merry wake with a start
wide on sam merry and pippin have been sleeping on striders bed
frodo stands next to strider by the window peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits room
where are they
they were once men
strider glances quickly at frodo then looks away
quietly great kings of men
then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power
blinded by their greed they took them without question one by one falling into darkness and now they are slaves to his will
strider looks from the window as the ringwraiths gallop down the bree streets
close on strider turns back to the hobbits his face lit faintly by the glowing embers of the fire
they are the nazgul ringwraiths neither living or dead
at all times they feel the presence of the ring
drawn to the power of the one
they will never stop hunting you
strider merry pippin and frodo march through a gloomy overgrown forest
sam follows at the read leading bill a scrawny pony who is laden with supplies
where are you taking us
into the wild
frodo watches uneasily as strider moves off into the cover of the trees
whispered aside how do we know this strider is a friend of gandalf
we have no choice but to trust him
but where is he leading us
strider stops casts a glance back at sam
to rivendell master gamgee
to the house of elrond
sam looks excited
did you hear that bill
were going to see the elves
strider leads the hobbits through the gloom of the forest
aerial on strider leading frodo sam merry and pippin across the windswept moors
the hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks
gentlemen we do not stop until nightfall
what about breakfast
youve already had it
weve had one yes
but what about second breakfast
strider stares at pippin blankly then turns away shaking his head
i dont think he knows about second breakfast pip
what about elvenses luncheon afternoon tea dinner
he knows about them doesnt he
i wouldnt count on it
an apple is thrown to merry who deftly catches it
another aimed at pippin catches him on the forehead
the hobbits trudge through rain looking tired hungry and miserable
saruman stands over the palantir his hands cupping the massive eye
whisper the power of isengard is at your command sauron lord of the earth
build me an army worth of mordor
saruman is seated as his orc overseer approaches
what orders from mordor my lord
what does the eye command
we have work to do
close on gandalf
lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor
he wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing
rising onto his knees
lifting his head
gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of orthanc
he is marooned on the tiny flat peak surrounded on all sides by a sheer foot drop
another whispering wail rends the air
gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down pov one of the beautiful isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the orcs
gandalf looks on in horror as orcs hack into the trunk with axes
saruman stands in rain looking out into the dark night
the orc overseer sidles up to him axe in hand sweating with exertion
the trees are strong my lord
their roots go deep
rip them all down
camera circles summit more and more trees are hauled down and killed
as gandalf looks on in helpless despair
wide on the rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on lead by strider
strider stops before a distant hill topped by an ancient ruin
this was once the great watchtower of amon sul
we shall rest here tonight
frodo merry and pippin collapse into a small hollow halfway up weathertop
they are muddy and exhausted
stider drops small swords at the hobbits feet
there are for you
keep them close
im going to have a look around
close on frodo
eyes flickering open
he suddenly sits up sniffing the air
sam merry and pippin huddled over a small fire
sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan
what are you doing
tomatoes sausages and crispy bacon
we saved some for you mr
put it out you fools
put it out
frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire
oh thats nice
ash on my tomatoes
five ringwraiths on foot running up the steep slope unnaturally fast
frodo sam merry and pippin clamber desperately towards the summit clutching their swords
frodo sam merry and pippin race into a ring of broken stones on the summit or weathertop
the ruined base of an ancient tower
the hobbits stand back to back in the centre of the ring waiting for the first assault
one by one the ringwraiths appear
brandishing gleaming swords they move slowly towards the hobbits
in the center is their leader
the witch king
back you devils
sam rushes forward with a cry
he swings his sword at the witch king who blocks the blow with his own sword
sams blade shatters
the witch king lashes out with his fist sending sam flying
merry and pippin overcome with terror throw themselves flat on the ground
the ringwraiths close in on frodo
a venomous whisper dances in his head
frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back desperately resisting the wraiths whisperings
slow motion as his hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring
the ringwraiths utter a chilling screech of excitement
frodo is unable to resist any longer falls to his knees and slips on the ring
frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world
he looks upon the ringwraiths now visible in their true appearance five ghouls dressed in long grey robes with white hair and pallid ruthless faces
the witch king extends a haggard hand towards frodo reaching for the ring on his finger
frodos trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring
he slides to the ground unable to pull his hand away
the witch king snarls and springs forward
he stabs at frodo with a wicked dagger
frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder
suddenly strider charges at the ringwraiths wielding his sword in one hand a flaming torch in the other
he moves in slow motion visible through a sea of mist
frodo sinks to the ground
behind him is a faint image of a ringwraith fleeing his head engulfed in flames
with draining strength frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger
appearing back in the real world sam rushes over to him
another ringwraith is burning and screaming
others screech fearfully at the flames turn and flee form the weathertop summit
strider kneels before frodo
he snatches up the witch kings dagger from the ground staring gravely at the long thin blade
help him strider
grim hes been stabbed by a morgul blade
the morgul blade suddenly melts
vanishing into the air like smoke
strider throws the hilt down in disgust
this is beyond my skill to heal
urgently he needs elvish medicine
strider lifts frodo onto his shoulders
strider is jogging grimly carrying an ailing frodo on his back
sam merry and pippin are running to keep up
the hobbits are carrying flaming torches for protection
we are six days from rivendell
hold on frodo
hell never make it
close on frodo
head lolling about barely conscious
fevered calling gandalf
looking up at orthanc
the tower of isengard gleaming in the moonlight
the camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland
with smoke and fire billowing out of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of orthanc
strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground
the camera is rising
a small moth flutters into shot
and leads the camera towards the summit or orthanc
gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of orthanc surrounded by a sheer foot drop
he looks weak and frail
and is seemingly asleep
the moth flutters close to gandalf
his hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and snatches the moth
gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it
the moth sits on the palm of his hand as gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue
close on the moths face
it suddenly flutters away
camera follows the moth off the orthanc summit but drops past the moth
falling down down towards the pitted wasteland straight into a fiery red tunnel
the dead trees of isengard are fed into roaring furnaces
molten metal pours into casts
red hot metal beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths
armor and weapons are forged from the great furnaces
saruman strides among the orcs and stands looking on a new born uruk hai as it escapes its birthing membrane
this is lurtz who rises up to stand before his master
close on frodo
his eyes flicker open
clouded red rimmed
his brow beaded with sweat
is he going to die
frodos breathing is getting shallow
strider looks out into the darkness
he is passing into the shadow world he will soon become a wraith like them
a distant cry of a ringwraith carries through the air
nervous theyre close
frodo gasps in sudden pain
thinking hard sam do you know the athelas plant
sam looks blank
its a weed
it may help to slow the poison
sam and strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the athelas plant
close on a small white flowered plant
strider drops to one knee carefully pulling it from the ground
what is this
a ranger caught off his guard
strider slowly looks up
frodo is breathing hard desperately ill
frodos half conscious pov surreal impression
a shimmering figure in white leaps off a horse
flash insert an ethereal vision of arwen as she appears on the other side
elvish with sub titles frodo im arwen
telin let thaed
i am arwen i have come here to help you
urgent lasto beth nin tolo dan na ngalad
hear my voice come back to the light
frodos eyes close
who is she
shes an elf
who now appears in her earth bound form a young elven woman with tousled hair dressed in mud splattered riding clothes
hes not gong to last
we must get him to my father
strider quickly lifts frodo
placing him on the horse
i have been looking for you for two days
where are you taking him
there are five wraiths behind you where the other four are i do not know
elvish with subtitles dartho guin berian
rych le ad tolthathon
stay with the hobbits
i send horses for you
close on arwen grabbing the reins of the horse
elvish w subtitles hon mabathon

strider clamps his hand over arwens
elvish subtitles andelu i ven
the road is too dangerous
elvish subtitles frodo fir

if i can cross the river the power of my people can protect him
what are they saying
close on arwen reaches for striders hand
looking deep into his eyes
i do not fear them
close on strider
we see that it is hard for him to let her go
arwen mounts her horse alsforth
ride hard dont look back
arwen looks down at strider as she supports frodo with one hand
elvish noro lim asfaloth noro lim
what are you doing
those wraiths are still out there
asfaloth springs away bearing arwen and frodo into the night
speeding pov through the forest from the back of the white horse
he lifts his head weakly
surreal slow motion pov the horses head bobbing
trees sliding by
moonlight flickers through the trees
aerial of arwens white horse emerging from the trees
and galloping across the open land as the sun rises
the white horse charges through a pine forest
suddenly galloping ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind
more ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the chase
arwen grits her teeth
urges the white horse to greater speed
the white horse speeds out of the pine trees
the ringwraiths close behind pan onto more ringwraiths galloping down the hillside
aerial shot more ringwraiths enter frame from different directions
a total of ringwraiths now pursuing frodo and arwen
close on panting head of the white elven horse
noro lim asfaloth
crane down as the white horse races towards camera to reveal the wide river bruinen in the foreground
without hesitation the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the ford
the ringwraiths pull up short of the ford clearly nervous of the water
the white horse reaches the other side
arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the ringwraiths from across the ford
give up the halfling she elf
she draws her sword and yells at the witch king
yelling if you want him come and claim him
the witch king screeches angrily draws his sword and leads the ringwraiths across the ford
the water starts flowing faster
a distant rumble can be heard
arwen waits until they are halfway across she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised
elvish non o chithaeglir lasto beth daer rimmo nin briunen dan in ulaer
nin o chitaeglir lasto beth daer rimmo nin bruinen dan in ulaer
frodo looks up weakly
to see a vast torrent of water flooding down the river towards the ford
as if a dam had burst
the foaming water seems to form the shape of dancing white horses with frothing manes
the ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge
their piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away
close on frodo as he loses consciousness
upset no no
frodo dont give in
arwen gathers the small hobbit in her arms feeling his life slip away
what grace is given me let it pass to him
let him be spared
image a bright light suddenly flares
frodo squeezes his eyes shut gasping
frightened where am i
a familiar voice cuts through the swirl of sound
you are in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning on october the twenty fourth if you want to know
frodos eyes flicker open he is lying in bed next to an open window
dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers
the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees
weak relief gandalf
softly puffing on his pipe
he smiles at frodo
yes im here and youre lucky to be here too
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
frodo sits up looking at gandalf questioningly
what happened gandalf
why didnt you meet us
im sorry frodo
close on gandalf
his eyes drift away
i was delayed
saruman stands over gandalf gloating
so much for the power of the ring or embrace your own destruction
with the power of his staff saruman raises gandalf from the ground then sends him crashing to the floor
there is only one lord of the ring
only one who can bend it to his will
and he does not share power
gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower
saruman watches gandalf fly away from isengard
on the back of a giant eagle
chilling so you have chosen death
gwaihir the eagle soars majestically over the mountains carrying gandalf towards the dawn
frodo raises himself up and looks at gandalf
what is it
gandalf returns his attention to frodo
sam runs to frodos bedside
he is overjoyed to find frodo awake
bless you youre awake
sam has hardly left your side
we were worried about you werent we mr
by the skills of lord elrond youre beginning to mend
elrond lord of the high elves steps up to frodos bedside
his face is neither old nor young though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
welcome to rivendell frodo baggins
frodo sits up looking at elrond with awe
wide on rivendell
a small cluster of elegant elven buildings sitting in a shangri la like valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains
you have found your way to the last homely house east of the sea
the elves of imladris have dwelt within this valley for three thousand years through few of my kin now remain
frodo looks out from his balcony
frodo and sam walk together
suddenly the voices of merry and pippin can be heard as they bound up to frodo and throw their arms around him
sam looks past frodo smiling
a bent figure sits alone on a bench in the sun
close on frodo turning following sams gaze
close on bilbo baggins
he breaks in to a broad grin as frodo rushes forward to embrace him
bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him
hello frodo my lad
frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal reading there and back again a hobbits tale by bilbo baggins
bilbo smiles proudly
he is sitting with frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall
frodo looks at page after page of beautiful handwriting with intricate maps and drawings
this is wonderful
i meant to go back
wander the paths of mirkwood visit laketown see the lonely mountain again
but age it seems has finally caught up with me
frodo turns a page
there before him is a map of the shire
quietly i miss the shire
i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else
off with you on one of your adventures
looks at bilbo but my own adventure turned out to be quite different
im not like you bilbo
my dear boy
sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack
pots and pans blankets cooking utensils provisions clothes
no what have i forgotten
pull back to reveal frodo hands in his pocket watching sam
sam looks up startled
slightly embarrassed no harm in being prepared
frodo strolls to the edge of the balcony
i thought you wanted to see the elves sam
more than anything
we did what gandalf wanted didnt we
we got the ring this far to rivendell
and i thought
seeing as how youre on the mend wed be off soon
youre right sam
frodo looks at sam
we did what we set out to do
frodo opens his hand the ring sits in his palm
the ring will be safe in rivendell
i am ready to go home
gandalf and elrond watch frodo and sam from elronds balcony his strength returns
that wound will never fully heal
he will carry it the rest of his life
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring
the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil
it is a burden he should never have to had to bear
we can ask no more of frodo
gandalf the enemy is moving
saurons forces are massing in the east
his eye is fixed on rivendell
and saruman you tell me has betrayed us
our list of allies grows thin
his treachery runs deeper than you know
by foul craft saruman has crossed orc with goblin men
he is breeding an army in the caverns of isengard
an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed
saruman is coming for the ring
elrond turns and walks away
this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves
we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard
the ring cannot stay here
gandalf turns and looks out the window
sounds of arrivals
gandalf watches as boromir rides through rivendell gate followed by legolas and gimli
this peril belongs to all middle earth
they must decide how to end it
not just for themselves but for those who come after
elrond approaches gandalf
the time of the elves is over
my people are leaving these shores
who will you look to when we have gone
they hide in their mountains seeking riches
they care nothing for the troubles of others
it is in men that we must place our hope
men are weak
the race of men is failing
the blood of numenor is all but spent its pride and dignity forgotten
it is because of men the ring survives
flash insert with the broken sword isildur slices off saurons finger
i was there gandalf
i was there three thousand years ago when isildur took the ring
i was there the day the strength of men failed
images elrond leads isildur into the steaming volcano
i let isildur into the heart of mount doom where the ring was forged the one place it could be destroyed
cast it into the fire
isildur turns and walks away isildur
elrond turns to gandalf
it should have ended that day but evil was allowed to endure
isildur kept the ring
and the line of kings was broken
theres no strength left in the world of men
theyre scattered divided leaderless
there is one who could unite them one who could re claim the thrown of gondor
he turned from that path a long time ago
he has chosen exile
strider watches from the shadows
as boromir strolls through the darkened gallery
boromirs eyes are drawn to an old fresco on the wall
depicting isildur defeating sauron
boromir looks with wonderment at narsil the broken blade of elendil which lies on a cloth covered plinth
quiet awe the shards of narsil
the blade that cut the ring from saurons hand
boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the blade
close on a small bloom of blood appears on boromirs finger
boromir senses striders presence
he looks from the blade to strider as if sensing a connection
but no more than a broken heirloom
replaces the broken blade but it clatters to the floor
boromir walks away leaving strider sitting alone
close on strider picks up the broken hilt as arwen appears behind him
why do you fear the past
you are isildurs heir
not isildur himself
you are not bound to his fate
the same blood flows in my veins
the same weakness
your time will come
you will face the same evil
and you will defeat it
elvish w subtitles a si i duath u orthor aragorn
u or le a u or nin
the shadow does not hold sway yet
not over you and not over me
night falls upon the beautiful valley of rivendell
still and quiet
strider and arwen stand upon a stone bridge
the evenstar at arwens breast shines in the moonlight
elvish with subtitles renech i lu i erui govannem
do you remember when we first met
elvish with subtitles nauthannim i ned ol reniannen
i thought i had strayed into a dream
arwen reaches up and gently touches the grey at striders temples
elvish with subtitles gwenin in enniath
u arnech in naeth i se celich
long years have passed
you did not have the care you carry now
arwen looks into striders eyes
elvish with subtitles renech i beth i pennen
do you remember what i told you
arwen reaches for striders hand
quietly you said youd bind yourself to me forsaking the immortal life of your people
whisper and to that i hold
i would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone
strider looks down
in his hand lies the evenstar
i choose a mortal live
you cannot give me this
it is mine to give to whom i will like my heart
arwen closes striders fingers around the jewel
arwen leans towards strider gently kissing him
elrond addresses the council
strangers from distant lands
friends of old
you have been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor
middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction
none can escape it
you will unite
or you will fall
each race is bound to this fate
this one doom
frodo sits amongst a council of free peoples of middle earth elrond stands before them addressing gandalf strider legolas and other elves dwarves and men
bring forth the ring frodo
frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone plinth
he places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat
shocked so it is true
disbelief saurons ring
the ring of power
grim the doom of man
it is a gift
a gift to the foes of mordor
why not use this ring
long has my father the steward of gondor held the forces of mordor at bay
by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
give gondor the weapon of the enemy
let us use it against him
you cannot wield it
none of us can
the one ring answers to sauron alone
it has no other master
boromir turns and looks at strider coolly
and what would a ranger know of this matter
strider says nothing and boromir turns away dismissively
this is no mere ranger
he is aragorn son of arathorn
you owe him your allegiance
frodo looks at strider questioningly
boromir turns sharply
quiet disbelief aragorn
this is isildurs heir
and heir to the throne of gondor
elvish with subtitles havo dad legolas
sit down legolas
gondor needs no king
aragorn is right
we cannot use it
you have only one choice
the ring must be destroyed
the hum of the ring seems to grow louder in frodos ears
gimli suddenly stands excited
what are we waiting for
gimli suddenly rushes forward
he swings his axe down on the ring
the axe shatters with a deafening crack
gimli falls backwards staring in disbelief at the ring
frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him
he slumps in this chair clutching his forehead
gandalf looks at him with concern
the ring cannot be destroyed gimli son of gloin by any craft that we here possess
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom
only there can it be unmade
it must be taken deep into mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came
one of you must do this
the council sits with downcast eyes as if a great dread has descended on them
boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice one does not simply walk into mordor
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs
there is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful
it is a barren wasteland riddled with fire and ash and dust
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume
not with ten thousand men could you do this
it is folly
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said
the ring must be destroyed
and i suppose you think youre the one to do it
and if we fail what then
what happens when sauron takes back what is his
gimli leaps to his feet
i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf
a storm of argument erupts around the room
close on frodo
sound disappears as he watches in slow motion
the angry faces the shaking fists the accusatory fingers his eyes move across to the ring
the hum grows louder in his head
shouting never trust an elf
close on the ring fills the screen
streams of blood flow across the surface
flames flicker within the gold band
do you not understand
while we bicker among ourselves saurons power grows
no one will escape it
you will all be destroyed your homes burnt and your families put to the sword
close on frodo
breathing rapidly caught in the grip of his hideous vision
with a huge effort or will frodo tears his gaze upon the ring
frodo suddenly stands
he speaks in a strong clear voice
i will take it
i will take it
i will take the ring to mordor
frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces
i do not know the way
gandalf rises to his feet
i will help you bear this burden frodo baggins as long as it is yours to bear
if by my life or death i can protect you i will
kneels before frodo you have my sword
aragorn steps forward
followed by legolas and gimli
and you have my bow
and my axe
boromir looks at them all then walks towards frodo
you carry the fate of us all little one
boromir looks towards elrond and gandalf
if this is indeed the will of the council then gondor will see it done
frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all middle earth stand at his side
a sudden noise
sam pops up from behind a bush
frodos not gong anywhere without me
it is hardly possible to separate you
even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not
merry and pippin jump up from behind another bush
were coming too
youll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us
you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission
well that rules you out pip
thoughtfully nine companions
so be it
announcing you shall be the fellowship of the ring great
where are we going
close on an old sword sliding out of a shabby leather scabbard
its polished well tendered blade glitters cold and bright
my old sword sting
here take it
bilbo offers sting to frodo
its so light
yes yes made by the elves you know
the blade glows blue when orcs are close
and its times like that my lad when you have to be extra careful
bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail
heres a pretty thing
mithril as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales
let me see you put it on
close on frodo peels off his shirt
revealing the ring on the chain around his neck
my old ring
frodo frowns as bilbo moves toward him
i should very much like to hold it again one last time
bilbo reaches forward eyes locked on the ring
a shadow passes across bilbo
for a split second he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands
frodo pulls away shocked
the shadow passes
bilbo slumps into a chair his head in his hands
his eyes filling with tears
sad im sorry that i brought this upon you my boy
im sorry that you must carry this burden
im sorry for everything
bilbo sobs and frodo moves to comfort him
the fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of rivendell
the fellowship trekking through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters
the misty mountains rise sharply to their left
we must hold to his course west of the misty mountains for forty days
if our luck holds the gap of rohan will still be open to us
from there our road turns east to mordor
close on sam at the campfire
the sound of clashing swords
wider aragorn and boromir are giving pippin sword tuition
get away from the blade pippin
on your toes
good very good
i want you to react not think
should not be too hard
move your feet
quite good pippin
close on gimli has managed to corner gandalf
if anyone were to ask for my opinion which i note they have not i would say we are taking the long way round
gandalf we can pass through the mines of moria
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome
gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea
i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice
boromir thrusts catching pippin on the hand
pippin throws down his sword kicks and lunges at boromir tackling him to the ground
legolas eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch which darts about the sky like flying smoke in the wind
what is that
its just a wisp of a cloud
worried its moving fast
against the wind
crebain from dunland
wide on the fellowship scramble under what little cover there is
as a regiment of large crows fly low overhead at great speed wheeling and circling above
as their dark shadow passes over the fellowship a single harsh croak is heard
and the crows suddenly wheel away back towards the south
gandalf staggers to his feet
worried spies of saruman
the passage south is being watched
gandalf looks at aragorn turns to the others
gesturing towards a high mountain pass
we must take the pass of caradhras
the fellowship clamber through rock and snow
close on frodo slips on some shale
as he scrambles to his feet the ring falls on the ground
close on the ring gleaming in the snow
boromirs hand picks it up by the chain
he stands the ring dangling before his eyes
he seems to grow in stature as if absorbing its power
aragorn warily approaches boromir
boromir is motionless
he stares at the ring as if transfixed
it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing
such a little thing
give the ring to frodo
aragorns hand moves to his sword hilt
looking up at boromirs face
the strange hum vibrates on the soundtrack
close on a weird beatific smile lights up boromirs face
the hum grows to a deafening roar
boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring back to frodo
lightly as you wish
i care not
boromir smiles at frodo ruffling his hair
close on aragon unhands his sword
following the crows as they race deeper and deeper passing a vista of industry hundreds of orcs and writhing birthsacks
flying past saruman who stands upon a wooden gantry
close on saruman listening to the cries of the crows
you try to lead them over caradhras
and if that fails
where then will you go
the fellowship struggles through the snow
if the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road
the fellowship are struggling through a blinding blizzard up towards the pass of caradhras
legolas the elf moves lightly across the top of the snow
he suddenly pauses
sarumans voice sweeps by in the wind
urgent there is a fell voice in the air
rock and shale fall from above
urgently hes trying to bring down the mountain
we must turn back
losto caradhras sedho hodo nuitho i ruith
sleep caradhras be still lie still hold your wrath
camera sweeps past saruman
he stands on the summit of orthanc chanting
clouds are flowing from all directions
converging on the distant mountains in a stormy malestrom
sarumans voice strengthens
rolling past the fellowship like thunder
a lightning crack explodes on the mountainside above them
frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them
the fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge
legolas pulls gandalf to safety
aragorn shields frodo and sam as snow piles around them
within moments the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow
boromir and aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits
who are pulled out shivering and fearful
urgent we must get off the mountain
make for the gap of rohan and take the west road to my city
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard
we cannot pass over the mountain
let us go under it
let us go through the mines of moria
gandalf has a concerned look on his face
you fear to go into those mines dont you
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep
you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad dum
shadow and flame
let the ringbearer decide
close on frodo the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him
close on merry and pippin shivering in boromirs arms
frodo meets gandalfs eye
we will go through the mines
gandalf slowly nods
so be it
the fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake
directly below great looming cliffs
in awe the walls of moria
footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones
gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees
slowly faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight
a large moon rises over the mountains
the lines grow broader and clearer forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols
it reads the door of durin lord of moria
speak friend and enter
what do you suppose that means
confident its quite simple
if you are a friend speak the password and the doors will open
gandalf raises his arms
incanting annon edhellen edro hi ammen
the cliff towers into the night the wind blows cold frodo shivers
and the door stands fast
mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door
sam packs pots and pans at his feet
watching sadly as aragorn un saddles bill the pony
close on aragorn whispering to bill the pony
whispering mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as bill
go on bill go on
dont worry sam
he knows his way home
aragorn slaps bill on the rump
bill goes trotting off
close on sam watching bill disappear into the darkness
merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake
black rippling rings slowly fan out
pippin is about to throw another stone but aragorn grabs his arm
ominous do not disturb the water
aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow
he exchanges a look with boromir
aragorns hand creeps towards his sword
gandalf gives up in despair
he sits down beside frodo
close on frodo peers at the elvish inscription
his face breaks into a smile of comprehension
quietly its a riddle
gandalf raises his eyebrows
explaining speak friend and enter
whats the elvish for friend
with that the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great doors swing outwards
revealing a blackness deeper than the night
as the fellowship enter the blackness something in the water stirs
the fellowship step warily into the darkness of moria
a dank cavern with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain
so master elf you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves roaring fires malt beer red meat off the bone
this my friend is the home of my cousin balin
and they call this a mine
snorting a mine
a glow from gandalfs staff suddenly lights the chamber
the fellowship recoil in horror
many dwarf skeletons are strewn about clearly the dead of some old battle
the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes
grimly this is no mine
its a tomb
in horror oh
legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton
the fellowship draw swords and back away towards the entrance
we make for the gap of rohan
we should never have come here
frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground
a long sinuous tentacle is wrapped around frodos ankle and is dragging him towards the lake
frodo cries out as aragorn and boromir rush forward
aragorn severs the tentacle holding frodo and pulls him to safety
boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs
more tentacles ripple out of the lake
the dark water boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the fellowship
again the creature grabs frodo and pulls him to the lake frodo is flung in the air as the fellowship battle the creature
aragorn hacks at a tentacle
frodo is released falling into boromirs arms
into the mines
legolas shoots an arrow into the creatures head gaining a few vital seconds for aragorn and boromir as they race out of the water with frodo
the fellowship hurriedly back away from the creature
retreating into the moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors
with a shattering echo the creature rips the doors away creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face
within seconds tons of rock seal the doorway
throwing the fellowship into pitch blackness
a faint light rises from gandalfs staff throwing a creepy glow across the old wizards face
ominous we now have but one choice
we must face the long dark of moria
be on your guard
there are older and fouler things than the orcs in the deep places of the world
wide on the fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings
its a four day journey to the other side
let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed
they continue up a steep stair passing through a dwarf cemetery
the graves are despoiled
dwarf skeletons are strewn about and goblin graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood
the atmosphere is very sinister
the path splits into three passages
each disappearing into dark tunnels
gandalf pauses frowning
i have no memory of this place
the fellowship are nervously waiting
while gandalf sits staring intently at the tunnel mouths in front of him
he appears to be in some kind of trance
he turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them
are we lost
i dont think we are
shhhh gandalfs thinking
frodos pov a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness
frodo is nervous
he approaches gandalf
whispers theres something down there
quietly its gollum
hes been following us for three days
teasing shot and emaciated leering creature
disbelieving he escaped the dungeons of barad dur
or was set loose
and now the ring has drawn him here
he will never be rid of his need for it
he hates and loves the ring as he hates and loves himself
smeagols life is a sad story
gandalf catches frodos look of surprise
smeagol he was once called
before the ring came to him before it drove him mad
gollums withered fingers are gripping the cave wall
he is large luminous eyes blinking with malice
grim its a pity bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance
it was pity that stayed bilbos hand
many that live deserve death and some that die deserve life
can you give it to them frodo
do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment
even the very wise cannot see all ends
my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet for good or ill before this is over
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many
i wish the ring had never come to me
i wish none of this had happened
so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us
there is a note of finality in gandalfs voice
there are other forces at work in this world frodo besides the will of evil
bilbo was meant to find the ring
in which case you also were meant to have it
and that is an encouraging thought sudden brightness ah
that its that way
gandalf points at the right hand tunnel
the fellowship scramble to their feet
relieved hes remembered
no but the air doesnt smell so foul down there
if in doubt meriadoc always follow your nose
laughs ye s
the fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space
let me risk a little more light
gandalf taps his staff
for a brief moment a light blazes
like a silent flash of lightning
great shadows spring up and flee
the great realm and dwarf city of dwarrowdelf
frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them stretches a huge empty hall with black walls polished and smooth as glass
well theres an eye opener and no mistake
ahead of them a wooden door has been smashed
black arrows are embedded in the timbers
two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway
gimli rushes ahead
gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber
lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight beaming in from a small hole near the roof
dwarf and goblin skeletons are piled high
in the far corner sits a stone walled well
a shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room a single oblong block about feet high topped with a great slab of white
gimli falls to his knees
gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes carved onto the white stone slab
here lies balin son of fudin lord of moria
he is dead then
its as i had feared
gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab
it has been slashed and stabbed
and appears to be covered in dried blood
the pages crack and break as he opens it
urgent whisper to argorn we must move on we cannot linger
reading they have taken the bridge and the second hall we have barred the gates
but cannot hold them for long
the ground shakes
drums in the deep
we cannot get out
a shadow moves in the dark
will no one save us
they are coming
unnerved pippin backs away nervously
he stumbles against the well sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in
merry reaches out grabbing hold of pippin before he falls
the fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well
gandalf turns angrily on pippin
angry fool of a took
throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity
they fall silent
a low rolling boom rises from the depths below
as if the caverns of moria were turned into a vast drum
a great horn blasts nearby
sams eyes glance at frodos belt
frodo looks down
a cold blue glow is emanating from stings scabbard
frodo draws the sword
and stares at its glowing blade
to the hobbits get back
stay close to gandalf
aragorn and boromir slam and wedge the doors
boromir catches sight of something he turns to aragorn with shock in his eyes
they have a cave troll
gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb
yelling let them come
there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath
the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments and goblins charge into the tomb followed by a huge cave troll
gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in goblin helmets
aragorn and boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords
legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats desperately trying to shield the hobbits
gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle
the cave troll is sweeping his club at aragorn
who stumbles backwards
the huge club descends for the killing blow
suddenly in a flash of steel boromirs long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll it rears back spewing green blood
sam is backing up against a wall
a sword in one hand a saucepan in the other
in desperation he swings wildly at a goblin with a saucepan
it keels over
sam looks surprised
he wallops another goblin and it too drops
i think im getting the hang of this
the cave troll lunges forward thrusting at frodos chest with his spear
sam screams as frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall
shocked yell frodo
the hobbits go crazy
sam slashes at the cave trolls knee bringing him down
merry and pippin jump on him
legolas fires an arrow
and the cave troll topples dead
aragorn rushes to frodos side as he slumps to the floor
frodo appears to be dead
close on gandalf aragorn hobbits looking horrified
suddenly frodo coughs
takes a huge breath
im not hurt
you should be dead
that spear wouldve skewered a wild boar
i think theres more to this hobbit than meets the eye
frodo open his shirt to reveal the mithril vest
the troll spear did not pierce the mithril
you are full of surprises master baggins
boom the sound of the drums rings out again
gandalf turns to the others
to the bridge of khazad dum
gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge dwarrowdelf chamber
they hurry towards a distant door
as goblins start scuttling down the pillars behind them like cockroaches
frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming goblin army thats rushing toward them
a deafening roar fills the air
a fiery light dances down the hallway
the pillars casting eerie shadows
the goblins freeze
they back fearfully away from the approaching beast
melting into the darkness
what is this new devilry
a huge shadow surrounded by flame falls across the hall
the ground shakes
an unearthly sound rumbles
quietly a balrog
a demon of the ancient world
this foe is beyond any of you
urgent yell run
the balrog a massive creature rises from a chasm a great foot man beast with a mane of flames
in one hand is a blade
like a stabbing tongue of fire in the other a whip of many thongs
aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway
gandalf follows leaning heavily on his staff
close on aragorn looks at gandalf concerned
lead them on aragorn
the bridge is near
gandalf looks at him
do as i say swords are no more use here
the fellowship race down the stairway aragorn picks up frodo
leaping across a gaping chasm
a narrow bridge spanning a bottomless pit
gandalf yells to the others aragorn makes to throw gimli across the chasm
nobody tosses a dwarf
the balrog smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings
it swoops down past the fellowship disappearing into a flaming pit
the fellowship run into a hall
the floor is split with fissures that spit flame
yelling over the bridge
they race towards the slender bridge of stone
without kerb or rail
at the far end of the hall
the fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge
pauses in the middle of the span
he faces the balrog
staff in one hand
sword in the other
frodo looks back in horror you cannot pass
alarmed yell gandalf
yelling i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udun
frodo watches as the balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height wings spreading from wall to wall
gandalf is a tiny figure balanced precariously on the narrow bridge
go back to the shadow
the balrog slashes at gandalf with its sword of flame
gandalf blocks with his sword
a ringing clash and the balrogs sword shatters into molten fragments
booming you shall not pass
the balrog places one foot onto the bridge
aragorn and boromir race forward swords drawn
gandalf cries aloud as he summons up his last reserves of
he thumps the bridge with his staff
a blinding sheet of white flame springs up
the staff shatters
the bridge breaks
right at balrogs feet
the stone bridge drops away into the gulf
from under the balrog
for a moment the great beast remains poised in the air
then it plunges down in slow motion relief floods frodos face
gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge
slow motion as the balrog falls he lashes out with his whip of fire
slow motion the thongs of the whip lash and curl around gandalfs knees dragging him over the brink
gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips screaming gandalf
fierce fly you fools
close on gandalf lets go his grip and falls away
following the balrog into the bottomless abyss
frodo cries out
boromir scoops him up and carries him away
they rush towards an archway
the fellowship tumble out of the great eastern gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside
sam merry and pippin fall slowly to the ground sobbing
aragorn turns to legolas and gimli
urgent legolas get them up
give them a moment
for pitys sake
by nightfall these hills will be swarming with orcs
we must reach the woods of lothlorien
come boromir legolas gimli get them up
on your feet sam
boromir glances towards frodo then back at aragorn
frodo is walking away as if in a daze
close on frodo slowly turns
a look of numb shock on his devastated face
the fellowship marches on
aragorn scours ahead of the company as they stumble on in the fading light
in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen
wide on the fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers
above is a roof of golden leaves held up by silver pillars
the trunks of huge grey trees
gimli looks nervously around
stay close young hobbits
they say a sorceress lives in these woods
an elf witch of terrible power
all who look upon her fall under her spell
a strange voice whispers in his head
and are never seen again
your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom
you bring great evil here ringbearer
well heres one dwarf she wont ensnare so easily
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox
the fellowship are suddenly surrounded by armed elves
deadly arrows aimed at their heads
haldir the elvish captain steps forward
he looks at gimli with disdain
the dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark
elvish with subtitles haldir of lorien we come here for your help
we need your protection
these woods are perilous
we should go back
you have entered the realm of the lady of the wood
you cannot go back
haldirs eyes lock onto frodo
come she is waiting
haldir leads the fellowship onto a hill top
they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them
several miles towards the south a large hill rises out of the woods
upon the hill rise many mighty mallorn trees taller than any others
nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city
it gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun
green gold and silver
to the east of caras galadhon the woods of lorien run down the pale gleam of anduin the great river
beyond the river the land appears flat and empty formless and vague until far away it rises again like a dark and dreary wall
the sun that lies on lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond
step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light
the walls are green and silver the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might mallorn tree now tapering toward its crown
celeborn steps forward to greet the guests
his hair is long and silver his face grave and beautiful with no sign of age upon it
next to him stands galadriel the lady of the elves
she has hair of deep gold and timeless unsurpassed beauty
celeborn looks hard at aragorn
eight there are yet nine there were set out from rivendell
tell me where is gandalf for i much desire to speak with him
frodo looks at galadriel standing silently beside celeborn
softly aloud he has fallen into shadow
galadriel looks to aragorn
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while the company is true
galadriels eyes settle on sam
do not let your hearts be troubled
go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil
galadriels eyes turn to frodo
her voice fades
tonight you will sleep in peace
whispered v o welcome frodo of the shire
close on frodo looks at galadriel
sudden insert galadriel as she is on the other side
no longer of this world
a piercing white light surrounds her
one who has seen the eye
gimli legolas merry pippin frodo and sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain
they lie on soft couches as elves leave food and wine for them
mournful singing drifts down from the trees above
sadly a lament for gandalf
what do they say about him
i have not the heart to tell you
for me the grief is still too near
boromir is sitting alone
aragorn approaches him
take some rest
these borders are well protected
moonlight catches the trace of tears on boromirs face
aragorn kneels down beside him
i will find no rest here
i heard her voice inside my head
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor and she said to me even now there is hope left
but i cannot see it
it is long since we had any hope
close on boromir looks at aragorn in despair
my father is a noble man but his rule is failing and our
our people lose faith
he looks to me to make things right
and i would do it i would see the glory of gondor restored
have you ever seen it aragorn
the white tower of ecthelion glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver its banners caught high in the morning breeze
have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets
i have seen the white city
boromir feels aragorns love for minas tirith and takes heart one day our paths will lead us there and the tower guards shall take up the call the lords of
gondor have returned
aragorn returns boromirs smile
betraying his disquiet sadness only when boromir looks away
the fellowship are asleep on their beds
gimli is snoring loudly
close on bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn
close on frodos eyes flicker open
as if by instinct
galadriel her white dress glowing in the moonlight glances at him
frodo follows her
as if drawn by an invisible force
upon a low stone pedestal carved like a branching tree sits a shallow silver basin
galadriel leads frodo into the small glade
will you look into the mirror
frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin
warily what will i see
galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug
a glow rises from the water
even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things
things that were
things that are
and some things that have not yet come to pass
frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal
he peers into the glossy surface
the night sky is reflected into the water
suddenly a figure takes form
the bowed figure of an old man clad in white robes
he walks down a long road
frodo leans closer to the mirrors surface
frodo gasps his face lighting up with hope
gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity
frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror
suddenly the image flares burning out to white
the vision shifts
frodo gasps in horror
the shire is in ruins
the image suddenly widens to fill the screen
bodies strewn about
dark shapes of orcs looting and destroying
bag end billowing in flames
the party tree is hacked down
frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow
the nightmarish image sweeps past his head engulfing him entirely
now an industrial wasteland
the fields and trees destroyed
replaced with brick factories belching smoke
image orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the factories
we see sam
and rosie cotton
soot stained and sobbing they disappear into the factory hell hole
suddenly the mirror goes dark
and out of the black abyss a single eye grows
close on frodo is frozen
unable to move or cry out
the ring dangles from his neck inches above the water
not shimmering with curls of steam
fire erupts around the eye
with a yell frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground
light instantly fades from the mirror
frodo comes to his senses
he is shocked
galadriel stands still as a statue unmoved untouched by the horror
i know what it is you saw
for it is also in my mind
it is the future frodo
it is what will come to pass if you should fail
galadriel looks at frodo intensely
frodo looks down
in his hand he is clutching the ring
frodo looks up at galadriel
the fellowship is breaking
it has already begun
he will try to take the ring
you know of whom i speak
one by one it will destroy them all
if you ask it of me i will give you the one ring
you offer it to me freely
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this
galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodos eyes
frodo is suddenly afraid of her
in place of the dark lord you would have a queen not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn
treacherous as the sea
stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair
frodo takes a step away from galadriel
galadriel suddenly laughs
a slender elf woman once more clad in simple white her voice soft and sad
gently i pass the test
laughs i will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
frodos confidence drains away
i cannot do this alone
you are the ring bearer frodo
to bear a ring of power is to be alone
this task was appointed to you and if you do not find a way no one will
frodo realizes what her message is
then i know what i must do
im afraid to do it
galadriel kneels down to frodos height staring at him intently
even the smallest person can change the course of the future
the ring lies in the palm of frodos hand
his fingers close over it
naked lurtzs eyes follow saruman alight with a mean intelligence
smiles they were elves once
taken by the dark powers
tortured and mutilated
a ruined and terrible form of life
my fighting uruk hai
whom do you serve
gutteral rasp saruman
quick cuts lurtz is quickly armored
leg guards helmet
a sword is thrust in lurtzs hand
the uruk hai are smearing themselves in white paint
a creepy ritualistic ceremony
the white hand of isengard is smeared on bodies faces and armor
saruman address a crowd of fully armed uruk hai
hunt them down
do not stop until they are found
you do not know pain
you do not know fear
you will taste man flesh
saruman turns to lurtz
coldly one of the halflings carries something of great value
bring him to me
alive and unspoiled
kill the others
lurtz is leading uruk hai out of isengard
they run fast their powerful legs carrying them at speed
the fellowship are in small elven boats
they row away from the lothlorien shore into the silverlode river
elves quietly watch them depart
galadriel gives frodo a small crystal phial
farewell frodo baggins
i give you the light of earendil our most beloved star
as the fellowships boats drift past galadriel stands alone watching from the banks of the river
in his head frodo still hears her voice
may it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out
the boats pass into the great river anduin
the three elven boats carry the fellowship steadily southward
green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land
the uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose
a flock of birds circle high above black against the pale sky
aragorn watches them with concern
the three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre dawn light
close on aragorn slowly paddling in the stern
frodo slowly looks up his eyes widening with amazement
wide on two enormous rock statues towering like foot pinnacles on either side of the river
carved images of gondorian kings of old
they loom over the boats with power and majesty
close on aragorn
strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels
he speaks almost as if to himself
deeply moved long have i desired to look upon the kings of old
the fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues feet
wide on craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads to reveal a large lake only a mile down river
as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore
we cross the lake at nightfall hide the boats and continue on foot
we approach mordor from the north
gloomy oh yes just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks
and after that gets even better
a festering stinking marshland far as the eye can see
that is our road
i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength master dwarf
indignant recover my
legolas turns to aragorn with urgency
we should leave now
orcs patrol the eastern shore
we must wait for cover of darkness
it is not the eastern shore that worries me
legolas casts a glance around into the parth galen forest
a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind
something draws near i can feel it
aragorn looks at legolas knowing full well what he means
sam has slumped asleep
merry dumps a small pile of kindling at gimlis feet
sam sits up with a start
aragorns head snaps round
his eyes fly to boromirs shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed
close on aragorn
as he realizes boromir has gone
frodo is walking beneath the trees
lost in thought
his feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab
his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of amon hen
the seeing seat
a crackling sound
quietly none of us should wander alone you least of all
so much depends on you
frodo turns slowly
he stares at boromir tense cautious
i know why you seek solitude
you suffer i see it day by day
are you sure you do not suffer needlessly
frodo stands silent for a moment
the murmur of the wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be heard let me help you
there are other ways frodo
other paths that we might take
i know what you would say and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
boromir has started forward towards frodo he pulls himself up
we are all afraid frodo
but to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have
dont you see that is madness
there is no other way
i ask only for the strength to defend my people
angrily drops the wood he has collected if you would but lend me the ring
frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir
why do you recoil
i am no thief
wary you are not yourself
what chance do you think you have
they will find you they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end
frodo turns to leave
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it might have been mine
it should be mine
give it to me
give me the ring
boromir leaps on top of frodo grasping for the ring
frodo has only moments to act
frodo rips the ring from around his neck
and rams it on his finger
boromir spins wildly around yelling into thin air
i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron
you will betray us
you go to your death and the death of us all
curse you and your halflings
boromir stumbles and falls
his body shakes as if in the throes of a fit
slowly he comes to
what have i done
frodo races through the misty twilight world past the foggy shapes of twisted trees
somewhere behind him boromirs distraught voice carries from another dimension im sorry frodo
frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps
he clambers up the stairs onto a high seat perched on four stone pillars
frodo cowers on the seat like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings
the world of mist swirls around him
frodo peers out from the seat
the world seems to shrink
in all directions views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist
images orcs spilling out of holes in the misty mountains
flames rising from mirkwood
grim faced easterlings march to war
black ships sailing into the south
all the power of the dark lord is in motion
frodo moves his gaze towards the east
fire explodes against the smoke as a huge mass of black battlements fills frodos vision
a mountain of iron immeasurably strong tower of adamant barad dur fortress of sauron
they will fall
frodo leaps off the seat and tumbles down the stairs
the eye sweeps amon hen like a searchlight seeking its ring
with a huge effort frodo wrenches the ring off his finger
frodo lies gasping on the summit of amon hen
below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat
frodo looks up as aragorn towers over him
numb it has taken boromir
aragorn moves towards frodo
urgent where is the ring
frodo backs away from aragorn
aragorn is shocked by the movement
i swore to protect you
can you protect me from yourself
frodo uncurls his fist
in is palm lies the ring
it glints gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun
aragorns eyes are drawn to it
would you destroy it
kneeling to frodo i would have gone with you to the end
into the very fires of mordor
look after the others especially sam
he will not understand
he draws his sword
urgent go frodo
frodo backs away into the trees
as uruk hai swarm onto amon hen behind aragorn
aragorn attacks the leading uruk hai like a madman
he brings two down with his sword
leaping into the ruins as others close in on him
frodo scrambles down the hillside away from the fight
aragorn battles the uruk hai amongst the pillars and blocks of amon hen
despite his bravery he is quickly surrounded
suddenly elven arrows smash into the uruk hai
legolas races out of the woods firing his bow
gimli leaps into the battle wielding his might axe
frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him
sam looks around for frodo
close on lurtz ordering his find the halflings
find the halflings
frodo stumbles and falls
quickly he crawls behind a tree
above him the sound of uruk hai crashing through the forest rings out
urgent whisper frodo
frodo turns to see merry and pippin hidden in a hollow a few feet away
hide here quick
frodo looks at his friends
slowly shakes his head a great sadness in his eyes
whats he doing
merrys eyes meet frodos
softly hes leaving
pippin stands and makes a move toward frodo
merry grabs at his arm
the echo of boromirs horn reaches aragorn legolas and gimli
they are battling their way down the slopes towards the lake
the horn of gondor
aragorn desperately slashes his way towards boromir felling uruk hai in his path
while legolas and gimli fight a rear guard action
many uruk hai fall to boromirs sword as he tries to protect merry and pippin
lurtz takes aim
a black arrow suddenly thuds into boromirs chest
amazingly boromir continues fighting but another arrow
and another brings him to his knees
merry and pippin are scooped off their feet by uruk hai
lurtz aims his bow at boromirs heart
suddenly aragorn charges at him smashing the bow with his sword
they lock into a deadly battle
aragorn cuts lurtz down and races towards boromir who lies slumped against a tree
uruk hai arrows sticking out of his chest
at least dead uruk hai lie heaped around boromir
his horn lies at his feet
cloven in two
painful gasp they took the little ones
aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow of blood from boromirs shoulder
where is frodo
i let frodo go
boromir holds aragorns gaze
then you did what i could not
i tried to take the ring from him
the ring is beyond our reach now
forgive me i did not see
i have failed you all
you fought bravely
you have kept your honor
aragorn tries to bind boromirs wound
it is over
the world of men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin
i do not know what strength is in my blood but i swear to you
i will not let the white city fall nor your people fail
aragorn places boromirs sword in his hand
boromirs fingers tighten around the hilt
i would have followed you my brother
my captain my king
aragorn lays boromir down
he is dead
be at peace son of gondor
aragorn bends and kisses boromirs forehead
legolas and gimli appear behind him
they will look for his coming from the white tower
but he will not return
on the lakeshore frodo stands in front of one of the elvish boats the ring in his palm
a distraught sam
running as hard as he can through the forest
close on frodo looks to the far side of the river
the camera moves in on the ring
i wish the ring had never come to me
i wish none of this had happened
tears fall down frodos face
so do all who lie to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us
with renewed determination frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket
the small figure of frodo pushing the elvish boat into the water
sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake
frodo is already paddling away
anguished not alone frodo
frodo in the boat paddling steadfastly away from the shore
tears in his eyes
the voice of sam carried on the wind
frodo whispers to himself no sam
sam looks at the water
then at the boat
frodo turns to see sam launching himself into the water
go back sam
im going to mordor alone
sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat
of course you are
and im coming with you
you cant swim
sam starts to go under spluttering and coughing
frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat
sam is underwater
hands flailing helplessly as he sinks
close on frodos hand grasping sams
frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat
frodo and sam look at each other out of breath tears and water streaming down both their faces
i made a promise mr
fierce passion dont you leave him samwise gamgee
sobs and i dont mean to
i dont mean to
crying oh sam
frodo starts to laugh through his tears
the two friends hug
come on then
the two hobbits row through the water
slow motion looking down on swiftly flowing water
boromirs body slides under camera
he is lying in one of the boats his arms across his chest
his broken horn at his side
the boat drops away from camera
as it plunges over the massive falls of rauros disappearing into the vapor below
if we are quick we will catch frodo and sam before nightfall
aragorn looks towards the far shore frodo and sams small boat can be seen lying on the distant riverbank as frodo and sam make off into the forest beyond
he doesnt react
legolas turns and looks at aragorn
you mean not to follow them
frodos fate is no longer in our hands
then it has all been in vain
the fellowship has failed
not if we hold true to each other
we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death not while we have strength left
aragorn pulls a hunting knife out of his pack and straps it on
leave all that can be spared behind
close on aragorn
a steely light in his eye
grimly we travel light
lets hunt some orc
aragorn legolas and gimli disappear into the woods following the uruk hai trail
frodo and sam scramble onto a high ridge
a distant line of saw toothed mountains below a dark oppressive sky
black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains
i hope the others find a safer road
simply striderll look after them
i dont suppose well ever see them again
we may yet mr
frodo looks at sam with great affection
despite the grim outlook sam is undeterred
im glad youre with me
