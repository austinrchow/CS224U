written by michael brandt derek haas close on the face of wesley gibson staring at the
six weeks ago i was ordinary and pathetic
his wry smile gives way to
the camera starts from the ceiling pointing straight down overlooking a table of twenty five people dressed in business casual pretending to have a good time at lunch in
this cookie cutter crappy restaurant
at the end of the table a bowl of spinach dip is in
front of wesley and the camera starts descending directly for it slowly as we hear
it was rochelles birthday which meant there was a certain amount of inter office pressure to go to applebys and sit at a table of twenty five with my boss
janice presiding at the head even though shes too tight to pick up the bill
which meant the poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty four ways everyone contributing to rochelles free meal surf and turf no less dont do us
any favors rochelle
anyway i ate a plate of extreme nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single handedly
the camera disappears in the bowl of spinach dip and we
where wesley drops his head down on his desk
so by the time i got back to my cubicle my eyelids were so damn heavy i had to put my head down even if it was just for a
a sharply dressed man mr
x wearing a dark
armani suit enters a skyscraper through the lobby
hes a shade taller than most of the office workers who are coming and going
he heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top floor
and as his finger presses the button just where the thumb meets the forefinger we see a tattoo of a three headed dog
the doors open again and he finds himself in an opulent corridor sleek and expensively designed
only one office is at the end of the hall
expressionless he makes his way toward it
without knocking he steps inside
an office fit for a king
or a queen
because behind a glass desk sits a beautiful indian woman dressed traditionally in a serape with a red bindi on her forehead the holy third eye
her name is puja
x sits in the single chair opposite her
after a moment puja looks up
i didnt expect for you yourself to come
one of the heads in the flesh
youre an important fence
she reaches over to an attacha case and removes a file
the name of the target is henry helms
carrying the file she moves around the desk and stands a few feet away from mr
x who rises so that they are both standing
she really is quite beautiful exotic even
with piercing eyes
hes a journalist who stumbled on to a story exposing a lot of powerful people people who dont like having their power threatened
x poor helms
have been five attempts on his life but he has been well protected
and well hidden
turns out his wifes family has a lot of money
hes in town to accept an award
well see to it that it never makes his mantle
and for that my clients will pay handsomely
x is looking at puja when a curious thing happens
he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts to move a little like a second dot is trying to emerge from it like an amoeba splitting
its a sh hooters laser
his eyes go wide as saucers
x but its too late as bullets rip into her head
splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet bar
x crouches drops his hands behind his back and a
pair of guns as technologically advanced as anything weve ever seen spring into his hands
stop flying and he sprints at the window from which they came smashing t rough what remains of it disappearing from the demolished room
all this as pujas dead body hits the floor blood seeping out of that holy third eye
xs momentum carries him from one building to the next over an alleyway the wet concrete shining below
he lands on the
and rolls up quickly guns ready
his eyes spot four marksmen running and ducking for cover on the neighboring rooftop
and on a dead sprint across the roof
he spots about a centimeter of flesh sticking out from around an air conditioning vent
he fikes the his left band
the bullet flies through the air and rockets into the flesh
which happens to be one of the marksmens ears
the guy yelps in pain and falls back from the vent exposing himself
thats all mr
x needs and another shot rings out while hes still on a dead run
the bullet finds its mark in the yelping mans forehead silencing him just as
x ducks behind a stairwell door
he pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of this pistol built into the barrel is thin c u r screen
it actually shows the heat signatures of the three remaining marksmen one of which is directly in front of him hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed
a second marksmen is just on the other side of the stairwell
the third is on the far side of the rooftop
x takes another look at the heat signature of the marksman hiding behind the shed and he fires his gun
then does an amazing thing in the split second that the bullet travels forward he jerks his gun to the side
actually steering the bullet around the wall and into the ksmans throat
before the guys blood hits the ground the assassin is moving again he dashes away from the stairwell then makes two incredible shots one knocks a piece of aluminum off
the top of the stairwell
which causes it to flip up in the air above the head of the hiding marksman
the second shot strikes the aluminum again
sending the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the marksmans heads as he falls
the camera moves over to where
the final marksman is breathing hard like an engine with a chronic misfire as he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades
all chopped down in a matter of seconds
he squeezes his eyes shut trying to psyche himself up
cmon cmon cmon
he looks out at the stairwell door
and all is quiet
x didnt know he was there maybe he left maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all
he finally decides
and takes one step forward
a bullet disintegrates his knee
he falls clutching the knee in agony as mr
x walks toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a hunter over his prey
xs shoe comes down on the final marksmans wrist pinning it away from his dropped weapon
who sent you
for a moment were not sure the last marksmans going
were just the decoys man
we were paid to get you out here
the marksman points at a small video camera sitting on the roof relaying their every move
xs face falls as
those words register and just then
ra rockets over thetreets of the city block after block in the blink of any eye
until it reaches a rooftop over a mile away
a man named cross is in a crouch holding a massive rifle pointed upward at an angle
a small screen on cross gun shows the scene from the roof along with various elemental measurements wind speed pressure temperature distance altitude
the information on the reflects off of cross eyeball as he processes the shot
a quick adjustment to the gun and a slight pull of the trigger
we follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an instant
somehow it keeps its elevation and its path
to the resigned look on mr
xs face an outsmarted man a dead man
the bullet hits him square in the chest and he falls to his knees then slumps over dead
flies start to gather as he lies there
first one then two then several as night time dissolves to day
and two pairs of legs approach the dead body of mr
the first set belong to an older man sloan who looks
like he has seen his share of death
the other set belong to the hottest black woman on the planet fox
as they look down at the dead body
it was a set up all the way
sloan just nods
he then stoops down shoos some of the flies away with the back of his hand and picks up the file that puja gave mr
the camera pushes in on the back of sloans hand as he reads the file
it too has the tattoo pf the three headed do q in the same spot as mr
re the dead body thats two heads in two weeks
which leaves only one you
he wants out
and killing all three heads gets him that
sloan nods again
well i dont know if we have anyone who can stop him
sloan squints back up at fox
theres one person who can
and with that we
wesley gibson the guy from the opening scene fast asleep in his little cubicle
some drool falls off his lip and erks h awake
just then the shot freeze frames and we see in the background of the shot his fat boss janice caught in mid stride coming toward him looking like shes ready
to bring the wrath of god
my name is wesley gibson
if you look at the corner of my desk youll see the billing reports i was supposed to hand in to janice an hour ago
the billing ort is highlighted on the screen for just a moment
then the movie resumes normal speed and janice reaches wesleys cube in no time
oh my fucking god i hope thats not my billing report sitting on your fucking desk
holy shit on an altar it isl a couple of the other office workers look up at the fireworks and smile
like theyre actually enjoying janices histrionics
why dont you just take a dump in your hands fork it over to me and say this is the best effort im gonna give to you janice
this is the best youre ever gonna get out of me
hell rochelle on her bbirthdav is doing a better a job than your lazy ass and shes already left for the day
je sus christ
wesley looks like hed rather be anywhere else
i meant to
imitating him i meant to
i meant to
well i meant to be a size four but meaning to doesnt pick no cotton
she snatches up the report off his desk
tell you what
ill just input the four ones myself
look everyone im gonna do wesleys four ones for him
i dont have enough to do with my own damn job so ill do wesleys too
wesley grabs the report back
ill do it
minimum for the maximum
thats all you ever do
the minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company
i said ill get it done
no youre worthless
im the one whos sorry i hired you
she storms away fuming
wesley looks over and sees some of the other workers still staring at him amused
he sits back down to the semi privacy of his little cubicle
a consultant in a suit is droning on and on in front of a nifty power point presentation
the camera pulls back to reveal wesley bored to tears sitting at a long table with janice and other corporate minions
the camera finds wesleys note pad where it looks like hes taking notes on the presentation
instead covering every inch of the page is the phrase life sucks then you die
my job title is account manager
i used to be called an account service representative but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients and not service them
onemore life sucks then you die
i have a girlfriend whom i neither manage nor service
wesleys girlfriend is currently riding some guy named barry on her living room
shes not very attractive sort of plain and ordinary
her names cathy
she works at banana republic
the guy shes humping is my best friend barry
shes giving it her best
as her moans reach a crescendo we
wesley is still sitting there with his note pad while the consultant continues to rattle on and on about god knows what
through the blinds behind the speaker wesley can spot his company
s hot intern nicole talking on the phone
he zeroes in on her until
wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijl staring at him
well the deals with applications sent by prospective clients and the is when the client is
everyone is still just staring
im sorry jesus
what was the question
i asked you about the effects of net investment income with regards to underwriting cycles
well thats the thing
whats the thing
trying to redeem himself cycles
hard market industry wide cycles differ from our firms cycles so i think its amistake to apply
good god amighty
everyone knows that net investment income is inversely related to both premium and loss reserves making firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles
in fact to prove my point id like you to spend some time this afternoon adding up the yearly differential responses
get it to me by five
wesley jots down on his pad action items and underneath it differential responses
then you die
he underlines it three times
wesley sits at a small round table by himself eating a ham and cheese on white
a group of
other workers sit at a table nearby gossiping and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss
there are people everyday you meet them who you wish could see you in a different setting a different place
just then nicole the pretty intern approaches and starts fishing through the refrigerator
instead of where you are what youve become
wesley sits upright glad now that no one is sitting at his table
nicole turns and smiles at wesley starts to head his way when
get your ass over here and
tell us what the hell is going on with you and whitcock the big cock
he pulls a chair over from next to wesley to make room for her at his table
wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich
wesley is staring at his monitor
and you wish to god your eyeballs werent being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue
that you didnt spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses
see that he is actually i laying solitaire on the computer
he keeps checking over his shoulder for janice but she is talking on the phone in her office with the door shut
he looks up and watches the computer clock turn from to
he saves his solitaire game and then turns off the computer snatches up his jacket waits for janice to turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her
call and then sneaks away
wesley presses the down button and waits
after an eternity the doors open
but at least at the end
of the day
wesley steps in and turns around
before the doors close he sees his boss janice down the hall looking at him
she checks her watch and looks back at him pissed
you know that tomorrow its going to start all over again
and then the doors close
wesley pedals a ten speed down a busy street
its raining and he squints to keep the water out of his eyes
he stands nervously at an atm machine
he checks to see if anyone is looking and then hits the check balance button
a message comes up you have
in your account
would you like another transaction
he clicks yes and then quick cash and waits for the to dispense
wesley enters toting his bike only to find cathy and barry laughing on the couch watching some crap on television
hes two steps in the door when
wheres the spaghetti
i specifically told you to get noodles on your way home
god wesley i already put the sauce on
you didnt listen is what you didnt
i might as well talk to the wall
ill be right back
he turns around
he starts to head away when barry pokes his head out of the apartment door
you want me to go with you buddy
what a dick
wesley doesnt turn around defeated
i got it
hes back on the ten speed pedaling again in the rain
a pissed expression on his face
my parents both died when i was born
he grits his teeth as we
a young wesley sits at a table with a couple of the nutjobs i had as foster parents thought any book that didnt contain a red letter edition was the
spawn of the devil
the ten year old wesley moves furtively to a side of the clap trap house and pries loose a board
so i had to hide my stash like it was a bag of many jane
stuck in a hole is a copy of the count of monte cristo
he moves back around the corner and standing there is his foster mother pissed as hell
one time my foster mother found my copy of catcher in the rye
she holds a copy of the book in her hand getting ready to strike
and god told her to beat me with it
young wesley takes a beating whap whap wrap
his face screws up taking the blows
but despite them i thought i was gonna be something special
that same expression is plastered on wesleys face as he pedals
he banks the bike up a curb and into a grocery store parking lot
across the street a man watches from behind the wheel of a chevy chevelle
in fact its cross the man we last saw assassinating mr
x on the rooftop
he watches wesley park the bike and move into the store
wesley stands looking over all the different kinds of noodles
none of them just say spaghetti
suddenly a womans voice pops up behind him
there is a remedy for all things but death
she said it so fast hes not sure he heard it right
he turns and sees the hottest zqzm ever to ace krogers aisles ox
shes wearing barely enough clothing to cover her tight body
didnt hear im sorry
you apologize too much
stammers again sorry
she looks him in the eye
spina bifida babies have more backbone than you
with that she walks toward the end of the aisle eyes scanning the whole time
stunned all wesley can do is watch her walk
on the smll f her back is a tatt it tattoo we saw in the be i n n a thkee head d dog
she gets to the end and catches him looking at her
then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head
as if to say come here
wesley still isnt sure what the hell is going on
sheepishly he makes his way to where she stands
she leans in close her lips just inches from his ear
i knew your father
whatever wesley was expecting it wasnt that
he pulls back from her
i think you got the wrong guy
cant say that i agree with you wesley
running it all together what is this
how dyou know my name
my father died in a car wreck the week i was born
your father died two days ago on the rooftop
of the metropolitan building
for a moment just a moment wesley is stunned but fox just keeps sizing him up
hed be damn disappointed in what youve become too
wesley holds up his hands in a defensive gesture
ive been called a lot of things but lady aint one of em
wesley starts to talk but fox interrupts him
damn wesley how dyou ever learn anything when you wont keep your mouth shut and your ears open
im trying to tell you about your father
wesley starts to open his mouth again but then closes it
your father wesley wits the greataz sit assassin to ever live
your father wesley worked for the fraternity
keeps right on going your father wesley was set up and gunned down by a man he used to consider a friend
and your father wesley
suddenly s raises her hands and ls fist two blgck taught me everything i know
wesley takes a step back
what is this
this is what youve dreamt about all your life
just then cross o s the corner to t e e also fisting a dar of alms
wesleys eyes go wide as fox suddenly starts firing bam
bami bamz bami bam forcing cross to take cover on the far side of the aisle
she screams this grabbing wesleys wrist and jerking him forward just as cross comes back up firing a killing machine
they barely get out of the way as the pasta aisle explodes in an avalanche of bullets
glass bottles of spaghetti sauce shatter turning the aisle into a rainstorm of red droplets were not sure what is sauce and what is blood
cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas and up to the top of the freezer section so he can have a better angle of attack at the fleeing
fox and wesley
he starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section smashing over styrofoam coolers as his bullets barely miss fox and wesley but slam into the freezers behind them sending
ice and glass exploding everywhere
but wesley and fox are too quick
she still has a
hold of wesleys wrist and she propels him through the swinging doors of the stock room
there is a cherry red ferrari convertible parked right next to the store
wesley is still trying to figure out what the hell is going on as fox tosses him the ke
but fox just leaps into the passenger seat guns up and ready as wesleys legs
somehow take over and he hops behind the wheel
just then crosss ev ll mound the corner practically going up on two tires
wesley turns the ignition pope the clutch and smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck when it launches forward
he races through the gears and rips around a corner and out into traffic
where are we going
the chevelle stays on his tail behind them cross drives and fires his glock at the same time
fox does her best to send bullets back his way while wesley mans the wheel breathing hard still stunned at what is happening
he spots a side street
whips the car into a rubber squealing turn
and ends up going the wrong way down a narrow one way street
he now has to weave in and out of cars headed right for them as cross stays tight on their ass
horns are blaring in his face but wesley somehow keeps the
ferrari on all four tires as he bobs inand out of the paths of oncoming cars
a x chevy pickup is headed like a missile right at them
wesleys eyes go wide
go around it
shoot the tires
fox looks at wesley momentarily stunned by his idea then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck
the front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers hard right where it bounces off a fed extrugk
hat sends it into a violent roll
wesley guns the ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips forward
right over their car
wesley watches it fly over them amazed his idea worked
when finally it smashes down into the street between them and crosss chevellel cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out
but its too late
his chevelle smashes into the x before skidding to a stop a tangled mess in the street
wesley snaps back to reality and rips the ferrari off the one way street and down a side street
he pulls the car to a stop then looks over at fox amazed
theres a lot of things you dont know about yourself wesley
who was that
was the man who killed your father
and now hes trying to kill you
wesley forces a laugh but right now its hard to paint any thing as ludicrous
i told you my father died when i was a baby
she leans right into his face so that their noses are only inches apart
have you ever believed that
have you ever been content with that answer
wesley stops not sure of anything right now
todays your new birthday wesley
he settles back in his seat and pops the clutch again this time easing
a little more respectably into traffic
the ferrari cruises to a stop outside a warehouse
the people i work with
we believe your father passed his skills on genetically to you
you knew how to handle the car you knew to shoot at the truck
its that confidence were gonna need to work on
wesley is still dazed
now i want you to look at me and tell me something
and i want you to be honest with me
do you think i look fat in this outfit
i thought so
she hops out
they walk inside a
t where mr
sloan stands next to a hucre man the butcher who is slicing beef off of hanging cow ca f es
there are flies buzzing around and blood draining into the center of the floor
if wesley wasnt nervous before he is now
the butcher looks up from his work and lays down the knife right next to where mr
sloan has a pair of silver pistols and a magnifying glass resting on a rolling table
this is wesley gibson
he needs his life changed
the butcher looks him over
we all end up where we belong dont we
the butcher snickers
sloan speaks up
fox told you about your father
wesley looks from sloan to fox to the butcher and back to sloan
like i told
the lady here
i think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else
im just an
my father died
they look at him imploringly waiting for an answer
i guess im not sure
sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in wesleys hand
shoot the wings off the flies
off the flies
the first time wesley notices flies buzzing all around
in the blink of an eye sloan has plucked the second gun off the rolling table and s pointing it at weslevs temple
he begins to count
you have three seconds
before he can say one wesley reacts
blindly firing the pistol in his hand indiscriminately b am
until his finger is just jamming on the trigger over and over
after a moment he looks up unsure why he isnt dead
sloan smiles drops his pistol on the rolling table and picks up the magnifying glass
he stoops down and signals wesley to do the same
four flies lie on the floor
crawling o d
their wings actually separated from their bodies
wesley jerks upright trying to process this
like i said you got the skills
and after we fine tune those skills
his eyes lock on to wesleys holding them in a vice like grip
youre going to hunt the man who killed your father
wesley is as stunned as weve ever seen him
he blinks a couple of times
walk with me
he drapes his arm around wesley and leads him out the door
sloan and wesley move down a busy commercial street
i know thin is hard for you to understand wesley but i want you to concentrate on what im saying
your father was a member of the fraternity a collection of the most powerful assassins the world has ever known
they weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about on the city streets
instinctively people step out of their way
but ive never heard of
we dont advertise wesley
we blend into the environment like moths against a tree
the camera moves over a diners counter
we stay in the shadows
to the kitchen where a massive man with a three headed dog tattoo on his hand flips burgers
the camera moves across an expansive lawn
we disappear into our surroundings
until it finds a man with a three headed dog tattoo on his hand trimming a hedge
the camera moves down a gun display case
because the easiest place to hide is in plain sight
until it finds a gun salesman holding out a weapon to an italian customer
he also has the tattoo
hes the sloan is still walking with wesley
wesley watches every face that passes them by
any of them could be fraternity members
until that time when we are called into action
the chef loads plates of food up on the warmer where a waitress picks them up and delivers them to a group of prominent looking businessmen
the lead businessman digs into his steak and immediately his left arm starts to curl up like hes having a heart attack
his cohorts look on as he spills over knocking all the plates off the table gasping for breath his throat closed
when the camera pans over again the chef is gone
the gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the front of this mansion
clip clip clip
we realize hes cutting a hole all the way through the hedge
then he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws a long range rifle with a scope
he pokes the rifle through the freshly cut hole looks through the lens starts to squeeze his trigger
the camera shoots way up to give us an aerial view of the neighborhood
we see that we are in the hills over the city and across the canyon a japanese man is just pulling into his driveway driving a black audi a mile
he brakes his car opens his door but thwapi a bullet disintegrates his head and he topples over never knowing what hit him
back at the hole in the hedge we see the gardeners eyeball looking through from the other side
until it disappears and he is gone
the customer takes the gun from the gunsmith and pays him in cash
he then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door like hes a bad ass instead of the goombah that he is
he only gets a block before the gun at his waist explodes causing him to flop on the sidewalk like he just stepped on a land mine
the bell to the gun shop jingles as the gunsmith leaves and heads in the opposite direction whistling to himself not paying attention to the pedestrians running to help the
and when the time comes that we are called death is as certain as the sun
sloan and wesley enter a normal looking pharmacy
they pass through the small front room and head directly to the back
we have been active for centuries wesley
outlasting rulers governments nations kings
we recognize no borders the entire globe is our killing field
they are buzzed through by the pharmacist and enter
a sophisticated back room where a trio of flat screen monitors are mounted on the wall
we are the baddest of the bad the three headed dog that guards the gates of hell
we show no mercy we destroy the weak we have absolute power
but recently a fallen angel one of our own has challenged that power
the screens in the room come to life with the face of cross
this man left the fraternity and decided to strike down those who had befriended him trained him made him who he is
a son whose mother died in childbirth
they reach the babys bed and a pair of strong arms lift up the child
but the camera finds the face of the second man
he took the boy to an orphanage so his true identity would never be discovered
and now we see that the other man is a young mr
and i helped him
wesley is still absorbing the story his life so different than when he got up in the morning
why would you do that
sloan puts a hand on wesleys shoulder gently
your father was like a brother to me
i will do anything to avenge his death
sloan turns off the monitors and pulls over a wooden chair from where it rests by a wall
you have a choice
would you like to go back to your job your girlfriend your life just as it was before
or would you like to begin your training with an assassins fraternity that writes the worlds history in blood and bullets
wesley doesnt know what to say
sloan moves to a back door
if the answer is the latter then have a seat in that chair
if not youre welcome to head out this door here and well never see each other again
sloan leaves through that back door
he pulls out a gun and waits for wesley to make his decision pointing his gun at the door
wesley is still standing there unaware of what is on the other side of the door thinking thinking thinking
he takes a step toward the door
flash his boss janice yelling at him mocking him
wesley hesitates looks at the chair then the door again
flash his girlfriend on the couch riding high on barry loving every minute of it
wesley stands frozen staring hard at the chair as the camera starts to swirl around him
flashes the consultant haranguing the other employees laughing eating
alone in the break room riding his bike all the aspects of his shitty life
as the camera continues to swirl around him his face going hard
fuck consultants and fuck action items and fuck differential responses
fuck it all
he takes a seat in the chair which creaks when he sits in it
out loud fuck it all
sloan hears the creak of the chair and lowers his gun
he smiles and walks off down an alley
wesley waits in the chair for what seems an eternity
starts to bite his thumbnail nervously
in comes the pharmacist
the man is built like a mountain with muscles rippling out of his white smock
hes got a british accent and is extremely polite
ah made your choice did ja of boy
very good very good
he walks behind wesley
the weathers been lovely the last couple o days would you mind putting your hands back here for me
wesley does and the pharmacist binds his hands with some rope
there thats it
is this the beginning of my training
the pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then wham
he hits wesley so hard right in the cheek that it almost knocks him out of the chair
what the fuck are
the pharmacist smashes him again
wesley struggles against the ropes but isnt going anywhere
the pharmacist rears back
keeps hitting him over and over again until wesleys eyes roll to the back of his head
you know how when you have a dream and wake up unexpectedly
wesley jerks awake in his bed
and the dream is still
on the fringe of your brain but you cant quite remember the details
he looks up at his ceiling fan barely turning a few blades missing
but then you see that same old busted ceiling fan over your bed and you are so damn glad it was just a dream
he sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror
his face has been pummeled it looks like a piece of squashed fruit
this was nothing like that
wesley shoves his atm card in the machine and hits the check balance button
amazed wesley takes out a grand the machine just spitting him money
smiling wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into traffic
the s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into
that little spinning wheel on a monitor tbat indicates your computer stuck
wesley sits in his cubicle staring at it
what happened to your face
wesley turns in his chair surprised
nicole stands there looking as pretty as ever way out of his league
i got hit by a man much bigger than me
nicole smiles flirtatiously
was this over a girl
something like that
i had no idea you had such a secret life outside of here
she cocks her head and studies him
is there something different about you
same old wesley
i dont think so
she puts her hand on top of his he can only stare at it
this kind of thing just doesnt happen to him
you arent like these people wesley
ive always thought you were different
would you consider me to be an observant person
whats that mean
wesleys about to say something when he spots janice heading their way
wesley nods at her and nicole frowns
uh oh here comes the wicked bitch of the west
with that she steps away just as janice walks up
wesley stands to face his boss as janice launches into him
fucking popscile you dont have time to get me the differential responses but you got time to chitty chatty with the intern
why do i even keep you around wesley
well i know one thing your review is coming up next week and i cant wait to start checking me off some boxes
attitude poor performance poor management skills poor works well with others
wesley just focuses on that mouth
fat lips over fat gums over yellow teeth
but now all thats coming out of it is jibberish
i jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to wesleys ears where it imbeds in the soft flesh of his brain and burns
its so goddamn loudl if only
if only it would just
its so unbelievably stunning coming out of wesleys mouth that it hits janice like a slap in the face
heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes
nicole watches pleasantly stunned from a few feet away
janice looks around shocked
wesley likes the way that felt so
just because you have one single iota of tenuous power you think you can push everyone around
i understand janice that junior high must have been particularly difficult being called tubby all the time but that doesnt give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like
sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk
janice looks down at her fingers which still have a little grape jelly on them
and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour before you so we can get an extra hour away from you and i know that must sting sitting by yourself in
the white castle parking lot every day gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us
janices eyes fall to her feet
you know if you werent such a bitch we might actually feel sorry for you
as it is i feel i can speak for the rest of the office when i say
with that he throws all the papers off his desk sending them flying
empowered wesley marches toward the elevators as everyone watches him go admiration plastered on their faces
the loudmouth from the break room steps out
that was great dude
he holds up his hand for a high five but wesley just wallops him with a right cross not breaking stride on his way to the elevators
wesley flies out the front door just as foxs diablo swings around the corner
whats up new man
you were watching
howd it feel saying exactly what you wanted to say
like i had a gun in my hands
fox grins as wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on the pedal
the diablos tires smoke as she launches it out of there
they return to the butcher shop
sides of beef hang from hooks next to a cutting table
the butcher is sharpening a knife
you need to get used to the blood and the muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can do to a chunk of
the butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of one of the hanging carcasses then slaps it on the table
take care of him butcher
will do fox
the butcher measures wesley then starts to talk in a steady almost bored voice
remember its the body we are killing
know it like a surgeon
wesley nods half disgusted half enthralled
okay well start at the beginning
to cut the subclavian artery hold the knife ice pick style and thrust down behind the clavicle cutting side to side
he jabs the blade into the beef
and just as he does
we smash cut to a businessman walking to his car just as the butcher comes up behind him and performs the exact same move he was just demonstrating
just as quickly we
and the butcher performs the next move
to slice the diaphragm first whip your wrist into the targets trachea to prevent screaming then drive the knife at a forty five degree angle upward just below the rib
just as the knife hits the side of beef we smash cut to
a drug kingpin coming out of his hotel bathroom wearing a bathrobe
suddenly the butcher is on him performing what he just described on this poor bastard who can no longer scream because hes missing his trachea and just as quickly
we are right back to the hanging side of beef as the butcher performs the next move
if you want the jugular pull your enemys head to the left and jab your knife well into his sterno cleio mastoideus muscle here then cut down and left
just like before we smash cut to
a man moseying down an alley carrying a briefcase when suddenly the butcher comes out of nowhere pulls the enemys head to the left and then wham
jabs the knife into the neck matching the move he was just demonstrating
the butcher continues to hack away at the hanging meat describing more and more ways to kill with a blade
they never show you this shit on the mcdonalds commercials
as the camera finds wesley who is completely absorbed in the lesson
the butcher hands him the knife and wesley starts to make his first chops at it wanting to please the butcher wanting to get it right
fox is seated at a small outdoor cafe sipping on a latte reading the paper
theres a story about the death threats to henry helms on the front page
just then wesley approaches his face splattered with flecks of blood
she wipes his face with a napkin
you havent quite figured out this whole blending in thing yet
a huge chevy x pulls up and fox hope out from behind the wheel followed by wesley
they get to the door and fox pulls out a metal device to pick the lock
what is this
she picks the lock and they step inside
the empty morgue examining room
empty except for a d d ozen dead b s laid out on slabs covered by white sheets
this is the roach motel wesley
wesley looks around disgusted
all right find us some skinny bitches
wesley uncovers the first body
nahh let the brother rest
find us some white meat
and nothing too fat
wesley covers the black male and moves over to a second body
he unveils it to reveal
what looks like a dead suburban housewife
load up soccer mom
fox and sloan stand next to a paper target the kind of thing you see in a police target range
it shows the outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for where youre supposed to aim
the gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper target
sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom and target to the end of the range
the camera pulls back to show wesley is with them standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite end of the range
selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination
an array of firearms are on a shelf next to wesley
wesley eyes all the weaponry
finally he settles on a short barreled black handgun
sloan takes it from him and inspects it
this is an imanishi
it holds seventeen bullets in the clip and one in the chamber
its made of a composite material unrecognizable by metal detectors
and the imanishis bullets have microchips that communicate with similar ones in the gun
sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line
what if soccer mom here is between you and your target
i suppose youre going to tell me to shoot her first
howd you do in physics class
fox cocks her head at wesley knows hes lying
okay i got a d
i couldnt remember all the rules thats it
what if i told you there werent any
he nods at wesley like hes on to something
people live by the rules set before them
we take them on faith that they are right
but how many times in your life have you thought you had a better way against the rules that was simply laughed at
because you use your brain differently than other people
all fraternity members do
i dont get it
humans use neurons to think
but most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism
and not you
we have the ability to think differently than other people
so we set our own rules
sloan hands him back the weapon
wesley aims the pistol at the target in front of him
he and the bullet plugs soccer mom in the shoulder
have you ever shot a gun before
just the flies
so you have no pre conceived habits we need to break
shoot the target
dont hit mom
you mean curve the bullet
this isnt about how
its about what
if youd never been told a bullet flies straight and i handed you this and said hit that target
what would you do
allow your instincts to guide you
just like the flies
the technology is only here to assist your natural instinct
wesley lifts the gun his mind racing
its not will that makes the physical react how we wish its control
you are in control
the bullets blast out of the gun like they are on a track set up by wesleys brain
he flicks his wrists and
they arc quickly just missing the body i e th center of the target
rules are made to be broken wesley
no one was better at that than your father
he had a pair of pearl handled revolvers with which he could conduct a symphony
l i wesley nods proudly and squeezes off some more shots all chasing through the same hole in the target
cathy jumps up from the couch when wesley comes in
oh my god wesley where have you been
ive been so worried
but wesley just pushes past her and starts to throw clothes out of drawers into a black duffel bag
whatre you doing
are you leaving
you owe rent
but wesley just keeps packing
you cant leave
this is bullshit wesley
bullshit bullshit bullshit
wesley just zips up his bag and turns back toward the door
where egx is now standing wearing outf that would make the devil blush
who the fuck are you
but fox doesnt even acknowledge her presence and just watches wesley do his business
wesley walks out the door and fox follows
cathy chases them out on to the landing
youre nothing wesley
and you will always be nothing
you think youre gonna be happy
with that skank
fox stops and turns around fisting her pistols
the camera swings over to cathy who is about to pies herself standing in the door frame with bullet holes placed expertly around her head
wesley and fox keep moving down the steps
barry is coming up the steps but he takes one look at them does a u turn and hurries out of their path
wesley tosses his bag into the corner of this immaculately furnished penthouse apartment overlooking the skyline
you can take the couch until we find you someplace better
she moves toward a separate bedroom
what was my father like
for a moment she thinks about it
they walk down a downtown lane buildings crowding in on them from all sides
not too many people are out this late they have the sidewalk to themselves
your father lov ed you wesley
he talked about you all the time
wesley looks at her hopefully
she smiles thinking about the past
thats a fact
he knew he wasnt supposed to but he couldnt help it
you worked with him
he trained me
made me what i am
a younger greener fox stands alone in the alley eyes scanning the rooftops
i remember one night he had me on my own for the first time and i was tagging this target named buster burgess
but i was green and clumsy and stupid
buster marked me and disappeared into this old tenement building
a shadowy figure creeps to the edge of the building and looks down
we cant quite make out his face
fox is looking the other way and hes got a clean shot
he raises a rifle to his eye
he nails fox in the thigh and she falls helpless to the pavement
motherfucker shot mein the leg
put a damn hole in my favorite skirt
the figure re aims ready to take out the helpless fox
then you know what happened
my father saved your life
put a bullet in burgess
i ended up with four more slugs in me
the figure unleashes four more shots
they turn a corner and head up into the lobby of a tall building their conversation continuing
what kind of training is that
im here arent i
wesley weighs all this puts it together
my father was burgess wasnt he
fox nods smiling
andstart riding it up
he didnt hit me anywhere important and he used pin shot bullets that didnt do any real damage
but you can be damn sure i dont let any mark get the high ground on me again
shesmiles at another thought
and you know what we did instead of go to the hospital to stitch me up
we went driving
a porsche showroom sits on the corner
a black convertible breaks through the glass and skids to a stop next to fox in the street
two hands pull her up and drop her in the passenger seat and the car roars off
the elevator dings
fox and wesley step out on to the rooftop where mr
x was gunned down
this is where your father was killed
wesleys eyes narrow and he looks around taking it all in
were not sure
the fence he was meeting was shot in the head
which led him out to here
but it mustve been a set up all along
all i know is it would take a hell of a trap to bring your father down
wesley crouches down by where his fathers body would have been running his fingers over the gravel rooftop
my whole life i thought he was dead
i shouldnt feel any differently just because it happened years later
but i do
like i missed my one chance
well thats why youre here
to make up for lost time
wesley looks back at her
can i see his body
they stand in a dark corner of a decrepit morgue where a couple of urns rest on a counter
the place doesnt look like much more than a crack house
we cremate our dead
id like to say its to honor them but its mainly to keep anyone from identifying them after theyre gone
these are my fathers ashes
sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound
can i have a minute
she leaves and wesley approaches the urn holding his fathersremains
he runs his finger over it and just when we think hes going to have an emotional moment
he smashes the urn on to the stand the ashes spilling out everywhere
wesley runs his fingers through the decay what a mess
there are pieces of bone intermingled in the cremains
but then hisfingegs find something in the dust
a bullet with a hole running down its center
he holds it up to the light for a closer look
as he studies it we start to hear
wesley site with his hands tied behind his back taking another beating from the pharmacist who spouts assassination techniques while he pummels wesley
if you get in the hoo ha of a two on one and find yourself the one remember that each foe will likely move at the same steady speed away
from each other allowing you to keep a gun on each
now if you find yourself one on three that poses a real bit a ball ache
the sound of the pharmacists voice fades to the background as wesleys voice over comes up
there are two kinds of pain
one is an object
a living thing that crawls around the outside of your body
cuts broken bones bruises
all deliver the kind of pain you can learn to ignore and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in your ear
wesleys eyes are starting to lose consciousness
ive lived with a different kind of pain all my life
the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over pushed around ignored
but you cant hide from that kind of pain either
wesley takes a brutal shot to the face
because it finds you
he involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his head
sloan sits across from wesley at a skinny table in an otherwise bare room
watch the eyes
look for a slight swelling of the pupil
you can train your body to stay a constant temperature you can control your heartbeat but you cant control the center of your eyes
thats how you know when someone is lying to you
sloan looks right at him
wesley narrows his eyes trying to fend off his stare
do you want to fuck fox
i know thats a lie without even seeing your eyes
try something else
what are you hiding from me
wesley looks down then focuses on sloan
wesley realizes its useless to try to keep something from this man
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center
places it on the table
you told me to hunt down my fathers killer
thats what im doing
the bullet that killed him
you said his heart stopped but there was no entrance wound
this bullet has a hole cut into its center
you know how a mole buries into the earth by pushing the dirt back around it
i think this bullet does what the mole does
splits the skin and pushes it back through its center filling the space it just passed through
sloan looks at him like he might have been underestimating him until now
fox was telling me that my father used special bullets
it looks like cross does too
which means these are custom made
if we find who makes them then we find someone who has access to cross
sloan picks up the bullet and leans back
you put this all together on your own
wesley taps his head
whatever happened to my fathers guns
the pearl handled ones
but whoever has them isnt long for this place
sloan reaches down and picks up a binder which he drops on the desk
the details of his life
q continue your hunt
no rules right
this stops sloan for a second
wesley lies on foxs couch trying his damndest not to peek at her through her bedroom door
its cracked just enough that he can see her draping a towel around her body as she heads to take a shower
wesley site up and looks at the binder sitting on the table
slowly he opens it and sees a picture of cross staring back at him
the man who took wesleys father from him
wesley studies the face wanting to know every detail
fox peers out the door and looks at wesley watching him absorb more of cross with every page
sloan leads wesley into a gigantic room lined from floor to ceiling with leather bound books
we keep a record of every assassination mission going back to the ides of march
maps diagrams logistics complications weapons of choice
its all there
wesley nods impressed
sloan just keeps leading him through a set of double doors into
a large room the size of an auditorium
on the floor is a gigantic model of the entire city built to scale showing all the buildings skyscrapers churches the waterfront the city streets
everything the city has to offer laid out in miniature
sloan and wesley stand like giants in the middle of the model city
whats all this
where we plot our local hits
this city is one of the fraternitys major headquarters
looking around this room
seems low tech
part of mastering technology is knowing when to use it
models cant be hacked
your father built this room himself
most of the buildings are white but interspersed amongst them are a few vainted red
some of the model street lamps are also red
the color red appears sporadically throughout the entire model city on the sides of buildings on mailboxes on some of the manhole covers
whats with the red ones
sloan just smiles
and the camera moves to his feet then pushesin on one particular street on the map further in on one red streetlight and we
the s city street now full sized buzzing with activity pedestrians hurrying to work cars and taxis and trucks whizzing through the street
sloan and wesley walk down the sidewalk passing streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in particular
the fraternitys grasp reaches every facet of the worlds major cities including their construction
look at this streetlight
wesley peers at it
there is a plaque affixed to the pole
the standard thing you find on these things
but then there is something different on this one
a tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque
the cerberus instead of the seal of the cit sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside revealing a hollow space behind it
he reaches his hand inside and pulls out a small handgun
flips out the clip expertly then racks the weapon
wesley cant believe it
you have stashes
just then two police officers walk by eye
the gun sloan has pulled out
sloan flashes his tattoo at them
keep moving fellas
they nod and do just that
they let us do our jobs we let them live
the camera pushes in on wesleys face as he realizes the full scope of this organization and we
wesley firing his imanishi on the shooting range steering the bullets wherever he wants them to go
impressed the gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the target making the angle all that much tougher
wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger but a pistol starts firing next to him
he looks over
sloan is standing nr o him firing at the target
every shot bends around the body and hits right in the forehead of the target
wesley smiles impressed
wesley thumbs through an old fraternity book which has detailed sketches of an assassination in th century paris
wesley working out on a heavy bag honing his punches the chef holding the bag for him muscles rippling
wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature city trying to memorize where the red marks are
wesley sitting here
being grilled by sloan as he tries to tell the undetectable lie
our job isnt just about how fast or true you shoot wesley
physical agility will always lose to mental agility
its warfare of the mind
fo s apart
wesley looking at fox through the bedroom door
wesley working with the butcher on the art of knife play
the gardener and fox show wesley the rooftop of a certain building on the model city one corner of the roof painted red
fox and the gardener now with wesley on that actual rooftop pointing out firing angles modes
of ascension and escape routes
the gardener moves over to a cornerstone in the roof of the building and then easily lifts it off revealing a stash of assault rifles
k shooting g
wesley looking at some ammunition while the gunsmith talks and demonstrates
he fires at one of the targets which explodes in a splattered mess and we cut to
fox making coffee as wesley sits studying the binder his mind racing
cross and my father were tight
but cross thought he should be one of the heads of the fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads
which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy
more reason for cross to die
wesley flips to the picture of cross
but i dont see jealousy in those eyes do you
fox walks over and slams the binder shut
to me wesley
in two weeks we have to kill henry helms
do you know who that is
the journalist whos got a price tag on his head
a price tag that were going to collect
your father was meeting with a fence about the job when cross took him down
so we can only assume cross knows about the target too
have to take cross out before we prosecute this mission
we cant have him out there as a wildcard wreaking havoc do you understand
weve never defaulted on a job and this k one wont be the first
sloan fires at the target the bullets following his every command
wesley does the same equally skilled
fox sits watching the two of them
is it becoming competitive
one shoots and then the other follows neither one ever missing
finally gunsmith runs the target back in to change out the body
fox leans back impressed
may have found your match sloan
sloan smirks and turns to instruct wesley
pick the weapon make the kill destroy the weapon
no other rules
wesley nods as gunsmith returns
to the gunsmith close the gap
push the body closer to the target
its already at four feet
your father couldnt even do that
wesley at some point closer
ill say when
gunsmith starts sliding the target closer to the body until its actually touching the back of the dead business man
how you gonna
just run it out there
let the kid work
the gunsmith shrugs and runs the target down the range
wesley looks at sloan
you wanna go first
there are limits to everything wesley
at some point the body becomes a shield
wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds lightning fast
the gunsmith brings the target back to them
a the business man is riddled with es
i guess not every rule can be broken
check the target
the gunsmith does and we see that each of the five bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found its mark on the target
youll find one entry below the shoulder missing the major blood vessels there exiting the back
second shot went through the abdomen clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly
third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen which is partially protected by the ribcage and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder
upper left abdomen is a good place where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street
and finally what i like to call the fk
number five entered the mouth was redirected downward by the upper jawbone on and exited the back of the neck
thats the shot youll find in the middle of the target
gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target
to sloan fuck the rules
with that he turns and walks away a look on his face that is his fiercest a far cry from the kid in the cubicle
that same expression is on his face as we
wesley strains against the ropes that bind his hands as the pharmacist waylays him
but is t e
wesley counts out the punches as he takes the shots
there is a look in wesleys eye we havent seen before a burning searing fire
as he continues to take punches and count them out
he pulls his arms tight and his muscles start to twitch and bulge muscles we didnt know he had until
now and as he continues to take punches wham
the rope strains against the wooden chair and we can hear the wooden legs start to pop until
wesley jerks his arms ee and comes swillcrincr with the broken of leg of the chair
the pharmacist goes down hard and wesley stands over him out of control
beating him with that broken chair leg
the camera pushes though one of the walls
to where fox and sloan are watching wesley pummel the pummeler through a one way mirror
the los k on foxs face becomes more and more and sexual until
she leans on top of wesley straddling him on too of her bed
they unleash on each other and from the looks of it fox makes cathy seem like a nun
dont you quit now baby
dont you quit now
wesley didnt know it could be like this
after they finish fox gets up and heads to the shower and he watches her go the whole way
in the doorway she turns around
sloan says youre ready
wesley site in a chair as fox crouches next to him with an advanced tattoo machine inking his hand
do you like being the only chick in the fraternity
who said i was the only sister
maybe you just havent met any others yet
playfully back maybe i have and im just not telling you
he settles down
how did you end up here fox
same way you did sugar
they found me
what did you do before
fox looks at him a wry smile on her face
at the mall
i cant see it
get in line
what made them come after you
i mean i know why im here
fraternity members all have something in their lineage that shows theyll be good at this
and yours is
my great great great grandfather on my mothers side
he was on a slave ship coming over from east africa and as it was pulling into charleston he killed every white man on the ship and swam to shore
they caught him and hung him four days later
motherfucker deserved it
be raped eight women in those four days
one of them was my great great great grandmama
she pushes her chair back done with her work
the camera pushes in as fox removes the device so we can take a look the three headed dog has been tattooed into his hand
wesley and fox walk down a crowded urban city street
the camera finds wesleys tattoo and then moves around behind fox and holds on hers
wheres the diablo
i got tired of the color
wesley cant help but smile then fox stops
theyre standing right in front of a car showroom displayed in the window is a midnight black porsche convertible sitting in a showroom window
us like the one wesleys father smashed in foxs story
suddenly the car comes flying out of the window glass shattering everywhere as it tears up the street
being a member of the fraternity was like winning the lottery
traffic lights mean nothing as wesley mashes the accelerator to the mat and the porsche responds ripping up the road like a tiger on the prowl
fox rises up in the passenger seat looking over the windshield the wind whipping her face
this is what my dads life was like
he was a fucking god
he weaves in and out of traffic then rips around a corner narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen wheeler which has to slam on its brakes
where we headed
trial by fire sugar
hook a right
wesley whips the car around a corner
park it here baby
he pulls the car to the side of the street
in front of a busy outdoor mall
its covered with shops eateries movie theaters and people people people
fox eyes the crowd
you need a new wardrobe or something
were here for a reason and it aint clothes shopping
somewhere in that crowd is your first target
shakes her head the real thing
whos the mark
youll know him when you see him
what if i dont
then you get shot
fox hands him his imanishi pistol which wesley rolls over in his hand
its graduation day baby
i he nods and makes his way toward
where he quickly mingles with the crowd
he has his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt the pistol inside
people pass him on his left and right some make eye contact some dont
anybody could be the target
wesleys eyes scan to the rooftops surveying
the security guard by the theater the sweater folder at the gap the scary looking guy shopping at the sunglasses stand
and then wesleys eyes settle on someone he was not expecting to see
barry his best friend that was shagging his girlfriend
is thumbing through books outside the barnes and noble
not paying attention to whats around him
wesley cant believe it
it cant be him
just then barry stops looking at the books and starts walking toward wesley keeping his eyes down
fuck this cant really be happening
wesley gets ready both hands inside that front pocket
and now barry meets his eyes
wesley cant believe itl thanks for calling me
i wanted to say
wesley pulls out his gun and barry throws up his hands
but now we see wesley is looking past b arry
over his shoulder
and hes looking at a man we recognize from his office
hes approaching rapidly behind barry fisting a pair of pistols
just as barry hits the deck wesley pulls the trigger
but it lust clicks the chamber empty
fox holds the clip to wesleys imanishi tapping it in her hand
holy shit she gave him an empty gun
wesley cant believe his gun is empty
in the split second that it takes him to realize this the consultant has his guns leveled taking aim but
wesley moves faster than we thought he could move
he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel and dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street
the consultant chases after him knocking shoppers out of the way sending fanny packs and nordstrom bags flying
wesley hooks a right around a sharper image and heads straight down a narrower section like hes on a mission knowing exactly where hes going
and now we see why
because the city around us goes stark white like the mg room
were seeing what wesley sees what hes memorized in all those hours staring at the model
finally we see one small bench next to a fountain which is bright red
immediately the natural color of the city c ws back and wesley is running all out for that bench
he goes into a slide hitting the grass
underneath the bench sliding under it popping up on the other side
he rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does revealing an automatic pistol
and just as quickly hes up on one knee aiming using the bench as a shield as the consultant rushes up surprised and bam
bam the consultant drops where he is three bullets hitting him in his two shoulders and his chest
people start screaming and running the hell away from the gunplay
wesley is about to run away himself but when he turns fox is right there beside him
a couple of security guards are with her smiling as well
wesley looks over at the consultant who site up smiling too even though hes bleeding from three spots on his body
pin shot bullets
wesley looks down at the gun
just like my father used on you
fox nods as the security guards go to help the consultant to his feet
you were watching me in the office
protecting our assets
she hands the clip from the imanishi over to wesley
time to do this for real
wesley and fox walk down a long hallway toward a single doorway
they open it revealing
a large office with a single desk and a roaring fire
sloan turns from the fire to greet them
he holds up the mole bullet and smiles
the mole bullet is made by a midget t filipino named pek war
his fingers are so small that they can shape and smooth the metal better than anyone
youve known all along
you knew before i ever broke the urn
i had to let you figure it out for yourself
part of my training
part of your quest
to get to know your father
and his killer
wesley nods a grave expression on his face like he knows what he is going to do next
pek war charges exorbitant prices as much as ten thousand dollars for a single round but his craftsmanship is unparalleled
he heads over to wesley hands him a slip of paper
you can find him at this address
a three foot seven inch asian man site at a worktable with his little legs dangling over the end of his chair
war is concentrating hard on the metal in his hands
the diminutive man looks up from his worktable when he hears a loud thump
he gets no answer
he remains perfectly still listening
l two louder thumps and a gunshot jerk his head around
then hes up out of the chair faster than we thought a little man could move
breathing ragged shimmying across his work space pek war hurries over to a chest of drawers
he gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal a stash of handguns
he reaches for one
but the muzzle off a pistol comes ue to the back of his head and the hammer clicks as it is pulled back
pek war throws his hands up
alam man lamangl alam man lamangl wesley signals for him to turn around
after he does
alam man lamang
wesley measures him with eyes that have gone hard
fox stands over wesleys shoulder loving every moment of this
there are two things about you im sure of right now little man
one is that you can speak english
pek war sees that wesley means business
perfect english and whats the other
that my nutsack is bigger than you
what do you want
a bullet you made killed his father
the bullet maker looks as though he knew a day like this might eventually come
his face falls and he looks
at his feet
i only mold the ammunition
i cannot be responsible for the way it is
wesley smashes him in the face with the butt of his gun then grabs a long metal stiletto type tool from the work table
youre as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself
im only going to ask you one question and i want you to think very hard how you want to answer
with that wesley sticks the stiletto into pek wars side
the blade is in only an inch or so
the little man starts jabbering to god in some foreign language
see ive learned a thing or two about human anatomy recently
in fact this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal cartilage of your tenth rib
just a little push and it will deflate your lung
thats called a pneumothorax
v helluva way to go suffocating in aroom full of fresh air
plus the sound the sound of all that oxygen hissing out of your lung
pssssssh like a balloon at a birthday party
enough to make a man beg for a second chance
but youre only going to have one
pek war waits trying not to writhe from the pain
so my question is
how do i find cross
pek wars eyes go wide pleading
my clients use middlemen i dont meet them in person i know so little about them
wesley twitches the handle just a bit
okayl okayl dammitl god damiaitl ill tell you
wesley lets up a little bit
fox snatches up a nearby phone
the porsche once again tears across the asphalt as wesley drives
wesley you gotta know something
no matter what kind of training youve done these last few weeks killing your first well thats gonna change you forever
wesley drives for a while
you know what my foster mother
told me when i was six years old
fox shakes her head
she caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime
i knew i wasnt supposed to but i was so damn hungry and it was just some fucking jello
anyway after she hit me so hard i couldnt bite down straight for a week she told me
she told me that god had killed my parents because i was such a wicked boy
someone needs to find that bitch and set her straight
so i grew up thinking i was the reason i never knew my parents
but now to find out that no my father didnt give me up because he had died
he gave me up because he was protecting me
well i guess i want to give him something back
here we are
they are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses one of which has the words times herald on it
newspaper delivery trucks make their way in and out of the loading dock area of this building
overhead an el train scrapes along the worn tracks
fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley so they can have a view of the corner in front of them
wesley scans the area quickly
not very discreet are they
fox smiles knowingly and looks up revealing what wesley is talking about
on various rooftops we see figures peering down
looking over the site
the others are only backup singers
this is your show
fox subtly moves her head and figures disappear crouching down
just then out the windshield they see a man wearing a long black overcoat approaching the corner near the newspaper building
foxs eyes start to dance
remember hes good baby
but youre the best ive ever seen
wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car
from a distance wesley approaches cross from the back
his steps become quicker getting closer every passing second
wesley starts to reach in his coat for his gun
and thats when cross firesl quick as lightning cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a nearby warehouse
his bullet has the instincts of a bird dog and it curves over the edge of the building and finds its mark causing a crouching assassin to plunge from the
roof to the street near wesley
the others on the rooftops hail down bullets as cross disappears into the nearest building the times herald
wesley and fox run toward the building as three other fraternity members beat them there the bellman the waiter and the electrician
wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then start inside the building
the minute bellman exposes himself in the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside his bloody body falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock
wesley and fox join the other two on the dock as screaming workers run from the place
we need a way in there
lets find another door
hell be long gone by then
shaking her head hes got the high ground
wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock
on the pallet
they all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the lift
wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs into the warehouse the four assassins safely crouching on the pallet on the front
the lowest level is the loading dock where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await
the electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes eyes darting guns drawn
he backs up to a pallet of stacked newspapers using it as cover
what he doesnt realize is that between each stack of papers is a space just big enough for a thwap
a bullet finds its way through the space and hits the electrician in the back of the shoulder spinning him around
close on cross gun
another shot and we follow the bullet across the dock and dipping low into the next space in the paper stack right where electrician is now leaning
the bullet buries in his eye sending him to the flog
wesley sees cross race for a set of stairs
just as wesley is about to cut him down cross fires at a wooden beam holding back some massive rolls of newspaper
the rolls tumble over and wesley has to dive out of the way allowing cross to escape up the stairs
wesley fox and the waiter all race for the stairs
giant printing machines are running full speed printing up the morning edition
a group of newspaper employees see the guns the fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety
wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring machines
to the waiter stay here and cover us
theres no angle for him to hit you if you stay here
wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the machines
dont let him get up there
and stay clear of the presses
hell use them however he can
how do you know
its what id do
with that wesley and fox disappear amongst the machinery
the waiter takes a step back from the press where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second
he sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding
everything looks clear until
shots ring out and a shelf o w a l o waiters head gives way
he turns to see a bunch of cans of spray lubricant falling to the floor
no big deal until cross shoots one of them out of the air causing it to explode
the burning oil covers the waiter who screams and stumbles nearer the printing press
more shots from cross and one of the restraining arms on the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half
the paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a
saw cuts the waiter in hplf
with a leap cross is on the scaffolding over the presses
for just a second cross stops as he locks eyes with wesley
but fox is already firing at him so cross has to keep moving
he heads up a second staircase but not before he sends a stream of bullets back at fox who athletically cartwheels away
but one of crosss bullets disintegrates a gear on the press near her sending flying metal everywhere
a piece of shxapnel b ies into foxs leg
making her break out of her cartwheel and flop down wounded
cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a door
keep goin baby
wesley races for the stairs
he is the only one left to chase cross to level three
wesley bursts through the door guns ready
the place is already in pandemonium with people yelling and screaming and running for cover
quickly wesley realizes hes in the business offices of the paper and it looks surprisingly similar to his old office
lame ass cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere
wesley jumps up on a desk
unafraid cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of the office
without hesitation wesley opens fire at cross
who immediately returns fire
and his bullets actually collide with crosss by ets in mid air
the bullets ricochet and take out a computer screen where someone was playing solitaire
the two assassins blast away all while diving and moving over and in the cubicles
cross has a gun similar to the imanishis and they each steer their bullets at each other from sharp angles
the first bullet collision was not blind luck but the pattern for the battle
they are fighting the same fight their bullets meeting in the middle each man using the same techniques at the exact same time
wesley needs an angle and spots a dry erase board the words action items written on it
he fires at it and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them strikes cross in the shoulder
cross cant believe hes hit but he doesnt have time to flinch
right as wesley fires again he turns barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby window smashing the glass out
wesley doesnt hesitate behind him
he sprints for the same window and dives through it guns at the ready and
we stay with wesley as he falls from the third floor firing his guns the whole time
until he lands top of an l train moving at ll speed
fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to the porsche
she ignores her wounds and rips the car out of the alley chasing after the fleeing l train
ahead of wesley cross is also on the top of the train
he manages to get up spin around and fire at wesley
but they both have to duck as the l train whips under an overpass which misses smashing both of them by mere inches
cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars and enter one of the l cars
wesley hurries across the top of the train spying the trail of blood that cross is leaving behind from his wound
wesley smiles a shark on a wounded baby seal as he also swings down between the cars and enters
where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way down the center of the empty car and out the back door
wesley hovers in the entry way his guns up and ready
he takes a step forward to follow the blood trail and immediately he is decked from the side by an ambushing cross
they tumble over the first row of seats both losing their guns
wesley kicks cross off of him but cross spins with two new suns in his hand
on him quick though and slams cross into one of the trains windows hard enough to crack it
with a quick twist of cross wrist wesley takes a sun from him just as cross kicks h m off
wesley fires as he falls backwards
cross falls backwards too from the momentum
and they both smash out opposite windows of the train before landing on either side of it
but the amazing thing is
they stand up and keep firing as the cars are whipping by at mph and realize they
are timing their shots to actually blast between each car in the s it second the opening passes
commuters ride along in blissful ignorance reading their papers holding on to the handrails
completely unaware of the gunfight raging outside the train
a bullet whizzes through an open window pierces a businessmans paper and exits a window on the opposite side of the car
the man sticks his finger through the hole unaware of the battle outside
what the hell
on opposite sides of the train wesley and cross are both sprinting and firing trying to get to the end of the last train while dodging each others bullets
as the last car passes they each jump on the tracks ending u with guns tucked under each others chin
this takes wesley aback
look into my eyes
wesleys finger is starting to squeeze his trigger
as is crosss
growls in pain look into my eyes goddammit
finally wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees himself reflected in crosss dupils
just then fox pulls up in the porsche about fifty yards away and her headlights illuminate them
cross shifts his eyes to her then does a curious thing he lowers his gun then drops it to the ground
wesley cant believe cross would leave himself defenseless
moving swiftly cross men tucks something into the rocket of wesleys hooded sweatshirt
everything they told you was a lie wesley
cross falls down
his black jacket spills open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder but to hig n too
one of wesleys bullets through the train must have found its mark
cross is bleeding profusely
he gasps a couple of times
then with his last bit of energy
find the missing piece
dispose of the weapon
with that the life goes out of crosss eyes
wesley stares at that face trying to decipher some meaning there
but cross just stares blankly back at him just as fox comes limping up
you did it baby
son of a bitch you did it
you put down motherfucking cross
wesley looks down and sees some of crosss blood on his hands from their clench
there is also some on the gun he is holding
ar h d ed crun
wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl handled gun from where it dropped and looks over them both
whatd he say to you
wesley looks up sees some sort of anticipation in foxs eyes
he looks back down at crosss body
he said pies on the fraternity
fox measures him like shes not sure if hes telling the whole story
finally she nods
damn i couldnt be more proud of you baby
lets go lay this on sloan
i think i need
a minute to myself
its your first kill
ill wait for you
naah thats all right
you need to get stitched up
ill meet you at that korean place
but hes already walking off
she watches him go thinking
wesley walks down the street
people instinctively get out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk
then he pulls out what cross slipped inside his pocket a beaten up copy of count of onte cristo
in fact theres no mistake its the same copy he had as a kid
wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the cover
printed on the inside in a steady hand are the words i left you something
wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a harley at a curb
he bee lines for the guy
wesley now blazes down the highway pushing the harley to its limits
his angry expression hasnt dissipated
the harley pulls up to a lower middle class house the kind you might find in any run down suburb
kids run around the neighborhood playing
wesley sits and looks at one particular house
he climbs offand heads to the side of the house still carrying his book
he ducks through a broken chain link fence and moves down the side of the house
until he finds a familiar wooden board
familiar because weve seen this place before its where he lived when he was a foster kid
he removes the board then reaches into the hole
his hand seizes on something
from the hole he withdraws a key attached to a note with an address on it north highbury st
wesleys eyes move from the copy of monte cristo to the key and back to the book
finally he lowers his hands
revealing a little eight year old kid watching him curiously from the back yard
you live here
the kid nods again
he tosses the kid the book and heads off
he pulls the harley over to a curb and then reaches into his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key
across the street the address matches n
the place looks like a concrete fortress
no windows just a large iron door in front
wesley approaches not sure what the address could mean
he gets to the door looking for a key hole but he doesnt find one
he fidgets there awkwardly for a second but then
the door opens revealing a woman anna
she takes a look at wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her lips
come in wesley
he stares at her trying to figure this out
and finds that the place is nicely decorated an attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker
anna is now trying to hold back tears but cant
hes dead isnt he
theres no point lying to this woman
she nods knowingly sadly
he told me if he didnt come back
it would be you who pulled the trigger
a he killed my father
anna looks at him confused
but then realization sets in
i think you need to meet someone
she leads wesley into another room where a five year old boy plays the floor
this is your brother
wesleys not sure what to make of this
but both of you you are both percent your
ive seen that from the beginning
andrew is busy playing with a couple of black toy buildings on the floor
wesley studies the little guy still confused
he was with you the whole time
wesley looks up and sees what shes referring to
the walls are filled with pictures of andrew anna and
photoaraths of wesley at various ages w hgn he was growing u
this was his favorite
she hands him a picture of wesley at about age sitting with his back to a tree reading count of monte cristo
the picture has been taken through a windshield across the street
wesley reels his legs give out he slumps against one of the walls
flash cross firing at fox and wesley at the grocery store
but now we see that fox positioned wesley between herself and the shooter
he wasnt trying to hit wesley he was trying to separate him from her
wesley thinking remembering
flash wesley studying crosss face in the file seeing that there isnt jealousy in those eyes
wesley still slumped against the wall surrounded by pictures of himself
flash wesley reflected in crosss pupils
cross was his father
wesley looks up at annas kind face
when your father and i found each other when we had andrew he said he could no longer live the way he had been living
he said he wouldnt give us up the way he had given up his first eon
wesley stares at the picture
he cant believe he was being watched back when he felt so alone
it was his greatest regret
she leaves him in the room alone with his brother
wesley watches the kid trying to process it all
for the first time emotions overcome him and he breaks down
but hes too tough now to sob so he forces the bob down in his throat and blinks back the tears
goddamn he has a brother
he walks up behind anna who is sipping some coffee at a kitchen table red eyed
would you like some coffee
wesley sets the key down on the table
do you know what this opens
a lone keyhole in a solid closet door
wesley sticks the key in and swings the door open revealing a long black coat just like his fathers
i guess its not much of an inheritance
he left me more than this
wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm
i want you to know that he forgave you before you ever pulled the trigger
he tried to keep you out of it for so long
why didnt he just tell me
once they had you
he couldnt risk it unless you were alone
he knew his one shot at telling you might be his last
her eyes harden a little bit
you have to finish what he was doing wesley
its the only way any of us will ever be free
especially your brother
they wont stop hunting us
your father knew that
ill be back as soon as this is over
you have family here
wesley nods these words meaning so much to him
fox eats in a small restaurant in the heart of koreatown the kind of place that has the hot hibachi grills on the s table tops
the place is mostly empty quiet with mainly korean faces both dining and serving
its the kind of place where you can eat and not be bothered
the doors swing open and fox looks up
the silhouette of e i ure in the dogjlwm is disturbing a familiar person in a long black coat
she squints the setting sunlight nearly blinding her as all she can see is a silhouette
for a second there i thought you looked just like cross
wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table as fox lights up a cigarette
skipped the hospital
he picked me clean and i dont care much for needles
she blows out a lungful of smoke and watches as it rises toward the ceiling
sloans on his way
one of the waiters waves to her to put out her smoke and she just stares him down
the man backs off nodding and smiling
you want something to eat baby
im all right
they got some good shit
wont fill you up too much if youre watching your calories
well the big man should be here any minute
listen can i ask you a question
baby you can ask me anything you want
he focuses on her eyes zeroing in on the pupils
did you know cross was my father
did you know
tight on those pupils
whatre you talking about wesley
cross killed your father
we see her pupil swell just a tiny bit
he saw it
exactly what sloan told him to look for when someone is lying
and from the look on foxs face she knows he saw it
she stabs out her cigarette crushing it on the hot grill so that it sizzles
whyd you have to ask me that
with that she kicks back from the table holding a huge black smith and wesson revolver
wesley only has a millisecond to respond and he does by kicking over the table which sends food and utensils flying but also shields him from foxs bullets
just as quickly fox leaps up on top of one of the other tables trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her feet dont touch the hot
if shes wounded we wouldnt know it
wesley does the same on a nearby table
they take shots at each other as they leap from table to table avoiding the sizzling centers but theyre both so quick that no bullets find their mark
then fox takes a running leap at him moving ferociously fast
shes like the animal shes named after and she launches off one of the tables
and catches wesley flush kno in him backwards a form tackle on to a table
where he lands quare on the oven top
and his guns go flying across the room as
the table to starts to burn through his clothes
you shoulda known better baby
but he rolls over taking fox with him and now the oven is burning into her back
with all her strength she bucks him off and then flips herself backwards off the table
with another kick she sends the hot table flying at him
it rips free from its wiring and the nozzle sprays gas out into the restaurant
wesley knocks the flying table out of the way but not before it burns his arm as he blocks it
spotting his guns he sprints for them as fox unleashes a hailstorm of bullets
but hes too damn fast and he dives across the floor pete rose style sliding to a stop at the precise moment where his hands come u holsling his weapons
one fluid motion he flips back over and eam
shoots bullets up in the air and then flicks his wrists so they arc over at the open gas nozzle
the bullets strike it sparking and then boom
fireball b sts from nozzle while a great riume of sweltering fire keeps pouring out
fox dives to get out of the way which gives wesley the opening he was looking for
he fires again and one of his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in the side of the face
she stops seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off her chin
this only seems to enrage her
pissed she produces two s r guns out of the small of her bac where she had them hidden we have no idea and charges wesley like an unleashed pit
shes firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks this time knocking wesleys guns out of his hands from where he lies flat on the floor
shes disarmed him and now hes defenseless
and fox stands over him breathing hard her face bleeding both gun barrels pointed right at wesleys face
i gotta admit baby
she starts to squeeze both the triggers
i thought we might have a future
but wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she reels
in the same motion he grabs her wrists and pulls her toward him
taking her guns right out of her hands like a quick change artist
flipping them over foxs face full of surprise is the last expression shell ever have because
most of foxs face is blown clean fr her head and a blood mess s ra s a oss the wall
wesley leans his head back and closes his eyes the spume of fire flickering brightly against his lids the events of the last several hours washing over him
for several moments there is nothing but darkness and a silence as permanent as death
theres a town in germany called leverkusen that had a bear hunter named hans koblenz
sloan the butcher and the pharmacist walk across the parking lot toward the door of the smoking bar b que joint
during his life he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the rhine
you want to know how he died
a pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village mauled his wife killed his twin daughters and then lied in wait for him to get back
from the woods
the fire is out but it has blackened the inside of the joint so that it looks like an absolute war zone
fox is in the same position as when wesley shot her but theres a sheet of paper folded on her chest
the butcher and the pharmacist flank sloan as he approaches the body frowning
when the hunter opened the door they ripped his throat out before he could scream
the two bears then curled up on the rug lw in the middle of the floor the rug that had once been their father and proceeded to bite
each other till they bled to death
sloan reaches down and picks up the paper and sees beneath it that pearl handled revolver
the one with the blood on the handle
thats a true story
he unfolds it to read printed in black ink on the paper sloan folds the paper back up and looks at the blood on the gun
wesley stands in the slaughterhouse holding two pistols looking around
the place has been cleaned out
theres no sign of the butcher
same thing at the pharmacy an empty store now
and in the fraternitys library nothing
all the books are gone
wesley processes this frowning
he keeps walking to the
where the entire model city has been destroyed like a giant has trampled it beneath its feet
wesley stoops over and pulls one smashed building out of the mess looking at it thinking thinking
and then hes up and moving quickly
anna opens the door for wesley who looks like he is on to something
he was working on a plan right
i dont know
there was so much he wanted to keep away from us
wesley moves into andrews roan
where the boy is still playing with the black model buildings
wesley moves over and crouches down next to andrew
can i see that for a second
the boy hands him the building in his hand
it is painted jet black except for one corner of the first floor which is painted red
wesley looks up at anna
do you know where he got this
anna leads wesley down some wooden steps into crosss basement
sure enough the entire floor of the basement has been made into a model map similar to the one that the fraternity used in the map room but all the
buildings are black with an occasional red mark
the scale is larger the model shows only one section of the city and a blue line indicates a route through the streets
and on the wall are pictures and clippings of henry helms
wesley squats over it trying to figure out what his fathers plan was
he sees a missing place for a building and puts andrews toy back in place then studies the map some more
i does this mean anything to you
there are large question marks painted on various buildings along the helms route
my god hes been planning it from the beginning
this is a fraternity hit
set up henry helms as bait knowing sloan would use his best men for the job
he was going to take them all out
wesley looks at it some more
only he didnt know where on the route they would try and hit helms
thats the missing piece he was t rying to figure out
do you know the answer to that
wesley looks up at her resolve on his face
but i know who does
a lump in a bed stirs
the lump stirs a little more
nicole the hot girl from wesleys office moves to her peephole and looks out but theres no one there
she opens the door and gives a quick look down the hall then shuts it and hurries to her kitchen
she starts to open a cabinet but stops gasps and jerks back scared shitless
wesley is in her kitchen lust a few feet away
she looks at him
seeing who it is wesley
is that you
he looks bruised and battered but there is a hardness to his eyes
its me nicole
what happened to you
wesley wipes his eyebrow with his thumb like hes considering what he wants to say next
i asked you once if you thought i was an observant person
she doesnt understand
but suddenly we
that meeting room from his old job
in fact its a replay of that same scene
wesley is still sitting there with his note pad the words life sucks and then you die printed over and over while the consultant continues to rattle on and on
through the blinds behind the speaker wesley spots the hot intern nicole still talking on the phone
and just like before hes zeroing in on her but this time we keep zeroing in and zeroing in until we see something we didnt see before
nicole reaches up over the counter to grab a stack of papers and her shirt pulls slightly up from her back
and that tattoo of cerberus
a three headed
log is printed there in the exact same place fox had
and we keep zeroing in on it and zeroing in on it until we
where fox is tattooing his hand again and we get another taste of that conversation they had
who said i was the only sister
maybe you just havent met any others yet
playfully back maybe i have and im just not telling you
and now with the gift of hindsight we see that wesley meant what he said and we
wesley still stands there just a few feet away from her
sloan didnt just have one person in my office watching me he had two
what are you talking about
what name do you go by
he points at her tattoo
because i know you have the mark
nicoles face changes goes hard like someone flipped a switch
like lightning she grabs for a butchers knife but wesley is faster
he pins her wrist back twisting until she drops the knife
she lunges again but a pistol comes up right below her chin
wheres the henry helms hit going down
sloans not your biggest problem fuckface
she reaches over slowly so he knows shes not going to go for a knife
and she turns on a small television sitting on the kitchen counter
the screen comes to life showing an inf mercial for the f obe
nicole shakes her head and
flips up the channels
and now we see what she wanted to show him
wesleys employee photo fills the screen above a reporters head while the reporter babbles in a serious voice
responsible for several recent shootings including one tonight at this korean restaurant downtown and another at an outdoor mall
details are sketchy but we repeat if you see this man please contact
she starts cycling through the news channels
and each one shows
different reporters standing outside the smoking bar b que or talking about wesley or speaking with police
one is even interviewing wesleys old boss janice who is very happy for the forum
he was aggressive toward me and other employees
a very negative person extremely negative
i cant even repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go
dispose of the weapon
and the cops were told to watch this place too
you have nowhere to go
hes smarter than you
hell feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the fraternity has pulled in the last ten years
ignoring her im only going to ask you one more time
where can i find him
you wont get to him
the cops will be here any second
wesley reaches over and cranks up a gas burner the menacing flame on high
then this is going to get painful quickly
she stares at that blue flame fear in her eyes for the first time
he starts pushing her head toward it closer and closer
where is it going down
the first scream from nicole is lost in
the door to nicoles apartment smashes open and four cops burst through the door guns ready
they spread out quickly checking out the place
one of the disappears into the kitchen
sirens wail and a helicopter hovers nearby as wesley stands on a roof looking down on the scene
he sees emts roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as cops cover every inch of the ground
from where he is it looks like every cop in the city is here
one cop looks up and sees a figure on the roof long jacket blowing in the breeze
what the fuck
what is it
the first cop points up toward wesley on the roof
into the radio air support can you get a beam on the four story southeast of our position
quickly a spotlight lights up the spot where wesley was standing but now we see its iust an air conditioning vent with soave loose streamers flapping off of it
damn it looked just like wesley a moment ago
on the radio negative roof is clean
wesley steps out of a dark doorway his hard eyes following a police car as it roars by without noticing him
he pulls his jacket collar up puts on
a skull cap and takes off in the opposite direction away from the scene
he passes a newspaper dispenser but the camera stays
on the front page which is still talking about henry helms
the camera holds on a photograph of helms which
where henry helms himself is tying a tie in a hotel mirror
hes a handsome enough guy distinguished even but he looks tired like the weight of living under a death threat has dragged him down
a door opens and we see his wife sarah helms step past two huge bodyguards to come in
the car is here
a gaggle of large bodyguards surround the helmses as they hurry out of a side door and make it into a limousine
they notice the half dozen motorcycle cops positioned around their limo
a lead bodyguard holds the limo door for them
re the cops whats all this
were not taking any chances
he shuts the door for them before climbing behind the steering wheel
the limo starts to make its way down the drive flanked in front and in back by dark suburbans and the motorcycle cops
commercial ships cruise up and down a river under an expansive bridge
sitting next to the incline to the bridge is an abandoned four story building what used to be
a a guy looks down at the street with his binoculars
its the gunsmith
into a radio nothing yet sir
on another tall building sloan talks into a radio
hold until i give the word
he clicks off the radio and looks into his palm where es holding that pearl handled aun fingering the dried blood
the suburbans and cops flank the limo as it rolls through the concrete jungle
the bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for anything
henry helms reaches over and grabs his wifes hand a reassuring gesture
but his white knuckles betray his trepidation
the driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the east side of the river
they make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the bridge
traffic is sparse and they look like they have an easy clear passing
the gunsmith sits waiting patiently
sloan watches the limo starting to approach the bridge
into the radio here comes the car
any minute now
take your positions
sloan leans out over the edge of his building gun ready
on the hospital roof the gunsmith puts down his binoculars and picks up a rifle
the pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and looks down high powered rifle in his hand
on another building the chef does the same
and on still another building the gardener also gets ready
each killer is in a different spot and has a gun pointed and ready just waiting for the signal
the limo is about halfway up the incline now a sitting duck hellfire about to rain down upon it
the gunsmith waits waits waits
and then out of nowhere surprising the hell out of him a knife is held to his neck from behind
the gunsmith doesnt even so much as swallow as the blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop of blood
the camera moves to the side to show wesley crouched right behind him a look of icy determination on his face as he holds the knife in place
the name is cross
in the distance the helms limo moves on safely
looks like you missed your chance
now where is sloan
the gunsmith feels the edge in wesleys voice
you dont understand man
this aint about helms
the intern told you right where to go
im just the decoy
the camera whips around behind wesley
to show that three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect pattern
and now we see it this was al a bet up to get wesley in the open
the three surrounding rooftops slightly more elevated hold each of the three assassins crouched in sniper positions zeroed in on wesleys back
but instead of surprise wesley just leans in closer to the gunsmiths ear
she told me that too
and with that he rolls the o over of just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash a hail of bullets
the gunsmith takes a dozen shots all in the chest but none of the bullets make it through the gunsmiths body
shouldve studied your anatomy fellas
wesley fires back indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops lying on his back using the
dead assassins body as a shield
quickly he bucks the gunsmiths body off of him and scampers for a nearby stairwell
the assassinb all disappear from their positions and head to the street
wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the front door of the building
he clicks the empty cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he hears a sickening sound behind him
the sound of two knife blades being rubbed together
and wesley turns to f the butcher there waiting for the butcher quickly hurls a knife which buries in the fleshy part of wesleys shoulder wesley ignores it and fires
i l the butcher deflects them with the knives in his hands wesley goes to fire again but his firing chambers recoil showing that he is out of ammo
the butchers eyes go wide
like i told you
the blade will always live on
i remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth
wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out the kniz in his shoulder
they charge each other the blades whizzing and clanging off each other as each tries to gain an edge
the fight spills out the front door and into
the two men slashing ducking and moving in the middle of the street
wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosilthe butchers face and forehead filling his eyes with blood
the butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming on to his hands
he tries to wipe the blood from his eyes but its just getting worse
i cant see
but you can hear
so hear this to cut the subclavian artery hold the knife ice pick style
wesley lunges and the butcher is defenseless to stop it
and thrust down behind the clavicle cutting side to side
he does just as he describes and the big guy topples over as his gore spills out into the street
but before he can gloat wesley realizes his new predicament
hes standing in the middle of the street and at one end is the chef and at the other is the gardener
to make things worse directly across the street from wesley is the pharmacist and each has a gun on him
three on one mate
youre out of ammo
and youre in a part of the map with no fraternity stashes
thats what id call a real ball ache
for a moment wesley stands there sizing up the situation
his eyes swivel from the gardener to the chef to the pharmacist
just then the buildings ound all of them go black
just like in crosss model
wesleys eyes fall on the on the red corner of the nearest building a cement block making up a decorative support column in front of it
im working off of a different map
with that the world goes back its natural colorb and he races for the building jumping up onto and over a lexus parked at the curb
the three assassins fire relentlessly at him but their bullets slam into the car smashing it to bits
on the other side of it wesley goes into a slide just as he reaches that cement block
affixed to it is a small silver crossi wesley slaps his hand on the cross and the cement block mechanically opens revealing a new pair of sophisticated ma ishis i
as his adversaries converge on him wesley takes the guns spins splits both hands apart and we
to follow both of his bullets in flight
the bullet from the left gun heads for the chef
he tries to drop down but the bullet curves downward it pierces his body
we see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs exit his side and head for the pharmacist while
the bullet from the right gun heads for the gardener who moves fast to fire his own gun but the bullet catches him in the wrist knocking his gun out
of his hand and
it hits the gardeners scaphoid bone ricocheting out also right at the pharmacist
just as the two bullets come together
hitting the pharmacist on both sides of his head before he can even react
wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of the pharmacists head as he falls to the asphalt dead
but wesleys not through he moves over to the gardener and rolls him over
where is he
where it started
wesley ends it for the gardener
weve seen this place before
its the same roof where cross took out the second head of the door is kicked open and wesley walks out eyes blazing
sloan is waiting for standing t feet away holding his fathers pearl handled gun trained right on wesleys head
cant say i dont have a sense of irony
the place i first decided to bring you in
wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops
you once asked why i helped hide you as an infant
it gave me power wesley
power to become a head of the fraternity
power over your father
and ultimately it gave me you the perfect weapon to kill your father
but now you have to dispose of the weapon
in some ways it pains me to do so
you are like the son i never had
sloans eyes narrow
keep your worthless dignity
youre still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago
wesley continues to bleed taking this in
sloan laughs derisively
you cant win wesley
the fraternity is everywhere
even if you kill me others will come from other cities to take my place
youll be hunted your whole life
but thats not gonna happen
like i told you before when we are called death is as certain as the sun
wesley stands as straight as he can muster
the two men face each other like two gunmen on main street in dodge city
an old newspaper even blows through like a tumbleweed
and we are close on wesleys face
act it i the same shot from the opening of the movie
six weeks ago i was ordinary and pathetic
we see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm reaching into his sleeve
but not today
with that he nulls out the matching pearl handled gun the twin brother of the one sloan is holding and they both open fire
wesley shoots sloans bullets out of the air and sloan does the same
just like he did with h father
but sloan is good and one of the bullets finds its mark hitting wesley ssmarely in the same arm that took the knife
he cant raise his arm its useless but hes come too damn far to stop now
he flips his gun from his good hand to his bad hand and manages to keep firing
then wesley does something unexpected
he starts sprinting straight at sloan still knocking his bullets out of the air
he closes the gap
a surprised and worried expression now spreads on sloans face
like what is this kid doing
but wesley is not stopping he shoots the gun out of sloans hand and then closes on him tackling him off his feet
they go flying right over the edge of the building
wesleys able to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself
but sloan is going to go over
at the last moment sloan reacher
and grabs one handed the barrel of wesleys gun
for a moment they dangle there in this precarious position looking each other in the face
sloan cant believe hes been bested by this kid
go ahead and shoot me killer
just like you did your old man
wesleys finger starts to squeeze the trigger but then he smiles
im done with this life
just like my father
and with that wes gy drops the n out of his h we watch sloans body fall through the sky
down down down
until it smashes into the sidewalk splattering like a grapefruit
wesley rolls over on to his back looking up at the darkening sky
six weeks ago i was ordinary and pathetic
just like you
he sits up moving out of frame
the place is now blanketed with cops looking at the dead bodies trying to make sense of what happened
but ive learned something in that time
ive learned about the man who made me
cope stand on the street handing out pictures of wesley asking pedestrians if theyve seen this man
ive learned about the man i am
patrons stand in line at a post office but thecamera pushes past them finding a black and white wanted poster of wesley describing all the killings hes responsible for
it holds tight on the picture
ive learned that all of us are unique even though sometimes were too fucking blind to see it
the door to the safehouse opens and anna wesley and andrew step out into the bright sunlight
wesley is carrying his little brother
they turn and head up the street toward the eastern sun
the camera rises up up up where it hovers for a minute
and just when we think it is going to leave the planet
and i learned the easiest place to hide is in plain sight
it comes back down down down until it finds
wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another cubicle maze pecking away at his keyboard
a sign attached to one wall reads san angelo insurance associates setting the bar highl office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties wishing they were anywhere else
a pretty receptionist comes over to wesleys desk
youre the new guy huh
just started last week
whered you move here from
all over the place really
nothing too exciting
well welcome to the team
just watch out for brokaw
hell stab you in the back first chance he gets
just then a harried man brokaw comes storming up
jesus connie dont you have some faxes to get to
the receptionist hurries away making a face as she does
laziest skirt i ever hired
but nice fun bags ill give her that
he leans over wesleys desk right in his space
listen jim i dont want to get started off on the wrong foot here but we
have numbers to make and if we dont make those numbers its my ass on the line
and if my ass gets chewed out by regional i can guarantee
that your ass is gonna be purina doggy chow
now im not sure how they ran things
wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and further until the words become gibberish just like they did with janice
wesley catches himself and snaps out of it just in time to hear
so do we understand each other
with that he hurries away his pants riding so high up his ass that they look like they may burst at any second
wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor it reads
he stands up stretches and makes his way to the receptionists desk
she looks up bites her lower lip
you want to take a break with me
she stands and they move toward the elevators waiting for the doors to open
you know we dont usually get breaks
just then the elevator doors ding
well youll find theres nothing usual about me
they climb in
the camera pushes in tighter and tighter on wesleys face
this life is ours to make of it what we can
until it fills the screen looking just like the shot of wesley we started with
and then a sly smile spreads across his mug
i think ill give it a shot
and as the doors close we officially
