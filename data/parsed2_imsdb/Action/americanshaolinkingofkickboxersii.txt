his is the only one still occupied and it doesnt look that permanent
in the window is a cardboard handwritten sign that reads kwans shaolin kung fu
what remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an impression of people moving and milling around
the students are doing their own thing and they are a mixture of old and young men and women
they are not dressed alike as they would be in a karate school they are dressed in old t shirts and tattered sweat pants
this is not a wealthy school by any means and that is typified by the appearance of sifu kwan who is walking through the students as they train
he is wizened old man years old if he is a day and he is dressed in a fraying chinese jacket scruffy cloth shoes and a discolored chinese t shirt
struggling through a horse stance his face in real pain
he is trying his best to hold the stance but his legs are quivering
he drops out of the stance onto his knees
master kwan is right beside him
sifu kwan was that long enough
its been minutes
sifu kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he walks past the student
at shaolin temple in misty songshan mountains we monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled
beat then we trained some more
he walks on leaving a puzzled student behind
getting back into horse stance i guess not
as he walks around the different people training
as one woman is moving through an intricate series of movements he sighs and rearranges her hands
tiger grasps his tail not hamburger
he moves on studying the room with his eyes often glancing toward the door and then toward the small clock on a table near the door
it is late and kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive
as he is waiting a young student comes up to kwan
master kwan when can i learn flying kicks
i see bruce lee
bruce lee actor we fighters warriors
a sparrow in flight is beautiful but a side kick to the ribs is effective
the boy shrugs and then starts throwing side kicks
kwan is half looking at the boy and half looking towards the door and the clock
the boy throws three or four kicks and then stops
he is watching kwan watching the door
kwan sees him and turns back to him
shaking his head a shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude
continue never mind
he continues to kick and kwan continues to look at the door
finally the student stops kicking half heartedly bows to the master and then moves to the side of the workout room
kwan doesnt know hes gone
kwan turns around forgetting for a moment what he is doing and comes face to face with the mother of a student mrs
rodriguez and she is holding a uniform of some sort
she smiles widely at him and holds up the uniform
it is beautiful obviously hand made and on the back is embroidered kwans shaolin and underneath that is drew carson
kwan takes in the entire outfit while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look
they are all very impressed
never in my days at the shaolin temple have i seen uniform as beautiful as this
thank you mrs
i wish drew were here to thank you himself
ta ma de
this last he says looking at the empty door
i only hope it brings him luck in the tournament
luck is no concern mrs
shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul thats how they saved the tang emporer
he looks again at the door then claps his hands together gathering his students around him
xie xie mrs
to class during my time training at the shaolin temple the birthplace of the martial arts i was lucky glance at mrs
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me
but there was also time for individual training where skills were honed like the blade of a sword
now it is that time for you
he turns to go
one of the students before he can leave clears his throat
what do you want us to do
when the blind follow the blind they both fall over the cliff
the others mutter no and shake their heads confused
he exits leaving his students staring vacantly after him
they look at each other honestly not knowing what to do
it is kind of spooky and there are no lights on outside
there is candlelight inside and it is moving around an effect not unlike a ghost carrying a candelabra
the area is dilapidated but very clean with all kinds of kung fu and chinese paraphenalia lying around
around the corner comes the spooky light and with music building to a crescendo we see drew carson a muscular year old bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders
moving through the garage practicing his kung fu maneuvers
he is kicking punching etc
occasionally spilling hot wax on his skin insert
in the background is a tv and on it is showing a martial arts movie
who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage watching drew
as he continues to move around the workout area his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the tv
suddenly kwan jumps out of the shadows attacking
drew reacts instantly evading the attack the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling insert shot here
kwan continues the attack and drew evades their movements matching the movements on the tv almost move for move
it is a beautiful ballet and drew ends it by sweeping kwan down to the ground
when kwan hits the ground hard his face is lit by the tv screen
who for the first time sees that it is kwan
he hurries over to his master a concerned look on his face
he leans down to help kwan up forgetting about the bowls of hot wax
it pours down on kwan scalding him as well as running down drews chest
kwan struggles to get up while at the same time trying to wipe the hot wax off
im sorry very sorry
blustering im ok never mind
what are you doing anyway
is taking the glued on cups of wax off his shoulders while peeling the already hard wax off his chest
i saw it in this movie
kwan shakes his head and walks over to drew standing in front of him
why didnt you come to class
why waste time with this
should study tapes of opponent
ill still win
besides the shaolin monks never had tapes to study
they did it this way
not quite our drills at the temple had meaning
if we had tapes we would have watched them
drew starts to protest but kwan doesnt even let him start
the warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win times in battles
study the tapes i gave you
all these years of one on one training youre the best ive ever taught
best white boy maybe
just fight like a shaolin warrior the rest will take care of itself
picks up tape face reality before it breaks your jaw
drew holds out his hand for the tape and kwan slaps it into his hand
drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the vcr when drews stepfather bob walks in
he is a big overweight man and he is very angry
shouting are you screwing around with this stuff again
look bob im not bothering you am i
its your attitude that bothers me son
im not your son bob
it is a threat one that bob almost takes up
kwan feels the tension in the room and starts to say something
cutting him off dont say a word yellow man
closing his already opened mouth
youre here because i told your mom id see you were taken care of
at least respect my wishes and make something of yourself
stop wasting your time
sarcastic when im the best fighter in the country im not going to let you be part of my entourage
you mean when youre in jail
just leave me alone bob ok
i never asked for anything from you
he spins and kicks one of the hanging bags then walks out of the workout room leaving bob and kwan standing alone
kwan looks at bob who towers over him and smiles sheepishly
big tournament this weekend
he starts to walk out but bob follows him
how would you have liked having to take care of a kid you never really wanted
i wish i had the chance
kwan exits and we
the grounds are immaculate and huge exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out
a gathering is around the pool and lawn area where trevor and his team are having an exhibition for their guests
polite applause is as he knocks out an opponent
taunting a different opponent
trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out
psychologist therapist masseur etc
who are cheering trevor on
as he plays with the next fighter
they said you were good
he knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick
there is no denying that hes a superior fighter
cant you get me any quality sparring partners
the next guy comes up but before they can start the psychologist dr
pfeelgut calls for time and motions trevor over
its not enough just to win trevor
you have to destroy your opponent completely mentally and physically
beat him once hes a threat
humiliate him and hell fear you forever
trevor listens to this nods his head once and when pfeelgut goes to leave trevor pushes him into the pool
pfeelgut comes to the surface smiling
trevor goes back to the ring
he really takes it to this guy alternately playing with him and hurting him
as the guy tries to hold his own the string to his pants comes loose and they start to fall down
he grabs for them with both hands and trevor starts to back up laughing with the rest of the group
toweling off who is yelling to trevor
trevor looks at him for a moment not really understanding then sees what the psychologist is saying
he lunges immediately forward and in slow motion knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up
trevor has learned the lesson of the day and he walks off
the masseur is massaging his shoulders a woman is doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure
an exercise physiologist is going over a computer print out with trevor when an old korean master master kim comes into the room
ah master kim
to physiologist ill look at these stats later
trevor indicates a seat near him much lower than the one he is sitting in
the korean master prefers to remain standing
are all you guys named kim
so what did you think
thick accent you velly good fighter
learn english will ya
and tell me something i dont know
a mountain lion doesnt ponder his weakness and is therefore vulnerable
after a beat well im pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap
beat youre history
chaunce get ride of the bum
the butler chauncy comes forward and walks up to master kim
very good sir
dont come here any more you hear
over a little more to the left sam
the masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly
its hard being me you know
so much pressure
people are streaming into the large building
the marquee out front reads diamond nationals
competitors warming up wall front stretch very high one guy kicking another in the head tap tap tap two man routine practicing another one jumps in
two beautiful girls sparring crowd assembling group of kids waiting call comes over public address system they run off stand outside selling high tech equipment different styles of fighters clothes
camo stars stripes headhunter stern year old girl doing kata two toddlers barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously two twins doing identical kata breaking etc
walk into the area drew is dressed in the ill fitting handmade suit by mrs
people recognize him as he walks past
making his entrance
he is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go
whats the nd uniform for
after hes gone cocky bastard
as he wins a fight
as he wins
drew watching as he wins again
the stage is set for the finals
drew and trevor are already inside waiting
drew fights in a mish mosh of gear different colors different makes while trevor is decked out in designer personalized gear
fighting for the grand championship trevor gottitall and drew carson
rounds max point
gentlemen bow to the ref to each other
the referee gives them a signal and the fight begins
drew is holding his own but trevor is scoring
after several flashy moves the round is over
we see trevors cheerleaders cheering
where he is given mineral water to drink his shoulders are massaged etc
kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup
nd round drews getting beaten worse than the first round
nothing he tries works
the score at the end of the round is in favor of trevor
drew is exhausted frustrated and worried
trevor is pumped and ready to go on forever
you only lose if you give up
the psychologist is exhorting him to destroy drew
trevor leans back on his padded stool smiling
the rd round starts
in this round trevor is destroying drew making him look ridiculous
a clinch comes and insert here before they can break trevor grabs the drawstring around drews waist and pulls
they face off seconds comes the call and trevor charges
as drew blocks his pants begin to sag
trevor not trying to score just trying to keep drews hands busy keeps coming
drews pants drop lower and lower
when they get around his knees he finally notices them and reaches down to get them
trevor drives and picks him up in a throw effectively showing drews bare ass to the world
cut away to crowd laughing girls shocked cameras poised and recording one mom puts her hands over her daughters eyes etc
trevor dumps drew and scores the final point just as time runs out
a buzzer goes off signaling the end of the round
trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration
drew tries to crawl out of the ring and everyone is watching him
as he is being interviewed by tv reporters
i was never worried
hes no match for me
i just hope the nd place trophy is a belt
crowd laughs trevors entourage laughs the hardest
as he packs up his stuff
they are not talking they are just walking drew kicking a can and contemplating the future and the past
kwans hand comes into frame and flicks the needle sending it vibrating back and forth
camera pulls back to reveal drew sitting at the table in kwans house the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and sad
kwan busies himself around the needle trying to alleviate the pain of drews bruises
next time we get that guy
shaking his head no next time master
big sigh you should find a new student
i just cant do it im not getting any better
dont talk like that
he pauses and decides not to tell another shaolin temple story
drew looks at him funny this is very against his character
i saw a shaolin monk once
i was only years old at the time but i remember it like it was yesterday
i was coming back from the market with my father
soldiers stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought
it was all we had left to eat no more money
these were hard times in china people were selling their children for food and the soldiers had no right
who can stop soldiers with guns though
he pauses and takes a sip of tea checking the needle adjusting it and turning it slightly this way and that
just as the soldiers were leaving a monk stepped out of the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back
well naturally they didnt
they pushed the monk and the next thing i knew the soldiers were in the street and the food was back in my fathers arms
soldiers and they were in a heap on the ground their blood mixing with the dust of the street
kwan smiles with the memory it is a sweet and heroic one
the crowd whispered shaolin and he bowed to us touched my cheek and smiled then just walked on
i watched him until he disappeared in the distance
he was larger than life a hero to a little boy of
i vowed then and there to become like him fight for right like the shaolin
he pauses again looking at drew
drew meets his gaze wondering why he is telling him this story
i never did though
my family left china and ended up here in new york a young boys dream left behind in china
all the stories
nodding made up
i never trained at the shaolin temple
when i realized my dream couldnt come true i convinced myself that it had anyway
it was a small step to convince other people
why are you telling me this
ive given you all i can and its not enough
it was never enough
youre like a son to me drew and you have all the potential in the world but i cant take you where you want to go
kwan takes the needle out of drews arm and then rubs the spot where it was with a cotton ball
there that should control the swelling
he watches drew who is pondering what kwan has said
so youre not a shaolin
drew nods an idea forming in his head
a slight smile forms on his face
kwan was expecting him to be angry he never expected this
if you are not a shaolin warrior then i will become one
what are you talking about
im going to the shaolin temple they can train me so i will never lose like that again
kwan feels drews forehead
a long beat here as kwan studies drews eyes
he hit you so hard youre delirious
ill get a cold cloth
he starts to get up but drew grabs his arm and forces him back down
eyes intent dont you see
you said yourself i needed the right training where better than the shaolin temple
whats holding me here
i have the chance to do what you couldnt
i will go to the shaolin temple
kwan looks at him realizes hes serious
he nods his head giving the idea serious consideration
he smiles along with drew
i must pay for your ticket
ill make it there myself
i grew up on the stories of the shaolin and you can be those stories
you can live my dream for me at least let me help you
let an old man make up for the trouble hes caused
kwan touches drews bruised cheek fatherly love in his eyes
drew nods his head then bows in the traditional chinese manner
as he packs for china
as kwan drops drew off at the airport
drew takes his suitcase and walks into the airport
bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes ride around him their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks against the northern china dirt
camera pulls back to reveal tian an men square and the huge photo of chairman mao on the front of the meridian gate of the forbidden city
drew continues his run past a group of western dressed lyou mang who watch him run by through dark glasses
drew runs through a large city park stopping to watch a group of older citizens going through tai zhi routines under the weeping willow trees there
drew runs through an open air food market picking his way through flipping fish dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables
people yell at each other trying to get the best price
young man brushing his teeth in the street
a group of toddlers strung together with rope walks down the street their split pants showing glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk
drew walks up to it a huge backpack on his back
he hesitates a moment then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone else
he manages to get in through a window
there are no seats
drew takes his pack off and sits on it
next to him is an old man his teeth red and rotted from betel nut juice
the man smiles at drew
drew watches the countryside go by
temples farms and rice paddies slide by with an occasionally glimpse of the great wall
he stops on the platform for a moment a huge colorful chinese billboard in the b
a transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods him into motion
drew walks on passing a sign that reads luoyang
he stops at a drink stand and orders one
as soon as he stops he is ringed with people watching his every move he feels almost like a movie star
the woman in the stand hands him a drink and takes the money out of his hand
where is the shaolin temple
the woman just smiles and shakes her head not comprehending
he comes to an intersection and sees a sign that says shaolin temple with an arrow
he goes in the direction that the arrow points
drew walks up and says hello
can you tell me how to get to the shaolin temple
they titter with laughter covering their mouths with their hands
drew is not really amused however he is frustrated and tired
the shaolin temple
how hard can that be
geez doesnt anyone speak english here
as she pushes her way to the front of the group
she is a strikingly beautiful young woman
but wouldnt it make more sense for you to speak chinese than to expect us to speak english
flustered youre right
i apologize ive just been trying to get to the temple for a long time now
why do you want to find the temple
not without pride i am going to join the temple as a monk
ashema translates this for her friends and they titter anew
they gesture to drews longish hair and laugh and then make some attempts at martial arts movements
im going that way i can take you
you have a car
the next best thing
beat this is a chinese car
she pulls out her standard issue black bicycle she has customized it however with some colorful additions
drew does and they take off the girls from the school tittering as they drive off
it is not the most stable ride ashema is struggling to keep moving while drew is doing his best to stay on the bike
he is riding strongly and she is comfortable in the back
they are getting stares from the people they pass but ashema seems to be enjoying the attention
drew hits a bump and ashema holds his waist a little tighter
neither of them mind in fact drew starts looking for more bumps
he pulls around the corner into a wide area lined with drink and food stands
we are here
this is it the temple he came halfway around the world to see
the shaolin temple the birthplace of the martial arts
ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from drew marveling at his awe struck face
i have to help my grandfather with our stand
if you get a chance come by later
distracted ill try but monks arent allowed to be around girls
shaolin monks dont need luck
beat hey thanks a lot for the ride
i hope i see you again
they wave at each other and ashema pushes her bike off
drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple
he is letting it all sink in
after a moment he picks up his backpack and heads for the front door
he pulls it open and disappears inside
the muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of the day outside
drew quietly closes the front door and the half light takes over
he walks through the temple proper and what follows is a montage of temple shots establishing the feeling of the temple the famous shaolin monk painting the depressions in the
floor of the training hall the incense blackened walls of the temple the temple figurines the red lanterns hanging from the ceiling a huge wooden carving of bodhidharma etc
no one is around
drew continues to explore looking for someone to talk to
he wanders into another hall following the o
sounds of chanting
once inside this hall he sees a group of monks amid hanging incense burners and paper lanterns sitting down on the floor chanting in rhythm
no one notices that drew is standing there
the monks eyes are open but they dont seem to see him
he stands there for a moment then shrugs and walks out of that hall
he goes into a corridor then passes the wooden man chamber
all manner of training equipment is standing outside wooden men posts hanging targets heavy bags iron palm jugs balance beams etc
a monk the drill sergeant hereafter d
is standing in front of a wooden post driving his hand into the wood
the post trembles with every strike
drew stands next to the monk watching him intently
again the monk takes no notice of him
excuse me master
still no answer
the man is just slamming his hand into the post over and over
drew sighs and walks on
he goes down a path and flowering bushes are on either side of him
he can see the pagoda forest in the distance
at the end of the path a monk san de is sweeping up the path
drew walks up to the monk and bows
master may i ask you a question
no answer nor response
drews kind of tired of this treatment
whats the deal here
is everybody deaf in this temple
even if you heard me you wouldnt understand would you
shine your head for a quarter
he walks off frustrated wondering what he has to do to get noticed
he walks back into the chanting chamber
the monks are still chanting
drew stands there listening some more moving with the beat until they stop chanting
drew thinking it was some kind of performance claps his hands
that was great
the monks finally take notice of him and they are shocked
so you can see me
several monks rush up and start herding drew towards the exit
very agitated no tourists
drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monks attention
im not a tourist
i want to be a monk
the monk stops his face a mask of shock
he calls to another monk and they have a short conversation in chinese
thats not possible
what do you mean sir
the training is too difficult
besides shaolin policy is no foreigners
i didnt come all this way from america to get turned away
i want in
i want to become a shaolin monk
what people want and what they can have are often not the same
not in this case
oh yes especially in this case
im not leaving
drew starts to sit down intent on staying almost like a kid who is going to hold his breath until he turns blue
you give me no choice
to other monks remove him
he continues in a stream of chinese and the other monks grab drew and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the door
i just want to be a monk
drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door
they pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple
he watches with interest as they open the door and force drew through it out of the temple
a group of people stop and watch the foreigner
the temple door closes with a solid boom
what about my
the temple door opens again and out comes drews backpack
it lands next to him but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear and some socks
the people standing around laugh
drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack
he sits there for a moment then gets up and heads for the small shops and stands ringing the courtyard
he walks past a couple of the stalls looking at the people running them
he doesnt see ashema
he passes a tea stall where one old man is sitting down sipping his tea
the old man looks at drew and smiles and drew is about to walk on when ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall
drew sits down heavily putting his pack down next to him
ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him the steam rising from it
make it a double
they kicked me out
a bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of drew as if hes been drinking heavily
he points to his teacup and ashema shakes her head
youve had enough
drews shoulders slump even more
maybe its for the best drew
you belong in america
i have to do this
i cant go home not until im a monk
id be even more of a disgrace
the old man talks to ashema for the first time
he chatters in chinese motioning towards drew
not now bau bau
my nickname for him
he wants to tell you a story about the temple
the grandfather keeps talking even though ashema and drew really dont want to listen
he is telling a story about a monk who was refused admission into the temple
it broke his heart not to be allowed to be a monk
what did he do
ashema says something to him and he continues in chinese
he decided not to leave
he stayed in the courtyard until they let him in
a long time through the worst weather
he just sat there unmoving through rain sleet snow
did they let him in
beat of course they did what kind of story do you think my bau bau would tell
he stayed in front of the temple until they could no longer say no
he went on to become one of the most famous monks in the history of the temple
drew sits there thinking letting it all soak in
he then gets up and smiles
please tell your grandfather your bau bau he is a wise man
and that he tells a good story
the grandfather smiles at him nodding his head
what are you going to do
are you going home
drew shakes his head
im camping out
he starts away from the stand
in front of the temple
he walks off into the chinese night
the sun is barely coming up and only a few shafts of light are illuminating the darkness
a figure can be seen sitting cross legged in front of the door
it is drew backpack at his side
the front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around and he sees drew sitting there
his eyes widen in shock then he quickly disappears inside
almost immediately the door opens again and the admissions monk is standing there surprised and angry to see drew sitting there
you cannot stay here
no response from drew
he just sits there staring straight ahead
do you hear me
drew doesnt move
san de the sweeping monk walks out of the open door a monk behind him carrying a suitcase
he walks past drew noticing him sitting there
he walks on
the admissions monk slams the door angry
sweat is running into drews eyes and he is trying to keep them from stinging
they are playing games around him throwing stones at him messing with his hair and his clothes touching the things in his backpack frisbee football walkman etc
as he comes out of the temple chasing away the kids
when they are gone he turns to drew
will you give up
i think so
his eyes are closed and it is obvious he is very uncomfortable
it lingers for a moment then goes away
she is giving him food and all he is moving is his mouth
they do not speak
he is miserable and he is looking at the relative comfort of the stands around the temple where there is food warmth and light
his spirit is wavering
give this up drew
no response from drew
just a small smile
this time it stays even longer
drew looks down at it and smiles
looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard
as a school group comes through the temple
the children are tied together with a rope and the teacher motions to the crazy american
drew has become an attraction
they are marveling at his perserverance
this time it doesnt seem to bother him so much
bau bau speaks quickly in chinese
my bau bau says keep it up
he is proud of you
they are no longer tormenting him they are playing around and with him
drew is not moving but he is part of their group
drew stares at the spider his companion in the vigil
the birds are keeping him company and they are singing for him
drews form is firm and solid the determination in his eyes easily seen as he stares at the moon
he will see this through
the old monk san de comes back the same monk following behind him with the suitcase
he looks at drew a little surprise showing in his face at seeing the american still there
he doesnt stop though
he goes into the temple shaking his head
same as the first shot all alone in the temple
the door to the temple opens and out comes san de alone this time
he walks over to where drew is stares at him for a moment then sits down across from him
drew tries not to look at him
san de runs his hand across his bald pate and smiles
my head is shiny enough already dont you think
drew in shock at his ability to speak english sputters you
you speak english
im sorry i was just goofing
i apologize master
i didnt mean to make fun of you
san de shrugs it off
what are you trying to do
i want to become a monk they wont let me in
hey youre just a grunt a janitor sweeping up and all dont sweat it
its not your problem
why are you sitting here
i got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldnt leave
san de nods
has it been hard
it was at first
i was uncomfortable in pain actually but as time went on i got
into it i guess
the sacrifice made me feel
in control you know what i mean
nodding much of the training at the temple is in that direction self sacrifice
tell me more
at first i was really bored and very lonely
but then things changed
maybe its like hitting the wall in running it was like i became part of the courtyard and i felt powerful
even the spider became my friend
drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm
it was an incredible experience i said id do it and i did it
san de watching drew intently smiles at this last
he stands up and bows to drew
drew bows back from his seated position
i wish you all the best
same to you
san de turns and goes into the temple leaving drew still sitting in the courtyard the setting sun in the b
comes the sounds of gongs and drums
a crowd has gathered in the courtyard
ashema and her grandfather are in the crowd and they work themselves up to where drew is
drew turns his head and a procession of kids about his age some older and some younger come walking into the courtyard
the front door to the temple opens wide and a column of monks all in their best saffron robes are lined up waiting to receive them
the young men who are walking in all still have hair and they are carrying some baggage
they begin to enter the temple
they are disciples
this is the last class for fighting monks at shaolin
drew very concerned watches as the monks to be file through the temple doors
the mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go through
the temple doors close
who is crushed
his chance is gone
im sorry drew
it was a good effort
drew is sitting there trying to understand what is happening when the door to the temple opens again
the drill sergeant appears in the doorway and impatiently motions for drew to come in
the crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold
drew gets up warily expecting some trick
the drill sergeant motions again wanting drew to hurry up
drew looks at ashema and her bau bau and smiles
he picks up his backpack and starts towards the temple limping from sitting for so long
the crowd goes crazy clapping and yelling
drew runs into the temple
the door closes behind him
the line of disciples has stopped waiting for drew
drew back pack in hand takes his place at the end of the line
they parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside the temple
as they walk by some of the monks look nonplused while a few are put out by the fact that drew is among them
several of the disciples turn around to look at drew and a couple are openly hostile to him
they file up to a raised platform on which stand monks each holding a scroll in their hands one monk for every new disciple
a gong sounds and the questions begin
who is asked
do you accept the authority of the shaolin patriarchs
yes without pause
do you renounce the earthly world
sure do master
the monk pauses for that is not the ritual answer to the question
the drill sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear and the monk then continues
will you abide by the rules of the temple even if it means death
the drill sergeant comes up behind drew and whacks him in the side with his elbow
whispering answer yes without pause
rubbing his side yes without pause
who is the patriarch of the shaolin temple
do you accept the shr fu at the shaolin temple as your spiritual leaders
yes without pause
the drill sergeant nods his head
will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal gain
drew pauses looking at the drill sergeant
nods urging him on
yes without pause
puts his hands over his eyes
i mean no of course not
then another gong sounds and the quizzing is concluded
a figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes
everyone bows down their eyes on the floor to the figure who is moving towards the raised platform in the center
drew also bowed down sneaks a peak at the figure
it is san de
san de catches his eye and smiles slightly
he winks at drew then clears his throat
everyone stands up again
do these disciples accept the authority of the shaolin temple
yes without pause master san de
who now knows that the monk he called a janitor is the headmaster
under his breath ill be damned
the disciple next to him gao pokes him sharply in the ribs
holding his side oh unbelievable in the same place
are they ready to begin their training
then let us welcome them into our ranks
gongs go off firecrackers are set off and a special flag is raised on the flag pole
a roar comes from the crowd outside
all of whom are happy
all that is except for gao who is staring at drew
drew notices the stare
you got a problem man
when the noise subsides
your training begins tomorrow
for now your shr fu will introduce you to our temple
welcome to shaolin
san de walks away and the disciples are split into several platoons
drew is matched up with the drill sergeant and gao is also in his group
great just great
they are motioned to follow gao out of the courtyard and into the temple proper
drew walks behind the other disciples who are lining up to get their robes
as he takes his place in line a monk comes up to take drews backpack
drew resists and a tug of war ensues
what are you doing man
you must surrender this
no way man
get your own
the drill sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over
it is unseemly to argue like this
take the backpack into the sleeping quarters
to drew do not cling to material things it is not good for your soul
he walks away and drew reluctantly gives up his backpack
drew lines back up and is about to get his robes when gao slides over and takes them from him
drew immediately shoves him and tries to grab the robes back
gao smiles and moves away holding the robes up and away from drew
drew is pissed and ready to go after gao
before he can however li another disciple grabs another set of robes from the table and gives it to drew pulling him away from the confrontation
whats with that guy
watch out for gao
i hadnt noticed
whyd they let him in anyway
maybe for the challenge
no that was me
they both smile and walk off
the camera moves down the line of monks as their hair is shaved off in clumps
drew is standing next to his chair arguing with the d
about the haircut
james designs my hair master
i dont think
this will symbolize your final break from the outside world
cant i just wear a patch
shakes his head and drew sits down unhappy
the barber starts on drews head big clumps of hair falling down to the floor
they are running their hands over their heads
drew comes out of the building his head shaved completely clean
what outside world
i dont want to be seen by anybody
he rubs his hand over his head and then sees the others
li is smiling
if i look half as stupid as you guys do im really in trouble
a number of cots are lined up side by side
has assigned a bed to each monk
drew finds his bed which is right next to gaos
i want another bed
i wont sleep next to the american
we are no longer chinese or americans han or mongol
we are shaolin
everyone is a monk
well this monk smells
drew unconsciously smells himself
he shakes his head
li goes up to the d
and points to the bed he was assigned
i will switch with disciple gao
nods and then starts for the door
go to sleep
we have an early day of training tomorrow
gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed hitting drew with his shoulder
drew trips him as he walks away all done very secretively since the d
li comes over to the new bed and in silence they get climb into their respective beds
switches off the lights then leaves and drew stares up at the ceiling
thanks for what you did
where are you from
new york city
what is new york like
ill tell you about
drew waits for a moment fearful that the d
will be coming back in
good night li
all is quiet
suddenly a huge stick enters frame and it pauses for a moment above drew before thumping down on top of him
drew cries out when he is hit and jumps out of bed looking all around him
no one is there
a few of the disciples are moving around because he yelled but there is nothing else there
drew belatedly gets into a fighting stance but no other attack is coming
who seems to be sleeping peacefully
as he climbs back into bed bone weary
he lies back down to sleep
drew stumbles in bleary eyed to relieve himself
he stands at the urinal relaxing as he starts
suddenly a huge stick whacks drew across the rear end the sound reverberating through the latrine
drew yelps and jumps looking around for the attacker
no one is there and his underwear is now all wet
camera pulls back to reveal drew sitting with li and some other disciples
drew makes a face
you got to be kidding
comes up behind and grabs the bowl from him
you dont like it dont eat it
he takes the bowl away
i didnt say i wasnt going to eat it
he turns to the rest of the disciples
well at least we start training today right guys
a chorus of yeahs
they are the standard fighting monk issue suitable for martial arts training
wonder what theyll start us with first
wooden man i think
no itll be basics first day
horse stance kicks and punches
when they are all dressed they run out of the room
in the b
are the fighting monks going through their routines
as they go through forms or free sparring
there are shots of monks throwing stars working with weapons etc
it is all very exciting
who is more excited than all the others
as he walks to the front of the group
in his hand he is carrying a shovel
bodhidharma the patriarch of the shaolin temple taught us that to train the mind we first have to train the body
basics i told you
who motions to one of the monks behind him who has a wheelbarrow filled with shovels
each one of you take a shovel
were using the shovels as weapons
beat in the war on infection
motions with his hand and in the distance is the latrine building
you will be digging today digging our new latrines
a shaolin fighting monk in training does not ask questions
he just obeys
leads the way to the latrine building and the disciples follow each of them carrying a shovel
drew is trudging along not believing what they are doing
i came halfway around the world to dig latrines
i could have just joined the army
digging with their shovels
their training clothes are already sweated through and dirty
their shirts are off and their arm muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine
as he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole then places the pole on his shoulders the muscles in his arms shoulders and back straining
he walks off to the side of the area to dump it
as he dumps the dirt a pole appears and cracks across his back
he drops the buckets and falls to the ground
he gets up as quickly as he can but there is no one to be seen
as they are working hard on the latrines
drew is teaching them an american song as they work
aint no cure for the shaolin temple blues
working on a chain gang i fought the law and the law won tons the monks are singing along with him
all except for gao
it is again very meager a bowl of rice a bowl of soup and a piece of scrawny meat
drew looks at it for a moment
is standing over his shoulder
drew shakes his head and starts to eat quickly
as he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole
he gets it up onto his shoulders in pain and starts to walk
immediately the d
is there in front of him
he examines the baskets
they are not full
he moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt
shocked whatd you do that for
do a job well or dont do it
as they are in line for water
they each drink a large glass full then move back to their work area
drew is the last in line
when drew gets to the front the d
smiles and shakes his head
sorry all gone
get some more
drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground then looks up at the d
then forces a smile
he takes the proferred buckets of water made of wood with pointed bottoms and large handles
indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides to work on the shoulder muscles
drew turns and walks away muttering to himself
im gonna get you man
gao is laughing as he watches drew go
once they are filled he starts back for the temple
his shoulders are straining from the weight of the buckets
he goes over the path to the temple having to negotiate logs over chasms etc
after various trials and tribulations drew arrives at the temple his arms incredibly tired
is there waiting for him
drew determined not to show any weakness raises the buckets a little bit higher
he comes to the d
proud and defiant
motions for him to put the buckets down
without thinking drew puts the buckets down and they both fall over spilling their contents onto the ground
drew tries to stop them but hes too late
the water has all spilled out onto the ground
dont tell me i know
get more water
they are exhausted from their work
drew is lying in bed his eyes wide open ready to get attacked
as his eyes go closed finally
he is balancing as he walks
who is working at the other end
he starts across the same ridge
they come to the middle a stand off
back up and let me pass
no chance gao
you back up
gao smiles and shakes his head
gao starts forward and whacks drew in the leg with a leg sweep
drew tries to keep his balance and fights a valient but losing battle
he falls over the side the dirt in his buckets flying everywhere
gao wipes his hands off and continues walking
a huge splinter sticking out of it
he is in real pain
walks over and looks at the splinter and in one move pulls it out
heartlessly shaolin monks feel no pain
rub some dirt on it and you will be fine
he walks away
on a work break
they are watching the monks training in the distance
it is all the more desirable because it is unattainable
in the distance a monk can be seen walking between two other monks
they are leading him out
the monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the disciples
his face and body are covered with bruises and welts
the two other monks dont say a word their faces grim
li turns to the d
he failed to pass through the wooden man chamber
he must leave the temple
the wooden man chamber
the ultimate test of a shaolin monk
did you see his face
he just wasnt good enough
i wouldnt be surprised if half of us go out the same way
appears and motions for them to work
the monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them
breath in through your nose out through your mouth
imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching your thoughts flow by
clear your mind
think of nothing
drew sits trying to think of nothing
he is not succeeding
he bends over to get a dish when a pole comes and smacks him on the rear end
he turns immediately in one direction but gets hit again from the other direction
drew is furious and he cant even see the attacker
come out goddamn it
no answer as we hold on drew looking around
drew is walking with li having just dumped their buckets into a large hole
so what is this night soil stuff anyway
you guys actually use this as fertilizer
they turn to go back and there is gao balancing a huge basket of night soil over his head peasant style
he is on the same ridge that they are going to walk on
how you doing
a little worried let me pass
he reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet and then closes on gao a little bit
theres something on the bottom of your basket
drew pokes at the basket for a moment right over gaos head
then he jams the stick in and holds it there
i think i found the problem
beat a hole
drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down onto gaos head
they back away as gao goes running towards the pit where the night soil is deposited
to li well somebody sure smells
as they work a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout
drew stops working and watches them pass
this is ridiculous
suddenly a bamboo pole cracks drew on the shoulder
he turns around ready for a fight only to see the d
standing there the pole raised for another strike
back to work
drew is about to say something but doesnt
he returns to work
he is sitting with li and a couple of the other disciples wu shu and low
ive got an idea on how to get even with our beloved drill sergeant
they all huddle a little closer
in the b
can be seen drew li wu and a couple other of the disciples
they are waiting for something
hits the trip wire and suddenly two bamboo poles hurtle towards him ready to slam him in the shoulders
with one beautiful move the d
breaks both poles shattering when they hit his arms
hardly breaks stride and continues walking
he looks back once and sees the outline of the group of disciples
who are up and running as soon as they are spotted
they run by gao who was watching from another area
he looks around knocks and then goes in
walks into the front of the courtyard and addresses the group
gao is standing off to the side a smug smile on his face
you are all responsible for anything that happens within your group
what happened yesterday falls on everyones shoulders
so all of you will do double work
the smug smile gone now
drew is in the center of the room and the sound of light snoring is heard
it is him he is asleep
suddenly a bamboo shinai is slammed across drews back waking him up
bodhidharma meditated for years without sleeping
think you can manage minutes
they are all singing chain gang
they are good workers and they dont mind the hard work nor the hot weather quite so much
who is holding court
we came here to train not to be slaves
were free men
but we swore to obey them
an uninformed choice is no choice at all
we have to stand up for our rights
if they dont even know were dissatisfied things will never change
they havent changed for centuries why should we listen to you
are we men or mice
sheep or the shepherd
im with you
the others are with him too except for gao
they are ready to explode and drew has the match
im for going to the headmaster right now
they are all ready
they head for the door but gao doesnt move
drew stops at the door and turns to gao
youre either with us gao or youre against us
no answer from gao
they exit the room
heading for the same place but from a different direction
drew goes to knock on the door when it opens and san de is standing there
has just arrived
he looks at san de for instructions but san de indicates that he will deal with them
master san de
we have something to say
this is an interesting coincidence as i was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all
i request permission to go first
i think id better
no really i want to
san de holds up his hand
he is the final authority
here at the temple we use a period of intense physical labor to test your patience and to teach you humility and self reliance
as you continue training you will be given chores every day remember the first time you saw me i was sweeping
physical labor keeps us humble
who tonight have been anything but humble
youve all performed admirably and have learned an important lesson to obey your shr fu without question
because of this ive decided to begin your martial training sooner than what is prescribed
the disciples can hardly believe their luck
and what did you have to say to me
who is sputtering now
i mean we just wanted to
thank you for the opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the shaolin temple
beat yeah thats it
they all say thank you as one and then bow to the headmaster with their hands clasped in front of them
they turn away and head down the hallway
as they increase their pace almost running through the halls with their excitement
suddenly it bursts open and in come the disciples led by drew
they fan out into the room drew in the center
gentlemen this calls for a party
he runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers and puts on some good old american rock n roll
everyone but gao is moving in time with the music
drew is the most accomplished dancer but the others are pretty bad
the entire effect of the bald headed monks rocking out is very comic
drew starts showing li and wu a couple of dance routines old stuff the swim the twist etc
everyone is having a great time
glowering as he moves toward the boom box
he reaches for the stop button
drew blocks the arm and a pushing and shoving match starts
youre trying to get us all kicked out
im just trying to have a party
they push and shove into the middle of the room a couple of kicks and punches thrown then they face off ready to duke it out
the party is raging while gao and drew are the only ones static set to do battle
just then the door starts to open
everyone freezes and looks toward the door including gao
drew meanwhile has the presence of mind to jump onto the boom box shutting it off and hiding it with his body
as the d
opens it and sticks his head in
he surveys the room seeing the tableau of frozen monks with drew lying on his bed
who waves to the d
who knows that something is going on
go to sleep
he hits the lights and then closes the door
in the semi darkness the room relaxes in a collective sigh
drew stands up and packs up the stereo
gao walks over past drew
its not over american
intercut of feet striking the stone floor depressions in the floor testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen
through the door come the d
drew and the others
they line up along one wall watching the fighting monks go through their form
it is beautiful powerful graceful and intimidating
their form done they file out of the chamber leaving the d
with his group along with one fighting monk
motions for them to line up as the monks had
you will train days a week from am to p
alternating with work and meditation
sunday afternoon is free time
lets that sink in then motions for the monk to take over
in order to keep our bodies strong bodhidharma gave us a series of exercises and breathing techniques
because the times demanded action we developed shaolin style wu shu from these exercises
he goes through a couple of martial movements
the spirit of bodhidharma remains
training is like meditation
be aware of everything but aware of nothing in particular
think not thinking
what do you mean think not thinking
who doesnt explain any further
your training begins today in this most sacred of training halls
the floor bears witness to the efforts of fighting monks from centuries past
where there are depressions and worn spots the result of thousands of hours of training
at the shaolin temple we forge our bodies in the fire of our wills
we adhere to a vow of non violence unless someone else is in danger
follow my movements
he starts moving through a series of techniques and the rest of the disciples try to mimic his actions
he is moving around the room and they are trying to do what he is doing
some are getting it some arent
drew used to a more individualized type of training isnt getting it
a hand comes into frame grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the ground
pull back to reveal drew along with the other disciples lined up and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back out
their muscles are bulging with the effort
filled to the brim with small stones
drew is forcing his arms into the urn in iron palm training
he is going through a complex form kicking and punching never missing or faltering a step
some of the poles are as high as feet off the ground
he is less sure but at least he doesnt fall
trying the poles
he starts out well but he soon misses and falls almost impaling himself on a pole
i cant do this
here at shaolin cant doesnt exist
drew is working with his friend li
they are moving through a series of techniques ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to blocked by a special shaolin technique
each time li throws the final kick drew gets hit hard
his block isnt working
a monk comes up to him
block the way i showed you
showing him a block this is the way i was taught
do it this way
you wont get hit
drew bows and turns to continue working with li
by this time however the ranks have shifted and gao is opposite drew
drew attacks first in the series and gao uses the block to easily deflect drews kick
menacingly my turn
he attacks and drew gets to the final technique
he blocks the way he did before and he gets slammed brutally by gao
gao stands over him smiling
a monk is alternately falling down and kipping up falling down and kipping up
drews group is working on several very athletic maneuvers none of which drew is especially good at
gao of course is having no trouble
drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground
he is very angry and he hits the ground with his fist
emotions cloud the spirit eliminate them
this isnt martial arts its gymnastics
this is shaolin wu shu
drew sits in the dirt watching everyone around him sail through the air and flip over the ground
he is not a happy camper
the entire group is gathered in a sort of pit on a hard concrete floor
stands in the middle
i want to go over some takedowns before we end for the day
ill need a partner
he scans the group and then points to drew
drew smiles ruefully walks to the front and bows to d
watch carefully as i take him down using techniques from shwai jyau chinese wrestling
looking at ground excuse me master but there arent any mats here
do they always use mats in america
the group laughs a little at that and drews manhood is now challenged
if you are scared ill get someone else
perhaps gao would assist me
who is already getting up ready and willing
this changes drews mind right away
lets do it
attack me straight on
drew attacks and is taken down brutally smashed into the hard concrete floor
no attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow
drew gets up right away and attacks again
again he is driven to the ground
this continues from all angles and all methods of attack
who can barely watch the destruction
does not let up at all taking drew down hard each time
every time regardless of the impact drew gets right back up
his eyes are dazed there is a little blood coming out of his nose but he keeps coming back for more
finally after a high arcing back throw a real thumper the worst of all of them the d
calls it a day
good thats all for today
before anyone can move however drew raises his hand as high as he can obviously in pain
im not sure i got that last throw clear in my mind
the group gasps knowing how much drew must be hurting admiring him for his guts
even gao is impressed
i said thats enough
if youre getting too old for this kind of training i understand
drew attacks and the d
executes the manuever perfectly crashing drew down almost on his head
luckily drew is able to twist at the last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder
he moans and groans and lies there
i think ive got it now
the group disburses shaking their heads in wonder
li comes up to drew who is still lying on the ground
are you trying to kill yourself
he hurts more than me hes just not bleeding thats all
he tries to get up but moans in pain and falls back down
li helps him up and takes him to the showers
watching them go
there is a slight smile on his face
it is huge and looks really painful
if you go to san de he can send you to a doctor
drew pulls away and stands up
he backs up to the wall of the dormitory right underneath a window
i appreciate your concern li but its not that serious
im all right
just as he is talking gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty water from washing the floor of the dorm
hhe smiles then pours the huge bucket over the edge dousing drew
as the dirty water hits him drenching him
it is huge and the water is crashing down from high above
he is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders onto him
as they stand on the bank
concentrate on your stance
all i want you to do is try to hold your stance
li youre first
li smiles and walks into the waterfall using a walkway that goes behind the thundering water
he moves into the water a little and gets into a deep horse stance
he stand there immovable
after a moment he turns to look at d
who motions him farther into the water
who nods his head and walks into the thundering water
as soon as he gets into the main stream of water he is forced off the ledge and he falls about feet into the pool below
each of them try it in turn
gao goes in and he manages to stand under the impact of the water for a moment before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool
its his turn
he walks to the waterfall and goes in
he picks up an umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall imprinted with a new york giants nfl logo on it unmistakably american
he walks into the waterfall and the umbrella works for a moment
drew is holding it with both hands and he gets into a deep horse stance
he turns to smile at the d
and then waves at the others
as soon as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella the water slams him and off he goes into the pool
he lands with a huge splash doing a painful bellow flop
drew comes to the surface still clutching the now destroyed umbrella
he smiles at the other disciples who are still swimming sheepishly
thought id join you guys
drew is in with the group
gao and drew are chosen to do a training exercise together
in this exercise you try to touch your partners chest lightly and your partner tries to block
the group gets started doing the drill and gao is almost caving drews chest in with his blows
he is so close to drew that drew doesnt have a chance to block it
on the last strike drew falls back to the ground
is there immediately
drew shakes his head and gets back up
now its drews turn to strike and he tries to hit gao with the same amount of force as he did but gao avoids his attack throwing him off balance
he throws another punch out and gao grabs it and pulls
drew falls to the floor again
a monk who was watching walks over
the goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner
just try to tap his chest
i know but
then do it that way
the monk walks away shaking his head
drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways and li is enjoying watching him
to the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall
this sure beats sweeping
floating past temple statues and ancient chinese decorations barely missing them
drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to li harder than he should have
it heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center right in the face
the statue starts to tip
drew and li rush for the statue and catch it just before it tips over and smashes on the ground
they look at each other thanking their lucky stars the statue didnt fall
they start to throw the frisbee again when drew spots the d
coming towards them
drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms
he tosses one to li and they just begin sweeping again when the d
rounds the corner
knows something is going on but they look so innocent
sweep the main chamber drew
he bows and smiles goodbye to li
he walks into the main training chamber
this is the chamber where they had their first workout and drew just stands there for a moment soaking up the tradition of it
he walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and stands staring at it
quick cuts to different angles of the painting
who begins to sweep
his broom is going over the depressions where the monks train and soon he loses his desire to sweep
he takes the broom in his hand as a weapon and starts to spin it going through a martial arts form his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the
he finishes with a flourish having moved into a shadowy area in a corner and then bows to an imaginary crowd using the broom as a microphone
imitating an announcer presenting the greatest fighter in the history of the shaolin temple
drew holds his broom over his head nodding his head to the imaginary crowd
the crowd is going wild
just then out of the shadows comes an attacking staff slamming into drews unprotected stomach
drew ready to double over in pain hears the staff hit the frisbee and stands up straight adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach
before he can react the staff smacks him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor
as he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept up
drew is standing in front of a painting statue of bodhidharma one in which he is made to look extremely fierce
san de walks up behind drew and stands there for a moment
he was an amazing monk
yeah whats up with him
come with me
san de walks away and drew follows him
the room is filled with paintings and scrolls
a golden sash hangs in a place of honor
san de puts the tea leaves into the pot then soaks them with boiling water
he pours the water out then repeats the process several times
his movements are all very precise and careful it almost looks like a martial art kata
legend states that bodhidharma gave us tea
once while meditating bodhidharma fell asleep a natural reaction we all have to fight against
san de looks pointedly at drew who doesnt meet his eyes
when he awoke he was so enraged at his eyelids for betraying him he tore them off and threw them to the ground
beat from those eyelids grew the first tea bush
you see even the leaves look like eyelids
san de shows drew a tea leaf
nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure and your will is strong
the tea is ready and san de begins to pour for drew
i understand youve been questioning some of the teachings of the temple
its just not the way i was taught
san de keeps pouring into drews cup
it is getting to the rim
san de is not stopping
no more will go in
san de continues pouring until the tea runs all over the table
you are like this cup full of what you have learned
how can we show you shaolin unless you first empty your cup
he picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window
he now pours into the empty cup
the rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free you not restrict you
they keep your mind from harmful thoughts
beat drink your tea
drew nods and sips at his tea
his body moves with the wind bending and swaying
another monk is attacking him with a hard style and the soft style is very effective
drew and li try it and drew is having a lot of trouble
he is used to training hard style and the soft style seems too weak for him
its not fighting i feel like im dancing or something
this soft stuff is unnatural fighting should be hard tough
holds out his hand in a tight fist
if my hand was always like this what would you call it
after a beat deformed
he opens his hand letting it go limp
and if it was always like this
nods and walks off leaving drew to stare questioningly at li
they are not dressed in their monastic robes however
they are in street clothes
it is their day off
a monk comes down the line handing out hats to the disciples
they put them on and wait for instructions from the d
remember let no one know you are disciples at the shaolin temple but do not forget that you are
they file out
as soon as they are out the serious faces break into smiles and they are teenagers again
some of the disciples run off to join relatives waiting for them in the courtyard while a group of them stick together
drew is walking with li wu and several others
as they walk through the small town outside of the temple
they pass by ashemas stand but only the bau bau is there
drew bows to the bau bau then slips off his hat rubbing his bald head for bau bau to see
bau bau laughs and the rest of the guys rush up to drew forcing his hat back on his head
were not supposed to
chill out guys
its our day off
he bows to bau bau and then they walk off
they walk through the small town checking it out
they walk through the countryside enjoying their freedom
drew has brought a frisbee with him and they are tossing it around
the hills are filled with buddhist carvings
as he walks by the carvings
the detail and the artistry are amazing
as they walk by a riverside park
the park is filled with people and a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope
drew stops to watch them then looks back at the others
they all shake their heads
drew nods his
they continue to shake their heads
drew starts running towards the kids stripping off his shirt at the same time
the others pause for a moment then follow his lead
as they swing into the river trying to keep their hats on as they splash into the water
they are having the time of their life
resting on the bank of the river
drew and the guys spot a group of girls down the bank from them
check it out guys
good work wu
what tipped you off
alarmed we are not allowed to have contact with females
it is the most serious rule of the temple
its a stupid rule li
he is about to turn away then spots ashema as she runs down a path to the group of girls
he stands up immediately and starts over to her
he is jogging at the same time trying to straighten his clothes and his hat
li starts running after drew
the others follow
who hears her name
she looks around sees drew but doesnt immediately recognize him
she looks around the park
she looks at drew again and this time recognizes him
drew arrives and impulsively he gives her a hug genuinely very happy to see her
li arrives and pulls them apart
you can get kicked out of the temple for this
whos going to tell li
he turns to ashema who has now backed off a little bit and is looking at drew a smile on her face but is pretending that she is embarrassed
the other girls are gathered around giggling
pointing at girls not the giggle girls again
howve you been
you look great
hiding a laugh you look
how do you like the temple
nobodys supposed to know
li tugs at drews shirt
we really shouldnt be doing this
im trying to show you guys a good time
to ashema i guess i gotta go
it was great to see you
one of the giggle girls behind ashema whispers something in her ear
she nods and smiles
my school is having a party this tuesday night
can you and your friends come
li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies but drew smiles and takes ashemas hand
the girls start to giggle again
he brings her hand up to his lips and kisses it gently
well be there
the room is dark its after lights out
are you nuts
we cant go to a party with girls
were working hard we deserve some r r
weve earned this
back home in new york you dont say no to a party
wheres your sense of adventure
what do you do at a party with girls
drew smiles knowing that he has them
you dance and talk
and have a good time
that clinches it we cant dance
and we dont know how to talk to girls
trying to sound like an expert thats easy
you just talk to them like you would to the guys you just dont tell them as much and
not in the same way
drew is in over his head
like you know
look dancings easy
ill show you
well start with slow dancing
an oooh escapes from the guys
drew pulls his boom box out of his backpack and starts searching for a suitable tape
you guys grab a pillow for a partner while i find some slow music
the disciples have grabbed their pillows
drew pops the cassette into his boom box and turns it on low and sultry
just move in time to the music nothing elaborate
think of it as a soft form
the disciples move and sway in time to the music
they are treating their pillows like imaginary girls
who is holding his pillow at arms length
loosen up li
shes not going to bite
how do you know
who is really getting into it
he is dancing with his pillow cheek to cheek and occasionally sneaking a kiss
practicing their dancing and preparing for the party
who sits back on his bed his hands clasped behind his head
this is going to be great
still moving and swaying to the music
now asleep and in bed still clutching their pillows like they were girls
as it opens
looks in on the room and sees all the kids holding their pillows
he shakes his head and then closes the door
camera pulls back to reveal drew and gao going at it
the other disciples are paired off as well but the only real action is here in this ring
drew is getting tagged hard while the points he scores are all relatively controlled
after one particularly powerful shot drew stops
i thought this was light contact
fight you coward
drew stares at gao then looks around for the d
he is over at the other side of the training area
you got it
before he can move however gao attacks slamming him full power in the face
drew almost falls to the ground then attacks him and the battle is joined
the fighting is fast and furious and soon the others see what is happening and gather around
one of the monks comes over and tries to break it up but they continue fighting wrestling kicking and punching
finally gets over to them and without moving a muscle barks stop
drew and gao immediately break apart breathing heavy and staring daggers at each other
to others back to work
he turns and walks off motioning for drew and gao to follow him
drew follows immediately with gao behind him
gao shoves him once
san de is sitting down reading a buddhist text
with a sigh he puts it down
on the wall behind is hanging a golden sash
beat tell me what happened
drew looks at gao and gao looks at drew
there is a pause one that is very uncomfortable
finally drew speaks
it was my fault
i started it
surprised at drews confession
disciple gao was better than me
drew pauses and gao is even more surprised at the revelation
i lost my temper
he was only defending himself
who nods his head and looks at drew
is this true disciple gao
gao looks at drew wondering what he should say
drew looks at him nodding for him to say yes
but i am not completely blameless
i didnt think you were
beat the shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges
we challenge ourselves but we do not fight with each other
never do we fight to see who is best we train to be able to right wrongs not to let our hands and feet express emotions run wild
a shaolin never throws a punch or kick in anger
beat shake hands and let your emotions go
gao looks at drew knowing that the anger is already long gone swept away in the shock of drew taking the blame
they shake hands
both drew and gao notice the golden sash hanging on the wall
it is occupying a place of honor
that is the golden sash the highest honor of the temple
it is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle of understanding
the best fighter
among other things
fighting is only a small part of being a shaolin monk
san de nods
return to your training
drew and gao get up bow to san de and head for the door
they get to the door at the same time however and for a moment they jockey for position trying to be the first one through the door
finally drew tires of the game and opens the door for gao
ten more seconds and i would have kicked your ass
gao smiles and walks through the door
just as he passes drew he punches him in the stomach
in your dreams
they are dressed in street clothes and are just pulling on their hats
drew instead of wearing his temple issue hat pulls on a new york yankees baseball cap
now were ready
he leads them towards the window of their dorm but stops when he gets there
he turns to where gao is standing all alone
gao you coming or what
there is a moment of indecision then gao frowns shakes his head and comes jogging towards them
im coming just to keep you out of trouble
suddenly a figure lands on the ground with a puff of dust
in a crouch drew scans the area then motions for the others to jump down
immediately other figures land with puffs of dust all around him
as soon as they have all landed they move off
as they sneak through the courtyards and training areas of the temple
they are about halfway across from the front door of the temple when a monk comes walking towards them
he is weaving and bobbing he looks drunk
drew shoots li and gao a questioning look
in the temple
they take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk makes his way past weaving and throwing kicks and punches
it is a tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where drew and gao are standing but he walks on
whisper drunken kung fu
drew nods and leads them out of the temple
it is the same school where drew first met ashema
the guys still happy arrive at the school and the realization of what they are about to do sinks in
they stop talking and are staring at the building
drew starts toward the door and nobody follows his lead
he stops and motions for them to join him
are we men or are we sheep
a beat then the entire group bellows and they follow drew the shepherd in through the front door making noises like sheep
it isnt happening
the boys are on one side the girls are on the other
the music is bad chinese rock and roll
the only ones together are drew and ashema who are talking in the center of the room
the disciples are all clustered together staring at the walls and the ceiling
a group of giggle girls are standing around drew and ashema
a group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room observing everything thats going on
ashema smiles a sheepish smile
drew decides that if they are going to have a good time hes going to have a hand in it
he pulls out a cassette tape gives it to ashema play this when i signal ok
she nods and walks off
drew motions for gao and the guys to come over
they do and when they do drew turns to the giggle girls ladies allow me to introduce my best friends in all of china
he drags gao over to one of the prettier girls
this is gao
and this wild man is li
drew does the same for li wu su sou and all the others forcing them to stand with the girls for a moment
when everyone is paired off he motions to ashema
insert of ashemas finger on the tape player play button
as the song the disciples have been singing in the fields blasts out
immediately the disciples start moving with the music and suddenly the party is happening
who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody some holding the girls closer than others
drew and ashema are locked in an embrace their eyes closed
a hand comes in and taps drew on the shoulder
eyes still closed not now li
the hand comes in again punching drew in the shoulder hard
drew opens his eyes and sees that he is surrounded by five tough guys dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on
what can i do for you
they have noticed what is going on
he turns back to ashema but she is pulled back by the giggle girls away from danger
the tough spins drew around and pushes him hard
one of the toughs has already gotten behind him on his knees and drew goes flipping over the tough landing hard on the ground the wind knocked out of him
drew gets up wincing not really ready to fight
cant we talk this over
the tough pulls his fist back to strike drew who has been grabbed by two other toughs his arms pinned behind his back
suddenly a figure flies in and slams the tough to the ground
it is gao and he immediately sets on the other toughs
the room erupts in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs
the girls are screaming as the boys kick and punch
the disciples are winning having a great time until the door to the room slams open and the headmistress comes storming in screaming at the top of her lungs for
them to stop
as they all agree as one to hightail out of there
they go running past the headmistress and out the door full speed
as they climb back into the dorm room
he lands on the hardwood floor panting his lungs out after the run
after a beat he lifts his head and looks right at gao
did you say you were going to keep us out of trouble
the group pauses for a beat then they all laugh relaxing
gao sits down and looks around
they are all dressed in their training clothes dirtied after a full day of training
i cant believe nobodys said anything
its been a whole day
we broke every major rule the temple has how could we get away with it
i think we might have
if they knew theyd have already gotten us
you guys just have to stop looking so guilty
who pushes his dinner away from him
ive lost my appetite
lets go back to the dorm for a few minutes go over our stories in case they seperate us
he gets up to leave and the others follow him
drew and the others spot the cops and walk quickly to their dorm room
somebody called the cops
before anyone can answer the door opens and the d
walks into the room his face serious
come with me to san des chamber
he turns to go but the others are on their feet ready to follow drew
drew looks at them and shrugs then follows the d
also in the room are two high ranking police officials
the headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs and san de is just sitting there letting her vent
she has obviously been going at it for some time because her face is sweaty and flushed
she stops when drew and the d
enter and points an accusing finger at drew
hes the one
drew i think you know headmistress low
drew can only nod
the police have also come
a morals violation is what brought them
drews head snaps up at the words morals charge we demand that he leaves the temple and china
hes a disgrace to the temple and to this country
he must leave
they all agree that drew should leave and for a moment the sound of the three of them agreeing fills the room ad libs
who is staring down into the abyss
this is a serious issue there is no question
this we will have to take under advisement but we will handle matters of this temple
this involves more than just the temple
i am authorized to escort him from your temple to the jail now tonight where he will be held until he leaves the country
san de pauses letting this sink in
master may i
san de nods we accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our ranks
if we force him to leave china we admit failure
can we do that
the police dont have an easy answer to that
who is surprised that the d
is sticking up for him
you are wise
you know what is right and what is not right
this disciple does not even know right from wrong
who will teach him if we do not
this sinks in and the police have nothing to say
the headmistress will not keep quiet however
he does not belong here
whisper chill out honey
drew catches a hard look from the d
would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from that which he so desperately needs
she is about to speak but thinks better of it
san de stands up signalling that the meeting is over
thank you all for coming
i am pleased that you brought this problem to our attention
may you sleep well tonight knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved
i do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news
you will not have to
the headmistress starts to say something but san de holds up his hand stopping her
he leads them out then closes the door and comes back to face drew
master i cant tell you how sorry i am
i appreciate you both going to bat like that for me
i wont let it happen again
neither will we
you must leave the temple in the morning
but i thought
you do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal but you cannot stay
drew sits for a moment looking back and forth between san de and the d
his eyes are filling with tears and he wipes at them
im sorry master
as am i
drew gets up and walks out of the chamber
he has just finished telling the disciples what is going on
they are shocked
why only you
drew shrugs and goes over to his bed lying down with a sigh
always told us that were all responsible for what happens
its not fair
it doesnt have to be fair
everyone else is asleep but not drew
he is staring at the ceiling
everyone is gone already their beds made up
drew gets up quickly and gathers up his few things
he puts on his new york yankees cap and shoulders his back pack then looks around the room one last time
i hate long goodbyes anyway
he exits the room
walking through the courtyard for the last time
only a few monks are around and they dont meet drews eyes
the sounds of training can be heard o
drew stops to listen to those sounds for a moment then heads for the door
as he leaves the temple
he pauses for a moment with the door open then shuts it sadly
he looks out over the courtyard which is completely deserted
drew sighs hitches his backpack onto his back and starts out
as he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper he sees
dressed in street clothes with their bags packed
li and gao are in the front their bags in their hands smiling
youre either with us or against us remember
smiling im with you
a cheer goes up from the entire group as drew li and gao embrace
in the b
can be seen the d
who is observing all this
the door opens and drew walks in the d
can be seen in the b
san de indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in
quite a show of solidarity yes
drew nods trying to hide a smile
he is trying his best to appear humble
why did you come to the shaolin temple
caught off guard to train master
yet you rebel at every rule and blame the training for your inability to learn and progress
no response from drew who is just looking down at the ground
you are like someone swimming in fresh water crying i thirst
what you seek is all around you
dont fight with the ways of the temple the battle is within yourself
you must accept the responsibility for your life
if we force you out of the temple you can always blame the temple for your failure it never has to be your fault
beat life without committment is no life at all
what if i cant handle it
what if i fail
live for the moment drew
the future will take care of itself
if you go through your days here squeezing every last bit of life out of every minute you need not fear failure
after a beat then its up to me
your fellow disciples stood up for you
its your turn
i dont want to let them down
dont let yourself down
he bows to san de and then leaves the chamber
are you staying
drew waits for a moment studying their hopeful faces
yeah im staying
if only to keep you guys out of trouble
they walk off and just as they round a corner a bang is heard as one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell
drew jumps spinning around in the direction of the sound
are you allright
yeah im just a little on edge thats all
ever since i got to the temple some nut has been attacking me with a stick at night in the toilet
its driving me crazy
gao and li look at each other nodding
honest its happening
every class of disciples the one with the most potential is singled out for special training
we were wondering who it was
now we know
gao and li nod and drew walks with them shaking his head
in the b
comes drew dressed in his monastic robes no hat on his head
he is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk
drew walks up to ashema and takes her hand and they stand like that for a moment
she then turns to him and starts to say something
drew stops her with a finger on her lips then strokes her cheek
ashema beautiful ashema i cant see you anymore
miss you and remember you
ashema closes her eyes against the tears there and buries her head against drews shoulder
are they making you do this
she wants to hear that they are even if its not true
she needs to hear it
drew pulls her head away from his shoulder looking into her eyes
it would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this
it is my choice and my responsibility
he embraces her for the last time and she openly begins to cry
he holds her for a moment then breaks the embrace and with one last long look at ashema walks away
in the b
comes up and corrects his technique and drew immediately does it his way
he is doing well jumping from pole to pole kicking and punching
he tries an especially difficult sequence of moves and falls with a thump to the ground
immediately he is back up and onto the poles
he tries the same set of moves falls again
instead of being angry drew just laughs at himself then climbs back up on the poles
in the b
is a huge bronze buddha
drew is in the same position as the buddha
he fills them up and then starts moving back towards the temple his arms up and strong
as he goes through a thicket of bamboo
as he gets to the center he is attacked
the staff comes out but drew manages to block it with one of the buckets
the staff strikes again and drew blocks again
a third time and drew raises both buckets over his head to block it and drenches himself with the water
then the staff hits him in the stomach
his attacker has vanished leaving drew alternately moaning from the pain and chuckling at himself in the bamboo
as they go through a very intricate beautifully staged series of techniques
the last technique is a very powerful kick and one which drew is to block using the blocking technique he refused to learn before
this time the kick is thrown and drew blocks it with the new technique sending li pitching to the ground is a cloud of dust
drew turns around and high fives gao
drew is next in line and he moves through the techniques without a mistake
when he gets to the end of the routine he breaks into a little dance step having fun
the entire group breaks up in laughter
gaos hands are around his elbow pulling down
using your muscles bend my arm
gao pulls down while the d
tries to fight back with his muscles but finally after great strain his arm bends
a cheer goes up from the group
smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his place
the old man puts his arm up on gaos shoulder and takes a deep breath
he does not tense up his arm and shoulder
gao looks questioning at the d
what if i hurt him
you will not
gao starts to pull down gently at first but when he sees that the old monks arm is not bending stronger until finally he is putting all his strength into
the old monks arm has not moved and his expression of relaxation and piece has not changed
gao quits not able to bend the arm
motions for drew to get on the other side of the monk
grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance
drew and gao shrug at each other and take an arm
they pull and push straining and groaning but there is no movement from the old monk
it is like he is a heavy stone
they give up and the d
bows to the old monk
master shus spirit is indeed strong
sweating from their efforts
drew is on the ground trying to do a kip
he is coming up but then is crashing back down onto his spine
comes up to him and points at his chest
try to hit me here with your feet
drew tries another kip pushing his feet towards the d
he lands on his feet easily surprised
he carries them out to the garbage area and begins to scrape them off
from out of nowhere comes the staff swinging for drew
drew doesnt jump but just calmly avoids it
the staff whooshes over his head
drew stands up and the staff comes again from a different direction
drew avoids and the staff finds empty air again
drew goes on with cleaning the plates a slight smile on his face
after a beat he looks around trying to find the attacker
when he is sure no one is around he smiles bigger
i did it
as soon as he finishes saying that the staff comes out and slams him in the stomach sending drew to his knees in pain
the sequences are very beautiful as the monks throw kicks into the air and into targets
drew is rushing li throwing every possible technique at him which he blocks
li gets into a low stance as he goes back and drew takes this opportunity he uses lis own leg as a step and jumps off of it hitting him
hard with a jump spin hook
li gets up right away and slaps drews hand
a group of monks drew in the lead come running down the path barefoot in the snow
throwing kicks and punches at icicles hanging from rocks on a cliff
slow motion as the disciples shatter the ice
they are singing again but this time the song is in chinese
drew is in the middle and gao is straining to bend his relaxed arm
he is getting the hang of it
walks up with another monk with a spear
together they position a wooden target
the monk bows to d
and to the rest of the disciples then positions the point of the spear in the hollow of his neck
he then hands the shaft of the spear to the d
holds the shaft and starts to push bending the spear slowly but surely
the spear is now almost bent double
with a flick of his head the spear goes flying into the target positioned behind him its point finding the bulls eye
drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point is imbedded deep into the wood of the target
bowing boy his spirit is strong
set against a deep blue sky it could be spinning anywhere but the camera pulls back to reveal the shaolin temple forest of stupa where the disciples are having a
pick up football game its sunday the disciples afternoon off
the football spins into the hands of gao who drops it
drew runs over showing gao how to catch the ball and how to make the cuts he has to make no dialogue music over
gao follows drews instructions then they run the play
this time gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown
drew runs up and high fives gao then teaches him how to spike the ball
they are playing some more having a great time
this time drew goes out for a pass with gao playing defense
li throws the pass and gao intercepts
drew laughing goes after gao
who goes long for a pass which gao lets fly
it is immediately obvious that it is way too long
who is walking along through the stupa meditating as he walks
who stops running and sees san de
the ball is going towards san de
the ball is heading right for his head
they are bracing for the impact and the trouble it will cause
who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional receiver
he holds the ball and looks right at drew a very stern look on his face
expecting the worst
his stern face now taking on a mischevious look
he hefts the ball and puts his fingers on the laces
drew pauses for a moment not sure what san de said until san de motions with his left hand like a nfl quarterback for drew to go out
he takes off sprinting with gao covering him like a blanket
san de throws the ball to him in a perfect spiral to a spot where gao has no play on the throw and drew catches it in stride
san de immediately returns to his meditation while drew and the others stand around dumbstruck
they come to a stream and there by a stream is a beautiful young woman who cant get across the stream without getting her clothes soaked
without thinking twice drew allows her to get on his back and carries her across the river
he deposits her on the other side and then continues running
gao and li run up next to drew and together they go back to the temple
when they stop outside the temple they are breathing heavily
finally catching his breath gao turns to drew
i cant believe you carried that girl over the stream
after all the trouble you got into
are you crazy
you almost got kicked out once over that kind of thing
drew smiles slightly
i left that girl at the stream
are you two still carrying her
he turns and walks away leaving li and gao to puzzle that one out
as he walks away san de comes out from behind a pillar where he had been sweeping smiling and nodding his head at drews answer
the action is fast and furious
who are squared off and fighting
they are intense and the techniques they are throwing are full power
drew hits gao and he bends over
drew closes thinking that he has gao at his mercy
at the last minute gao stands up and cold cocks drew who sags to the ground
who is trying to get his bearings
lucky shot slant eye
who gives him a mean look
you stink american
who stands up mad
youre dead meat
he comes at gao and they start fighting again throwing all kinds of acrobatic kicks and techniques
a gong sounds o
and gao and drew stop bow to each other and then embrace smiling
saved by the bell
i had you
drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water and to towel off
as he rubs his neck d
comes up to him
san de wants to see you in his chambers
drew raises his eyebrows then looks over at gao and li
he rolls up his towel and snaps gao with it as he walks by
i wonder what you did now
san de has an ornately embroidered golden box in his hand and he is showing it to drew
you are to deliver this scroll to the arhat living on the jade mountain
this is your quest
the scroll that is in this box is more precious than life
guard it well
i will master
if you deliver this you may ask this master the most advanced monk of the shaolin tradition any question you wish and he must answer it
san de takes out a map of the area
this map will lead you to the jade mountain
let nothing deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll
you leave first thing tomorrow morning
beat you must return within three day
or dont bother to return at all
san de stands and bows to drew
drew returns the bow takes the map and the box then leaves the chamber
he is off on his quest
the sun is high in the sky and the scenery behind is incredibly beautiful guilin
he goes over to a drink stand and buys a cool drink
just as he is about to drink it down it is knocked from his hand
drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader the one who hit the glass
they are yelling at drew in chinese which he doesnt understand
ok boys just let me get my glass and
drew not looking for trouble bends down to pick up the glass and the leader kicks him in the rear end sending him pitching to the ground
drew rolls to a standing position and the five men close on him
a crowd is now starting to form eager to watch how the monk handles this situation
the thugs come after drew and the leader throws a roundhouse punch hitting drew square in the jaw
they continue to attack while drew tries to avoid getting hit
drew catches a haymaker and he spins and drops and the thugs laugh kick him a couple of times and then kick dust and dirt onto him
drew doesnt get up
they soon tire of the sport and move on the crowd staring at drew in pity
to himself this humble not fighting stuff is harder and more painful than it looks
who have now spotted a man and his young son
they are both loaded down with goods from the store and the thugs stop them
they take the things from them and start to walk off
the father tries to fight back but they easily beat him up sending him into the dirt
the young boy runs forward
the leader of the thugs raises his hand ready to slap the boys face
before he can bring his arm forward drews fingers come around his wrist stopping it
oh i dont think so
its getting good now
the fight starts and this time drew is unencumbered by vows of non violence
he has a cause and hes enjoying every minute of the fight
it is over quickly as drew is a superb fighter using incredible techniques
the thugs limp away leaving drew with the little boy and his father
drew bends down and picks up the goods handing them back to the boy and the father
drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy looking deep into his eyes
a whisper is going through the crowd shaolin
drew touches the boys cheek smiles then stands up and bows
he moves on the crowd watching him walk away
he now has a hero
as he climbs the side of a mountain
it is dark around him with vague forms of the temple columns and statues
drew is sitting with his eyes closed oblivious to his surroundings
he is throwing kicks and going through his routines concentrating on his breathing
as he finishes a particularly strenuous series he strips off his clothes and dives into the lake
as drews head breaks the surface of the lake he is surprised to see a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes
drew starts to get out of the lake then remembers that he is naked he stops not quite knowing what to do
he goes as close to the shore as he can without coming out of the water
the woman just smiles and starts to strip off what clothing she has on
she is very sexy
no dont do that
im a monk
ive taken a vow to abstain
no one will know
throw me my clothes please
pouting the woman takes drews pants and tosses them to him but they land purposely about feet away from the lake edge
who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a cover
he gets up and hurries to where his pants are
he starts to put them on and the woman is all over him trying to seduce him
he takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye
despite the fact that this is every teenage boys dream come true i cant
he lowers her hands and her head drops pouting
besides if i were to break my vows it would not be with you
he kisses her on the forehead and then grabs the rest of his clothes running up the path away from the lake
drew walks up to the front of the temple looks around for a moment then takes a drink of water from the well out front
just as he starts to drink a huge tour bus pulls up in front air brakes hissing
before he can react the doors open and a bunch of american tourists pile out of the bus and rush into the temple jostling drew from side to side
not another temple
do they have a gift shop
how do you say gift shop
you have minutes to be back on the bus
the wave of tourists passes drew and he stands there looking after them
then as a group they realize that they just passes a monk and turn back to drew
a real live monk
somebody take my picture
the tourist runs up to where drew is and stands next to him
the cameras click and whirr and drew is thoroughly embarrassed
when the first pictures are over and someone else wants to stand next to him he raises his hands up to his face and bows
oh mi two fwo he then turns and walks away
monks dont like to be bothered they are from a different world
drew stands at the side of the waterfall studying his map
from his expression we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get where he is going
drew pockets the map checks that the box is safely in place then starts toward the waterfall
the drop off the side of the waterfall is incedible steep and deadly
as he enters the waterfall
the water hits his back almost pitching him into the abyss
drew concentrates and moves forward slowly but surely
he emerges on the other side only to be confronted by a swamp
jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps
drew examines the distance between the objects realizing that he can jump from place to place and make it across
just like at the temple
he starts out jumping onto the first stone then moving on to the others
he almost falls a couple of times but regains his balance
he gets a rythm going and is soon almost halfway across
he gets to one particular rock only to find out that its the head of an alligator
its mouth opens to bite him
drew jumps off it quickly onto a tree stump
when he lands on the stump he examines it carefully to make sure it isnt something else
he continues across more careful this time
it is much steeper now and the going is much tougher
as he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge the way to the arhat
drew smiles stashes the map and starts across the rope bridge hand over hand
he looks down once at the drop then forces himself to look straight ahead
he just starts across when the rope bends and jumps
drew turns around to see a man right behind him
is this rope strong enough for both of us
no answer from the man who is now pushing drew to go faster
he is inching up closer to him and occassionally kicking him to go quicker
ok ok im going
which is starting to fray from the weight
who sees that and is hurrying
the rope is fraying more and when drew is almost there the rope snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain
who slams into the wall hard
when he hits the scroll pops out of his pocket and goes up in the air
drew groggy from the impact manages to lash out and pin the scroll to the cliff wall with the back of his hand
who is barely hanging on just below drew
he has his hand out to drew for help
who doesnt know what to do
if he tries to save the scroll the man might fall
if he goes for the man the box will certainly fall
screaming for help
drew hears the headmasters voice
the scroll that is in this box is more precious than life
guard it well
he looks down at the man who is about to lose it
what the heck
drew reaches down for the mans hand letting the box fall
their hands meet and drew pulls him up
as it spins down into the abyss
as drew pulls him up onto his back and carries him up the rope to the other side of the gorge
they look at each other and smile but drew is anything but happy
what am i going to tell the arhat
there is no bounce to his step and he is dreading this audience
drew walks up to the entrance looks around
he doesnt see anyone
he walks into the hut
he walks through the rooms looking at all the books and scrolls littered around the room
maybe he wont miss one little scroll
he shakes his head and starts for the front door
the view is incredible
drew stands looking at the view and slowly becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him
he looks down and it is the arhat
i apologize i did not see you
the arhat says nothing but just puts out his hand for the scroll
drew bows again and gets down on his knees
i failed master
a person was in danger
the arhat holds up his hand and drew stops talking
of course youre right
drew bows once more and is ready to leave
the arhat reaches into his robes and pulls out the embroidered box that drew was given at the temple
you have it
the arhat holds up the box in front of drew for a moment then tears it in two with his hands scattering the pieces to the winds
so i didnt fail huh
beat i can ask my question then
the arhat sits without moving or speaking
drew takes that as a yes
what is the meaning of life
the arhat ponders that for a moment then smiles and puts his sandles on his head and stands up
what is life
what is reality
the head of a dead cat
he walks off leaving drew sitting there dumbstruck by the answer
smiling ruefully i just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning of life
he shakes his head and gets up following the arhat
the arhat is standing on the other side of his hut the sandles still on his head
for forty years shaolin disciples have made their quest to deliver a scroll to me
you are not chinese
i notice the littlest details
how many succeeded
you chose correctly
nothing is more precious than human life
but i didnt obey
smiling slightly at the beginning of your training you were to obey without question
now as you become a shaolin you must learn to question everything and obey yourself
drew and the monk bow to each other the sunset over the mountain in the b
the arhat is already out there moving through his gong fu moves
i have to leave
what is the easiest way to get back to the temple
drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that brought him to the hut
the arhat runs after him grabs his sleeve and pulls him over to a place behind his hut
after all he went through to get there
bus stops every min
will take you straight to the temple
drew smiles and shakes his head then bows to the arhat
the arhat returns the bow
thank you master
they should give you a bus schedule with that map
he walks off to the hut while drew makes his way down to the bus stop
he is dirty weary but triumphant
as he walks back through the temple to san des chambers to report he sees a group of people walking out the other way
the group is made up of the thugs who attacked him the woman by the lake and the man from the bridge
they are talking together on their way out
smiling as he realizes that it was all a test every moment of it
they are expert fighters now and they move through the complicated routines with ease
hitting the ground and rolling then coming up and throwing a shuriken at a target
the throwing star hits the target dead center
manipulating the spear like a master
up on the poles again
only this time squared off against him is li
they move from pole to pole throwing kicks and punches at each other
is standing in front of them
weve got to rebuild this
beat tear it down
smiles grow on the faces of the disciples
they rush into the building
different shots of the monks tearing the building apart with kicks and punches
shots of drew gao and li kicking through walls through doors through windows etc
some the three of them destroy together others are seperate
several shots of disciples as they concentrate on particularly difficult things using their chi smashing the bricks and wood apart
they are destroying the building and they are having a great time
note great place for hot song over this scene pull back to reveal drew standing there calmly while two full sized disciples hang off his arm
he is going nowhere in particular just walking and thinking
suddenly out of nowhere comes the staff and the attack
drew calmly avoids the first few strikes blocks a couple more then grabs the staff and pulls
out comes the d
into the night on the other end of the staff
he looks proudly at drew
as he smiles and bows in respect to drew
drew returns his bow
the camera follows the sweeping brush as it ends with a flourish
the camera pulls back to reveal the temple courtyard where san de and the d
are standing in front of the group of disciples
only one trial remains before you become full fledged fighting monks
the wooden man chamber
they are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber
i warn you all any monk who fails must leave the temple forever and will never be called shaolin
san de pauses letting this remark sink in
disciple drew carson as you will return to america and never intended to live as a monk in the temple you need not enter the chamber
who rises to the challenge
master san de i am part of the disciple class am i not
san de nods
then i must pass this final test
furthermore i request that i be the first one through
very proud your request is granted
in front of the entrance to the wooden man chamber
san de and d
are flanking drew as he pauses in front of the door
drew turns to look at san de and the d
smacks drew in the back of the head
what did you do that for
my last chance when you come out the other side we will be equals
drew smiles at the d
s attempt to lighten him up
he turns to look at the others from his disciple class then opens the door and goes through
drew pauses for a moment examining the room
it is filled with wooden statues of monks all in different fighting positions
the carvings are precise and incredibly beautiful
their arms open hands fists and legs are fashioned out of hard wood and they look very dangerous indeed
drew gathers himself for a moment then starts into the chamber
as it presses down on one of the stones of the floor
the attacks start from all sides as the wooden statues come to life spinning lunging and striking
drew is caught off guard and is hit several times driven back to the door of the chamber
the statues stop moving
drew a little scared tries to remember the sequence of the statues letting his arms practice for the attacks
there is fear in his eyes
he starts in again and the attacks come again but they are different this time
drew is clobbered
driven back to the door drew slumps against the wall
his face is already bruised and bleeding
whispering i cant do it
there is no cant only wont
including the one where drew succeeded in evading them
who gathers himself straightens up and takes a deep breath forcing it out in a breathing exercise
i am a shaolin monk
he enters the chamber again and the attacks start again
drew however is prepared both mentally and physically
he blocks avoids rolls jumps and redirects the attacks on him making his way across
he is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him
drew caught a little off guard quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way
suddenly as he turns and tries to get his breath two huge deadly spears are streaking towards him
drew blocks the spears with his arms misdirecting them into the wall behind him
they thwock into the wall sticking there
as he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues a volley of arrows comes hurtling towards him
drew blocks some avoids others and catches one in each hand
he throws them down and continues on
he goes past the few remaining statues and is out of the wooden man chamber
all that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door
drew looks behind him then starts to walk
he goes cautiously expecting a trap or a trick
he gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door
he spots a handhold near the top of the door and pulls it with his hand
immediately his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling drops right onto his arm forcing it down
drew fights back with his muscles the veins popping out in his arms and neck
behind him a statue has started coming towards him spinning like a dervish
its fists and legs are extended and they are deadly
the panel drops lower and lower
as he relaxes his face and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body letting his inner energy take over
as it slows with a grinding noise then stops
holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm his face and body completely relaxed
the panel goes back up into the ceiling and the door opens
the whirling statue slows and then stops altogether
drew reaches up with a hook kick and taps it in the face
not this time
drew quickly walks through the door
drew is there each time to embrace them and congratulate them
there are a few missing from their ranks monks who did not make it through the chamber but the majority of them are there
the entire temple is gathered to watch the ceremony
san de and d
are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes
after he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements including the waving of smoking incense over them san de spreads his hands you are now shaolin
we welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks
a roar rises from the assembled monks and fireworks go off all around
where a huge red sheet is pulled back to reveal tables laden with chinese dishes wine and other foods
the party gets going and is soon in full gear
as they congratulate themselves and gorge themselves on the huge tables of chinese food
they are enjoying themselves
this only happens once every couple of years and the monks are intent on enjoying themselves
who is walking towards the side of the temple away from the party
who sees him leave
he excuses himself from his group
who is walking in the bamboo grove his hands behind him
drew walks up to him and they bow
i wouldnt have made it through without you
beat you once asked why i came here why did you let me in
do you remember the story you heard about the monk who would not leave
that monk was me
who digests this
he smiles a little
i would like to ask a favor
before you leave for american can you help at an international tournament in beijing
the shaolin temple has an entry and he will be fighting men from all over the world id like you to be there
he smiles without pause
now a friend would like to see you
from out of the bamboo grove comes ashema her hands in front of her and her head down
she is not sure drew wants to see her
drew looks at her then back to san de but he is already gone
they are alone
drew walks to her takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look at her face
her eyes are full of love and tenderness and a little fear
drew kisses that fear away
one large raised ring is in the middle of the floor the place for the finals
where li gao san de d
and some others are waiting
they are all in monastic garb
drew and ashema walk up to them holding hands
drew is dressed in a fighting monks costume as well and he bows to his fellow monks
are we late
the fight has not yet started
did you think he would get into the finals
who could know
he fights the winner of the western countries which is why i wanted you here
ill help any way i can
as it parts to let someone through
drew turns casually to look at the competitor
slowly a figure followed by a large group of people comes clear
it is trevor
who is stunned
could he have known
who spots drew standing near the ring
he walks past him trying to place his face
then he comes back and walks right up to drew and slaps him on the back
i cant believe it
i come half way around the world and run into you
i heard you left the city but i didnt know losing to me drove you into being a monk
drew is dumbstruck and trevor takes advantage of it
to san de he take a vow of silence too
nice hair drew
he looks at ashema if he took a vow of chastity too honey you see me after this fight kay
he puts his arm around ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her rear end
wish me luck huh
he walks off and drew who still hasnt said a word stares after him
all of the monks are looking at drew with questioning looks everyone that is except for san de
as trevor and the shaolin entry bow to each other
the fight begins
it isnt even close
trevor is better than he ever was
he is incredible and he destroys the shaolin fighter
oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd he plays with the shaolin fighter making him look like a real fool
who is watching the destruction
behind his eyes he is reliving his humiliation
who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique and then immediately plays to the crowd right in front of drew and the referee comes over to trevor and
raises his fist up in victory
trevor tears his arm away and screams to the crowd the crowd which before was wild and booing now grows quiet
i want him
he points right at drew
i want to face the american who is now a shaolin monk
i want to learn at the hands of a master
the crowd who has seen drew and heard about him for quite a while warms to the prospect
they start cheering for the american shaolin to face trevor
i want the american shaolin
who doesnt know what to do
san de appears and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder
pointing and yelling for drew
who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring
the crowd is going crazy eager to see the match
drew oblivious to the crowd walks over to trevor
i came to the shaolin temple because of you trevor
you humiliated me and i wanted to make sure it could never happen again
so lets see what youve learned
shaking his head ive learned that
theres nothing to prove
beating you is no longer important
it was my ego that had to be defeated not you
youre just chicken
the arts should never be about who is best they are too important for that
he bows to trevor and starts out of the ring
they dont know whats going on
they dont know either
they want drew to fight him
who know what is happening and are proud of drew prouder than they have ever been
come back here
you cant just walk away
drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where san de is standing
they bow and the pride is shining in san des eyes
do you turn away from him out of fear
who is seething
i thought the shaolin monks were warriors not babies
look at him he is too scared to face me
his face calm
i will not fight for personal glory or for my ego
you have learned much
the shaolin monks are pussies
who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head
you did the right thing
how about you baldy
he is pointing at li and gao and the others who are itching to climb into the ring
gao goes over to san de and shoots a questioning look at drew
master the american is insulting the temple and the fighting monks
looking at drew what should be done
someone should face him in combat
for the tradition of the temple
san de looks at drew long and hard
there are some times when a shaolin must fight and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson
who understands the implication of what he is saying
he starts to smile slowly
its your call
drew nods then turns to face the ring where trevor is still standing trying to get someone to fight him
drew walks with gao back to the side of the ring
he turns to gao and li and together they high five
for the temple
drew climbs into the ring
the crowd is going crazy
trevor has a predators grin on his face as he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match
immediately his contingent of people start to work on him massage drinks etc
who sits alone in the other corner
who see the difference
immediately they mobilize the other monks
who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd and rushes up to give it to drew
as it is flooded with monks
some of them are massaging drew painfully others are stretching his legs out others waving towels to bring air to him etc
the referee signals for the fighters to come to the center
they do and he motions for them to bow to each other
remember last time punk
nothing exists but the moment and
beat im going to enjoy it
they back up and the fight begins
trevor attacks hard but drew avoids easily using all soft gong fu
he continues to attack throwing flashy technique after flashy technique but he cant touch drew
stay still dammit
stand and fight
and he dances out of the way
trevor is getting more and more angry
soon drew tires of this game and decides to end this quickly
he goes after trevor and it is immediately obvious that trevor is completely outclassed
drew scores on trevor at will and soon has trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of high kicks takedowns flips and punches
trevor drops to one knee his hands down at his side note even bothering to defend himself
drew grabs trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist
he is going to put him out with a good old fashioned roundhouse punch
yelling for the knock out blow
worried about this latest development
instead however drew smiles and lifts trevor up and shakes his hand putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd
trevor looks into drews face wondering why drew would do such a thing
when he sees drews friendly face he knows
to teach him a lesson
trevor smiles and holds up drews hand as the champion
the crowd goes crazy
who also get the message
who knew the message all along
drew and trevor standing together in the center
the monks on the side climb into the ring to celebrate with drew
he is doing the beginning of a shaolin form
when he finishes the salute a figure comes toward him
it is san de and he has something in his hands
drew bows to san de and san de holds the golden sash out to him
drew takes it and san de bows to him
drew cant stand it anymore and rushes up to san de
he gives him a hug
who is not used to shows of affection
he is lost for a moment then his face softens and he returns drews embrace
they break and bow again and san de moves off
drew stands there holding the golden sash the rising sun of the first day of the rest of his life shining in the b
who comes up to drew taking his arm and walks with him along the great wall
