by jonathan mostow march revised first draft of a video camera
the screwdriver blade of a swiss army knife enters frame methodically tightening a row of screws
pull back to reveal on the backslope of a mound of rubble a three man tv crew field producer reporter and cameraman all wearing flak jackets waits while the cameraman
jeffrey taylor works to repair his malfunctioning minicam
throughout this sequence rod the reporter types on a laptop computer oblivious to what is happening around him
howard the field producer lies on his stomach peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars
beyond him we see an empty street
it is lined with buildings blasted by shells a sawtooth wall in the f
a ruined high rise at the end of the street billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language
how about it jeff
jeff finishes his repair job snaps the minicam closed
jeff slips the knife back in his pocket scrambles over the loose bricks and stones to a position next to howard
a frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the wall
she is young in her early twenties with shining dark hair down to her shoulders
shes carrying an armload of books
jeff focuses the minicam
framed in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman
jeff ignores howard pans the minicam down the street
in the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal
a row of blasted windows
in one of the windows a sniper crouches
sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel
matter of fact sniper
window in the middle
looking through his binoculars stay on him
stay on him
now go back to the woman
jeff swings the minicam and the image blurs then holds steady on the frightened woman
nervously she peeks around the corner
back to the sniper
stay tight on the sniper
jesus look at him
hes about fourteen
dont lose this
jeff kneels on the ridge minicam on his shoulder
jeffs minicam zooms in on the sniper
the sniper sees the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position
he sees her
stay on her
if she runs widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame
jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at howard
i said he sees her
i heard you
stay on her
jeff looks to rod for support but hes busy typing oblivious
jeff hesitates then lifts the minicam to his eye again
the sniper taking aim
the frightened woman decides to make a dash for it
she takes off her high heeled shoes inhales deeply gathering herself to run
jeff watches through his viewfinder under his breath no
the frightened woman bolts sprinting barefoot across the cobblestones skirt lifted slender legs flashing
jeff jumps to his feet waves the minicam shouting sniper
sni the woman looks up in jeffs direction confused breaking stride we hear a burst of automatic gunfire in the window the winking muzzle flash of the snipers the womans
body jolts from the impact of the bullets
the books go flying from her hand
she spins to the pavement her hair billowing
just stands there a shattered expression
the camera hangs at his side
he stares at the dead woman as a pool of dark blood expands around her body
a touches down on the tarmac
a late model jeep cherokee is parked at the arrival curb
amy taylor jeffs wife peers out from behind the wheel scanning the crowd
jeff carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder emerges from the terminal
amy gets out of the car grinning
jeff sees her and hurries over
he drops his bag and they fall into each others arms kissing hungrily
these are two people passionately in love with each other
god i missed you
lets get out of here
wheres your equipment
dont tell me you checked it
holds up his bag this is it
jeff shakes his head no
again jeff shakes his head
amy arches an eyebrow
a modest apartment in the back bay neighborhood
not much furniture but lots of books and cds
on the walls blow ups of arty photographs amy in modeling poses plus many black and white scenery stills
jeffs bag is unopened on the floor
we see two nearly full wine glasses on a table
the camera tracks down a hallway to the open bedroom door
more framed photographs
amy lies in bed curled up against a pillow
the sheets are tangled in post coital disarray the only sign of disorder in this neatly arranged room
amy stirs reaching her hand out toward the other side of the bed which is empty
she opens her eyes surprised to find herself alone
something catches her attention from across the room
she rises pulls a loose robe around herself and pads over to a closed door
she knocks softly
can i come in
a walk in closet has been converted into a small photographic darkroom
moist x prints hang from a clothesline bathed in a warm red glow
the images are moody black and white landscapes
jeff stands over the developer timing a print
amy enters through a thick black curtain behind him
he doesnt look up
jeff shakes his head
amy looks over his shoulder at a landscape photograph in the developing tray
i remember when you took that
we had fun on that trip didnt we
amy looks at him
after a beat you want to talk about it
theres nothing to talk about
i told you
end of story
whatever happened back there wasnt your responsibility
you cant keep beating yourself up over it
he says nothing
what do you think
you could have stopped that girl from getting killed
you dont understand
he stops lifts his eyes
it was different this time
he breaks off and pushes through the curtain
she watches him go
jeff pours himself a glass of milk
amy enters stands on the other side of the counter
jeff doesnt meet her eyes
after a beat i talked to reynolds
a beat he thinks i could still get the job at the san diego station
oh jeff you didnt
think of it
low pressure a steady paycheck
so i shoot city council meetings how bad could it be
she looks at him concerned
is that what you really want or are you just running away
its good money full benefits
im tired of freelance
we could finally put some money in the bank
you know ill never stand in your way
but youve worked so hard
are you sure you want to throw it away
throw what away
dont you get it
i dont do anything
i sit i watch i film i let it happen
youre supposed to let it happen
its your job
its my excuse
she looks at him not understanding
its like i was paralyzed
i wanted to do something but i didnt
i just stood there and watched her get killed
he looks at her emotional
please babe i need this
say yes and well take as long as you want drive cross country and make a vacation out of it
what do you say
amy looks at him considering
we hear a faint rush of wind
then it gets louder
and the metallic grill of the cherokee explodes into frame as the car whooshes over us hurtling down the massachusetts turnpike
in a series of shots with credits over we see landmarks form the cross country trip a pennsylvania dutch farmhouse a smoke spewing factory in ohio the mississippi river kansas
wheat fields loveland pass and the continental divide
the middle of nowhere
sand weeds and sagebrush
a two lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon of asphalt
the cherokee cruises along the road
its massachusetts plates seem out of place in this stark landscape
there are no other vehicles
moving closer we see that jeff is driving
amy is sound asleep in the reclined passenger seat
in back luggage moving boxes camera cases
the air conditioning whispers
on the console are two empty styrofoam mcdonalds coffee cups and a state of the art nikon camera
jeff stretches in the drivers seat
he forces his eyes open fighting sleep
he reaches for the coffee cup
he glances into the back of the jeep
there is a thermos of coffee on the back seat
keeping one hand on the wheel he reaches for the thermos and fumbles it to the floor
he strains to reach it
he doesnt notice
a slow moving dodge ram pickup truck is approaching the highway along a small road that cuts across the desert floor
the pickup equipped with oversized tires roll bar and a cb whip antenna bounces over the uneven terrain and turns onto the highway stopping just before entering jeffs lane
jeff glances up just in time to see the ram lurch into the road in front of him
jeff drops the thermos and spins the wheel
amys eyes fly open the cherokee goes into a wild looping skid
the ram jerks to a halt as the cherokee whips past averting a collision by inches
jeff expels a breath
amy turns to see the pickup stopped in the road
she looks at him concerned
i took my eyes off the road
seeing thermos on floor maybe its time we took a break you know
jeff nods looks in the rearview mirror
halted in the middle of the road
inside dimly visible through tinted windows are two figures in cowboy hats
the driver leans out the window and gives jeff the finger
angry at himself
he looks over at amy
ill pull over next chance we get
a beat sorry
he glances in the rearview again still a bit shaken
a small desert gas station mini mart just off the highway
a sign over the building last gas for miles
the cherokee is parked at the pumps hood raised
jeff comes out of the mini mart carrying a plastic quart of oil
he unscrews the cap and starts to fill the crankcase careful not to spill on the new engine
in the b
amy is visible inside the store browsing a magazine rack
amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide the desert southwest
a truck driver stands nearby perusing the magazines
he glances in amys direction notices what shes reading
amy looks up at him
hes ish plain looking friendly wearing a u
logo baseball cap
were moving actually
shes not used to talking with strangers but the guy seems harmless enough
we thought wed take the scenic route
in that case you oughta try the pass road bout thirty miles west
real pretty makes a loop through the hills then hooks back up with the highway
amy smiles politely moves toward the cash register
ill mention it to my husband
the trucker tips his cap
enjoy the rest of your trip
as jeff continues pouring the oil he doesnt notice the mud streaked dodge ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him
the driver earl climbs out
the other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up
earl is a beefy man about jeffs age
he wears a sweat stained western hat cowboy boots and a t shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps
he saunters over to the cherokee stands there a beat looking over jeffs shoulder
jeff senses something behind him turns
his eyes widen as he sees earl recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before
earl stares at him unsmiling
flatly nice car
jeff is in an awkward position
hes got a half full upside down bottle of oil in his hands
if he lifts it now hell spill on the engine
he turns his gaze back to the engine decides to keep pouring
earl steps around to the open passenger window peers in
jeff watches him wary
leather i guess you sprung for the whole nine yards
then again out here what you really needs a c
is that right
the oil bottle empties out
relieved jeff pulls it away and screws back on the crankcase cap
he shuts the hood with a thunk and moves around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle from the tank
earl blocks his path
course if you use a c
you gotta have a handle
jeff says nothing
this is not a friendly conversation
how about shit for brains
beat you damn near killed us back there boy
look im sorry i didnt see you
you pulled out in front of me
the hell i did
i saw what happened
looking past earl jeff sees amy come out of the mini mart with a bag of groceries
he speaks carefully anxious to avoid a confrontation
how about if we just forget it okay
im sorry it happened
i dont want any trouble
i bet you dont
earl glares at jeff before turning away
he passes amy gives her a broad smile
caught this fellow tryin to steal your cherokee
amy takes in the situation
she nods politely
earl continues into the mini mart
she approaches jeff puzzled
what was that about
guy in the truck
thinks i tried to hit him
jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup who has not moved during the scene
he looks back at the mini mart
cmon lets go
you want me to drive
just get in
is something wrong
no lets just go
jeff climbs in behind the wheel
amy glances at him and gets in the car
jeff keys the ignition and pulls away
as jeff steers back onto the highway he glances in the rear view mirror sees earl coming out of the mini mart staring after the disappearing jeep
jeff shifts in his seat relieved to be getting away from there
amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to then then
this isnt the grand prix you know
jeff releases his foot from the accelerator
the needle sinks back down to
she gives him a long contemplative look
whats bothering you
i told you
pause the guy was an asshole
keeping an eye on the rear view mirror jeff nods toward the grocery bag trying to change the subject
whatd you get
amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food
junk food fiesta
sno balls yoo hoo moon pies
can you believe they still make this stuff
its probably gourmet cuisine around here
far below us the cherokee traces the empty highway
there are no buildings no houses no other vehicles
jeff drives in silence
amy stares out the window bored
looking for a distraction she picks up a cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label
trying to brighten the mood this is crazy
look at this
says if you win this mail in contest you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts
she gives him a playful glance
what would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts
jeff shrugs disinterested
sell em for thirty cents each and pay off this car
beat alright what about ninety thousand dollars
what would you do with that
jeff stares out the window
hes not into this
i dont know
look amy im not suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them sonofabitch
he stole my camera
the redneck at the gas station
he lifted it right under my nose
my brand new nikon
pounds wheel in frustration goddammit
should we go back
whats the use
hes probably halfway to bumblefuck now the bastard
look maybe if we call the cops jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks
what the hell
the car gives another jolt
whatd you do
i a warning light flashes on the instrument panel
the brakes and steering lose power
the engine quits cold
hang on i cant steer
the car bucks and screeches
after a few hiccups it jerks to a halt just beyond a crest in the road
for a moment they sit there dazed staring ahead at the empty road
then amy notices an object on the floor the nikon
she picks it up
deadpan found your camera
he rolls his eyes
he yanks the hood release and gets out
steam pours from under the hood of the cherokee
amy gets out and looks around at the scorched wasteland
jeff goes to the front of the car gropes under the hood for the release latch
he yanks his hand away burned by the hot metal
are you okay
amy moves to jeff to examine the burn
she reaches out
annoyed i said im fine okay
jeff lifts the hood examines the engine
he tugs on a cable checks the battery connection and radiator
he goes to the passengers side and takes a hand held cellular phone from the glove box
he dials zero and hits send
the phone beeps
out of range
jeff grunts tosses the phone on the seat
it bounces and lands on the floor
amy watches as he returns to the engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap
whats going on jeff
whats it look like
im trying to fix the car
not the car
whats going on with you
jeff busies himself with the engine not answering
its been a month since you got back
you cant keep shutting me out like this
jeff says nothing
jeff im talking to you
flaring look i really dont want to go into this right now
im changing jobs our finances are fucked and were stuck in the middle of nowhere
so could we maybe just fix the he stops in mid sentence
there is a rumble in the distance
they look down the road
christ not these guys
approaching fast on the road
as it streaks past earl yells and launches a beer bottle from the window
the bottle shatters on the asphalt
watching the ram speed away
looking down the road jeff a quarter mile away the pickup is slowing
it pulls a u turn and stops facing the cherokee
it just sits there engine idling
what the hell
whats he doing
i dont know
jeff watches the pickup frowning
then from the opposite direction they hear a low rumble
they turn and stare at
coming over a crest in the road
its a huge eighteen wheeler
a white peterbilt
it grinds into low gear and slows brakes creaking
the truck comes to a halt with a hiss of compressed air
the pickup starts up again
it pulls another u turn and drives away melting into the desert
breathes a sigh of relief
the driver dismounts from the cab leaving the engine idling
we recognize him as the trucker in the mini mart
he removes his cap revealing a shock of prematurely white hair
he is well shaven his clothes immaculate
his name is red
you folks all right
our car broke down
chuckling i figured that much
you want a hand pushing it off the road
thanks id appreciate it
amy you want to steer
amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral
jeff and red push the car to the shoulder
as they push jeff glances at the cb antenna on reds cab
think you could radio a tow truck for us
i sure would if i could mister but my c
blew a fuse this morning
im waiting till i hit the truck stop on i to get it fixed
how far is that
red walks around to the front of the car and peers down at the exposed engine
id offer to take a look but its hard to say with these new engines
used to be you could give em a kick and a holler and theyd start right up
now its all computers and chips
its a new car
that could be the problem
you been running it pretty fast
amy gives jeff a reprimanding look
its subtle but red notices
tell you what
if you want a ride theres a little diner up the road
they got a pay phone
you could call a tow truck from there
jeff considers this glances back to where the dodge ram was last seen
nice of you to offer
but weve got a lot of stuff in the car
i think were better off waiting for a cop to come along
amy rolls her eyes
red sees the look trying not to smile
he glances up at a small plane flying overhead
casually suit yourself
not many cops on this road thats why the truckers use it
maybe youll get lucky
tipping his cap good luck
he turns and heads back toward his truck
amy looks at jeff
she waits till the trucker is out of earshot
are you nuts
we dont know this guy
hes offering to help
it could be hours before anyone else comes along
you really want to be stuck out here
amy ive got my equipment in the car
all our stuff
what if those guys come back and were not here
turns away quietly to himself jesus
dont be stupid
amy hears this
shes had enough
stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride
in the b
the truck is throttling up
then mad and careless stupid was letting you talk me into leaving boston
she turns away
the truck starts to pull out
she bites her lip thinking then steps into the road and flags the truck down
do you think you could drop me at that diner
surprised sure thing
how about you mister
i could take you both just as easy
my husband wants to stay with the car
ill just get my purse
she goes to the passenger side of the jeep for her purse
jeff follows lowering his voice
what do you think youre doing
im going to the diner
im going to call a tow truck
then im going to order an iced tea and wait
good bye jeff
firm youre not riding with that guy
end of story
you wanted to be alone
why dont you take the time to get your head together
she walks to the truck
jeff stands there
she climbs into the cab
red moves some papers out of the way
watch your step maam
she pulls the door shut
the truck throttles up and pulls away
jeff watches the truck dwindle in the distance flashers blinking
after a beat the flashers cease
beneath a blazing sun jeff paces restlessly in front of the cherokee checking his watch wiping beads of sweat from his face
he looks down the highway
nothing in sight
extremely bored he wanders over to the raised hood and studies the engine again
after a few moments something catches his eye
curious he kneels down and peers under the chassis
dangling under the engine
oh for christs sake
he pulls his swiss army knife from his pocket and slides under the car
working with the screwdriver blade of the knife he reconnects the plug to its socket
in the process his hands and shirt become stained with grease
jeff slides out from under the car brushes himself off and gets behind the wheel
he tosses the swiss army knife on the center console and keys the ignition
the engine roars to life
the cherokee speeds down the empty highway
jeff drives a determined expression
the jeep blows past
a weather beaten structure with a gravel parking lot
a peeling sign on the roof belles beer food
there is a phone booth outside
the cherokee pulls in and parks
jeff chirps the alarm heads for the entrance
dark and dingy
formica tables a bar
chunky customers in k mart clothes sit at the bar nursing beers and watching a football game on a big muted tv
jeff enters and all conversation stops
the other patrons turn and stare
after a moment they return to their beers
jeff glances around
no sign of amy
no sign of red
a bored looking bartender stands behind the counter preparing a sandwich
behind him a blackboard menu
the bartender looks up a cutting knife in his hand
i was supposed to meet my wife here
the bartender shrugs gives him a look yeah so
dark hair slender about five five
wearing a pale blue benetton shirt
a pale blue what
the bartender plops the sandwich on a plate tears off an order slip
your orders ready
to jeff i been busy
they come and go
it wouldve been within the last half hour
she mightve been with a trucker
guy with a baseball cap
driving an eighteen wheeler
the bartender thinks a moment shakes his head
dont ring a bell
the bartender leans over the counter calls out hey
man heres looking for his wife dark hair button on shirt travelin with a guy in a baseball cap
anybody see em
jeff looks up and down the counter
blank faces a few disinterested shrugs a few headshakes no
a disheveled female barfly flo grins up at him
looks like she got away from ya cowboy
a few of the regulars chuckle at this
jeff ignores them turns back to the bartender
could she have left a message with another one of your employees
dont see how
im the only one who works here
jeff scratches his head
this doesnt make any sense
i dont understand
is there another belles diner
chuckles no siree
jeff clenches his jaw takes another look around
an elderly couple sit at a rear table watching him
they whisper to each other
under his breath shit
he turns and goes outside
jeff squints in the bright sunlight
maybe he got this place confused with a different diner
he peers up at the sign
it says belles all right
he walks to the phone booth looks inside
the phone book is missing
he picks up the receiver listens for the dial tone
phone works okay
he hangs up
he stands there for a moment scanning the horizon in all directions
there is nothing else out here nowhere else she could have gone
jeff marches back into the diner
jeff goes to the bartender
excuse me how far is the next town
about twenty miles
look if my wife comes in her name is amy tell her i was here
tell her to stay put till i get back not to move
would you do that please
shrugs bored okay
jeff regards the bartender skeptically
he takes one last look around then heads out
jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door forgetting to deactivate the alarm
the siren wails
jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if off
the cherokee pulls out of the parking lot kicking up gravel
the stereo is off the windows rolled up
jeff drives his jaw set tightly
the speedometer reads mph
the cherokee crests a rise
and then across the desert plain traveling on another road he sees it
the wheeler that picked up amy
jeff presses the accelerator
the cherokee turns sharply onto the other road
the cherokee speeds down the road gaining on the peterbilt
it comes up behind
jeff honks his horn flashes his lights
cmon you fat ass
either the driver doesnt notice or hes ignoring jeff but the truck does not slow down
jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside the cab
he honks again and waves gesturing for the truck to pull over
but the peterbilt maintains its speed
jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver
its red alright
but hes wearing a different cap
from this angle we cant see into the passenger side of the cab
red peers down at jeff puzzled
jeff shouts at him waves pull over
red suddenly notices something ahead in the road blares his horn
jeff looks up sees an rv camper approaching in the oncoming lane
jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the rv whooshes past in the opposite direction horn blaring
jeff is rattled catching his breath
he swings back onto the road
jeff slips in ahead of the peterbilt then starts weaving and braking forcing the truck to slow
both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop
jeff leaps out of the cherokee and runs over as red climbs down from the empty cab
note throughout this scene various cars and trucks pass in either direction
jesus pal what the hell you doing
i was signaling you to stop
didnt you see me
how thick can this guy be
wheres my wife
where is she
red gives him a puzzled look
how should i know where your wife is
i checked at the diner
no one saw her there
mister i dont know what youre talking about
jeff stares is this guy nuts
you gave her a ride
you were supposed to drop her at belles diner
red searches his memory trying to be as helpful as possible
he shakes his head
how can you not remember
it was just half an hour ago for chrissakes
red gives him a peculiar look
mister i never seen you before in my life
suddenly there is a loud squawk from inside the cab the cb radio
filtered breaker breaker iron man you copy
reacts your radio works locks eyes with red what the hell are you doing
jeff freaks out circling the truck calling loudly amy
you in there
red shrinks back unnerved
look mister i dont know what you want but i want my fucking wife is what i want
what have you done to her
reds eyes dart to something in the distance
jeff catches this turns
cruising toward them
jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves frantically
the patrol car switches on its flash bar and speeds up pulling to a stop behind the peterbilt
sheriff boyd ish climbs out sizing up the situation
jeff runs over
officer i need your help
whats your problem
i dont know this guy has my wife
calm down sir
tell me whats going on
jeff catches his breath
i dont know what the hells going on
last time i saw her she was with this guy in his truck
now hes saying hes never seen her
officer hes crazy i dont know what hes talking about
dont lie you son of a bitch
the sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster
just a precaution
all right everybody just calm down
to jeff sir you want to tell me what happened
our car broke down
this guy stopped to help us said hed drive my wife to a pay phone
but she never showed up
turning to red sir
i dont know officer
im driving along suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife
i swear i never seen the guy before
and you didnt give his wife a ride
the sheriff takes a long look at both of them unsure what to think
he turns back to red
sir all right with you if i search your truck
hell yes officer
go right ahead
names red by the way
pulls out his wallet my permits are all current
you can check em out
that wont be necessary yet
just stand back behind the line
both of you
as red closes his wallet several credit cards fall to the ground
he bends to scoop them up
jeff eyes this suspiciously
the sheriff climbs up into the truck
the sheriff pokes his head inside looks around
pretty much what youd expect in a long haul big rig a cb radio a plastic jesus a map of the u
taped to the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker xs showing where the truck has been
the sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind
a blanket is folded over a foam mattress
a stained pillow rests on top
jeff and red keep a careful eye on each other as the sheriff climbs down from the cab wiping his hands
to both of them all right lets see your license and registration
jeff and red fish into their wallets and hand over i
the sheriff examines them comparing faces to pictures and writing down names
what are you hauling today mr
nothing empty load
im heading to fresno for a pick up ball bearings or something
eyeing him long way to go empty
tell me about it
too much competition nowadays
one horse guys like me gotta drive halfway cross the country just to get a payin job
to sheriff impatient are we gonna keep looking or what
the sheriff hands back the i
yes we are
to red sir im gonna have to see everything
jeff and the sheriff observe as red unlatches two heavy padlocks
grunting he raises the slatted metal door
it retracts along the ceiling with a noisy rattle
the cavernous interior is mostly empty except for a few randomly strewn cardboard boxes too small to contain a person
re boxes those yours
clothes and whatnot
you want to take a look
the sheriff considers it shakes his head
i think were pretty much done here
youre free to go
reacts whoa whoa wait a sec
youre not going to question him anymore
sir i searched the truck
theres no evidence of suspicious activity no sign of struggle
red has been looking on
he chimes in trying to be helpful look i dont mean to butt in but maybe you got my truck confused with someone elses
lunges go to hell you sonofabitch the sheriff grabs jeff holds him back
you want to get arrested
now the man has a point
this is a plain looking john doe truck
maybe you did get them mixed up
jeff stares at the sheriff a beat then bolts suddenly for the front of the truck
he yanks open the door and leaps up into the cab
the sheriff jogs after him
red walks to the cab unconcerned
jeff searches the cab for signs of amy
he tosses aside a jacket rifles papers on the floor
there is nothing
sheriff boyd looks up sternly as jeff continues searching the cab
red watches calmly
taylor either you come down from there or im going to have to arrest you
jeff gives up reluctantly
he looks lame and desperate and he knows it
he steps down from the cab gritting his teeth
it was him
it was this truck
uh huh i can see that
did you get a license plate
jeff stares at him knows where this is going
what about the information on the door panel
you recall any of that
i wasnt paying attention
the sheriff studies him a beat nods
taylor did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today
what does that have to do with anything
well for starters maybe she left you
i dont believe this
ive seen it a hundred times
lovers married couples gay guys
you put two people in a car long enough theyll go at it
hell ive even seen men dump their women on the side of the road and vice versa
jeff stares at the cop
emphatic my wife did not leave me
cuts in officer im sorry id like to stay and help but i really got to make it to fresno
go ahead sir
i appreciate your cooperation
this is insane
youre just going to let him go
ive got his information
if we need to find him later well know where to look
to jeff good luck findin your wife mister
no hard feelings
red climbs into the cab
jeff watches helplessly resigned to the fact theres nothing more he can do
the sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio
as the truck drives off jeff goes over to the cruiser
sir i believe you that your wife is missing
maybe you got confused about what truck she got into maybe you had a fight you dont have to tell me
the point is im trying to help
he hands jeff a card with an address printed on it
the town of bracketts miles that way
my deputys name is len carver
hes a good man
hell help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing
jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in
the sheriff softens his tone sympathetic
if you want my opinion your wife is probably around here
lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare
either way shell turn up
as jeff stares at the sheriff the police radio squawks
filtered sheriff this is dispatch
gilberts locked out of her trailer again
can you respond
into mike dispatch
tell her im on my way
he racks the mike
i want your name and badge number
the sheriff looks up at jeff sighs
sheriff arthur boyd
this really isnt necessary dont tell me whats necessary goddamnit
im noting the exact time of this conversation
exhaling suit yourself mr
the sheriff shifts into gear and drives away
jeff is left standing on the side of the road desert in all directions
a wall is covered with missing persons notices
photographs of men women and children stare back at us
names and dates are printed across the bottom of the notices
pull back to reveal jeff staring at the gallery of faces
its a creepy feeling
several yards away deputy len carver a young puffy faced lawman sits at a desk filling out a form
jeff looks shaken
is this a recent picture
jeff glances over
deputy carver is holding up a wallet sized photograph of amy
two months old
she still wear her hair like that
the deputy resumes filling out the form
he clicks his tongue sympathetically
well certainly do our best mr
theres over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year
runaways deadbeat dads dropouts folks hiding from the i
all vanishing without a trace
jeff stares at the faces
now im not saying shes one of them
i sure hope not
but unless theres a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction believe me the f
wont even look at your case till its been hours
deputy carver finishes the paperwork and staples the photograph to the form
he looks up at jeff
nevertheless well sure keep our eyes peeled
hows that sound
jeff clenches his jaw
from this high vantage point we see jeffs car approaching
the cherokee pulls up to the side of the building
jeff gets out and walks inside
jeff enters looks around
its the same scene as before same bartender a slightly different cast of characters
no sign of amy
jeff advances to the bartender who stands at a sink rinsing beer mugs
did she come in
looks up uninterested didnt see her
you didnt see her or she didnt come in
buddy i told you the last time
maybe she came in maybe she didnt
all i know is i didnt see her
jeff looks around not particularly trusting the bartenders skills of observation
he grinds his jaw
the other customers at the bar have been watching all this
one of them an older grizzled barfly looks up at jeff
confidentially none of my business mister
but if i was you id take a look in the ladies room
the barfly gives jeff a wink and turns back to his beer
snickers from some of his bar mates who avert their eyes when jeff glances at them
jeff knows this is almost certainly a put on but he cant take a chance
while the barflies watch poker faced jeff walks to the door of the ladies room hesitates then knocks
his knock is answered by a wordless sound half groan half amy
jeff tries the door
he rattles it
jeff puts his shoulder against the door heaves inward
the door swings open revealing
flo bent over the toilet vomiting
she whirls around a strand of spittle dangling from her lip
hey what the hell you doing
jeff backs away yanks the door shut
the barflies chuckle among themselves
jeff strides angrily for the exit
he stops at the door takes one last look around
no one seems to be paying him much attention
he turns to leave
but something stops him
he cant put his finger on it
theres something wrong here
he stares at the other customers
why do they avoid eye contact
are they hiding something
he scrutinizes more closely
there is the gruff trucker sitting at a nearby table shoveling food in his mouth
hes been averting his gaze ever since jeff walked in
and then theres the traveling salesman
popping vitamins along with his coffee
or what about the shirtless biker reading a comic book at the bar
probably an ex con
while jeff is running these suspicions through his mind a trucker approaches the counter to place an order
the bartender jots it down on a pad then tears off the carbon slip
he places one copy above the grill and another in a pile by the cash register
jeff stares an idea forming
he approaches the bar
i want to see your order slips
you write down the names
i want to see them
what are you nuts
i dont have to show you jack shit
jeff leans in his face
if my wife came in here then her names in that pile
the bartender stiffens stares him straight in the eye you calling me a liar
a tense beat
possessed by a sudden impulse jeff makes a grab for the receipts
before he can reach them the bartenders hand clamps onto his
mister ive had just about enough of you
let me see the fucking slips
in one swift motion jeff overpowers the man and extracts the receipts
he starts going through them fast looking at names
tully mark flo andy and
jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a smith wesson revolver
now mister youre going to have to leave
jeff takes a step back
everyone in the diner is staring
he stumbles backwards heads for the exit
jeff exits breathing hard and runs to the phone booth
is occupied by a young man with an awkward oversized frame ill fitting clothes
jeff raps on the glass anxiously
please i need the phone i have to call the police
the man looks up dull and glassy eyed
his sluggish demeanor suggests mental retardation
he hangs up and slowly opens the door
drawls my names billy
you the feller lookin for his wife
howd you know
did you see her
the sluggish man hesitates
theres something holding him back
jeff senses this
please if you know something anything tell me
a beat i seen her
billy is about to answer
the bartender sticks his head out of the diner
billy backs away spooked
never shoulda opened my damn mouth
now im gonna git it
billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot
jeff hurries after him and catches up cornering billy between two cars trying to calm him
no ones going to hurt you billy
just tell me what you saw
billy glances around nervously swallowing
she came in on a truck
a big white one
she got in another truck
they say im a dummy but i aint
i see things
jeff reels struggles to stay focused
do you know where they went
up by the river
where by the river
they dont tell me that kind of stuff
the men in the truck
billys expression darkens
he starts backing away
i aint talking to you no more
billy i need you to come to the police
if you tell them what you saw theyll be able to help me
man youre the dummy
jeff looks at him confused
dont you git it
the police is the ones in on it
billy turns and runs back into the diner
on jeffs sickened reaction we
jeff drives flat out his face grim
the speedometer reads mph
keeping his eye on the road he thumbs through the pages of a pocket address book
he picks up the handheld cellular phone and dials
the no service indicator beeps
the highway intersects route
the cherokee slows just enough to take the corner without tipping over
it flies past a sign route north
the road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert plain
the route is narrow and windy forcing jeff to reduce his speed
jeff drives desperately searching for any sign of a truck
there are no other vehicles on the road
he keeps pressing the redial button
the no service indicator beeps over and over
the road curves through a tunnel then climbs higher past sharp cliffs and drop offs
jeff follows the signs for route
something catches jeffs eye on the cell phone
for the first time the service indicator blinks green
jeff immediately grabs the phone again and presses redial
there is a burst of static then we hear a scratchy ringing
the call is going through
thank god yes
he waits for an answer
its jeff taylor
listen i dont put me on hold
i need a favor
ive gotta talk to that friend of yours at the f
no its about amy shes missing there is a burst of static
the reception is very poor
i said amys been more static
jeff holds the phone tight to his ear
yes im still here
no dont call back steve
the signal cuts off
jeff slams the phone against the dash furious
he punches redial gets the no service beeping then glances up sees a covered with high visibility markers stretched across the road
the sign road closed
he mashes the brakes
the cherokee skids to a halt just short of the fence
jeff stares at it
he grinds his teeth
beyond the padlocked gate the highway continues as an unpaved dirt road
he deliberates then throws the cherokee in reverse and does a three point turn so hes facing back in the opposite direction
he looks up sees has been hiding in the bushes off the road
it lurches forward and stops in the middle of the road blocking jeffs escape
jeffs eyes widen in fear as he recognizes the vehicle and its driver earl
earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle
he raises it to his shoulder
calling out out of the car
put your hands where i can see em
i said get out dammit
jeff stares into the rifle deliberating
his hand moves to the gearshift
he jerks it into reverse and floors the gas
peels out in reverse snaking wildly side to side aiming for the chainlink fence
it bursts the fence
poles and chain mesh go flying
cranks the wheel and brakes hard
the rear end of the cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road
he throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle
jumps in the ram and takes off in pursuit
guns the engine
the cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted storm damaged road
he yanks the four wheel drive lever
the huge pickup streaks after the cherokee its
liter v roaring oversized tires devouring the terrain
guns the engine on the washboard road surface the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while keeps pace in the dust from its wake
inside the cab earl can be seen speaking on a cb transmitter
throws the cherokee into a sharp turn in the road
as the car rounds the bend he looks up reacting as blocks the road at a construction site
more unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond
to his right a cliff goes straight up on the left a guardrail protects a steep ravine
he cuts the wheel left crashes through the guardrail and plunges into the ravine
bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope crashing through sagebrush and manzanita
clings to the wheel tossed about violently as suitcases and packing boxes go everywhere
the cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and crashes through the upper branches of a willow grove
as the leaves part we see
lands on the passenger side with a splash and comes to rest half submerged in the rushing water
jerks the ram to a halt leaps out and runs to the edge of the road to look down on the cherokee in the river
he grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the slope
the world is sideways
water rushes into the car
jeff is strapped into the drivers seat by the seatbelt
the airbag deflates with a hiss
jeff grimaces in pain
he looks around blinking
the river is flowing right through the cherokee
luggage styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty coke cans bob on the surface of the water
jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release
the belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side
he gets to his feet reaches overhead to unlatch the drivers side door and pushes it open
he hoists himself through the door
earl sees jeff emerging from the half submerged cherokee levels the rifle and fires
ducks back inside the cherokee freaking
the passenger side is on the river bottom and if he tries to get out through the drivers side hes a sitting duck
jeff swears and looks around seeing a metal camera case underwater in the back seat
he grabs the case and swings it at the windshield
the first three blows bounce off harmlessly
then the windshield shatters with a crash
he takes a deep breath submerges and swims underwater through the broken windshield
earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water
several items of debris from the car are floating on the current
he begins moving downstream along the bank eyeing the river
jeff breaststrokes for all hes worth
sand swirls in the swift current
he pushes away from a boulder in his path
he swims until his lungs are bursting then surfaces for air
earl sees jeff break the surface
he aims the rifle and fires
a bullet smacks the water near jeffs head
then jeff is under again
jeff struggles to stay in control
the current is turning swifter
his shoulder glances painfully off a boulder
earl works his way through the brush at the rivers edge
his foot lands between two rocks
he pulls it out swearing
jeff surfaces and gulps in air staying out of sight of earl on the bank
then he is down again
earl works his way along the shore
up ahead the river runs over rapids before passing around a bend
earl hears an engine and turns
a huge moving van has arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine
he shouts to the driver pointing downriver
hes getting away
the driver shouts something inaudible
earl runs along the bank ducking under low hanging branches
jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast moving current
he slams into a boulder letting out a cry and swallowing a mouthful of water
a downed tree hangs over the river
jeff grabs desperately and takes hold of a branch
hes got it
hanging on to the branch he notices a familiar object floating past in the water the donuts pack
jeff tries to haul himself from the river
the branch bends under his weight
then it comes free with a crack
jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water
earl works his way along the shore
the unseen driver of the van shouts to him from upriver
where is he
hes in the water
i just saw him
the river has turned slow again
jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to the bank
he drops to his knees retching
clutching his ribs he raises his head and looks upriver
for the moment there is no sign of earl
but he could appear anytime
jeff gets to his feet wincing
he looks up at the rocky canyon wall bordering the river
its steep but scalable
he begins climbing
jeff has climbed to higher ground
he lies flat on his belly and peers through a gap in the rocks at the river valley below
the men have given up their pursuit
the moving van a jumbo three axle gmc has turned around and backed up to the edge of the ravine
a stocky man al whom we recognize as earls passenger at the minimart operates a gas powered winch in the cargo door of the van
a cable runs from the winch down to the cherokee in the river
standing knee deep in the current earl signals to al while the winch slowly tugs the cherokee onto its wheels then backwards out of the river
watching in amazement
he can hear only snatches of their conversation
cant believe you let him get away
you try chasing
through this shit
this is what happens when you get one without the other
jeff cant believe it
the cherokee is being pulled backwards up the slope toward the road
he belly crawls back from the outcropping gets to his feet and climbs higher
jeff has moved to higher ground
he crouches behind a stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below
the cherokee is now back on the road
operating the winch with precision efficiency earl and al drag the cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the moving van
once the vehicle is aboard they stow the ramp and close the van doors
watching in amazement straining to hear what earl and al are saying
behind jeff a pebble skitters on the rock
he turns reacts
its billy the halfwit from the diner
wielding a shotgun like a club he swings the butt at jeffs skull
jeff drops to the ground unconscious
there is a creak as the trunk opens
jeff lies inside dazed and disoriented blinking into the sun
his eyes wont focus
earl and billy stand over the trunk in silhouette
he can hear their voices he coming around
i clocked him pretty good
a gun barrel jabs jeff in the ribs
rise and shine dad
a face slowly comes into focus
is it really billy
the halfwit from the diner
only he isnt a halfwit anymore
cmon shake a leg
jeff looks at billy
nothing makes sense anymore
but one thing is clear billys mental retardation was all an act
weak where is she
give us some answers and you might find out
according to her youve got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank
is that true
well some doesnt cut it
your wife gave us a dollar figure
i want the same exact from you
coming around stalling i dont theres different accounts
the balance fluctuates
fluctuates my ass
if a hotshot like you aint tracking his bottom line itd be the first time in history
turning what do you think earl
we been fucked with is what i think
little slut lied to us
put em on the spot theyll say anything to stay alive
billy nods disappointed
yeah i suppose
peers down at jeff guess youre not the donut magnate after all
to earl waste of time
earl raises a pistol
jeffs eyes flash
blurting out ninety thousand
earl stops glances at billy
they both eye jeff carefully
emphatic ninety thousand dollars
a faint smile plays on billys lips
he slams the trunk
its nearly pitch black
a beam of sunlight shines through a rusted hole
it illuminates jeffs eyes
the car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert
jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain
he braces against the confines of the trunk
the engine noise is deafening
the car hits a depression and jounces wildly
jeff is thrown about violently
there is a creak and the trunk opens
jeff squints into the sun
earl and billy stand over the trunk
dont try anything stupid
jeff gets out grimacing
his clothes are stained with grease and tire grime
he sets his feet unsteadily on the ground looks around
we see that he has been confined in the trunk of a pontiac firebird
the firebird and dodge ram are parked on a bluff
red stands on the highest point peering through binoculars at the desert below
he glances at jeff
youre a tough man to get a hold of jeffrey
jeff stares a mix of emotions anger fear confusion
barely able to control himself what do you want
its not me were talking about
question is what you want
jeff looks at him with loathing
see ive got something you might want to buy
cant show you the merchandise right now but i can describe it for you
about five five hundred and fifteen pounds
id say three maybe four of that is tits
black curly hair upstairs and down
jeffs anger bubbles over
you sonofabitch he advances toward red
billy and earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground
billy drives a fist into his kidney
jeff gasps in pain
red nods impassively
bring him up here
earl and billy hoist jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to red
from here jeff can see a small desert town spread out below as well as the highway leading through it
welcome to brackett jeff
if ever there was a two bit shithole in the middle of nowhere this is it
one gas station a half dozen stores and a v
pointing see that building
jeff follows his gaze
thats the bank
brackett commerce bank
you with me
jeff nods tightly
then heres the drill
youre gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of from your account in boston
got your wallet
you ask for the money in cash
todays payday at the copper mine so dont take any horsecock about how they havent got it
if the manager gives you a hard time thats your problem
its your wife whos counting on you
how do i know shes still alive
billy slugs him in the gut again
jeff doubles over
shes tucked away someplace safe
you get her back as soon as we get the money
simple as that
jeff compresses his lips
now a smart guy like you youre already thinking about calling the cops right
jeff says nothing
red raises a hand held cb to his mouth
he keys the transmitter
into mike iron man to blacktop lets open the gate
filtered copy that iron man
red turns back to jeff
like i said jeff if you want to call the cops theres nothing i can do
hell with the fire youve got in your eyes right now i figure youre fixing on calling the f
even the nd airborne
jeff stares back
problem is you can see this town for miles around
so ask yourself hows the law gonna get here
they gonna fly in
either way well see em
so let me be very clear if we see one unmarked car one plane one human being who even smells like a cop this deal is dead
he tosses jeff the binoculars
now take a look at the building with the flagpole
jeff hesitates then raises the binoculars
the image shifts then steadies and focuses on a small building with a police cruiser out front and a barely legible sign brackett sheriff
its the police station where jeff filed the missing persons form earlier
theres exactly two cops in this town
one of thems inside pulling ass duty the others on patrol in the foothills
now a minute ago one of my men called in a non injury accident on the i connector
deputy carver comes out of the building gulping down a sandwich
he gets in the cruiser and pulls away lights flashing
itll take that good ol boy minutes to get to the connector another to see theres no accident and another or so to tool his way back
minutes all in
the cruiser pulls away down the highway
lowers the binoculars and looks at red
thats your deadline
if for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before im looking at a bag of money your wife is dead youre shit out of luck and were
gone for good
he smiles at jeff
see thats why theres no risk to us in this thing
you do the legwork
we sit back we watch we listen to our scanners we monitor you every step of the way
if at any moment we dont like something we split
beat helluva lot safer than sticking up s wouldnt you say
they lock eyes
red tosses jeff a windbreaker
put this on
you cant go into the bank like that
jeff puts on the jacket
it covers his filthy shirt
red checks his watch
how about it jeff
time to get the show on the road
on jeffs expression
jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends the loose rock at the foot of the mesa
he looks up at the ridge but red and his crew have pulled back out of view
jeff starts across an open field toward the town first jogging then running
jeff hurries toward the bank
he looks back at the mesa again
the gang has disappeared
up ahead a mud streaked pickup cruises the main street
jeff eyes it warily
is it one of theirs
the truck pulls around a corner
jeff pushes through the main doors
its a typical small town operation
a guard stands near the entrance
several customers wait in line for the woman teller
jeff looks at the slow moving line and swears softly
he doesnt have time to wait
he glances around sees an older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank the nameplate on the desk identifying him as roger calhoun
i need to see the manager
i need a wire transfer from my bank in boston
calhoun looks up from his paperwork hesitates at jeffs appearance
im the manager
would you like to have a seat
jeff remains standing
he eyes the other customers nervously
turning preoccupied what
i said you can have a seat if you want
he takes a seat across the desk from the manager reaches into his wallet and brings out several forms of identification
heres my drivers license credit card if you need it my account number in boston
how long is this going to take
calhoun looks at him curiously
are you all right
quickly yes im fine
look that account only has in it
how much can you advance me on my credit card
impatient my credit card
ive got a limit
can you advance me the whole
calhoun looks mystified
no i cant
for non customers the limit is a day
sir are you sure youre all right
yes im fine
transfer the money okay
calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the transfer form
jeff eyes him decides he has to risk it
he leans toward the desk
look im going to tell you something
whatever happens just keep filling out that form okay
looking up baffled sir
there are people watching
excuse me you the manager
a guy wearing cowboy boots and a feed cap stands behind him
yes i am
lady over there said to see you about a car loan
indicating waiting area certainly sir
would you like to have a seat
the guy takes a seat ten feet away
jeff looks at him paranoid
their eyes meet
jeff looks away quickly
turning back to jeff you were saying mr
transfer the money
jeff enters and locks the door
he startles at his reflection in the mirror
he is sunburned dirty lacerated
he opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies looking for anything that could be used as a weapon
he tosses aside detergents and air fresheners
he picks up the toilet plunger pulls the wooden rod from the rubber base
he swings it into his palm a few times testing it as a club
its too bulky
he wont be able to conceal it
he checks his watch
time is running out
he takes one last look around the bathroom then exits
jeff comes out of the rest room
the manager is behind the tellers counter
the cowboy is gone
in his place sits a middle aged blue collar worker
he looks at jeff
jeff takes a seat glances at calhouns empty desk
there is a letter opener on the desk several paper bands for wrapping currency
positioning his body so no one can see jeff takes the letter opener and slips it into his sleeve
he scoops up a handful of currency wrappers
jeff goes to the tellers window scribbles something on the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller
would you tell the manager i want the money in these denominations
the teller looks at him oddly
jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope glancing up and down the street
theres no sign of the men
he squints toward the mesa
no sign of them there either
he stands there
whats he supposed to do now
he checks his watch growing anxious
finally he is about to jog back in the direction he came when
a phone jeff turns
theres a pay phone down the street
it rings again
he approaches quickly lifts the receiver
filtered no shit
i can see that
how much you got
jeff looks up and down the street trying to figure out where theyre watching from
he looks toward the bank glimpses the manager peering through the window
the whole thing
turn left and start walking toward the main road
get in the first car that stops
when do i see my wife
filtered when i say so
the line clicks
jeff hangs up and starts walking
calhoun speaks on the phone
marie this is roger calhoun down at the bank
is the sheriff there
a beat well maybe its nothing but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange
jeff walks along the road carrying the envelope
various cars pass in either direction but none slow down
jeff stiffens as an wheeler approaches
but the truck thunders past blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his face
jeff continues walking anxiously checking over his shoulder every few moments
his eyes narrow
the dodge ram pickup is cruising toward him
it slows then brakes to a halt
the passenger door opens
earl sits behind the wheel aiming an automatic pistol
toss the envelope on the seat
jeff stands firm
first you tell me where she is
first you give me the money then you find out
unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway
jeff looks around wonders if earl would risk shooting him in view of passing traffic
jeff hesitates then tosses the envelope on the seat
earl opens it reaches in and pulls out several packets of currency
they are wrapped with paper bands and appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds
he replaces them and gestures at jeff with the gun
now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around
earl sees that he isnt carrying a gun
he beckons jeff toward the truck with the automatic
turn around hands behind your back and step toward the truck
jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side door
earl grabs his arms yanks roughly and wraps them with several layers of duct tape
now get up in the truck knees on the floor
do it now
jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the floor facing the rear of the pickup his belly pressed against the seat
earl reaches over and pulls the door shut
he throws the truck in gear and starts driving
jeff grimaces looking up at him
i gave you the money
now let her go
let her go
do i look like i have her
what the hell earl backhands jeff against the passenger door
there is a ringing sound and earl pulls a cell phone from his pocket
he presses a button and raises it to his face
on phone its done
im heading in
a beat listening gotcha
he ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash
you gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet
you think we picked you out of the blue
new car massachusetts plates probably be days before anyone misses you
hell you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it rich assholes looking for trouble
he tucks the pistol in his belt
jeff looks at him seething
jeff tries to squirm free
earl sees it and belts him across the temple
jeff slams into the passenger door wincing
id have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up
mimicking panicked driver help help i aint got no power
jeff has come to rest with his back against the door
by contorting his arms he is able to draw the letter opener from his pocket
he manipulates the letter opener into position and begins cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists
steering with one hand earl reaches into the envelope pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in jeffs face
jeff saws faster at the duct tape
you know what im gonna do first with your money boy
well do you
jeff glares at him
fluttering bills under his nose ill give you a hint
only one thing smells better than money
you wanta guess what
earl laughs obscenely
he riffles the bills under his nose again then stops abruptly frowning
he looks down at the bills
what the hell
earl stares at the bills
jeff works feverishly behind his back
earl pulls out another packet then another examining the bills
its nothing but singles
erupting you lyin sonofabitch
there is a ripping sound
jeff wrests his hands free and lunges across the cab
he plants the letter opener in earls shoulder
the pickup veers across the center line on the narrow mountain road
it swerves back over correcting wildly and drifts for the opposite shoulder
jeff seizes the pistol from earls waistband
earl flails and knocks the pistol from his grasp
the pistol flies onto the floor
earl uncorks a vicious backhand
jeffs head snaps sideways
he grabs earl by the arm and twists sharply
the pickup careens back and forth across the treacherous roadway
jeff gropes on the floor
his hand closes around the pistol and he swings it at earl crack
earls nose erupts
jeff reaches across and jams his foot on the brake
the pickup screeches and comes to a halt straddling the road
jeff swings the pistol into earls face crack
earl tries to fend off the blows
jeff creams him again crack
a tow truck driver traveling in the opposite direction pulls to a stop
he gawks at the two men struggling in the pickup
jeff aims the pistol at point blank range
earl is a bloody wreck
his head lolls groggily
where is she goddammit
whatd you do with her
jeff is about to slug him again when he notices the two truck parked across the road the driver staring out
jeff swears and wrestles earl into the passenger seat
he seizes the roll of duct tape and binds earls wrists then passes the tape under his legs so earl is effectively hog tied
he then slams earl back in the seat circles his neck twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of the passenger side headrest
earl begins to gasp for air
the tow truck driver gets out and approaches
jeff gets behind the wheel and throws the pickup into gear
the two truck driver leaps out of the way as the pickup surges forward tires smoking
he stares open mouthed after the departing vehicle
jeff drives one hand on the wheel the other brandishing the pistol at earl
where is she
barely able to breathe fuck you
jeff swings the pistol
there is a crack of exploding teeth
earls mouth erupts with frothy blood
you like that
how about this
jeff hits the brakes
earl is thrown forward letting out a strangled cry as the duct tape chokes off his windpipe
four wheel anti lock brakes you sonofabitch
you want to try em again
he hits the brakes again harder
earls tongue protrudes from his lips choking
his face is red
how about an emergency stop
you want to try that earl
where is she
i dont know
fuck you you dont
he slams the brakes again
earls eyes bulge sickeningly
he is being choked to death
is that what you want
you really want me to stop
cause i bet this baby stops on a dime
traveling in the opposite direction sheriff boyd is returning toward town
as he rounds a bend in the road he sees the ram driving erratically and weaving back and forth across the road
the sheriff reacts
what the hell
as the ram passes sheriff boyd throws the cruiser into a screeching degree turn
he flicks on the siren and takes off in pursuit
jeff glances in the rearview mirror
the cruiser is on their tail siren wailing lights flashing
he swears and pumps the brakes in a series of rapid bursts
end of the line earl
how about it
you gonna tell me
shes with billy
i dont know
jeff hits the brakes again
sheriff boyd jerks the wheel to avoid a collision with the pickup as it slows and accelerates in rapid spurts
on radio repeat i am in pursuit of a dodge ram pickup
request back up repeat request back up
the cruiser pulls up alongside the pickup
boyd reacts in amazement to what he sees jesus christ on radio dispatch
suspect identified as one jeffrey taylor repeat jeffrey taylor
boyd taps his brakes falling back behind the pickup
jeff is wild eyed
where were you taking the money
losing it to the truck stop
jeff has the information he needs
he slams on the brakes
sheriff boyd swerves to avoid a crash as the ram screeches to a halt in front of him
the cruiser skids to a stop
jeff leaps from the pickup with the pistol in his hand
he rushes toward the cruiser
sheriff boyd hops out levels his service revolver
i know where she is
ignoring him drop the gun
jeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an embankment
he raises his hands
you dont understand
shes been kidnapped
i understand plenty
now get down on the ground or ill shoot
he means it
earl struggles for breath
the duct tape is still tight around his neck
he strains against the tape binding his limbs
he glances in the side view mirror to see the sheriff ordering jeff down on the ground
by wriggling and contorting his wrists earl is able to tear one hand free
then he pulls away the rest of the duct tape from his knees
the tape is still wrapped tightly around his neck pinning him to the backrest
earl claws at the tape but it wont come free
finally with both hands he reaches behind his head and yanks the read rest from the seat
he reaches into his boot for something
jeff is spread eagled on the ground
sheriff boyd calls out to earl in the cab
he keeps his gun leveled
you there in the pickup
you all right
can you get out
just dont shoot me officer
hes crazy i tell you
well get out dammit
you gotta listen to me glances down at jeff shut up
to earl cmon out sir
its safe earl sets one foot on the road
the headrest dangles against his back still taped to his neck
suddenly earl whirls holding a
snub nose revolver and fires
the sheriff stumbles away blood spurting from his shoulder the gun flying from his hand
jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls
earl comes around the pickup after jeff raising the gun to fire
jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the embankment
earl runs to the edge of the embankment
down below jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff ordered him to drop
he finds it
earl is aiming at point blank range from the top of the embankment
he is already squeezing the trigger when
earls chest erupts outward as a bullet passes through his body from behind
earl staggers and flops down the embankment
he comes to rest near jeff blood gurgling from a massive chest wound
jeff climbs the embankment
the sheriff is lying on the road critically injured gun lying nearby and still smoking from the shot that killed earl
the sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote transmitter strapped to his uniform
weak shots fired
help is on the way sheriff
just hang on
i have units and an ambulance en route
jeff bends over the sheriff and examines his wound with a grimace
he is verging on unconsciousness
jeff deliberates torn
there is nothing he can do here
making up his mind jeff runs to the pickup
the hand held cellular phone has spilled into the road
he scoops it up jumps behind the wheel and lays rubber
jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a texaco truck stop
behind him the dodge ram pickup lies hidden in a growth of scrub oak and tumbleweeds
jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below
its a giant truck stop
there are hundreds of big rigs parked in rows like silvery sardines
a sign towers over the main building diesel
he looks shaken
how will he ever find red here
it seems impossible
he descends the bluff to the truck stop
jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and reaches the edge of the parking lot
there are trucks everywhere
diesel motors rumble
exhaust fills the air
he reaches the end of a row of big rigs starts searching the grounds for the markings of reds wheeler
its nowhere in sight
a high pitched feminine squeal from an adjacent trucks sleeping compartment startles jeff
muffled cmon baby give it up
the woman giggles o
jeff ignores it scanning the truck stop
a police car is arriving at the truck stop
staying out of sight jeff passes quickly to the rear of a tractor trailer
jeff peers out from behind a parked mini van as trucks emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash
across the way trucks are filling up on diesel at the gas islands
jeffs eyes narrow
is that reds peterbilt among them
he quickens his pace then falls back slumping
the rigs black driver is getting in the cab
jeff glances to the side frowns
an older vacationing couple is eyeing jeff warily
jeff looks down cops to it instantly
his clothes are ripped caked with blood
he ducks between two parked cars using a side view mirror as he hastily wipes blood off his face
he checks to be sure no one is watching
something catches his eye
a highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near the place where jeff ditched the pickup
beside it a state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars
jeffs jaw tightens
he glances toward the road sees two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of the truck stop
swearing jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the opposite direction shielding his face
jeff emerges from between two vehicles glancing over his shoulder nervously
he keeps his head down moving fast
he scans the truck stop in all directions
the patrol car is still parked on the ridge the patrolman peering through binoculars
jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building passing a row of pay phones
he looks up stops dead
red is talking on a pay phone six feet away
red is facing away unaware of his presence
jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone
he shields his face with the receiver and listens
on phone i dont know dammit he was supposed to be here a half hour ago
theres reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms
red waits listens
look im getting out of here
stay off the airwaves
bring the girl and meet me at the barn
you got that
he hangs up
jeff presses the phone against his face and turns away
when he looks up red is walking toward his peterbilt truck parked in a row of big rigs
jeff starts to follow then freezes
several cops are fanning out on foot questioning everyone they encounter
jeff sees red getting into his truck
the engine kicks over
the brakes hiss and the truck begins pulling out
jeff whips around
the older vacationing couple are talking to a cop fifty yards away
the husband points toward the pay phones
jeff makes a sudden decision doubles back behind a rolling farm truck
thanks the couple calls out something to his fellow officers
runs alongside the farm truck using it as a shield
he overtakes the truck cuts across its path
the farmer blares his horn
jeff glances left
reds tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area slowly gaining speed
jeff sprints in front of a moving car
the driver jerks to a halt and honks catching the attention of a nearby cop
jeff quickly turns away avoiding being seen
reds wheeler turns toward the access road
jeff looks around panicked
more cops are spreading out on foot
theyll notice him any second
jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow moving postal truck
the truck speeds up nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly
jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself
in the path of another huge truck
a cop is standing only feet away
jeff goes underneath another trailer crawling between the moving wheels
he springs to his feet
reds peterbilt is pulling away
jeff runs for all hes worth
his arms and legs pump furiously
he runs abreast of the truck
and seizes the spare tire mount
jeff hangs on for dear life
his legs drag over the asphalt
he lets out a cry of pain
the truck is joining the highway accelerating
grimacing jeff swings his legs over the universal joint as the roadway races past below
the huge tires are a howling blur
suddenly his grip falters on the grease
his back scrapes the rushing asphalt
jeff gasps makes a grab and holds firm
as he hangs on a station wagon overtakes the peterbilt in the passing lane
a three year old boy sits in the rear compartment staring out at jeff a puzzled expression on his face
jeff stares back
its an odd moment between the two
the station wagon continues forward and exits frame
the peterbilt thunders over a patch of highway that is being graded for paving
the tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt pelting jeff all over his body
he realizes he cant stay where he is
grunting with effort he works his way hand over hand along the underside rigging toward the cab
he seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up
standing on the coupler jeff clutches his ribs and catches his breath
hes in pain
the road whips by below his feet
the truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces violently
jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support
the truck is doing mph exhaust racketing
jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials
he holds it tightly to his ear shouting above the wind
on phone hello
can you hear me
this is jeff taylor
i need to talk to the deputy
he strains to hear the reply
the name is jeffrey taylor
i just witnessed your sheriff being shot
now put someone on goddammit
red glances in the side mirror at the road behind him as he drives unaware of jeffs presence
jeff clutches the cell phone to his ear waiting
he reacts suddenly as the call is put through
deputy carver speaks on a phone extension while the dispatcher sits nearby
its no good
hes not talking
you better mobilize your boys
the troopers stare back
they look like they have a score to settle
the truck streaks along the interstate
sitting on the coupler jeff is a picture of despair
the truck races toward the bloated lowering sun with no sign of slowing down
jeff lies curled under the windfoil on the roof of the cab
he hugs himself shivering in the cold draft
the tractor trailer rumbles in low gear along a sparsely populated two lane road
a neighborhood dog yaps
from his hiding place under the windfoil jeff peers out into the darkness unable to figure out where he is
he catches his balance as the truck turns a corner and slows driving past a tract of undeveloped land before turning into the driveway of a
and braking to a halt under the broad overhanging eave of an old dilapidated barn
behind the two story farm house a rusted volkswagen bus and satellite dish hunker in the weeds
a newer car a cadillac deville is parked to the side
red kills the engine and climbs out of the cab
as he walks toward the house a screen door slaps
deke squirts across the lawn in his pajamas
daddy youre home
red scoops him up
hey deke you miss me
arleen comes out of the house in a bathrobe
deke get back to bed
i said now
to red warren
i thought you were coming back next week
she comes out into the yard
jeff flattens against the sleeper
he can see red greeting his wife their words carrying faintly across the lawn
jeff is baffled by this domestic scene
arleen reacts with disappointment to something reds told her
but its four in the morning
why cant al and billy come some other time
reasoning i told you weve got some stuff to take care of
wont be more than a couple of hours i promise
red turns to his son extends a key
say deke how bout opening up the barn for your daddy
deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while red returns to the cab passing within several feet of jeffs hiding place
he reaches into the cab brings out a duffel bag and unzips it
jeff keeps his breathing shallow squeezes against the windfoil
deke cmon over here i got something for you
deke runs up breathless
red holds two hands behind his back
red and deke are just six feet from jeff
guess which hand
pointing to right hand this one
red opens his right hand
pointing to left this hand
red opens his left
hes been tricked dad
laughing okay okay ill give it to you
he opens his hand revealing jeffs swiss army knife
deke takes the knife and runs off
red goes to the rear of the trailer unlocks it and raises the slatted door
he hops up inside
his footsteps echo in the metal trailer
we hear him shifting boxes
jeff seizes his chance
he crawls out from under the windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave
the structure creaks under his weight
red sticks his head out of the trailer puzzled
deke you back there
jeff crouches in the shadows
he can see red poking his head out from the trailer peering up at the roof
red shrugs lets it go
he resumes unloading boxes tosses down a full set of louis vuitton luggage
he lugs the items into the barn
jeff goes to a second story window
a board has been nailed over the window
he pulls it away steps into
and looks around amazed
everywhere around him there are stolen goods
matching luggage sets
a rack of womens coats
a table piled with cameras
a crate filled with car phones
a stack of windshields
two sets of golf clubs
three child safety seats
a ten speed bicycle
several dozen commercial vehicle license plates are scattered about arkansas oregon texas iowa south dakota
as jeff stares reeling there is a rumble outside
red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and pontiac firebird arrive at the barn
he beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into
al dismounts from the moving truck
billy climbs out of the firebird
they are travel sore stretching
red shuts the door behind them
man if i never see another couple from massachusetts itll be too soon
tell me about it
you get any word on earl
shakes head theres reports of an accident up five mile but thats about it
red grunts unlatches the door to the moving van lowers a ramp
the three men begin unloading boxes
jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole
the men unload jeff and amys belongings luggage photography equipment miscellaneous items
inside the moving van the battered jeep cherokee is visible partially covered with a tarp
i told you we shoulda gotten rid of em like that couple up in utah
nice and clean
so it got a little fucked up so what
we stay out of the area for a while things will cool off
there is a hammering noise o
red looks over irritated
dammit al what the hell you doing
al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of amys jewelry
he looks over at red
figured id get started on the jewelry
fuck that you can work on it later
help us with the girl
jeff breathes in sharply presses his eye against the knothole
red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of the moving truck
he and billy slide out a long metal box similar to a drawer in a morgue
they lift the metal lid revealing the sack is stained and ripped
red pokes at it
the sack doesnt move
mustve died from the exhaust
jeff stares paralyzed his universe exploded
moisture forms in his eyes
billy and al reach into the compartment start to lift out the sack
ill get some plastic
well bury her before it gets light out
suddenly the sack drives its legs into als belly
al falls backward drops the sack on the floor
it tears open revealing amy gagged with duct tape her wrists and ankles taped
she squirms and kicks wildly her screams muffled
we see jeffs eye in the knothole
its all we need to see to gauge the effect on him of seeing amy alive
al gets to his feet furious
scared me half to death
chuckles gotcha good huh al
oughta be more careful next time
glaring at amy lemme do her red
ill cut her head off right now
you in there
shit its my wife
help me get her in the freezer
calling out just a second arleen
red walks to a corner moves aside a section of false flooring
he pulls up a hidden trap door revealing a root cellar
squirms on the hay strewn floor
her clothes are ripped face bruised
she looks up reacting jeffs eye is visible in the knothole
their gaze meets
returns and takes amy by the legs
al and billy lift her by the arms
as they carry her to the root cellar red peers into her terrified face
dont worry honey
its not as bad as it sounds
itll take you about minutes to suck the air out
probably wont even feel it
amy reacts writhing even more violently but shes no match for the three men
jeff watches helplessly as
the men disappear with amy into the cellar
we hear a metallic thud then a few moments later the men reappear without her
red closes the trap door secures it with a heavy padlock then slides the panel of false flooring over it
cmon lets go
they turn walk toward the door
red opens it
arleen is standing there
al and billy greet her politely
hey missus c
are you coming to breakfast
ive been calling you
sure thing honey
the barn goes dark as the men leave
the barn door rolls shut
a lock clicks
jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness
he crosses the room bumping into a workbench
he swears makes his way toward the
jeff drops to his hands and knees feeling for the padlocked trap door
he finds it speaks in an urgent whisper
amy can you hear me
jeff cups his hands presses his mouth to the floor
still no reply
jeff swears glances around the dark room
there is a tool bench across the room
hang on baby
theyre in the house i cant use the lights
im gonna get you out
he goes to the tool bench fumbling in the darkness
he knocks over a cardboard box a pile of car keys spill across the table
his hands run over an assortment of tools
he locates a hammer takes it
returning to the trap door jeff inserts the claw in the padlock and tries to pry it open
the lock wont give
he strains using all his strength
suddenly the handle snaps
jeff flies backwards
he gets up goes to the tool bench
his hands feel over and reject an assortment of small tools
he finds a crowbar returns to the trap door and inserts it into the shackle twisting with all his might
after several failed attempts he swears
its not working
if i make any more noise theyll hear
jeff mulls his options
he sets his jaw exhales
im going to get you out of there amy
he swallows emotional clearly torn
i love you
under his breath please god let her still be alive
jeff opens the door
a weak dome light flickers on
he climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the cb radio but no luck the keys are gone
he opens the glove compartment
there are maps trip logs truck stop receipts
he rifles through them quickly
jeff frowns gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the drivers seat
his eyes register a discovery
he brings out a big black semi automatic pistol
jeff studies the base of the grip clearly unfamiliar with guns
he fumbles with the clip ejects it
the clip is full of bullets
he snaps the clip back in place
under his breath fuck you asshole
jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging eave
he steps to the edge of the roof and lowers himself onto the peterbilt cab then drops to the ground
he looks around
reds is the only house visible
a light flickers in the trees a mile away
it could be anything
jeff moves toward the house
jeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen door
the door creaks on its hinges
jeff steps into
jeff lets the door close silently
there are voices coming from a distant room
he passes a washing machine a hamper full of dirty clothes and moves silently down
toward the voices
video game sound effects emanate from a room off the hall
jeff flattens against the wall peers into the living room
seated on the floor with his back to jeff deke is playing nintendo on a wide screen television
various items are scattered about stereo speakers a jukebox a brand new nordic track
there is a rifle rack across the room
stepping past the doorway jeff continues down the hall toward
red is in the middle of telling a story
arleen billy and al sit around the table
the plates are cleared away
they are drinking beer
so there i am its a howling snow storm ive got live chickens that are supposed to be in denver days ago and this cop is busting my balls because
i havent got chains
arleen and the men laugh heartily
so what happens but this big old rooster damn thing mustve weighed ten pounds he reaches out toward that highway patrolman
al glances toward the door stops laughing
billy and arleen follow his gaze go silent
just reaches out with his beak see and
red notices his audience is no longer paying attention
he turns in his chair sees standing in the doorway
aiming the pistol
his clothes caked with blood and dirt
he sways slightly
nobody else moves

arleen glances at red frightened

arleen looks up at jeff scared
she starts to open her mouth when stick em up
nine year old deke is aiming a rifle at jeff from the hallway
the rifle looks enormous in his hands
the boys lip quivers
the room is silent
no one moves
jeff keeps the pistol aimed at red
he swallows speaks slowly you dont want to do that kid
just put the gun down
firm dont listen to him deke

voice quavering my daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time

deke looks at his father fights back tears
his finger tightens on the trigger

deke whimpers squeezes the trigger
suddenly billy bolts from the table
the rifle fires
the recoil knocks deke off his feet
the bullet rips into als shoulder
oww goddammit you little shit
red is out of his chair
jeff dives first and seizes the rifle
he whirls aims the pistol at red

jeff sidesteps to the window
billy is running across the yard
is he headed for the barn
jeff swears turns back

deke rises tears streaming down his face
its okay kid

clutching his shoulder wound al glares at the child as he passes
where the hell was billy going
he gnaws his lip decides

red arleen and al get to their feet
deke stays at his mothers side
jeff aims the pistol at red holds the rifle with his other hand
he herds them to the door
arleen looks to red nervously
do like he says arleen
jeff trains the pistol as his captives stand at the entrance to the barn
he glances around keeping an eye out for billy
to red okay
reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife
this aint gonna work boy
jams pistol at him do it
red fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to arleen
she just stands there
its okay arleen
she takes the keys
indicating barn door okay now unlock it
arleen inserts a key opens the padlock
now give me the keys
turning to deke deke push the door open
deke looks at his father
deke goes to the door begins wheeling it open
thats enough deke
gesturing them inside with gun lets go
jeff herds all four into jeff leads the group through the barn at gun point
he glances right and left wired
the rifle is strapped to his back
he keeps the handgun ready
he peers under the tractor trailer looking for any sign of billy
they reach the trap door
jeff circles it constantly keeping an eye on red and al
he hands the keys to deke
deke i need you to open this
deke looks at his father
he kneels unlocks the padlock and heaves open the trap door revealing a narrow staircase slanting into the cellar
deke looks down into the darkness and swallows
its okay deke
theres a freezer down there with a woman in it
i need you to let her out
deke descends the steps frightened
voice quavering i cant see
jeff jabs the pistol at red tell him where the light is
a beat to deke the switch is on the right
theres a click and the light goes on in the cellar
deke lets out a yip of fear
its all right son
just ignore that stuff
jeff crouches to peer into the cellar
roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling
the light is a bare bulb
there are several distressingly shaped garbage bags against the wall
his gaze shifts back to red
to deke deke
you at the freezer
youre almost done
just open it up let the woman out
we hear a freezer being opened
shes all tied up with tape
you got that swiss army knife your dad gave you
make sure you dont hurt her
they wait tensely while deke works downstairs
to red you better pray shes all right
i got her jeff
im almost free
amy come up here
amy climbs the stairs quickly
scraps of duct tape cling to her wrists
she throws her arm around jeff
they were going to kill me
i know baby
they cant hurt you now
while amy embraces him jeff keeps the gun on red and the others
he gestures toward the cellar
to red arleen and al okay
everybody in the cellar
arleen and al descend the steps
red follows then stops halfway down
remember this moment pretty boy
cause whatever happens no matter how far you run i will hunt you down and kill you like a dog
jeff stares back
a beat then go to hell
he boots red in the chest sending him backward down the steps
he slams the trap door shut and locks the padlock
he looks around sees a massive tool chest
he tips it onto the trap door crash
then he takes amys hand still keeping an eye out for billy
lets get out of here
they run from the barn
the first rays of sunlight are beginning to poke over the horizon
jeff wheels the barn door shut and locks it
he sees amy running toward reds house
its not safe turning but theres a phone inside
we have to call the police
one of thems still loose
cmon this way
its too much to explain
jeff grabs her arm
as they take off running toward the light flickering in the distance
lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn watching
jeff and amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat terrain illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun
the morning sky is lighter now
a rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop junked appliances and a clothesline
theres an old utility pickup truck parked in front
jeff and amy arrive out of breath
jeff pounds on the door
theres no answer
jeff puts his shoulder to the door and rams it open
the flimsy door gives way easily
the place is ramshackle torn vinyl furniture empty beer bottles scattered about
a tattered flag hangs on the wall
theres no one around
amy follows him inside looks around
jeff crosses the room snatches up a phone and dials
while he waits for an answer amy leans the rifle against the wall
she notices a set of car keys hanging by the door
re keys take it
we may need to get out of here into phone suddenly hello
this is jeff taylor
im reporting an emergency
i dont know the address the house belongs to a red barr i mean warren something
no i dont know his name
suddenly hearing something jeff a deep rumble is approaching getting louder by the second
no he kidnapped my wife hes locked in a barn
if you contact the police in amy pulls a curtain aside reacts to what she sees panicked jeff
suddenly the roar is deafening the peterbilt explodes through the wall of the trailer home
dive out of the way
inside the truck cab we catch a glimpse of red behind the wheel shouting something inaudible
fragments of debris cling to the grille
the rickety structure spins degrees
jeff goes flying
a television somersaults across the room and explodes
amy slams into a wall
the speeding peterbilt shears away a section of the trailer home with a horrible ripping sound
the trailer home is suddenly open to the sky
red puts the truck into a hard turn circling for another run at the devastated trailer
jeff struggles to his knees
amy is crawling over the debris
jeff pulls her to her feet
he grabs the rifle and car keys
they stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer
red sees amy and jeff flee the trailer and head for the utility pickup
he throws the peterbilt into a turn
amy and jeff run for the ford f utility truck an aging blue collar workhorse equipped with side mounted toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder
jeff keys the ignition
the engine sputters
amy whips around to see the peterbilt bearing down from the side
jeff turns the key
the engine catches
he throws the ford in gear and floors the gas
the ford shoots out of the peterbilts path
the ford peels out of the driveway and joins the road spewing exhaust
its an old vehicle that doesnt maneuver well
jeff mashes the gas pedal
the engine strains backfiring
amy looks back sees the peterbilt joining the road
cant this thing go any faster
a shotgun blast shatters the passenger window
amy screams as glass showers the cab
jeff swerves wildly
what the fuck
he swivels his head right sees kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the ford on the right hand shoulder
the driver billy is levelling a shotgun through the window
cranks the wheel
billy triggers a blast
yelps as the passenger side mirror disintegrates
she whips around sees pulling even with them on jeffs side
the drive al leers as he spins the wheel and creases the ford raises the pistol and fires
the ford is sandwiched between the cadillac and firebird as they race down the highway with the peterbilt in the rear
lets out a cry as they carom off the cadillac
blood flows in a trickle down his neck
amy sees it panicking
use the rifle
amy raises the rifle thrusts the barrel awkwardly out the window and aims at billy
she fires wildly bang
grins as the shot whistles past harmlessly
he reloads the shotgun snaps it shut and returns fire blam
the blast hits the fords side mounted toolbox
the door flies open
tools scatter on the road
veers away swearing as hammers and chisels and power tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path
the front end of the extension ladder comes free from the lumber rack and hinges into his path smashing the sonofabitch
billy swears and jerks the wheel steering away
he glances up suddenly sees jeff aiming the pistol
the pistol fires
billy slams backward against the headrest hit in the face
theres blood everywhere
the car careens toward the shoulder
the firebird hits a mound of earth flies through the air and lands with a crash
red sees the crash scowling
he presses the gas and pulls closer taking billys place alongside the ford
amy sees the peterbilt advancing
whipping her head to the other side she sees al raising a pistol
al jacks the trigger blam
a stray bullet slices the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer
the hose hisses and whips through the air
red swears and lets the truck fall back swearing
up ahead is a long curving downgrade
he taps the brakes
there is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor
sonofabitch he realizes the trailers got no brakes
the peterbilt descends the grade letting out a rapid fire blat of backfires
its gaining speed bearing down on the ford
amy turns in the seat terrified
the truck looms closer
jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor
they are flying into a hairy curve
red struggles to stay in control
every time he applies the brakes the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward
the peterbilt races into the curve
red has no choice
he has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether
he hits the brakes
the huge truck screeches on the asphalt tires smoking cab and trailer folding at right angles
then unexpectedly the trailer disconnects from the cab
flanking the peterbilt al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab
now the trailer is an unguided missile weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop
al tries to swerve away
the trailer streaks toward him
al slams on the brakes screaming
the trailer piles into the cadillac
there is a huge impact as trailer and cadillac are reduced to scrap metal
and just as this is happening
blasts into the rear of the ford jarring it forward with a crunch of metal and taillights
slams against the wheel
amy is thrown against the dashboard
the ford is being propelled downhill by the peterbilt
the two vehicles are now locked together gaining speed as they hurtle down the grade
jams the pistol through the rear pass through window and fires at red in the truck
bullets ping off the grille
the gun clicks empty
red hits the brakes but its no use
the bumpers are meshed
the two vehicles plunge downhill skidding sideways
up ahead a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge
the peterbilt and ford fly onto the bridge
the big truck glances off a railing
the vehicles suddenly come unlocked
the ford plows into the concrete railing with a crash
the peterbilt creams it from behind and caroms away skidding the length of the bridge before smacking the opposite railing
in front of them the concrete railing has broken away
debris falls feet to the bottom of the gorge
the fords right front tire hangs in the air
jeff looks at amy
she looks wildly adrenalated eyes wide
you all right
amy looks back at him
she expels a long breath and nods
jeff forces his upper body through the drivers window and looks over the fords roof at the peterbilt
its facing them yards away on the bridge
the engine is dead
steam hisses from the crumpled radiator
one tire is shredded
there is blood on the broken windshield
sitting in the drivers window
he squints toward the truck searching for any sign of red
there is none
i cant get out
jeff drops back into the cab
the dashboard is crushed against amys legs
she tries to wriggle free
what is it
wriggling its just
i cant get out
what do you mean
i mean i cant get out
he climbs out of the ford runs around to amys side and yanks the door
it comes open with a creak of metal
behind jeff on the bridge a motor kicks over
exhaust belches from the smokestacks
red is behind the wheel
his face is covered with blood
he stares hatefully
with a rasp of gears the peterbilt lurches forward
he pushes against the dashboard with life or death urgency
cmon amy push
amy struggles and struggles to free her legs
amy glances toward the peterbilt terrified
creeps toward the ford
the trucks grille is smashed
one wheel rim scrapes the asphalt
it gains speed
jeff crawls over amy and tries pushing with his legs
she winces as the metal cuts into her skin
turning reacting jeff
rams the rear of the ford crash
it jars the pickup farther through broken concrete guardrail
jeff and amy are thrown forward by the impact
the peterbilts engine roars
its pushing them over the edge
reds eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces the pickup farther through the broken railing
lurches through the widening gap in the railing
concrete sails into the canyon
the front tires hang over the void
jeff strains against the dashboard
it wont give
he whips around swearing and leaps from the ford
jeff runs to the peterbilt and jumps on the drivers side running board grasping the door handle
red heaves the door open suddenly
it strikes jeffs head with a crack
he falls backward to the ground
red presses the gas yelling over the engine roar
the railing is giving way
he sees jeff struggling to his feet
you think you can come into my life and fuck with me
nobody fucks with me
he looks down
jeff is no longer visible
suddenly the passenger side door flies open and jeff surges into the cab landing on red clawing at his eyes
they grapple in the cab
red swings an elbow into jeffs face crack
jeff drives a fist to his jaw
the steering wheel drifts counter clockwise as the truck inches forward ramming the ford closer to the precipice
red gets his hands around jeffs neck as the steering wheel continues to move counter clockwise
the truck is no longer hitting the ford squarely
instead the peterbilts right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed crushing the left side of the ford under its massive weight
red has both hands around jeffs windpipe
he glances up for a second reacts but its too late
the peterbilt is surging up the drivers side of the ford using the pickup like a ramp
amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened under the peterbilts weight
for an instant the peterbilts front tires seem to hang in the air
then the truck is falling
red and jeff are thrown forward in the cab still flailing at each other as the truck plunges nose first into the gorge
then it jerks to a halt in mid air
the left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete railing
the peterbilt is dangling nose down from the bridge
jeff slams into the windshield
red lands on top of him
loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield
red grabs jeffs arm and twists sharply forcing it at an impossible angle
their faces are inches apart
you think you can fuck with me
he headbutts jeff viciously crack
blood erupts from jeffs nose and mouth
red is about to deliver another blow when
the windshield falls away
the loose items in the cab plummet feet to the canyon floor below
jeff drops through the windshield opening
he clings to the center support column
his legs dangle over the hood
red slips through the opening his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant
the windshield sails away into the gorge
the iron rebar groans
its beginning to give way under the weight of the truck
the truck slips slightly
jeff feels the truck shifting
he grabs the windshield wiper blade with his free hand
the blade snaps away
red is clinging to the steering wheel
he flails at jeff with his feet swearing
jeff is barely out of reach
jeff looks to the side
there is a grabhandle on the corner of the cab
he reaches with his free hand and seizes the handle
the rebar groans
the truck is wedged against the ford
as the truck slips it forces the ford closer to the edge
jeff clings to the handle
he reaches for the passenger side door handle working his way up toward the bridge
gives away once more and scales the cab finding more handholds
he climbs past the passenger door
behind him red is working his way higher in the same manner
he grabs jeffs foot trying to pull him off the cab
jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment
red grabs the door handle
jeff boots the door release button
the passenger door flies open
red falls away as the door opens
hes clinging to the open passenger door suspended over the gorge
amy breathes in sharply feeling the ford move closer to the edge
she struggles to free her legs from the dashboard
the peterbilt slips again
below red loses his grip and almost falls
jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of exertion
he runs to the passenger side of the ford
the ford teeters precariously
any move could send it over the edge
jeff can only extend his hand to amy over the void
cmon amy its all you now
you can do it
with a huge effort amy frees herself from the dashboard and reaches for jeffs outstretched hand just as comes free from the rebar
takes hold of jeffs hand
plummets into the canyon
seems to fall forever
before landing with a huge jeff and amy fall backward on the road
down below secondary explosions rock the canyon
jeff takes amy in his arms
dont let me go jeff
i wont baby
i wont ever let you go
he looks into her eyes
their lips meet in a kiss and we
police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the house
yellow crime tape holds back onlookers and news reporters
cops and evidence technicians work the scene
a criminalist photographs stolen property as its carried out of the barn
a plainclothes fbi agent closes a cellphone and walks over to where jeff and amy are sitting at a picnic table
they are battered and bandaged
hows the sheriff
out of surgery
it looks like hes gonna make it
as for the wife and kid shes not talking hes being turned over to protective services
jeff nods soberly
weve got i
on the dead suspects
turns out they were all licensed truckers
one of em had a rap for check kiting
otherwise they couldve been model citizens
what about the leader
his real names warren claney
three speeding tickets in five years apart from that hes clean as a whistle
amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn
dazed how could they do it
how could they treat it like a
shaking his head i dont know
ive been doing this years ive never seen anything like it
it was simple efficient and organized
they stayed on the move spread it over a dozen states
as long as no witnesses survived its an untraceable crime
looking at them you were just a couple of the lucky ones
up ahead a television news helicopter is landing on the road
a cameraman reporter and producer hurry over
jeff watches the news crew a bemused expression
it seems like a million years ago
the fbi agent shakes his head disdainful
re media cmon lets get you folks out of here before things really get hairy
he escorts them to a waiting sedan
as they climb in jeff looks back over his shoulder surveying the scene one last time
he gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied news crew arrives mikes and cameras at the ready running alongside the departing sedan shouting questions
through the rear window we see jeff putting his arm around amy pulling her close as we hear promise me one thing
over this last line the sedan drives away and we climb higher and higher away from the bristling crime scene until the ranch house is just one in a town
of modest houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in every direction
