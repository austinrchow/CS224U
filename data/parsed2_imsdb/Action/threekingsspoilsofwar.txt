three kings spoils of war unproduced draft by john ridley by john ridley july th president bush in the oval office delivering an address to the american people
this act of naked aggression must be checked
the united states along with coalition forces from the middle east have drawn a line in the sand
there is only one way for this situation to be satisfactorily resolved
the belligerent forces from the republic of iraq must be removed from kuwait be it by choice or by force
from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge empty desert
just the humvee nothing else for miles
we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises
at at at at at
at at at at at
there are three soldiers at the humvee
second lieutenant john epps who sweeps the horizon with a pair of binoculars
pfc wes hammond who is behind the wheel looking very bored and pfc mark jaeger who is at the humvees thirty caliber machine gun making the noises and shooting at
when jaeger talks its with all the swagger of a b movie hero
at at at at at
at at at at at
what are you doing
what does it look like im doing
im killing iraqis
at at at at at
at at at at could you stop please
youre giving me a headache
yeah a headache
my head hurts
youre making me uncomfortable
im making you uncomfortable
baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three hundred thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles that doesnt bother you
but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull
thats exactly it
jaeger goes right back to playing soldier
at at at at at
knock it off
dont get pissed at me just cause i want to be ready when this war starts
ready for what
what are you supposed to be doing
i told you im shooting iraqis
no youre not
epps points in the opposite direction that jaeger was firing
the iraqis are that way
those are our troops youre shooting at
with his binoculars epps looks in the direction jaeger was shooting
you know what
i think you got schwarzkopf
you got the general right in the ass
now thats good shooting
another month in this desert and i might just
think were going to do it
think were going to war
not up to us
up to the iraqis
all they have to do is get out of kuwait
we ought to kick their asses anyway
even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses
i dont think well go to war
we shouldnt even be here
this isnt our fight its a regional conflict
it should be decided regionally
people are suffering
people were suffering in afganistan and we didnt do anything
thats cause the afganis werent smart enough to be sitting on top of oil
people suffering is one thing but when the yuppies arent going to have enough gas for their bmws its time to break out the tanks
weve got a whole lot of nothing to patrol
as they pack up and get ready to roll on jaeger says almost to himself we ought to kick their asses
either way we ought to
the bazaar is loud and colorful a cacophony of arabic fills the air
the bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling their wares to each passerby literally shoving them in the faces of prospective customers
epps wes and jaeger walk along side by side looking almost like the three musketeers except that wes is droning on
and its very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone
its considered offensive
you know so much about the middle east you know where we can get something to eat
when do you ever point the soles of your feet at people
im saying dont do it accidently
jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of his foot at a vendor
my foot accidently jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it
i hate it when that happens
wes slaps jaegers leg down
youre going to get us in trouble
it was an accident
you saw it was an accident
im just trying to help you guys out
it doesnt hurt to know something about saudi arabia
like learning arabic
youre gonna learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here
i didnt learn arabic because we were getting shipped here
you dont learn it in a couple of weeks
i studied it in high school
spanish wasnt hard enough
i thought it would be good to know
yeah if you ever need to buy a rug
why dont you try this ashra ka mahari dahra sahib
what does that mean
dont shoot me im friendly
you can use that when you surrender
how do you say come here baby
i can use that now
dont even try it
you offend a woman out here youre in serious trouble
dont worry about jaeger
he uses his personality as a form of birth control
have i said that to you guys recently
as epps and wes walk on jaeger notices something on a vendors table
it is a small square box slightly larger than a mans palm fashioned of wood and metal
it is not particularly ornate but eye catching in its own way
the instant jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the vendor is giving him the hard sell in arabic
jaeger holds the box up to the vendor
what is this
all he gets is more arabic
jaeger calls over to wes
wes comes back over to jaeger
what is this
now you need me
what is it
you know so much about arabland tell me what it is
wes looks over the box carefully
well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say its a box
can you eat it
if you cant eat it i really dont care what it is
ask him what it is
wes says something to the vendor in arabic
the vendor answers back
he says its a box
yeah youre funny
its a puzzle box
if you can figure out how to open it theres supposed to be a treasure inside
excited for real
oh man youre not going to fall for that
there might be something in there
yeah the deed to the brooklyn bridge
there might be
and youre the guy whos going to open it
you could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch
decisively without even haggling about price jaeger whips out some money and pays the vendor for the box
well that showed me
now can we eat
the three men walk on jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box
its filled with young soldiers messing around playing cards listening to music whatever
jaeger lays on a bunk holding the puzzle box probing it with his fingers trying to find a way to make it open
wes crosses over
you get it yet
youll get it
ill show epps
hell be sorry when i get this thing open
you really think theres a treasure inside
i dont care if theres a lump of coal in here
i just want to be able to rub epps face in it when i crack this thing
wes watches jaeger work the box for a beat
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait
thats in two days
like i said so
theyre cancelling all leaves all passes
no more drills
we stand at full ready starting whats your point wes
you have a point
were going to war arent we
if theyre doing all that it must mean were going to war
it doesnt mean anything
why would they do all that if we werent
jaeger frustrated finally looks up from his box
okay so were going to war
were supposed to go to war
were soldiers thats what we do
the guns the tanks the planes youre just now getting the hint were in the war business
jaeger goes back to his box
wes stands over him for a beat longer then jaeger
for sure aggravated what
you ever think about dying
come on man
i almost had this thing open
you ever think about it
you ever worry
the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass im going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over
the only people who ive got anything to worry about are the poor dumb camel jockeys who dont know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling
at them an m in each hand and a grenade between my teeth
now if youll excuse me soldier id like to get back to my box
ive got a treasure to find
wes lingers over jaeger for a few more beats then walks off as we president bush in the oval office addressing the nation
just two hours ago allied air forces began an attack on military targets in iraq and kuwait
these attacks continue as i speak
our objectives are clear
saddam husseins forces will leave kuwait
the legitimate government of kuwait will be restored to its rightful place and kuwait will once again be free
from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge empty desert
just the humvee nothing else for miles
we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises
at at at at at
at at at at at
its like the opening scene all over again
jaeger is at the machine gun epps sweeps the horizon with his binoculars and wes is behind the wheel
only difference is that wes watches cnn footage of the air war on a watchman
at at at at at
re his tv this is so weird
its happening but its not
its like a tv show and were part of it
at at at at at
will you knock it off
youre going to annoy the iraqis into submission
jaeger gets down from the machine gun pulls out his puzzle box and starts to work on it again
this is stupid
its going on a month now
how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards
they can bomb them all they want saddam aint going anywhere without a ground assault
what the hell is the army waiting for
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting
ive got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place
the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer itii be for us when we have to engage
you know what wes
if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war
you all want to lay off
i hope the iraqis shoot me put me out of my misery
startled epps and wes each pull their guns and spin in jaegers direction expecting to have to fire at something
i did it
i got the box open
jaeger has indeed opened the box
we can see something inside of it
you almost got yourself shot thats what you did
wes excitedly goes over to jaeger
jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax
i dont know what it is
its a container
break the seal
jaeger hesitates a beat which heightens a bit of suspense
all three men cant help but be drawn closer to the container
go on man
jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the tube
he sticks his finger back into the container and draws out a rolled up piece of paper
its a fortune box
jaeger unrolls it
whats it say
help im being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory
we see the paper
lines are drawn on it large crude figures
its hard to make out exactly what it all is supposed to represent
its a drawing or something
some kind of art
epps takes the paper from jaeger and gives it a once over
looks like something a kid would do
wes takes the paper and looks it over
its a map i think thats what it is
there you go jaeger
just find the buried treasure and youre a millionaire
jaeger takes back the paper
all excited like a kid on christmas you think
yeah thats exactly what i think
you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes
lets get out of here
we got sand to protect
epps and wes load up and get ready to move out
jaeger just keeps staring at the map eyes lit like candles
the room is filled with maps recon photos humint reports
theyre posted on the walls with various levels of troop strength allied and iraqi indicated
more data is constantly flowing in analyzed and processed
jaeger enters spots woods a young soldier on intel detail and crosses over to him
im looking for a favor
i need a map of iraqi
all i got is maps
im gonna have delayed map syndrome when i finally get out of here
what kind of map you need
topographical geographical thermal
i dont know
a map map
a map map
woods pulls out a map and hands it to jaeger
that shouldnt be too hard to read
iraq is the pink thing
i could use some recon photos too
woods gives jaeger a sideways glance
planning on going to war all by your lonesome
want to be ready when we do
ready for what
woods starts to dig for photos
some good ones
theyre all good ones
satellites weve got can snap a shot of the boil on saddams ass
saddams got a boil on his ass
woods looks up at jaeger with an expression that says what
i dont know
woods goes back to looking pulls some photos and hands them to jaeger
staring at the pictures like they held the secrets of the ages jaeger starts to exit
woods mumbles after him yeah
you figure out how to win the war be sure to let us know
maps and photos cover jaegers bunk the way autumn leaves cover the ground
he swings between studying the maps and reading from a book titled a history of the ottoman empire
jaeger puts the book down then slides the drawing from the puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos
he looks at the mosaic hes put together looks at it like it was having a dialogue with him
dig it it is talking
a voice only jaeger can hear
right now its just a little whisper but the voice is getting louder
a crossing soldier carrying a football calls to jaeger
come on jaeger
were playing ball
jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance
no thats okay
im doing some
the soldier crosses off
jaeger goes back to staring at his maps and photos and drawings and books
what were you saying
as it all keeps talking to him we once again president bush delivers an address
this evening as i report to you the military operation known as desert storm enters its final phase
the coalition forces that face the tyranny of saddam hussein have launched an all out ground offensive
as this last and most critical part of the campaign begins i ask for your prayers that god may bless each and every one of the coalition forces at our
side in the gulf and that he may continue to bless our nation the united states of america
from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge empty desert
just the humvee nothing else for miles
we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises
at at at at at
at at at at at
its our three boys again just like weve seen them before jaeger at the machine gun epps working his binoculars and wes at the wheel watching his watchman
jaeger jumps down from the machine gun pissed as all hell
they finally start the ground war and where are we
same place weve been since we got here
securing freedom for the dirt
everybodys got a job to do
figure it this way at least you get to go home alive
id like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt
hey look at this
jaeger and epps come around to wes watchman
we see cnn footage of some iraqi soldiers looking very tired hungry and scared surrendering to a cnn news crew
theyre surrendering to a news crew
you believe that
jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat
eighteen hours into the war and its over
those soldiers have got loafers on
what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers
a casual one
damn this is sweet
we are going to be home in no time
better grab up some sand to take home to your family
jaeger bites at his lip
he wants to say something but isnt quite sure how if he should if
fuck that jaeger
just say it
we could go home with something else
millions of dollars
what are you talking about
jaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box
youre not going to show me that tired map
jaeger starts to tear at his pockets like hes trying to get at a bee
he pulls out his other maps recon photos
the guys a walking atlas
epps looks on in shock at the spectacle
i think youve got some issues to deal with
really when we get out of here im pretty sure its shrink time for you
just listen to me
ive been doing some reading
in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks
it became part of the ottoman empire
when the turks rolled in they raped they pillaged the usual stuff
anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards
they buried their treasures drew maps and hid the maps in puzzle boxes
i read about this man
i read about it
sarcastic wellllll if you read it it must be true
was it in the star or the enquirer
wes tell him
you know this stuff
the turks invaded yeah
i guess people would have hidden what they had
but that doesnt mean what was in that box is jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps
looks at this
look at it
the drawing is a map of this area right here
you can see it
the geography the landmarks
its the same area
epps grabs the map from jaeger
and you know what that area is
were doing a little thing with them right now desert storm
maybe youve read about it
what were doing is kicking ass
for gods sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews
the war is over
weve just got to keep shooting people cause the army spent all this money and weve got to put on a show for the taxpayers
youre not saying what i think youre saying
i cant believe youre even thinking it
its right here
this region an nagaf
i got recon photos
therere no troops there no fighting you dont know where the iraqis have moved to
and our forces havent even engaged the republican guard yet we dont know its about a hundred miles from where we are now
how long do you think it would take us to its not a hundred miles
its a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain pure desert mountains a river
if the map is even real
im telling you its real
so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase
tell him its crazy epps
he doesnt say nuthin just thinks
its the thinking that makes wes nervous
epps tell him
epps gets a little more thinking in
wes sees which way this is going
youre out of your minds you know that
both of you
you dont even know if theres anything out there
what the hell are you thinking
im thinking about when this war is over
why you figure im here
cause i got tired of being president of gm
if a brother doesnt play ball or deal drugs there arent too many big money prospects around and im not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting
the oil companies wars
so i say if maybe theres something out there what the hell thats what i say
wes cant believe what hes hearing
he pulls out the last card he has to play
jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness
what the hell are we deserting
both jaeger and epps close on wes for the hard sell
people get lost all the time in war cut off we disappear for awhile
we disappear we came back nobody knows nothing
but we all got to be in for this
we all go or we do nothing
epps youre smarter than this
jaeger i understand but youre smarter
you know its real
you know its real and you know its there
you know it
youre insane if you think youll find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive
if you say that then i say you dont know second lieutenant epps very well do you
wes buries his head in his hands
he squeezes at it hard like hed rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say what hes going to say
i dont believe im doing this
its going to be cool wes
its all all right
we go we get rich we go home
its that easy
jaeger and epps start to pack up
to no one in particular and not too convincingly wes mutters
to strains of hendrixs wait until tomorrow the humvee cuts across the desert kicking up plumes of loose sand
it looks more a dune buggy out for a joy ride than a military vehicle
epps drives jaeger rides shotgun relaxed feet up on the dash
wes is in back with a what the fuck did i get myself into look on his face
the hendrix comes from a walkman hooked up to a pair of small speakers
basically these guys are just kicking it
our boys are just on a beer run
maybe this wasnt such a bad idea after all
now this is war
were going to get court martialed you know that
hell well just buy our way out
epps picks up a map and gives it a read
to jaeger he says hand me the navicom
jaeger hands epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger than a video box
its a navigational computer which can pinpoint its location by satellite within meters
basically the ultimate compass
epps compares the navicoms readout with the map
hold on boys and girls
epps watches the navicom
welcome to beautiful iraq
land of enchantment and riches
youre such a pussy you know that
howd you get in the army
cool it jaeger
i know you think this is crazy but a couple of hours from now youre going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out
id settle for being alive
alive would be fine
epps is that a sand dune
why yes jaeger
i believe it is
no please not again
epps punches the accelerator and the humvee jumps forward like a horse out of the gate
the humvee hits the dune and takes to the air
as it arcs up and over the desert we hear
as gravity takes hold and brings the hummer back to earth we epps is still taking it for a joy ride
wes is still getting sick
came on im serious
knock it off
the hummer hits yet another dune and takes flight
this isnt funny all right
i mean it
the occupants jostle as the hummer touches down
epps and jaeger laugh and high five
wes is content just to go on looking sick
hey wes what kind of treasure you figure these people buried
if theres a treasure
what kind you figure it is
i dont know
it would be small easy to transport and hide
gold or jewels
how the hell should i know how much
but thats the great thing about gold
a little goes a long way
you know what im doing with my part of the gold
if theres gold
you know what im doing with my half
epps turns to jaeger
theres just the slightest slightest hint of edge brushed across his tone
what youre going to do with your third
you know what im going to do with it
im going to buy a sixty three vette stingray
all tricked out and cherry
im going to be so sweet
youre going to buy a car
this is too much
you dont even have the money and youre wasting it
a car is not just a car where i come from
i had this friend had this wicked candy apple red sixty four and a half mustang youre getting gold and youre going to blow it on wheels
what are you going to do with your third invest it
oh thats fun
its not about being fun
its about being smart
you take that money you take care of it let it grow and you dont ever have to do anything again
thats what im talking about
and im talking about enjoying myself
you know you sound just like a boy whos never whats that
jaeger and epps look out the front windshield
a plume of sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before them
so engrossed in their discussion previously they hadnt even noticed until wes pointed it out
epps reaches over and kills the tape player
a loud quiet comes with it
all three men just stare at the plume as it drifts closer
finally take the binoculars
wh what do you think jaeger scrambles up the binoculars and stares off into the distance
epps and wes wait
theyre not supposed to be here
i had the pictures
theyre not supposed to be here
both of you shut the hell up
weve got to do something
weve got to turn around
we can see them they can see us
we run they chase
what are we going to do
thinkings not good enough for wes
what are we going to do
were going to keep driving
theyll shoot us
we run theyll shoot us anyway
if we keep driving they might think we friendlies iraqis
or even if they know were americans they might get scared think were part of a detachment and keep on going
theyre not going to its the only way
epps is right
jaeger and wes know it
they shut up and ride
dig that tension wes sweating epps giving the wheel a white knuckle grip
jaeger reaches down and readies his m
when he chambers it it sounds like thunder cracking
the plume draws closer and closer until its not just a plume but two dots
then its two jeep like vehicles
next we can even make out the passengers
that doesnt do much to relax our boys
us the iraqis were almost on top of each other now
the vehicles are going to pass within feet
epps throws in one more thing wave at them
dont look just wave
all three throw up some weak forced waves
the vehicles pass
look at that the iraqis are waving back
and thats all theyre doing just waving
our boys break out into cheers
i think im going to throw up
im going to toss
you see that
right by us
they went right by
you had them epps you called it
figure they dont want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them
look at you not even breaking a sweat
youre cool boy
they all have a good laugh but wes brings that to a crashing halt
looking back at the iraqis in a voice dead with fear they stopped
oh jesus theyve stopped
epps and jaeger look behind them
they stopped and theyve turned around
the two iraqi vehicles have stopped theyve turned and now theyre racing towards our boys
epps momentarily freezes
jaeger helps him right out of it
go go go
epps punches it and the hummer takes off
the iraqis are right behind them
the vehicles all do same hard driving they twist and turn like wild snakes over the loose sand hit dunes take flight
its the open desert and our boys have nowhere to hide
inside the hummer its a rough rough ride
our boys are thrown violently about the cabin
for epps controlling the hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse
the iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire our way
bullets kick up around the hummer like angry little bees with a hell of a sting
epps yells at jaeger
now its jaeger whos freezes
epps returns the favor
jaeger climbs back to the humvees machine gun works the action and starts firing
unlike before when he was playing the real thing is much wilder
the humvee bounces around like a cork in the ocean
taking aim is nearly impossible
the best jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the iraqis general direction
all wes can do is cover his head and stay down like a scared little girl
steady it out
i steady it out they blow us out of the sand
its like a dog fight in the dirt
the vehicles weave cut
one of the iraqis starts to cut across jaegers firing line
jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets loose
a hail of bullets rips into the iraqi vehicle just above wheel level
it kicks the vehicle up and back whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time then smashing it back into the ground
jaeger is beside himself
i got him
you see that i nailed him
as if in answer the remaining iraqi vehicles gunner tears off a salvo that eats up the space right around jaeger
hes not hit but it kicks him back down into the humvee screaming with fear
the boys are running out of options and epps knows it
wes take the wheel
wes is too scared to move
epps reaches back and literally pulls him up and over into the front
with little finesse wes takes the wheel as epps slides over
epps takes up an m with a grenade launcher
he loads it up and readies the weapon
crawling to the back he takes aim
keep it steady
wes does his best to give a level ride but the iraqi bullets coming at them dont help much
epps zeroes in on the target
he takes aim and starts to squeeze back on the trigger
he almost has a shot off when wes hits a dune rocking the hummer violently
epps loses the target
i said keep it steady
epps tries to take aim again
one shot is all he gets
the bullets keep coming but hes in no hurry
the iraqis are only getting closer
the grenade rips from the launcher riding a trail of white smoke and slams into the iraqis
you know the story huge explosion car parts flying a hundred feet into the air bodies whipping through space stuff bob dole would hate
but maybe he would like it
they were just iraqis
wes brings the hummer to a halt
a spastic scared relieved laugh escapes him
jaeger checking himself for wounds and epps m still in hand get out
epps makes his way to the wreckage sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any survivors
yeah like somebodys walking away from that bang
wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was
i thought we were dead
yeah well were not
we got to get out of here
nobody says anything
this really scares wes
we have to go back
were not going anywhere
not til we get what we came for
incredulous we just about got killed
you know what happened
we just about got killed and you want to go on
jaeger go check out the hummer for damage
jaeger starts to cross back to the hummer
wes gives him something to take with him
youre crazy you know that
jaeger goes leaving epps and wes all by their lonesome
wes turns to epps
you know that right
you know hes sick
with a flip of his head epps indicates the dead iraqis
they shouldnt have been here
we shouldnt have been here epps
there is a war going on
this is miles from the battle lines
they were probably deserters
deserters would have run they wouldnt have engaged
they shouldnt have been out this way thats all im saying
wes starts to get it
it really doesnt matter what he has to say
were not going back are we
epps has got nothing to say to the truth
he turns and starts to walk to the hummer
youre trying to get us killed
like a whip epps snaps around
he grabs up wes and pulls him close
im trying to get us paid
im trying to get us all paid
as long as theres a chance something is out there we go on
theres not going to be anymore trouble
if there is we go back but there wont be
almost as an afterthought epps realizes hes got wes and lets him go
gently he puts it youll feel different after we find the treasure
money has away of making people feel different
nobodys got anytbing to say to that so they say nothing
epps heads back to the hummer
a beat later wes follows
jaeger is already behind the wheel
epps rides shotgun this time
once again wes is in back
to jaeger epps ask she okay
yeah shes fine
jaeger fires it up and pulls out
as they head off we the sun beats down violently as the hummer rolls along
epps jaeger and wes all ride along in an angry silence
jaeger starts to smile
he chuckles to himself
epps looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit himself
im just thinking you know if the rest of the boys knew what were doing
i mean if they knew what we were coming back with
you cant tell anybody about this
but im saying if they knew
were going to be millionaires man
epps joins in cackling like a hyena
itd make their heads explode
he turns back to wes
you know were going to be rich
come on admit it
in spite of himself wes gives a little smile
ahh there it is
there it is
you know it
singing to levert money money money money
jaeger joins in
money money money money
epps starts to slow down
what are you doing
low on gas
got to refill
a nervous look punches it way onto jaegers face
he and wes jump out of the hummer and go around back to the reserve tanks
jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense
after a beat epps screams for him
time to face the music
jaeger hauls himself out of the hummer and goes around to epps whos got a look on his face like hes just had a spoonful of steaming shit
he points angrily at one of the reserve tanks
look at it
look at it
shot to hell
its been leaking gas since the fire fight
i told you to check for damage
and you missed this
how are you going to miss something like this
i didnt miss it
i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit youd want to turn back
so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel
knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere
i figured youd turn back
wes gets a slow boil on
you stupid son of a bitch
wes lunges for jaeger but doesnt have the speed or the skills
jaeger counters and sinks a fist into wes jaw
wes goes down but he manages to take jaeger to the sand with him
they start to scrape but its obvious jaeger has got the upper hand
epps reaches down and yanks jaeger off of wes
get off him
jaeger comes up to his feet
wes wipes some blood from his lips
he looks down at his bloodied hand then sneers at jaeger
you two fightings not going to get us anything
him getting us stranded out here doesnt do much good either
were not stranded
weve got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back
then lets go back while we still can
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway
were not that far
we can make it
what do we do with the humvee
we leave it
what if someone takes it
jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert
whos going to take it
we mark the location with the navicom we can come right back to this spot
wes has had enough
you two dont even know how crazy you are
you want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent
you have to go with us wes
what is that an order private you have to go with us
you cant walk back
jaeger dangles the keys to the humvee from a finger
and you sure as hell arent going to drive
wes burns a hole through jaegers head with his eyes
epps steps to him
load what you can water tools weapons
anything you think we might need
wes burns on a bit more then turns and heads for the hummer
jaeger watches him go then smiles to himself
whos he kidding
he wants it as bad as we do
were going to be fat epps
as soon as we get back to saudivillie you and me are going to epps gets up in jaegers face
the menace he projects is very real
were going to keep going cause i want some of whatevers out there
but you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again and ill kill you myself
you got that
jaeger just stands there his fear swelling
i got that
epps storms over towards the hummer leaving jaeger to be all scared with himself
a long line of footprints works their way through the sand up to epps jaeger and wes
epps and wes trek side by side
jaeger is behind them having trouble keeping up
between pants he gasps hey
you dont have to go so fast
faster we get there faster we get back
im with you
jaeger struggles on just a bit more then im gonna
im just gonna stop for a little water
dont drink up all of yours cause you arent getting any of ours
im just going to have a little sip thats all
just a sip
jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand
he looks up
epps and wes are still walking
wait for me
you can catch up
im right behind you
wes looks back at jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his water
thanks for straightening out jaeger
epps shrugs like hitting jaeger wasnt much of anything
maybe we are crazy for doing this
but if we do it we do it right
i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldnt have to do it again
not much chance of that
jaegers an idiot
hes not so hes an idiot and hes not nearly as hard as he thinks
how tough you have to be to make the army
all youve got to do is shoot a gun and stop a bullet
again epps looks behind him as jaeger struggles to his feet and stumbles after his two comrades
look at him
we ought to just leave him behind
epps gives a little laugh like hes just heard a mildly amusing punchline
like he said people get lost in wars all the time
and out here
out here there are eight million ways to die
all this talk starts to creep out epps a little
okay so he was riding you
get over it
wes smiles a little smile
im just talking
they walk on
jaeger works to catch up muttering to himself as he goes
cant even slow up for me
wasnt for me they wouldnt even be here
im the one that found the map
should have just come by myself
shouldnt even cut them in
as jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come from under his boot
he goes dead still
panic races up and down his spine
in almost a whisper be says epps
again louder epps
like he couldnt be more annoyed epps turns around
epps isnt sure of what hes heard
epps doesnt say anything he just keeps on staring
scared angry they dont get it i stepped on a land mine
epps and wes look at each other then back to jaeger
like hes got no time to mess around you didnt step on any mine
i heard it click
if you stepped on a mine youd be dead by now
nobody uses delayed fuse mines anymore
i heard it
maybe its just a can or something
jaeger loses it
just plain sick of all this epps and wes trudge back over to jaeger
paranoid thats your problem
youre just paranoid
whyd the paranoid one have to find the map
epps pulls a knife from his belt
he sinks to the ground and probes the sand under jaegers foot
we hear the sound of metal against metal
epps goes white
for a second he doesnt move
tension falls like a steel curtain
slow careful epps withdraws the blade and stands
jaeger reads the expression on epps face
just be cool
its a mine isnt it
howm i gonna relax standing on a mine
were going to get off all right
well get you off of there
epps goes to wes
the two start to move away from jaeger
where you going
me and wes are just going to talk
why you got to move away to talk
were going to be right over here
youre moving away because its going to blow up isnt it
its going to blow up
i said be cool all right
now be cool
epps and wes move over and huddle
what kind of mine
i dont know and i wasnt about to mess with it
should have blown already
delayed fuse thats vietnam stuff
maybe thats all the iraqis could afford okay
maybe they got it on discount
maybe the fuse is messed up
or maybe its going to go off in two seconds and we wont have to worry about getting jaeger down off there all well have to worry about is finding
behind them pathetically jaeger cries epps
were not going to be able to get him off it anyway
theres a way
cant do it
cant do it and keep him alive
epps eyes narrow
he doesnt want to hear this kind of talk
i said nobody dies
epps my leg is falling asleep
epps thinks and thinks hard
to wes weve got rope
break it out
epps crosses back over to jaeger
my leg is falling asleep
its not falling asleep
youve only been standing there for three minutes
im the one who can feel my leg and its falling asleep
it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up
wes crosses over with climbing rope
very very gently epps wraps the middle of the rope around jaegers waist leaving several feet dangling off each end
hows this going to work
me and wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine
thats going to do it right
im going to be okay
not too convincingly youre going to be fine
youre not going to let me die are you
dont let me die
ignoring the question when we start running suck up your breath
youre going to get the wind knocked out of you
dont let me die epps
i dont want to die
epps and wes pick up separate ends of the rope and take up positions behind jaeger
epps waits a beat afraid of what might happen but there is no choice
he digs in ready to take off running
wes whispers to him what if its a valloro
just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us
you just go when i say go
should have at least gotten the map off of him
blows up with him then we did all this for nothing
ignoring him ready
epps takes a couple of deep breaths holds one wes and epps are off the the races churning up sand as they race away from jaeger
they scream like banshees as if to draw strength
jaeger does a little chant oh god
the rope goes taught
jaegers body jerks violently backward as he gets the air punched out of him
as his feet leave the ground the mine detonates
a fireball blossoms and eats up the air towards the camera as the camera itself rushes away from the belching fire and smoke
his feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball but still get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground several feet from the explosion
epps runs to jaeger
wes takes a casual stroll back over
im all right
oh jesus im all right
all casual like wes says the map okay
we see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground
it looks like something has been dragged through the sand
the camera follows the tracks to epps wes and jaeger who crawl on their bellies
they thrust knifes into the sand before them searching for mines
we get the feeling theyve been at this for awhile
how long we going to keep this up
until were out of the mine field is how long
havent found a mine for half a mile or more
that dont mean nothing
iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think were in the clear
you want to crawl crawl
wes stands and starts to walk
epps waits a beat and follows suit
only jaeger stays down
youre going to blow yourselves up
wes is right
if there were any more mines we would have found them
hell that one you stepped on was probably old anyway left over from the war with iran
you dont know that
it could be a trick
if we step on a mine well know it was
let me see the maps
jaeger stays down afraid to get up
get up and give me the maps
after a beat jaeger stands and hands over the map from the puzzle box and a recon photo
epps compares the two then takes out the navicom
were on course
northeast twenty eight degrees
when we hit the base of the mountain well find a pass
i can see it on the recon photo
shouldnt be too hard to traverse
thatll take us to the top and
epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a smaller white dot in the middle
whatever it is
its the treasure thats what it is
it better be
epps starts to pack away the map
real plain jaeger says the map
epps stops like he almost not sure what jaeger is talking about
jaeger extends a hand
epps gets it
he hands the map back to jaeger who tucks it away
our boys walk on
youre not losing trust are you
just figure its my map i ought to hang on to it
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself
probably wouldve too if epps wasnt around to stop you
i didnt have to stop anything cause nobody was going to do nothing
were in this together understand
yeah i understand
wes doesnt want to come along in the first place but he gets a third of the find
thats a sweet deal
im getting tired of you riding me jaeger
anytime you want to do something about it just let epps stops dead in his tracks
they all go quiet
epps cocks an ear to the air and listens
they all listen
wind but thats about it
i dont hear any shut up and listen
again they listen
again they hear wind
then there it is the sound epps is looking for a pop like a big balloon being burst just over the next rise
quick like that jaeger grabs his m down off his shoulder and is about to ready it when epps slaps down the muzzle
its a fire fight
single shots doesnt mean a fire fight
thats not a battle going on
what is it
yeah what the hell is it
epps jaeger and wes edge carefully up to the lip of the rise on their bellies
theyre barely visible against the sand
epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on the ground below
through binocular lenses we see a shiite camp a tent city really
there are several uniformed iraqi soldiers who are roughing up the shiite men
what is it
epps hands the binoculars over to jaeger
who looks down at the scene on the ground
a bunch of them
what are they doing here
jaeger hands the binoculars to wes
well its iraq
im not sure but im guessing that has something to do with them being here
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere
maybe theyre looking for gold
again we see through the binocular lenses
one of the iraqi soldiers is pushing around a shiite having a good laugh about it then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a bullet gift
wrapped straight to the brain
what the hell did he do that for
why are iraqis killing iraqis
those people down there are shiites
youve got shiites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north
neither of themve got much love for saddam
probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some
theyre doing more than slapping
the shiites are on our side
i didnt know that
is there anything you do know
i know youre a pussy
i know that
lets get out of here
the soldiers are going to kill those people
we have to do something
theres nothing we can do
we can fight
thats what were here for to fight the iraqis
to help the shiites and the khurds
i didnt sign up to help any shiites
all we were supposed to do is get the iraqis out of kuwait and if we arent doing that then all bets are off
we carrying any ordinance
some extra grenades
epps thinks then shakes his head
were out numbered and out gunned
theyd cut us to shreds
so good bye shiites
thanks for playing
we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go
were american soldiers
we dont abandon people
funny you should say that while were out looking for gold
youre the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad
ive got a new agenda now its get rich
the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all
to wes i dont want to see people killed any more than you
but we try to help out we die and all we do is die
we cant just go off and theres nothing we can do
we shouldnt even be here in the first place
theres a big loud quiet as our boys just hang there
from down below comes another balloon burst another gun shot
epps lowers his head
he wants to fight but its like he said theres nothing they can do
epps slides back away from the rise then jaeger and finally wes disappears back the way they came
its the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find in a desert not too steep or rough but it looks as though they will definitely takes
more than a little physical exertion to navigate
epps wes and jaeger approach a path at the mesas base
jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over
this is it
were right on target
epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa
all weve got to do is make it to the top
and find the treasure and get it and get back to the humvee and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off but thats about it
were not going to find anything standing here
lets get to climbing
they ready their packs and weapons then start up the mesa
our boys trekking along the pass
they push onward and upward
the pass has narrowed and become more treacherous the rocks are loose and the footing unsure
the going has slowed considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their steps
our boys stop
the pass has seemingly came to an end
for a short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer
the three soldiers take it in
not much of a pass
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here
worn down to nothing now
picks up again just on the other side
they all take a good look at what little there is to cross on and how far down it is to the hard jagged rocks below
think we can make it
we make it or we go back empty handed
looks like we make it
epps and wes edge their way towards whats left of the pass
jaeger just stands there staring down
epps wes and jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of the mesa
small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to the ground below
no man says a word theyre too busy trying to keep alive and the air is filled with the sounds of labored breathing
each step so very careful testing the pass for purchase making sure the footing is solid
they inch one foot forward then slide over the next
their hands probe the cliff face fingers crawling like spider legs looking for something anything to take hold of
sweat drips into epps eye
he blinks hard and fast trying to clear his vision
right now he cant really afford distractions
slowly carefully inch by inch the little death dance goes on
he steps wrong
the pass gives way under his foot and begins to slide down
instinctively wes rockets out an arm grabbing jaeger by the uniform
at first jaeger smiles glad for the save
but then he realizes something wes is literally holding his life in his hands
all wes has to do is loosen his grip and
the color drains from jaegers face
wes stares back blank as a bowl of water
eternity goes on for a second
finally wes yanks jaeger back up against the mesas face then slides on
jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat clutching the rocks for dear life
epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass
he holds out a hand to wes and reels him in
together they both help bring in jaeger
wes looks back over the path theyve just crossed
the us army always an adventure
let me see the map
jaeger hands the map to epps who gives it a going over
they should be easy going from here
stay on the pass straight to the dot
what do you figure it to be
got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive
x marks the spot
something like that
but the white dot in the middle thats got to mean something
i hope it means something otherwise
otherwise whatever were looking for could be anywhere
but the map has been pretty precise so far
i dont think itll be too hard to our boys step past a grouping of rocks
they stop dead
sitting before them in what looks like a small camp is five iraqi soldiers
time clicks by real slow for an instant
its a delayed reaction like the beat it takes after you pick up a hot pan before you realize that yeah it is burning the flesh from your hand
our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came
they run like wild rabbits for a bit jumping over a rock formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover
like well trained warriors they peel their weapons from their shoulders lock and load and stand ready
they wait a bit taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under
finally epps gives the order
lets hit em
simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear down on the iraqis with their m s ready to blow them to kingdom come
one problem no iraqis
for a beat our three dont move
they hold position breath coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race
theyre eyes flint back and forth scanning for something
m still at the ready epps raises up taking a tactical stance
he inches forward sweeping his weapon back and forth before him for any potential target
there is none
the iraqis have vanished
epps lowers the m but does not shoulder it
wes and jaeger come up from their cover and cross to epps
they keep their weapons ready
eerily they all look around as if trying to spot ghosts
whered they go
i dont know
theres a lot of space up here
they could be just about weird they didnt chase us
maybe theyre as scared of us as we are of them
just seems weird they didnt chase us
whats weird is how they disappeared
doesnt make sense
there is a sound a steady swooshing that starts faint and grows closer like a rolling thunder
our three start looking around turning where they stand trying to find the source of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch
they see nothing
still the sound races closer and closer
epps jaeger and wes raise up their weapons in preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast
from below the edge of the mesa a helicopter gunship probably a mil mi hind d armed assault helicopter if you want to be technical raises up very dramatically into
it hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers
on board are the vanished iraqis wearing nasty grins
the pilot brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine cannons at our boys
wes and jaeger dont have to be told twice
they bolt from their spots and not an instant too soon
the gunner lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing
we see what the chopters weapons will do to rock
we can imagine what they would do to flesh
epps jaeger and wes take cover behind some rocks
the gunship swings around picks up speed and bears down on them
more shells fired
they punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover
again the three scatter and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock
our three go sliding down an embankment crouching low
their heads whip around looking for the gunship
where is it
whered it go
where the hell is it
just stay down
in answer to jaegers question the gunship comes swooping up behind them like a bird of prey
our three have all of about a second to get running before the iraqis send more shells their way
they kick up chunks of rock as they ping ping ping around epps wes and jaeger who make a wild evasive run
dig it up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face
they race for it hurl themselves into it as the gunship sends a special delivery of white hot metal their way
once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space
its too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through
our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck air
beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom
jaegers worked up a real scare
what are we going to do
what the hell are we going to do
were not going to do anything
panicked theyre going to kill us
they cant shoot us in here
and they cant fly around out there forever
so we wait
if they land if they land we can take them
if they dont land then weve got nothing to worry about
wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air
it floats very steady as if
wes eyes key in on something the gunships missile pods rotating slightly coming in line
wes eyes go wide like someone just jammed an electric cattle prod in his ass
epps wes and jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of the passage as a missile rockets from the gunships pod
with a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow straight into the passage
slamming into the ground it sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive explosion
it races through the passage lifts our boys from the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were nothing more than discarded ragdolls
jaeger takes cover and cowers
he puts his panic into overdrive
wes pulls his rifle
grunting like an animal he sprays bullets at the chopter but its like throwing snowballs at an elephant
the gunship turns on wes and fires in his direction
it doesnt hit him but it sends him running
epps has had enough of this shit
he scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about
it races for him cannons at the ready
this one is going to be close
epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him
epps fires but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug
the grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly
the chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks epps back flipping him up and over the edge of the plateau
his m goes flying smashing into the ground far below
epps manages to grab hold of the plateau lip with one hand
it swings him around slamming him hard against the cliff face
he hangs there suspended by his weakening grip far above the ground
jaeger and wes run to him grabbing him by his arm
they pull and pull hard until epps can get some kind of purchase and crawl his way back up to the plateau
at the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers above and beyond our three
it rotates so that the bay doors are facing epps wes and jaeger
three iraqis are inside weapons trained on our targets
one of them yells something
they want us to surrender
the three share a nervous look
epps fairly growls yeah ill surrender
jaeger and wes watch as shielded by their bodies epps palms a grenade from his belt
wes and jaeger dont quite smile but they know now they at least have a chance
as epps stands the other two turn to face the iraqis
they all fold their hands behind their necks which for epps hides the grenade from view
slowly they walk towards the gunship
one of the iraqis starts to yell something
he lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys
with his thumb epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly
its a perfect toss landing in the chopters bay
the iraqis see the grenade land they scramble for it
one of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship
the grenade explodes in the iraqis hand killing him instantly
it also touches off a fire ball that severely damages the gunship
it rocks lists spins wildly out of control
our three hug the ground as the chopters rotors go whipping through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among them
worse still the gunship now a lame bird drops from the sky towards epps jaeger and wes
all they can do is cover their heads as if that would do any good against two tons of crashing steel
the chopter rushes down
down but it just misses them
it slams into the ground skipping over the edge of the plateau to the rocks below
our three pick themselves up
they walk to the edge of the plateau and look down on the crash
jaeger scared painted all over his face sinks to his knees and looks as if hes about to go into shock
wes looks down at jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer
just keeps getting better and better doesnt it
they stare for awhile then one by one move off
we epps wes and jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs straight down into the ground
jaeger takes out his maps and photos
epps consults the navicom
what do you think
lines up with the map and the photos
were right where we should be
epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look around
not much to see
i sure dont see much place else around here to hide anything
wes pulls a lantern flashlight from his pack
going to his belly he shines it down into the crevice
cant see anything
he tosses a rock into it
we can hear it hit the ground below
its got a bottom
guess we know what the next stop is
lets break out some utility shovels lanterns and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting
me and jaegerll climb down and see what we can see
what am i supposed to do
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up
doesnt hurt to have a look out either
think there might be more iraqis
right now i wouldnt be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns
we see a few quick shots of wes securing a line down into the crevice epps and jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses the two men lowering themselves down into the
the lantern punches a hole through the darkness as epps uses it like a machete to blaze a trial
he sinks down
down until finally they touch bottom
he unclips himself from the rope and jaeger starts down
the space isnt that big like a small cave really
its tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole of it
but its big enough that one wouldnt have any idea where to start digging
jaeger makes it to the bottom
wes yells down
yeah were down
what do you see
more to himself a whole lot of nothing
so where do we start
epps takes a look around then shrugs
wherever you want
epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack
jaeger follows suit
he looks around picks a spot and starts digging
he sits up top weapon in hand standing guard
they dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave
they dig with a determination to find something
still up top hes given up on standing guard
now he stretches out on the ground sunning himself
their shirts are off and theyre caked with sweat and dirt
they look like theyve been digging for quite some time
they certainly dont have the same enthusiasm they displayed previously
now they just seem to dig by rote
the sun has begun to sink noticeably
wes leans over the crevice
suns going down
its getting dark up here
its obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come up with nothing
epps keeps digging but just barely
jaeger doesnt even bother anymore
he just sits on the ground sulking
he rolls over and scoffs
theres nothing down there
epps notices jaeger just sitting there
what are you doing
what does it look like im doing
it looks like youre not doing anything
and im not doing anything because theres nothing down here
get up and dig
weve been digging
weve been digging for hours
if there was anything here to find we would have found it
get up off your ass and dig
sounding defeated as all hell and very whiney whats the point
theres nothing here
the maps a fake
christ even i see that now
were just wasting our time
we might as well give up and epps spins
like a bolt of lightning hes on jaeger grabbing him up and pulling him close
you listen to me
the whole reason were here is because of you and that map of yours
i didnt do all this for nothing and im not leaving with nothing
if you think for a second im giving up just cause youre too tired to turn over some dirt then you dont know john epps too well do you
so you dig and you keep on digging til i say you dont have to dig anymore
epps pushes jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard
a fire burns inside him
a fire that burns out of control
before he even knows what hes doing jaeger springs to his feet shovel in hand bringing it down in a long arc for epps head
epps bears him coming
he deftly side steps the blow grabs hold of jaeger and forces him down
they roll around violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the other into a choke hold
he can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down
what are you doing
what the hell are you doing down there
they fight on down and dirty
locked together they roll around the ground each trying to get the upper hand
they smash into the lantern sending the cave into near darkness
at the same time epps works himself on top of jaeger
he lands a couple of solid punches takes a rock from the ground and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into jaegers skull
all jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow
something catches epps eye a glint of light flashes across his faces
he stares at it at an opening a bare seem really in the side of the cave wall where light seeps through
the rock slips from his hand
forgetting all about jaeger epps goes to the opening
jaeger himself as if what just happened hadnt really happened comes up along side epps
must be a compartment
i feel air
probably opens up outside somewhere
thats where the light comes from
couldnt see it with the lanternon
jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now
the white dot light in the dark
thats all epps needs to hear
he starts clawing at the opening with his bare hands
that gets him nothing
grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it
jaeger gets the lantern working again then picks up his shovel and joins in
they keep hitting and hitting picking up a rhythm like a southern chain gang
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore
the rock gives way enough for epps to pry it free
theres just enough space for a man to reach his arm through
for a beat epps and jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid of what mayor may not be in there
with some trepidation epps begins to move his hand towards the opening
slowly it extends closer
just as it moves beyond the opening
vthere is a wild screeching hiss as some small hairy thing leaps for epps
both epps and jaeger recoil jaeger going nuts with fear
jaeger grabs up his m and takes aim at
whatever it is
no dont shoot
jaeger squeezes off a few rounds
a couple of bullets hit the thing but the rest ricochet wildly about the cave and around epps and jaeger
all the two men can do is duck and cover squeezing themselves into tight fetal balls as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of random death
eventually the bullets lose speed and die off
jaeger and epps raise up off the ground
they walk to the dead thing that jumped from the opening
its just a mongoose
is it dead
yeah bwana you got it
yelling down what the hell are you doing
i think we found something
they go back to the opening
epps shines a light inside to make sure there are no more surprises then reaches an arm in
jaeger looks on with great anticipation licking his lips like a hungry jackal as epps twists his arm in the opening
epps face freezes
he goes perfectly still for a beat then slowly draws his hand from the opening
it clutches a wooden box
it is similar to jaegers puzzle box but slightly bigger
the instant epps sets the box on the ground jaeger smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood
from the splinters pours a river of gold coins
jaeger and epps are too stunned to do anything but look at it
he leans over the crevice
what is it
whatd you find
incredulous himself gold
jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs his lips flutter a bit before they land on the word gold
they scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through their fingers
its not like i figured
and its heavier than i imagined
i wouldnt know
i never imagined this
not in my whole life did i ever imagine this
you dont have to imagine it
now all youve got to think up is what its going to buy you
epps grabs up one coin and stands
with all his strength epps gives the coin an underhanded toss straight up
wes catches the coin
he turns it over in his fingers
he smiles and theres nothing pleasant about it
epps yells up
wes thrown down a pack
a beat later an empty pack comes falling down
epps picks it up and takes it over to jaeger
the two of them start loading the coins into it
i dont think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins
well send the gold up then me and jaegerll climb back
ready when you are
epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line when jaeger grabs his arm
jaeger isnt sure how to say what hes thinking
we send the gold up whats to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here
hes not going to leave us
whats to stop him if he wanted to
all he has to do is cut the line
what is to stop him
to jaeger all right
ill go up then you send up the gold and why do i have to stay down here
i dont see how that plans any better
someones got to send the gold up
it cant get on the line by itself
whys it got to be me
a tense moment passes
what are you doing
another moment then all right
you go up ill send up the gold then follow
yeah thatll work
jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on
hes just about ready to climb up when epps stops him
serious as a heart attack he says if youre even thinking about leaving me down here you better think again
jaeger stares at epps for a beat then laughs himself a little laugh
he yells up wes im coming up
jaeger starts to climb as wes helps out by pulling on the rope
epps watches him for a bit then looks at the pack of gold and the rest of the equipment
suddenly he scurries about gathering up all the things theyve brought down
jaeger continues his climb disappearing up into the crevice
a few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from above
epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to the rope
yelling up okay
the rope goes taught slowly drawing the pack up up into the crevice finally to be swallowed from view
epps waits for the rope to come back down
he waits a beat more
he tries to keep the apprehension from his voice but it creeps in anyway
he tries it again
still more nothing
whats that sound
its epps breath getting heavier and faster
the rope snakes its way back down
epps cant help but let go of a little laugh like a guy whos just been given a scare by his own shadow
taking up his own pack epps hooks up then starts the climb to the top
they work the rope helping epps up
he gets to the lip of the crevice and pulls himself over
hes breathing hard and lets his pack slide to the ground
trying not to sound too rattled
what the hell took so long
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line
it didnt seem that long
not when youre up here with the gold i guess not
throwing epps own words back at him not losing trust are you
epps lets this go
itll be too dark to make our way back now
lets bed down for the night and head out at first light
what about the gold
what about it
maybe we should split it up now
we started this together and were staying together so theres no point in splitting things up now
what if we get separated
way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share
wes might be right about that
it stays as it is
were halfway home now
lets not blow it by people getting ideas
youre the one with all the ideas
youve had your say wes
now leave it
maybe youve got ideas of your own for the gold
maybe youve already got things worked out
maybe i do
maybe i dont need your ideas
maybe i can do better on my own
epps sees trouble coming and deals with it the only way he knows how
casually he turns from wes as if hes about to let things go
suddenly he spins back around throwing a punch to wes jaw that sends him to the ground
wes puts a hand to his mouth
it comes back stained red
wes goes on the boil
you got no reason to do that
i told you when i straighten someone out they stay straightened
this is how it works nobody touches the gold
except when were on the move and someones carrying it nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it
jaeger wastes no time jumping in
that sounds like a plan to me
wes still on the ground fumes
you got no reason to hit me
im getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around
then get up and do something about it
wes thinks about it but thats all he does
hes not ready to cross that line yet
then just lay there and bleed
epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down
jaeger does the same
wes just lays on the ground
the first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark
our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled with gold
surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well but then the last twenty four hours has taken a lot out of them
there is a slight sound rocks crunching underneath a foot
someone stirs someone moves
its hard to tell who it is in this bad light
they creep towards the pack inching their way closer and closer
they reach out a hand just about to grab the pack
wes who obviously wasnt asleep at all lunges for the person and takes them down hard
theres the ugly crunch of body against stone as they hit the ground
m in hand wes straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle against his head
stay the hell down or i will rip your stinking head off
underneath him an iraqi soldier who already looks very badly injured bloody cut slightly burned babbles back in high pitched and frightened arabic
this is enough to wake jaeger and epps
what the hell
i caught him
i caught him trying to steal the gold
get off him
slightly crazed he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i wasnt sleeping
would have slit our throats if i hadnt stopped him
get off him
epps reaches down and physically pulls wes from the soldier who still rattles on
i told you
he tried to steal our gold
he tried to kill us
he doesnt have a weapon
hes a soldier
he doesnt need a weapon
hes got rocks
hes got bare hands
the soldier goes on babbling
wes has had just about enough of that
he gives the soldier a kick to the ribs
epps gives wes a hard push
i told you dont push me around
even now frightened but more calmly the soldier goes on
tell me what hes saying
wes listens but with disdain
he translates says hes one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter
he lived through that
the soldier goes on and so does wes
says they were deserters they were afraid to fight dont believe in saddam anyway
they flew the gunship up here to hide out
when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first
whyd he come in our camp
wes asks him the question in arabic and gets an answer
its enough to give wes a bit of a laugh
says he wanted food
he wanted the gold
hows he going to want the gold
he couldnt even know we had it
he could have been watching us
maybe we should give him some water
all last night he could have been i think he wants something to drink
im not wasting my water on him
jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier
i dont care what he says he wanted our gold
would have slit our throats if he had the chance
whatever he wanted he didnt get it
weve got no need staying around here
its light enough
lets pack up and head out
jaeger and epps start to go for their gear
wes is still on the iraqi soldier
what about him
we have to do something
epps gives an expression that screams what the hell are you talking about
we cant just leave him
hell run back to his outfit report our position
you said he was a deserter
thats what he says
he could be a spy or something
you dont know that
you dont know he isnt
so well take him with us
at least til we get back to the hummer
hed just slow us down and drink our water
and if we ran into any more iraqis you know hed sell us out
we dont leave him we dont take him with us
what does that leave
by way of answering wes lifts his m and works the action
youre out of your mind
hes an enemy soldier
im not going to let you kill him
were at war
the discussion starts to get real heated
we are not at war
you and i and jaeger are awol
we have no authority he tried to kill us
if not just now then in the helicopter
thats all the authority i need
jaeger goes somewhere near panic
we dont need to do this
we got the gold all right
lets just get out of here
the iraqi may not speak the language but hes got a pretty good idea what they are arguing about
he starts to plead for his life im not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around
i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you dont have the stomach to do what has to be done
ive got no stomach for murder
its a combat action
its murder and i wont be any part of it
then step aside
get out of my way
the iraqis begging goes into over drive
jaeger just about loses it
for christs sake we dont need this
lets just go
lets just get out of here
wes yells down at the iraqi
shut the hell up
wes moves menacingly for the iraqi
he thrusts his m forward
epps grabs it and throws a punch
unlike before with jaeger this time wes ducks the blow and swings the butt of the m back at epps
its not much of a blow though and epps keeps on coming
he barrels into wes and takes him down
as the two men tussle the iraqi sees his chance to get away
he springs up knocking jaeger to the side and bolts past him
hes getting away
epps turns and sees this
maybe hes not for killing this guy but he certainly cant just let him get away
he takes off running after the iraqi jaeger a step behind
the iraqi face flush with fear eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above
he knows if he can make it he at least has a chance of getting away
it shows in the desperation he climbs with
epps and jaeger are right behind him
they claw at the rocks but cant gain ground
the iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau to freedom
our two soldiers scramble up right behind him
the iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau
hes just about to pull himself up
hes just about to get away we hear a short burst of gunfire
three large bloody holes mushroom open in the iraqis back
he stands smoke curling from the muzzle of his m like a white snake having just send the iraqi some bullets special delivery
he arches stiffens then falls like a stone past epps and jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes
as the two climb down wes goes to the body and stands over it like the great white hunter standing over his kill
all business like he says i had to
you saw how he ran
would have given us away
i had to
theres a beat of quiet then maybe we ought to
you know bury him
say some words over him
you want to say some words
he sneers down at the body
go to hell
how are those words
wes moves off
a beat later jaeger walks away
epps just stands there looking at the body
wes epps and jaeger are making the trek back down
jaeger is shouldering the pack with the gold
wes has got his m
epps stops and puts his pack down
he takes out the navicom and a recon photo
we should head northeast
thats away from the hummer further into iraqi
theres another pass on the photo
we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up and it should get us back down
it should or it will
least going back the way we came we know what were up against
you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time youre wrong and youre not going to take my share of the gold with
you trying it
were heading northeast
really calm cold and direct wes says youve got an awful lot of orders in you
always giving orders
i out rank you thats why
in the service you do but were not particularly in the service right now
way i see it what were doing that doesnt particularly give you the right to toss orders around
epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring wes
we been down this road
i told you how it is
unless you feel like theres something you want to do about it
what if i do
epps says nothing so wes tries it again a little harder
what if i do
he works the action of his m
you talk loud and dont even have a big stick to back it up with
real casual epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the pin loose
he stands with the grenade in one hand and the navicom in the other
real calm like he was talking about the weather something happens to me i let go of this grenade
i go and i take the navicom with me
and how do you suppose youre going to find your way back to the hummer when you wont even know whats up or down
its a big country and you could be heading for the allies or wandering right into bhagdad
thats if you dont die of thirst before you even get that far
how you like my stick now
epps and wes have a stare down
jaeger whos getting really good at freaking out jumps in
why dont you put the gun down all right wes
you put the gun down and eppsll put the pin back in the grenade
wont you epps
the stare down goes on a beat longer
finally wes lowers his rifle
he turns to jaeger and vents what anger he can
im starting to think youre a real bitch you know that
the camera pans over the vast expanse of nothingness
smoke shiite encampment or at least whats left of it
tents are torn down and burned goods scattered
it looks like a ghost town
epps wes and jaeger wander into it
they look around but see no signs of life
wes grabs up some shiite garments white robes and starts to put them on
youre going to burn up in those
the white reflects the sun it keeps you cooler
thats why they wear them
jaeger looks to epps who just shrugs
jaeger gets some robes and puts them on
epps follows suit
think the iraqis killed them all
probably shot a few
scattered the rest
pointed murder or a combat action
its hard to tell them apart
they keep on moving passing straight through the camp
epps marches ahead not wanting to even deal with the other two men
wes talks after him
really he talks more to himself and hes not sounding too lucid
you saw how he ran didnt you
first chance he got he ran out
would have gone straight to his co told him all about the gold
what do you think would have happened then huh
then what do you think would have happened
two thousand screaming iraqis bearing down on us
you ought to thank me for killing him
ill get a medal for it
watch and see if i dont get a medal
epps isnt even paying attention hes just walking on
almost as if he senses something is wrong he stops in his tracks
he looks down at his feet and sees the most curious thing
sand is rushing away from his feet almost as if its going down a drain
he looks at it with the same wonderment that a dog watches television
what the hell
epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a moment later the earth literally drops from beneath his feet
hes standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in loose sand
immediately he sinks to waist level
he slows there but still goes down with rapidity
he screams to jaeger and wes
jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole
wes doesnt move
jaeger is paralyzed by indecision
he doesnt want to let epps drown but if he gets too close he could easily get sucked into
he flirts back and forth between rescue and safety
sand continues to pour in on epps
for christs sake jaeger
jaeger cant fight himself any longer
he lowers himself halfway into the hole stretching spread eagle trying to keep some kind of grip on the firmer ground and reaches for epps
their arms twist and strain for each others
first their fingers meet then they grab hands
they work a grip down to their wrist but thats all they can get
jaeger strains like a field horse pulling epps against the sand
it may not be enough as he begins to slip down himself
jaeger twists his head and looks up at wes
straining to say anything he pleads wes
his words fall on deaf ears
wes just takes a step closer to the pack of gold coins
this only serves to energize jaeger
he digs deeper within himself finding an untapped reserve of strength
he grunts and pulls the veins on his neck puffing like balloons
epps finds same purchase
he pulls swims his way up from the sand
a little at first but like hitting shallow water hes able to lift himself up
jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground
they collapse chests heaving like pistons as they suck air
as epps regains strength he pats himself down
suddenly he goes back into a panic
epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft sand frantically looking for the lost computer
jaeger joins in
they dig and scrape as best they can but daring to venture only so far into the soft sand
it doesnt matter
the navicom is lost
what are we going to do
how are we going to find our way back
well find our way
well find our way
epps wants to say how but hes got no idea
wes grows a smug smile
a lot of good you are now epps
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge
and let me guess who is
wes casually slides out his m
im the ones got the big stick
suppose i dont go for that
then i suppose itd be insurrection and i suppose id have to kill you
beat i suppose
what about jaeger
nothing about him unless hes got a problem about me dealing with you
yeah i got a problem with you killing epps
wes turns and glares at jaeger who backs down
i mean in principle
sneering you know jaeger you really are a bitch
epps isnt wasting anymore time
when wes turns to glower at jaeger he lunges up for him
wes side steps epps and lands the but of his rifle into the side of epps head
it opens a wound and sends epps back down to the ground
epps looks up right into the muzzle of west m
full of poison you die
wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot rings out
wes body jerks like hes just been hit in the back with a truck
the way cut timber falls he slams to the ground motionless
epps and jaeger stare at the body for a beat then snap their heads in the direction of the shot
up on a dune behind them are a group of shiites on horseback
one of them has a high powered rifle which he has just used to drill wes
he fires another shot
it pings to the ground between epps and jaeger
our two remaining men scramble
jaeger dives for the gold and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it
the two take off running as best they can in the sand
they run wildly erratically without looking back
they run until their bodies scream no more then keep going on inertia
reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and collapse in a heap at the bottom
they take a moment to catch what breath they can then we got to go back
we got to go back for wes
we cant just leave him
wes is dead
what if hes not
then he will be when those iraqis get to him
he was going to kill you
he was one blink away from it
hes dead epps and im sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass
they sit there trying to catch their breath
as they do a sound comes from the distance
they freeze ears cocked trying to figure out what it is
its a helicopter
quickly desperately as the sound of the chopter draws closer they scan the horizon looking for it
jaeger spots it and thrusts a finger in its direction
epps scrambles out his binoculars
he targets the helicopter
jaeger waits in high anticipation
ours or theirs
epps cant make out for sure
jaeger asks again with growing anxiety
ours or theirs
epps takes a long hard stare
its one of ours
weve got to signal them let them know were down here
the instant jaeger hears this his face twists up like hes thinking something and he doesnt like what it is hes thinking
quietly almost to himself no
we need something a flare a signal mirror
again jaeger says it this time including epps too
what do you mean no
they can fly us home
theyll ask questions want to know why we were out here
theyll search the pack
epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets
he stands ready to signal the chopter
theyll find the gold
epps turns sharply back to jaeger
were lost you understand that
weve got no navicom and no means to find a way back
so right now i dont give a damn about the gold because if we dont get off this desert and out of iraqi all its going to be good for
is buying us tombstones
epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter
hes about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an m action being worked
epps turns to face jaeger
i cant do it epps
not when were so close
i cant let you ruin everything
epps just stares at jaeger not frightened but surprisingly calm
first wes now you
im not like wes
wes was crazy
sarcastic and you youve got it all together
i dont want it this way
i wouldnt kill you just to kill you but i cant let you lose the gold for me
not when were so close
that helicopter passes and the only thing were close to is death
jaeger is unfazed
very politely he says sit down epps
epps takes him up on the offer
what choice does he have
the camera stays tight on the two men
they dont talk
they dont move
they just sit as we hear the sound of the crescenoo then begins to fade until it disappears
the chopter is gone along with epps and jaegers best chance of getting out of the desert alive
jaeger lowers his rifle
very genuinely he says im sorry about that epps
is it all right if i stand up
like he didnt know he was keeping epps from something
he looks around trying to figure things out
not much to figure
there still in the middle of a desert in a hostile country same as they ever were
im glad i didnt have to kill you
im glad it didnt come to that
well me too
i never killed anybody before
i talk a good game but im not like that
really im not
remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis
thats all it was was talk
i was scared out of my mind to go to war
i still havent gotten over stepping on that land mine
you still got a map on you
jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to epps
epps looks them over then looks over the terrain
without any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be finger paintings
i dont want to die
makes two of us
i know what i did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much i want that gold
its all right
i dont like it but its over now
i never had anything before epps
i never was anybody
not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins
when i was in high school i used to fed up with jaeger epps turns on him hard
hey you know what
can i be honest with you
right now im not all that interested in how youre messed up cause you didnt get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday
what im interested in is how i can keep from getting dead
and listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasnt good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a kennedy doesnt
do a damn thing to help keep me alive
so do me a favor either shut up or
just shut up
jaeger isnt sure what to say
epps sits down in the sand all out of ideas
theres a long quiet before jaeger says what do you think our chances are
if we can find the hummer or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay
weve got enough water for that
but we wont make another day otherwise
again they sit for a beat
wonder how the wars going
its got to be going better than this
epps stands and has a last look around
pick a direction
jaeger just gives a surprised look
we cant just sit here
weve got to start moving so pick
you sure you want me too
jaeger stands and takes a good look around
he considers things although there isnt much to consider
finally he decisively points in a direction
i pick that way
then we go this way
epps heads off in the opposite direction
epps and jaeger make the long march across the sand
theres so much nothing out there its maddening
epps drops down in the sand
he lets his pack slide fram his back then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig
he puts his pack back on and struggles to his feet
as jaeger crosses he takes epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him up
the two wade on
epps and jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day
they look worn out but they keep moving
jaeger is several paces behind epps
its a desert
thats what deserts do at night they get cold
im gonna stop for a second
just let me rest for a second
weve got to keep moving while theres still light
you know what im going to do
im just going to take a second
i want to look at the gold
dont you touch it
i just want to look at it
remind me of what im dying for
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here
yeah but we made that deal while wes was still alive
time for a new deal
jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it
epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist and forcing jaeger to let go of the pack
you listen to me
if if we get out of this i dont care what you do with your share but until then youve only got one thing to think about and thats staying
so you leave that gold alone or you and i are going to have to have a serious talk
epps waits for a response from jaeger but gets none
jaegers eyes seem to be glazed and his stare fixed on a point well beyond epps
he raises a hand points off into the distance
epps turns and looks
off a ways is a light in the window of what looks to be a shack type building
epps stares at it as if it were the holy grail what do you figure it is
place all alone like that
must be a boarder check point
couldnt be syria
we couldnt have gone that far north
its got to be saudi
epps heads for the shack doing double time
jaeger puts the pack back on and races to catch up
theyve got to have water
well get same water some directions maybe they even have a vehicle
we can head back for our lines and they dont even have to know about the gold
what if theyre not saudi
epps stops dead now not more than one hundred meters from the shack
if its a checkpoint it could be iraqi
epps considers this
weve got no cboice
either way weve got no choice
epps and jaeger keep on for the shack walking with apprehension now instead of running
epps stops less than fifty meters away
well we should identify ourselves
yeah i guess we should
epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack
instead he turns to jaeger
even if they are iraqis probably all theyll do is take us prisoner for awhile
got to figure were still kicking their asses in the war
they dont want any trouble
hell theyll probably just surrender to us
again epps takes a deep breath
and again just as hes about to cry out he turns to jaeger
thats if the war is even still going on
way things were shaping up its probably long over
epps takes a beat then sucks in a breath
he yells for the shack hellooooo before epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun fire erupts from the house and burns towards epps and jaeger
they dive for cover hugging the ground as bullets whistle and ping through the space around them
they are forced back and down against a narrow stretch of rock but it offers little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead
its just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them and death
at the top of his lungs jaeger starts yelling ashra ka mahari dahra sahib
ashra ka mahari dahra sahib
just as quickly as it began the shooting stops
from the shack we hear some chatter in arabic then the door opens
a few men appear in the doorway
they laugh and beckon for epps and jaeger to join them
what did you say
i dont know
something wes had taught me
i think it means dont shoot
were your friends
they must be saudis
its a saudi checkpoint
oh sweet jesus
epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack
jaeger is just steps behind him
they enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the four men inside
epps and jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on chattering behind them
oh man this is good
what do you think the chances are theyve got a whirlpool in this place
as they rub their hands together epps looks up
hanging on the wall is a very handsome nicely framed portrait of saddam hussein
epps nudges jaeger who also looks up
he also freezes
they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them
they couldnt tell in the dark
what are we going to do
what are they going to do
slip out your m
and then what
and then shoot them
i never killed anyone before
i told you that
well youre going to start with a bang cause youve got four of them to take down
behind epps and jaeger one of the iraqis asks a question of them in arabic
cant you i dont have a weapon
again the iraqi asks the question
we can tell by the tone of his voice he expects an answer
dont go bitch on me now
you were going to kill me
i just said i would
i dont think i shoot them
the iraqis sense that something is wrong
they move menacingly for their weapons
shoot them jaeger
jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his m
he jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth back and forth
dig it the iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of the muzzle flashes
they do the twist they do the jerk then they all fall down
the bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the place shredding walls eating up wood
jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty
he stands huffing eyes glazed like hes a million miles away from what he just did
epps steps up and takes the weapon from jaeger
thats like an alarm clock that brings jaeger back to the land of the living
jaeger takes one look around at all the carnage then doubles over and gets to puking
epps just watches this pathetic sight
when jaeger is all done lets get some sleep
the sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as jaeger comes awake
the second he does he sees a man arab wearing white robes peering through the window
jaeger gives a start and the man disappears
jaeger quickly shakes epps awake
theres someone at the window
this wakes epps up quick
i dont know
he didnt have a uniform on
he had on white robes like the guys who killed wes
epps does some quick figuring then staying low scrambles across the floor to one of the dead iraqis and grabs up his weapon
he grabs another one tosses it to jaeger
carefully still low epps creeps over to the window
slowly he raises up and looks out
epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking
what do we do
we cant stay here
even if that wasnt an iraqi soldier its only a matter of time before some show up
get all the water you can carry and well head out on foot
sun rises in the east
we go the opposite direction
may not find anything but at least well know were heading towards saudi arabia
as jaeger gathers up what water he can find creeps for the door
with the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a crack and peers out
its like the man vanished into thin air
jaeger stocked up on water comes over with the gold and epps pack which epps shoulders
epps opens the door and the two men carefully snake their way out weapons at the ready
it seems though there is nothing to be ready for
there is no one around
suddenly the man appears from around the shack
epps and jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons but they do not fire
the man just stands
he doesnt say anything he makes no threatening moves
the three stay still as statues for several beats until epps jerks his head indicating to jaeger they should move on
that they do weapons still on the man until they are beyond his range
they walk on a little ways
jaeger spots something and thrusts a finger in its direction
mounted on a horse riding on a dune that runs parallel to them is another arab man
he makes no effort to draw nearer to epps and jaeger but nor does he lose them
what do we do
we keep going thats what we do
we ignore them maybe they ignore us
as if to be contrary to epps statement another two arabs on horse back appear up over a dune before them
how many of them are there
epps doesnt know and he doesnt want to find out
they change direction heading away from the arabs
but again more arabs ride up over a dune
epps gets the feeling he and jaeger are about to be boxed in
i dont like this
epps breaks into a run
jaeger is only steps behind him
like something out of an old john ford western dozens of mounted arabs suddenly appear over a dune
they ride fast and hard for epps and jaeger like apaches heading for a wagon train
they easily overtake our two momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs and ride on a bit as if playing with them
epps and jaeger stop then bolt in the other direction
the arabs ride back again past epps and jaeger swiping them to the ground the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them
it looks like a cattle round up and our two are the cattle
epps and jaeger get up to make another run of it and again the arabs bear down on them
this time they mean business
they completely surround them cutting off all means of escape
the arabs start screaming something back and forth in arabic
we dont know what but it sounds unpleasant
epps and jaeger come skidding to a halt
they turn in their tracks digging in the scene
it goes like this they are completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force
doesnt get any simpler
epps and jaeger drop their weapons
their hands go in the air
the mounted arabs lead epps and jaeger hands tied before them and almost literally being towed by the horses into their camp
it is similar to the shiite camps weve seen before with several tent dwellings
as the party enters groups of shiites come over to stare at epps and jaeger
they chatter amongst themselves but our boys have no idea what theyre talking about and that just makes things all the scarier
from our boys point of view this is all like an unending nightmare being dragged along through a desert not knowing the language not knowing whats going to happen
their world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt a whirl
finally they reach a tent
one of the arabs tosses epps and jaegers packs on the ground just before it
another cuts them loose and shoves them inside the tent then yells something at them in arabic
he leaves and our two are alone
what do you make of them
shiites i think
is that good or bad
i dont know
they killed wes
why havent they killed us
i dont know
maybe we can fight our way out
against how many
we cant just sit here waiting to die
you come up with a better plan let me know
maybe if we traded them the gold
if we gave it to them they might let us live they might not kill us
we hear a voice i always knew you were a bitch
epps and jaegers hearts seize up and stop
its as if theyve heard the voice of a ghost and they have
he carries with him the pack of gold
epps can barely get his name out
you were shot
we were standing right there you were shot
in the flack jacket
still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat
took the air right out of me but i was just unconscious for awhile
course you didnt stick around to find that out
you left me for dead
we thought like a guy who just took two steps over the edge ohhh shit
epps gets the feeling theres not going to be much dialog going on here
wes gets real calm again which is almost as scary as him acting nuts
when my shiite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic
turns out weve been kicking ass in this little war
they figure weve finally gotten saddam off their backs
they brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me
im their new best buddy
america number one joe
but theres something the shiites cant figure out they cant figure out why my two buddies two fellow americans left me out in the desert
they cant seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost
its almost as if they were iraqi spies or something
and ive got to tell you they hate anything thats got to do with the iraqis
see how i mean
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint
jesus wes i killed the iraqis in there
you actually got around to killing someone
i guess youre only half a bitch
wes we thought you were dead and we thought we were next
hanging around to get killed wouldnt have done anyone any good
sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with
wes look i know you guys are telling the truth
its just the shiites dont know that
i guess you could tell them
but then you dont speak the language do you
wes gets right up into jaegers face
of course wes knows they dont
he allows himself a very sweet shit eating grin
theyre going to kill you slow
ill see to that
he steps away and starts to open the pack of gold
thanks for taking care of this for me
tell me something wes
are you crazy greedy or just stupid
jaeger says youre crazy
i didnt say that
i never said me
i say you dont have enough brains to be stupid
for a second wes is taken by surprise by the statement but he smiles at epps boldness
he sets down the pack of gold and gets right up into epps face
you disappoint me epps
always figured you to be a man a real bright guy
i had respect for you
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert
thats just what things came to
sometimes you cant help that
it doesnt change me respecting you
and now you let me down
i expected more from you you know
i really did
i expected you to now its epps turn to go smug
you expect this
wes got nothing to say
to jaeger get the gold
jaeger grabs up the pack
to wes now lets try things another way
lets try this you and me and jaeger are going to walk out of here
were going to walk out all smiling and friendly so your little shiite buddies wont suspect a thing
then were going to hop on some horses and ride away and live happily ever after
its all going to happen just like that because if it doesnt then im going to gut you like a fat pig
you understand me
wes says nothing
ill take that as a yes
epps gruffly spins wes around and presses the knife up against his back so that it is hidden
epps marches wes outside the tent stopping momentarily to grab up his pack with his free hand
to jaeger he says get the water
jaeger does as hes told
theyll kill you
you wont make it ten feet before they cut you down
you dont know john epps very well do you
can you ride a horse
no but i figure nows a real good time to start
they walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses
they pass a shiite who says something to wes in arabic
epps gives wes a poke in the back with the knife
dont say anything
the shiite obviously expecting an answer says whatever it was he said again
just keep quiet
i have to answer him
so you can give us away
if i dont answer hell know somethings up
epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time
you answer him but you answer him wrong and youre going to be staring at your insides while youre dying
wes very calmly says something to the shiite
the shiite just stands there for a beat looking at the three men then suddenly explodes in screams
no way of knowing for sure what hes saying but since hes going off like a westec alarm its a pretty good bet hes been tipped of
epps rears back a fist and slams it into wes face
epps and jaeger take off running for the horses practically leaping into the saddles as shiites come pouring out of their tents
forgetting himself wes screams in english
jaeger and epps spur their horses and take off riding hard
its amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry shiites are chasing you
wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by shiite and mounts up with blood in his eyes
he leads a charge of armed mounted shiites that looks like a posse going after some bad men
out front epps and jaeger pull up for a second
epps takes a look behind him
he cant hardly miss the sandstorm wes and the shiites kick up as they ride for them
epps points off to some foothills in the distance
its the only thing close to cover for miles around
ride for the hills
well try to lose them
they take the reigns to their horses and get to riding
behind them wes yells to his riders and signals for them to split up and try to cut off epps and jaeger
epps and jaeger hit the hills
they ride up for a bit then stop to spot wes
wes and his crew are better riders and have closed the gap
all the two can do now is try to lose them in the terrain
epps and jaeger ride as best they can and somewhat erratically to cover their trail
they head up a ways then cut across in a parallel direction
jaeger looks back but sees no sign of wes
we lost them
just as the words leave jaegers mouth a hail of bullets explodes the ground before them
their horses rear up and its all they can do to fight them
just ahead are the shiites who split off from wes having circled around epps and jaeger
the two yank their horses back and ride hard in the opposite direction with the shiites just behind
they fire on epps and jaeger the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them
epps and jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs
and good for it too otherwise they might be dead by now
they break for a trail that leads further up the mountain but it does little to shake loose their pursuers
as epps and jaeger level out they can see the trail below them and wes and his posse riding for them
our two start back the way they came
but the other shiites crest the hill
epps looks from side to side
either way is certain death
then he looks off towards an embankment
it is very steep
it would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment safely
all epps knows is there arent any gun totting shiites in that direction
which way do we go
we go this way
fear gives way to desperation
both men whip their steeds hard
the beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down
both epps and jaeger have to lean back in their saddles until theyre almost parallel to the ground just to stay on their horses
wes sees this and swears
he signals to his men to cut back the other way
epps reaches the bottom of the embankment
jaeger is almost there when he looses control of his horse
both rider and animal go tumbling in an ugly fall
the horse gets up and bolts off before jaeger can get to her
just then wes and his men make it back down the trail and start riding hard for jaeger
epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade
as he rides in he leans to the side and low
stretching out an arm epps literally scoops jaeger and swings him up behind him
a couple of rodeo performers couldnt have done it better
problem is with the extra weight they cant go very fast
wes and his men close hard now
the bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys
epps whips the horse trying to get everything shes got to give
this is it they get away now or not at all
their horse finds a little something extra
she goes faster faster
suddenly epps pulls up hard on the reins
the horse rears up she goes wild
it takes everything epps has to control her
but better that than if shed taken another stride
theyve come to the edge of a very very sharp cliff
epps may be a good rider for a novice but no way he could get this beast to fly
finally he calms the horse down but it doesnt matter
wes and the shiites ride up behind them cutting them off
wes stands down from his horse
epps and jaeger with nowhere to go do the same
the gold give it to me
epps takes the pack from jaeger but doesnt throw it to wes
give it to me
if i give it to you will you let us go
wes smiles and lies so badly he doesnt even bother trying to fake it
whatever you want
for old time sake
epps has got no choice really
he tosses the pack to wes feet who stoops to pick it up
wes starts to open the pack
looks like at the end of the day we finally find out whos better than who dont we epps
like i said i expected more from you
its like i said you dont really know lieutenant john epps very well do you
wes rips open the pack
hes got about one second to see whats inside
just a booby trapped claymore mine
epps grabs jaeger and yanks to him to the ground
there is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily destroys wes and a few of the shiite standing next to him
the rest along with the horses scatter for dear life
epps stays down until the coast is clear then gets up
jaeger to say the least is stunned
we lost the horses
it wasnt the gold
it was the claymore mine
the golds in my pack
when did you make the switch
its always been like that
when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured id better
i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack
just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own
we had a deal
no one touches the gold until were out of here
no one breaks the deal no one had anything to worry about
what if it hadnt been wes
i mean accidently what if i had
you shouldnt think about things like that
itll just make you crazy
we hold on the two men on the smoking remains of wes
we hold on them then epps and jaeger come up to the road a small highway
its eerie a road in the middle of the desert
they just stand and stare at it for a beat
a cars got to come along sooner or later
when it does we jack it
how do we do that
you lie in the middle of the road look like youre hurt
when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head
why do i have to lie in the road
somebody has to
yeah but why me
what if the car doesnt stop
then im a rich man
epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car
the only thing he gets is more quiet
jaeger sits next to him
after a couple of beats epps
i want you to know
i dont know
i just think youre a hell of a guy
this whole time youve kept your head
you didnt go money simple like me and wes
youve just been trying to figure how to get us out of here
and youve been fair too
i mean even after i
threatened to blow my brains out
even after that
you didnt take it out on me except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now
but id say youve been very fair
i just think its a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple
dont make so much out of it
only reason i havent figured a way to get all that money for myself is because ive been too busy figuring ways to stay alive
believe me if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had
im no better than anybody else
ive just been busier
they sit a while more
still no car
im thinking about taking a trip
thought you were going to buy a car
theres more gold than i thought and since theres only two of us now
where should i go
i dont know
ive never been anywhere
i wouldnt know where to go
where would you go
how the hell should i know
another long beat
still no car
id go to australia
lot of land not many people
i think after this id like to quit people for awhile
and the girls go crazy for brothers down there
thats what i hear
girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold
from the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor
it draws closer and closer
epps and jaeger stand
knowing theyre so close to the end of a long adventure they become very business like
well this is it
we get the car find some americans
we find americans well be all right
well make up some kind of lie
they wont find the gold
epps and jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car draws closer
see you in a minute
jaeger goes out and lays in the cars path
epps goes to hide behind some rocks
the car keeps getting closer and closer
jaeger yells over to epps
epps i dont think hes slowing down
hell slow down
the car gets closer
hes not slowing
hes going to slow down
the car gets closer
the car barrels right for jaeger
forget what epps says its not slowing down and jaeger knows it
at the last possible second jaeger rolls out of the way
the car doesnt slow tearing across the stretch of road where jaeger lay but swerves to avoid him
the driver loses control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt
epps runs to the car rips open the drivers door and presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head
you speak english
do you speak frightened y yes
jaeger runs over and jumps in the car
epps gets in behind the driver keeping the gun pressed to his head
where were you going
whats in the other direction
this road it leads straight to kuwait
turn the car around
please i beg of you
the american army is there
i am iraqi
they will kill me
nobodys going to hurt you
epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver
you see that
you take us to the americans and well give you another one
the driver turns around the car and starts back in the direction he came
they drive on for awhile mostly in silence
epps and jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much and the driver is too scared
finally the driver starts to talk
you are americans yes
neither jaeger or epps answer
we didnt not all want this war do you know
we didnt not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in kuwait
now your army crushes us
so few days and so many have died
and many fear we will all die
please tell this to your people we did not want this war
still jaeger and epps say nothing
outside the car the traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets thicker and thicker
i have a brother in our army
when i take you back will you look for him
if he is still alive will you look for him and take care of him
this last bit gets to epps
well look for him
outside the traffic away from kuwait has gotten so thick everything is at a stand still
there are iraqi military vehicles pulling out as well as a good many civilian cars and trucks
it clogs up both lanes and envelopes the car
some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much faster
look at this
they are fleeing from kuwait from your military
see if you cant drive around this
the driver tries to work the car free of the congestion but hes wedged in and not going anywhere
from out of the sky swoop down a flight of american f e fighter jets
they swing down on the far end of the highway engines roaring like angry lions
for a second time stands still
everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets
time starts again and with a deadly vengeance
the fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway vehicles and people civilian and military alike
there is no distinction only carnage
this is the infamous al jahra highway from basrah to kuwait city that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on the last day of the war by american
it became known as the highway of death
the huge shells rip a bloody path shredding cars and trucks igniting explosions straight towards the car with epps jaeger and the driver
with barely seconds to go before they are shot to pieces as well
they dive from the car epps dragging the driver out and scramble for cover along the side of the road
the planes turn back for another pass
what the hell are they doing
therere civilians in there
not even thinking about what hes doing jaeger jumps up and screams at the jets
epps jumps up and drags jaeger back down to cover as the shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them
the jets bank and swoop for another run
epps realizes there is something wrong
he looks around desperately but doesnt see
there back in the car
epps runs for the car trying to beat the jets
jaeger lunges for epps but misses him
epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car
he dodges jukes and weaves among shells shrapnel and explosions that go off all around him
he just makes it to the car grabbing up the gold as the fighters once again swing low and cut loose
a wicked hail of shells reigns down
it sets off a series of violent explosions that knocks jaeger off his feet
it takes him a beat to recover
by then the fighters have done their job and fly off
he walks towards the road over the plaintive wails of the barely living
the car the gold epps
they are essentially disintegrated
their car and epps that are gone
there isnt much of anything left on this road
just death destruction and bloodshed
jaeger is cleaned up in dress uniform and sitting at a table before a military tribunal
he looks very sullen as if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul
the members of the tribunal just look pissed
the members of this tribunal have reached a verdict
based on the evidence presented we find the defended guilty as charged of desertion insurrection insubordination and conduct unbecoming
further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man
you should consider yourself quite fortunate son
there was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad
i dont know that a person like you has much to say for himself but it is your right say something
jager doesnt stand
he doesnt look at the tribunal
he just begins to talk
im sorry i guess
not for looking for the gold or leaving my post
you know what its like to have gold raining out of your hands
thatll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig
im just sorry about wes
he was all right
it was the gold that made him what he became
if i hadnt found that map if i hadnt talked them into going searching
wes just might have made it home after all
i guess i feel responsible for him
the way i view things youre responsible for the lives of two men private first class wes hanmond and second lieutenant john epps
yeah well ive been thinking about that
see there was an explosion and everything but i never really aaw epps get killed
and nobody ever found the gold
i guess they both could have been burned to slag
but there were a lot of bodies out on that road
a smart man could have found some identification to use
a smart man could have made his way up to syria or turkey
a smart man could have gotten himself right out of the middle east
a smart man with enough gold
way i figure right about now old epps is sitting in a bar in sydney or melboure or maybe brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest aussies you ever
the members of the tribunal just scoff
i find it highly unlikely that anyone could accomplish such a thing
well sir i guess you dont know second lieutenant john epps very well do you
jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the tribunal with this question
