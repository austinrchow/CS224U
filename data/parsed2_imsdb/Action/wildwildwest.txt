a slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop
the chirp of cicada is the only sound
but suddenly the chirping gets louder and louder bzzzzz
until we realize its not the cicadas but a swooosh
a lethal razor sharp disc buzzes up over the horizon swoops toward the camera and out of frame
the camera spins around to see the disc flying away chasing a man thaddeus morton wearing a strange metallic collar exhausted horrified about to die
he looks over his shoulder panting hes been running forever
warn the president
morton zig zags through a grove of trees a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc
but the ruse is futile
the disc goes straight through the trees slicing a path straight as the crow flies
dilapidated broken down weathering away in the field
morton runs around the wagon but the disc buzzes straight through the sideboards
wood shavings spit everywhere
theres no stopping this thing
running for his life stops turns
he turns incomprehensibly mumbling pleading for his life cowering
wild wild west rev
and the disc swooshes toward the camera bzzzzzzz
a man leans into frame
this is general mcgrath
and hes there to collect the silver death disc
mcgrath to the unseen dead morton and they says you scientists are supposed to be smart
hooves thunder by
then bouncing skidding wagon wheels
up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex rebs
as the rebs pass a pint of whisky lash the six horse team on pan with the wagon to see its headed for
the legendary captain james west and i finally got him all to myself
west is bathing with the beatiful saloon girl
thats right sugar and you should feel free to treat him just bad
she moves in and kisses him long and hard
west hears the clatter of the approaching wagons
he stops the kiss and peeks out the knothole
down below west sees the wagon with the rebs
wild wild west rev
to himself general mcgraths boys
i thought yall was never gonna show up
mister west you wouldnt be here workin tonight now would you
would you be working if you were up here with you
they start kissing again
he surreptitiously peeks out the knothole while continuing his kiss
this two story victorian building across town is a gentlemens sporting house in name only
drunken roughnecks and ex confederate soldiers goose and maul the rouged up tarts
shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry
the toulouse lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and makeup identifying her as a soiled dove
a whore not to put too fine a point on it
shes trying not to make eye contact with two men seated at a table across the parlor
soiled doves pov gen
mcgrath and hudson hudson is a fearsome looking indian in a well tailored suit
long black braids descend incongruously from under a homburg hat
as for his companion
mcgrath is a mountain of drunken pus
six foot sweating like a devonshire hog with his tattered undersized confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top
his ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to be a miniature leather victrola horn
mcgrath smiles at our soiled dove and makes a little kissing gesture
wild wild west rev
eyes widened in revulsion
what evil abides in this godforsaken place
now a drunkenly eye crossed reb licks doras ear then whispers something in it
something unspeakably vile by doras expression
that wont be possible
the rebs load the boxes onto the wagon
we see the wheel of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water tower
packer up good virgil
next stop norleans
west is unaware that shes watching him not watching her
ah this hole is a safety issue
im thinking what if it starts to rain and the water level goes up
it could suck you right up
im protecting you
variations saloon girl frustrated has grabbed wests boxer shorts with little horses on them and plugs the hole with them
belle you dont just ram a mans underbritches into a knothole
you wanna plug the hole you ram your own britches in there
west is at a loss
she moves in for another kiss
wild wild west rev
the horses spook as a crate is dropped onto the wagon
caught on the water tower leg
west hears the creak
he breaks the kiss
serious much as id like to take credit for that you might need to hand me my gun
the tower starts to topple
hand me my gun
west crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes
the only people more shocked than he is are the guards and the rebs he just dropped in on
west picks himself up smiles coolly at the drenched slack jaws
okay who just made a wish
was it you
he looks up at the freaked out saloon girl still in the tank
she hangs on with one hand the other hand clutches his clothes
i could sure use those clothes now
she responds by frisbee ing his hat down
west picks it up with a look
uses it to cover his genitals
wild wild west rev
well we got us a shy nig
but he never gets that word out
west lashes a lightning martial arts kick to the rebs jaw
fought five long years with the union army not to hear that word again
and you boys lost remember
as the other reb comes at him he spins still holding the hat in front of him
down that one goes
west looks up at the none too bright water tank woman
how bout some pants
as she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap
general mcgrath checks a pocket watch looks up impatiently at the indian hudson
his eyes drift upwards
to the balcony where
have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk
mcgrath im still waiting on my guns and ammo but i see my men have brought your merchandise
mcgrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for hudson to confirm
mcgrath i had expected to be delivering it personally to mr
hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name
the indian speaks in a very precise kings english
my employer here in a brothel
a small ironic smile that would be quite
move in on an elegant brougham driven by a very large very striking woman in livery
as the carriage passes under the gas lamp we can make out the top hatted silhouette of mcgraths employer dr
clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women
as he strokes the cheek of the oriental one with the back of his hand like a cat
fat cans mcgrath and hudson night youll meet him when the time and place are appropriate
stands shall we go upstairs to check the merchandise
mcgrath frankly mr
hudson i wasnt planning to walk those oaken stairs with you
direct me to the poot sir
something young and creamy
a gamer that takes to the crop and spur
mcgrath looks to the singer rita who beats a hasty retreat from him after her song
so once again mcgrath lays his rheumy eyes on
shes oblivious more intrigued by the ex rebs on the balcony with the trunk
as she starts for the stairs
a mans hand grabs her
its the eye crossed reb again
you drive a hard bargain lady
all right fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and
still not interested
she tries to pull away
but the reb wont let go
but you gotta be interested
youre a whore
suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage
the falsetto becomes a baritone growl
baritone that doesnt mean a girl cant have high standards
just as the reb registers the odd new voice
her corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw
the rebs eyes roll back
and he slumps to the ground
the soiled dove is a man
hes artemus gordon and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly
but now as he she stashes the unconscious reb behind the bar straightens bosom and wig
west is trying to get dressed
as he pulls on one leg of his pants a guard lunges at him with a knife
west hops up on one leg smacks the guy with a mule kick
now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve
when the hand emerges out of the cuff its balled in a fist which coldcocks the other guard
could i have a little privacy here
as if in response the water tower still hovering above now crashes to the floor obliterating his opponents
he calmly looks up in time to catch the falling naked screaming saloon girl in his arms
youll have to excuse me darlin
but my evidence is getting away
west gallantly puts her down jumps up grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse
as the horse team which has spooked thunders past
sails onto the runaway wagon
as he pulls himself into the back he gives the shivering saloon girl a tip of his hat now on his head
sorry about there not being any towels
general mcgrath leers down a line up of fat cans girls
just as he gets to the beautiful singer who looks sick at the thought suddenly gordon intrudes
he she blocks out the singer poses coquettishly sucking a lollypop
mcgrath whats your name missy
demurely back to his falsetto dora
would you like to go upstairs
mcgrath oh indeedy i would
gordon dora starts to go as the eye crossed reb wakes up
he grabs him her very pissed
who the hell are you anyway
mcgrath emphasizes his claim by gut shooting the reb
the shot makes dora gordon jump and the room go quiet
as the reb crumples mcgrath turns back to gordon dora oddly inspired
mcgrath i feel like
trying to be coquettish again my talents really lay elsewhere
mcgrath nothing stokes the fire in my loins like a ditty
mcgrath hauls him her over to the piano player
mcgrath youve got some pretty fair lungs on ya girl now use em
he punctuates with a slap to gordon doras rump
the other singer rita watches too
gordon dora is sweating
reluctantly he she whispers something to the piano player
he clears his throat and begins singing
weakly buy a drink for the boys in the backroom for me
west spots the contents of an open box
stuck in sand
but clinking together ominously as the wagon races over the cobblestones
backwards ass bumpkins got a wagon full of nitro
west tries to steady the glass vials with his hands
but its no use
he quickly climbs over the boxes onto the buckboard seat
but the reins are dragging on the ground beneath the frothing horses
west leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the street
he pulls himself over the first ones neck
onto the next horse
and as he tries for the lead horse he falls between them
gordon dora singing
he she struggles through the song in a very tough room
and tell them i tried
and tell them i cried
just when it looks like the stone faced rowdies might rip him her apart mcgrath starts tapping a mud caked toe
encouraged gordon dora belts out the next verses over
wests custom boots drag in the dirt as hes about to be trampled under the hooves of the freaked out horses
and if he hasnt got enough problems the lynch pin attaching the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out
clanking together like chimes
straining with every ounce of strength in his body he pulls himself up by the harness onto
west grabs for the halter
but it doesnt whoa
the wagon goes around a corner up on two wheels
its about to tilt over when west grabs both the horses ears yanks them back screaming into them
i said whoa
this approach seems to work
the team comes to an abrupt stop
and with it the wagon hanging over the edge of a steep drop
jim carefully climbs off
he slaps the dust on his jacket straightens the crease in his trousers
when he looks up a bitter smile
well well this is workin out to be a perfect day
the tasteful sign under the red light reads fat can candys
and framed in the window general mcgrath with his singing soiled dove
general bloodbath mcgrath
fat cans close mcgrath mcgrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now singing along with gordon dora
he shes won over the room
rousing finish and tell them i tried just the same
he she curtsies to rousing applause
mcgrath beams like a man with the fire in his loins roaring
he grabs his little songbird and up the stairs they go
out the windows we see west tracking them
simul taneously going up outside steps
leads the sweating leering general down the hall
he she quickly opens and closes boudoir doors ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation
the real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk
he she registers a mild reaction of shock
closes that door and moves on to
the two rebs sitting on the trunk
at their feet is a wriggling burlap sack
the merchandise is alive
gordon dora giggles like a schoolgirl
well thats a new one
mcgrath slams the door drags gordon dora roughly
our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling herself for the task at hand
mcgrath beckons her over to the bed
mcgrath dont let the ear scare you
i lost it at chickamauga
gordon dora squints at the jerry rigged ear
one can hardly notice
fiddles with her belt buckle would you mind
cant seem to release the clasp of my belt
say no more
mcgrath is on her like a flash fidgeting with it
but it pops open revealing a spiraling screen courtesy of dr
his eyes lock onto it
its a deep deep pool
maybe your old swimmin hole
getting sleepy general
mcgrath ga ga yes im sleepy
mcgrath sits on the floor
this is gonna be easy
normal voice good
youre going to be my little doggy
and when i say speak you tell me everything i want to know
mcgrath barks woof
all right little doggy
as he does now tell me whos in the sack next door
is it the scientist dr
speak words dumb doggy
tell me the name of the man you kidnapped him for
but mcgrath doesnt answer
gordons mesmer spiral slows to a stop
mcgrath is coming out of the trance
mcgrath starts to growl rip at his her petticoats
watch the swirling spiral
lie down bad dog
as gordon notices that his contraptions failed
is busy trying to get the spiral going again doesnt see mcgrath reach for his boot knife
just as the deranged generals about to plunge it into gordon dora
the window explodes
jim west comes tumbling into the room kicks the knife out of mcgraths hand in one smooth move
west rolls to his feet fixes a gallant smile on gordon dora
didnt mean to startle you maam
looked like you could use some help
it takes gordon a moment to recover
he stares at this black samaritan obviously having no clue who he is
clears throat to recover falsetto looks can be deceivin
i am perfectly fine
west quickly pats mcgrath down removes a revolver and his bag of gold coins
i can see that darlin
woman of your caliber probably gets top dollar too
so here you go
flips her mcgraths coin bag you can run along
ill take care of mcgrath
as west sticks the barrel of his gun in mcgraths gramophone ear gordons eyes pop
i need him
you got the money
have a little dignity
gordon jerks wests gun hand away from mcgraths head just as the dog soldier comes around
mcgrath suddenly lunges at him
mcgrath bellows ferociously west
he drives his full weight into jims back pushing him out into
mcgraths rebel yell brings help from all directions
doors bang open all along the hallway
not just mcgraths men but hudson and his crew
a melee will ensue
west pushes the monster off of him rolls as a bullet splinters the wood where he just was
the shot starts
all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits
the beautiful young singer whod been coming up the stairs alone is now swept back down them
gordon still in character pushes his way upstream to the room where the scientist is held
hudson his back turned barking orders at his henchmen
get escobar out of here
the henchmen heft the wriggling sack when leave him right there
hudson whirls to see the gruff talking gordon dora holding the perfume bottle on him like its a colt
now gordon shakes one of the heavy bracelets off his wrist clicks a lock snapping it open
hes accessorized with custom handcuffs
lets go hudson
hudson gives a sick little smile reaches for his gun when
gordon sprays him in the eyes with the second bulb of the atomizer
the first mace
hudson howls in pain drops the gun rubs his eyes madly with both hands
gordon starts to snap the cuffs on the perfectly presented wrists when
brawling a dozen attackers
west spots mcgrath trying to escape down the stairs
he uncorks a lethal kick sending a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of gordon
gordon staggers drops the perfume mace bottle which shatters
hudson recovers his vision enough to send a fist into gordons mascaraed face pile driving him back into the hall
while hudson and his men make their escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack
west is blocked from chasing mcgrath gordon from going after hudson
west tries to push her aside
now get outta my way lady
the baritone growl im no lady
im a u
you get out of my way
gordon whip off his wig reaches inside it for something
west blinks at the weirdness reflexively draws his colt
as gordon withdraws not a gun but a badge from his wig
is waiting at the top of the hill beside the nitro wagon
loveless is beside it face still shadowed
has opera glasses trained on the second story of fat cans
her name is lippenreider
and now well see why
in a monotone get out of my way
get out of my way
the lip reading is interrupted by the arrival of
who come racing up with the scientist in the sack
federal agents inside sir
so miss lippenreider informs me
sighs still i believe good manners dictate we should send out
his cane telescopes out and loveless pokes the lynch pin out of the harness on the nitro wagon
then he gives the wagon the slightest push
the welcome wagon
once started the wagon rolls downhill toward the back door of fat can candys picking up speed
then as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into the carriage loveless steps in behind
and theyre off
west and gordon oblivious to the impending disaster
so now what
the answer is provided as the nitro wagon hits downstairs
theme music up
as we roll
the titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from the tv show
in the two corners are our heroes upper left shows west with his gun levelled toward
upper right gordon with his wig in one hand and his badge in the other pointed across toward west
the cowboy agent in the middle square fights and defeats the various bad guys
then as he exits quick zoom on main title the wild wild west
pan down to a sketch of a train caboose as titles end
west rides his magnificent black stallion down pennsylvania avenue
besides horse drawn carriages west shares the dusty road with people on bicycles the latest craze
he finally pulls his steed up at his destination
west dismounts ties his horse to a hitching post and winces as he puts his weight on a sore leg
west limps past black floor scrubbers
they stop working to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place
but not everybodys so impressed
as west heads toward the oval office four self important house detectives block his way
whoa there pardner
as west stops winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule but you cant just traipse into the presidents office
now gimme that gun
he nods at the six gun on wests hip
west coolly flexes his hand above it like hes about to draw
then like lightning with his other hand he whips out a sawed off shotgun hidden by his jacket
he pokes the gauge barrels up against pinkertons surprised crotch
or this one
a voice stops the situation from escalating further
the detectives head swivels around to see
stands in the doorway
dont make captain west any later for his appointment than he already is
the detectives back away from the hair trigger cowboy as fast as they can
west reholsters the gun and continues
president grant goes over to his desk lights a cigar
backlit in the haze the portly bearded figure lives up to the myth
been a lot of death threats lately cabinet made me hire some damn detectives
by way of apology drink cigar
thank you sir
west limps across the room to the bar pours himself a glass of whiskey takes a cigar out of the humidor
i hear you let general mcgrath get away
now wests blood is up
sir i had him right in my hands when some half a sissy wearin a dress ruined
cuts him off artemus gordon
of course i know him hes the best marshal ive got
hes a genius
off wests incredulous look gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect
nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his president
except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy
west just looks at him soberly
draws his gun and places it against the presidents head
grants eyes widen
who are you
i am the president of the united states
west points the gun to the ceiling and pulls the trigger
as grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down
who are you
i am the president of
as west cocks gun im artemus gordon
west lowers his gun nods at gordons class ring
the president went to west point not harvard
will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about
the real one stands in the doorway hands on hips surrounded by his house detectives their guns drawn
west nudges the fake grant in the fake belly with his gun barrel go ahead
sheepishly gordon starts peeling off his primitive but effective facial prosthetics
sir in perilous times like these i was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the white house
just as gordon makes his intestinal allusion west takes a ceremonial bayonet off grants desk and pokes a hole in the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch
the air hisses out finishes deflating with a flatulent r r rip
hey the first whoopee cushion
gordon scowls at him
youre clever gordon
one day itll get you killed
west smirks as grant looks up at the bullet hole in the ceiling then fixes west with a disapproving eye
and you west not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first shoot later shoot again then when theyre all dead try to ask a question or two
shakes his head working together will be good for both of you
the wild wild west rev
but sir i work
you work the way your commander in chief tells you to work
grant turns and exits frame
the place is a buzzing intelligence operations center state of the art for the s
maps of the u
and the world are on the wall
various staff and military people work clacking telegraphs printing machines that grind out reports etc
grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos all depicting distinguished bewhiskered men
ten of our countrys best scientists
all kidnapped in the last year
by general mcgrath it now seems
turns to them the fact is gentlemen youve both been working on the same case all along
why did it take you so long to realize it
well sir one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman
the detectives snicker over that one
grants had enough
i dont have time for this bickering
one week if were to believe this
grant holds out a letter to gordon and west
gordon snatches it reads reading general grant the scientists that you seek are in my employ the wild wild west rev
creating a weapons system beyond the pale of contemporary imagination
history and justice are on my side
i suggest you put your affairs in order
you have one week before you will surrender the u
this letter was delivered inside this
an aide presents a glass case
inside is a cake in the shape of the white house
reaching inside marzipan isnt it
grabs his hand wait
suddenly dozens of deadly looking spiders swarm out from inside the cake
gordon jerks his hand back
its mcgrath sir
the south is rising again
im gonna stop it
sir wests obsession aside mcgrath may be a vicious killer but a mastermind he is not
so whom do we seek
after consulting with intelligence
cuts him off mcgraths headed for new orleans
the longer we stand here talkin the farther away he gets
i dont need intelligence to tell me that
ah so that would mean you rely on stupidity
grants had enough
im leaving today for utah where the transcontinental railroads will be joined at promontory point
grant points to a map of the united states
the railroad lines have been drawn in
still a gap between them
for the first time the united states will truly be united
turns holds up letter someone wants us divided
now look you two are the best ive got
put aside your differences and stop this madman
whoever he is
if you fail well
we may never know how great this country couldve been
snaps off a salute you have a week
they both return grants salute as the president stomps off
his aide now approaches
the president has put a private train at your disposal
engine number five track six
holds out a wrapped box mr
gordon the item you requested
gordon takes the box hurries to catch up with west
west and gordon walking toward the hitching post
west is so beside himself he can barely untie his high voltage stud
he glowers at gordon who goes over to where
is parked on the other side of a bush
it has the customary big wheel in the front little wheel in the back
hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire
dual manifolds that sling under the riders legs
west shakes his head in disgust
i call it the bi axle nitro combust
ive gotta train to catch
west swings into the saddle
he looks at the snorting wild horse under him then down at gordon attaching the box onto the seat of his nitro whatever
snaps off a smug salute yee haaa
west spurs his horse and leaves gordon in the proverbial cloud of dust
although wests intentions are clear for some reason gordons in no particular hurry
he sighs climbs on the bike takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles
then finally ready
an engine kicks in and gordon rockets forward
yep artemus has invented the first motorcycle
fiery exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels him down the street at about mph right past
who both look over in wide eyed shock
the horse rears as gordon screams by leaving them in a cloud of internal combustion
from in front as it chugs towards us
sitting up in the spanking new steam engine no
is a white haired coleman
the wanderer is his pride and joy
coleman pushes the throttle forward and the engine roars past us
followed by a tender and two gleaming passenger cars
then comes west thundering past in a desperate effort to catch up
riding like hell
getting the last ounce of speed out of his well lathered steed he finally pulls alongside the rear passenger car
he looks up
in the window we see gordon engrossed in what hes doing
which appears to be sewing
stop this train
you hear me
if gordon hears him he pretends not to
he just casually makes the next stitch
wests horse has had it
theyre losing ground to the train
at the last second west leans over at full gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train
he swings out of the saddle hanging on for dear life blowing in the breeze like laundry
finally his boot finds a small metal plate to put its weight on
just as west stands safely on it
he flies up in the air and drops through a sliding partition in the roof
the car is like a classy victorian mens club
bar stocked with crystal decanters a pool table decorative pistols on the wall books etc
gordon seated in a club chair looks over as west falls from the ceiling into a seat
hes hot dusty and very pissed off
he glowers at gordon murderously
calmly thanks for dropping in
forget the bikes the beards the fake boobies
put down the needlepoint and lets settle this like men
he takes off jacket starts rolling up his sleeves
gordon remains remarkably cool continues sewing
as a matter of clarification this isnt needlepoint
he shows him some real needlepoint
right now im putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation
i call it
its a vest that when worn under the clothing can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range
west draws his gun aims it at gordons stomach and cocks the trigger
gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach
but it hasnt been really tested empirically yet
west takes off his guns and puts them on the table
yawn yawn guns
i find them so primitive and unnecessary
if one has done ones proper planning
how do you feel about a fist
gordon puts down the impermeable stands with a weary sigh
i must tell you mr
west ive always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part
well then mr
gordon you failed
west unleashes a lightning punch that drives gordon across the train car
he dabs at his bloody lip
im sorry mr
west you brought this on yourself
then to wests utter amazement gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time crooking his right leg stork like
is this some kind of martial art
then he bends at the waist and like a ballet dancer extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch
it immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling
it whacks west on the side of the head and sends him spinning back onto the pool table
shakes it off and is about to attack again
gordon calmly pokes a hidden button
suddenly the pool table revolves
west is gone
i love this train
west eyes wide is clinging on for dear life staring at the ties racing by inches from his face
gordon pours a fine bordeaux speaks loudly toward floor
the president asked for my suggestions on how to make the wanderer both comfortable and functional
as he swishes the wine in his mouth
west reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes and wires on the underside of the car
as he rips one tube out of the undercarriage
gordon has just settled into the club chair puts his wine down on the table
and while youre down there you may want to avail yourself of my sub carriage inter rail egressor
suddenly shackles snap out of the arms of the chair pinning gordons wrists
before he knows what hit him the floor opens and the club chair disappears
gordon appears upside down in the chair chagrined at his predicament
west looks from the escape trolley gordon was talking about back to his partner
only one doin any egressin is gonna be you
wide eyed perhaps the president was right about us putting aside our petty differences
recites above the the opposite is beneficial from things that differ comes the fairest attunement
suddenly they flip out of frame and back into the car shocked to find themselves facing
colemans a scowling grizzled old man in a coal stained suit
hes got a fire in his eye brown spittle in the corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives permanently and a large copper pot in his hand
knock each other about all ya please but harm my train and ill douse ya like dogs
he threatens them with the pot of steaming liquid
now for the first time gordon really looks troubled
thats my veal reduction sauce
well then lets get on about our business shall we gentlemen
now where to
shall we let professor morton decide
a severed human head is in a vise
meet professor thaddeus morton expert in the field of metallurgy discovered in a field of alfalfa
kidnapped from m
six months ago
west looks from the head to the open box
thats a mans head
gordon holds up a strange circular metallic object
and this magnetic collar was around it when his body was discovered
havent figured that one out yet
but west is still staring in disbelief at the head
thats a mans head
gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind the head
according to the retinal terminus theory
a dying persons last conscious image is burned into the back of the eyeball like a photograph
perhaps theres a clue there
excited gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back of his head
beams of light are coming through his eyeballs creating a blurry color image on the wall
mortons last image
thats a mans head
west turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted image projected on the wall
gordon realizes the problem
the refraction of the lenses causes the image to appear upside down
he turns mortons head in the vise
its right side up but still blurry
its a man who has a tiny victrola horn for an ear
hes holding a bloody metal boomerang
i was right all along
gordon sees something in mcgraths pocket
he seems to have something in his pocket
too fuzzy to read though
gordon drums his fingers on his great frontal lobe stymied
mortification of the aqueous humor seems to have led to the loss of
wild wild west rev
west takes the bifocals out of the box casually puts them on mortons nose
west now gestures to the wall
the white blur in the mans pocket is now focused
we can see that its the top of a piece of paper
he reads the writing on it
friends of the south
come to a surprise costume ball
april eight thirty
lowers glasses looks up like i said
we see the wanderer parked on the siding as we hear voices over
how about this
you could come as my man servant
gordon has his wardrobe open
selected from his vast array of costumes and disguises is a full livery outfit
how about this
you could come as my man servant
slave voice oh yes massa gordon dats what ill do
and ill jus smile and do as is tole so those people won ever know that i would rather shoot myself in the head than play your god damned man
west is right in gordons face
wild wild west rev
i have a horse costume
then cheery you could be the head
the only thing i need to wear is this
west straps on his holster
okay if you insist on carrying a firearm i have something i think youll find intriguing
gordon displays a belt with a silver buckle
he taps the buckle
a derringer pops out
west stares impressed
and it would go nicely with this
gordon takes out a sequined dress holds the derringer up against it
jim west does not wear a dress
then whats your plan
how bout this ill go as a government agent whos gonna kill mcgrath
an armed negro cowboy costume how creative
in a room full of white southerners you oughtta fit right in
you might even win first prize
west starts to walk away
gordon grabs him
listen to me
the art of disguise is whats going to get us into that party thus allowing us to find these kidnapped scientists before theyre forced to create something that will destroy
this great country
wild wild west rev
now you and i are the chosen ones jim
were under direct orders from the president himself
and our mission is clear save our country
our freedom is at stake and this is our duty as men
now you go as a riverboat captain and ill be a saloon girl
let me tell you a little something about beloved art of disguise
that night at fat cans i knew you werent a woman
but i was propositioned by three men
gordon you looked nasty
your breasts were all hard and stiff and were sticking straight out like two rusty cannons on a sunken ship
gordon grabs his fake breasts off the rack
he puts them on
these are a work of art
scientifically and aesthetically perfect
they look like shit
i dont wanna touch em
i can see i dont like em
what are you afraid youre wrong
touch my breasts
west touches gordons fake breasts
wild wild west rev
walking through the next car carrying a tray of tea
gordons last line got his attention
coleman peeks around the corner to see west eyeing gordons chest
to himself i knew it
well ill have no part of it
coleman shakes his head and walks off
west is thwapping gordons breasts
there gordon you happy
im touching your breasts
not so rough
the buckwheatll come out
thats your problem
west takes one of the cow udders out of gordons bodice and dumps the buckwheat onto the ground
what are you doing
west goes over to a wash basin picks up a water pitcher and fills the cow bladder
west squeezes the cow bladder shut and holds it up to his chest
now squeeze this
this is what a breast should feel like
passing back through the next car
when he hears that last line he cant believe it
he peeks in again to see
wild wild west rev
isnt that nice
colemans mouth drops
now touch yourself
disgusted federal officers bah
coleman walks off shaking his head
suddenly gordon shoots the cuffs off his jacket
out of one sleeve comes a pen
out the other a small pad of paper
they are both connected to a spring loaded metal gizmo up his sleeve
west reacts drawing his pistol up into gordons face
i was just going to jot down a thought
you know something thats a good place to put a gun
but then where would i keep my notepad
you know artemus i think you underestimate the convenience of a pocket
carrying some costumed swells pass through wrought iron gates guarded by some of mcgraths ex rebs
follow it up a spanish moss draped drive to a huge garden district mansion
as the carriage pulls to a stop in front
wild wild west rev
jim west drops to the ground from where hed hitched a ride underneath
he rolls into the shadows of the house
when he stands hes face to face with a huge guard with a gun
you got about as much chance of havin an invitation as him
he smirks at a lawn jockey
west reaches into his coat
matter of fact got it right here
he withdraws his hand
while the guard squints at his empty palm west grabs his head with his other hand and smacks it into the lawn jockeys fist
west leans the cold cocked guard against the house uses his shoulder as a step boosting him up to
west grabs the ironwork underneath and acrobatically swings himself over the rail
as he breaks the pane on the french door with his gun butt
west lets himself in
then just as hes about to part the heavy drapes
he hears womens voices approaching
in a spanish accent hey
get your hands off me
now miss lippenreider amazonia and munitia bewigged and wearing costumes wrangle a beautiful and defiant latina into the room
when she turns we recognize shes the singer from fat cans
rita is in her early s wearing a th century camisole so scanty it makes it hard to concentrate on what shes saying
put me in the dungeon with all those smelly dirty bearded men but i am not goin in there
you applied for the position
yeah a standing up position
im an entertainer not a
amazonia grabs her by the throat choking the word off
do not be selfish and stupid
he always spoils his new girl
well gimme a simple diamond bracelet instead of that
a ramp leads to a large bed
a leather and steel prosthesis is hanging from pulleys attached to the ceiling
it is not so bad
once the metal warms up
amazonia just picks her up and drags the hapless rita into the room
west emerges from behind the curtains shakes his head
he eases out the door and into
west hears the party din coming from down below
he goes to the balcony
the scene below is hallucinogenically surreal
a babel of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us
avant garde music is coming from two x quartet boxes on either side of the room to create stereo
an authentic cowboy outfit
complete with six guns
west turns to see who busted him
coming his way is a ravishing chinese girl dressed up as a dragon lady
what a terribly clever costume mr
west meets east
mae lee east
holds out delicate hand are you here alone mr
actually im uh trying to surprise an old friend general mcgrath
seen him around anywhere
i dont believe that name was on our guest list
and i would know
lovelesss personal assistant
the name means something to west
one of the great founders of the confederacy with jefferson davis
funny how most people think hes dead
tonights his coming out party
we follow them as she takes his arm and leads him down the stairs into the party
west surveys the crowd
see anybody that looks familiar
west scans the room
matter of fact i do
shes got the mole too
gordon has apparently encored his soiled dove get up
miss east sees who hes looking at
she makes a pouty face as theres a flourish from the stereo quartet
blows a little kiss at him meet me later
in the foyer
west watches as she joins
miss east leads them in a sober rendition of the battle hymn of the republic in front of a large doorway
singing mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord
from behind the doors we hear the whir of an elevator
it stops with a clunk
bursts open and abraham lincoln in a mini float appears
its decked out like lincolns box at fords theater
on its own power it moves past the laughing party goers in the foyer
now the women throw grapes on the floor
singing he has trampled down the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
are whats trampling down the vintage
west takes in the whole man
it explodes like a pinata
up from the hole in his neck peeps
impishly dont you just hate that song
the southern crowd gasps at lovelesss dramatic appearance
why yall look like youve seen a ghost
its me dear friends alive and kicking
well alive anyway
as he giggles the distaff corps surround him and remove the lincoln paraphernalia
then step aside revealing
is half a man
cut off at the waist and mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an engine he is a man bereft of tuchus kishkes and everything else in that
vicinity that makes life interesting
chuckles we mayve lost the war but heaven knows
we havent lost our sense of humor
loveless looks down at himself smoothes half of his fritz lang metropolis style suit
his face turns dark as he surveys the crowd
not even when weve lost a lung
thirty five feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce
like a preacher all in the name of the south
then quietly do we lose our sense of humor
you can hear a pin drop
loveless turns to the foreign dignitaries
i owe a deep debt of gratitude to my friends across the sea for their comfort and
he suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that surround him
then abruptly manically
mi casa es su casa
ma maison est a vous
let the party begin
loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing
miss east leans down and whispers in his ear
loveless looks in wests direction
now loveless wheels over to west
west isnt hiding
hes cocky in the face of rolling danger
west how nice of you to join us tonight
and add color to these monochromatic proceedings
west keeps a lid on his temper
two can play at this game
well when a man comes back from the dead its an occasion to stand and be counted
loveless smiles slightly
miss east informs me that you were expecting to meet general mcgrath here
i knew him years ago
but havent seen him in a coons age
i bet a man like yourself would find it difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know
danger flickers in lovelesss eyes
he looks to miss east
perhaps the lovely miss east will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment
well you know beautiful women
they encourage you one second cut the legs out from under you the next
lovelesss face drops
he is no longer amused
miss east winks at west then accompanies loveless in the direction of the study where
general mcgrath waits impatiently
he takes two champagnes off a passing tray guzzles them then wipes his mouth on dolly madisons bustle
as his eyes sweep the room
he ducks behind a mountain man carrying the french tricolor
when loveless and general mcgrath disappear into the study and close the door west eases after them
he pauses as he passes the soiled dove leans into her big bouffant
he regards a stained glass window patterned with a spider over her shoulder
i see a big ole spider up on the wall
hope it doesnt drop down your pretty dress
as the soiled dove jumps a little west continues over to the study door
now the soiled dove turns and we see the scared confused expression
maybe its because she is not artemus
hes the mountain man in the fringe jacket
and right now hes shaking his head as he watches west resort to a decidedly low tech surveillance method of lovelesss study
peeking through the keyhole
so th century
mcgrath paces in front of lovelesss desk
loveless my men are ready to go to war with no weapons to fight
ever since the nitro and the guns were destroyed at fat cans lice and demoralization have set in
your men will have their weapons tonight
and my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century
mcgraths face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin
mcgrath oh youre a pip sir
id follow you into the maw of cerberus himself
loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the desk
and so you shall
makes an x have your men here at
loveless wheels his chair toward the door with mcgrath behind him folding up the map
ducks out of the way as loveless and mcgrath emerge from the study
as they disappear into the throng of well wishers west takes a thin lock pick out of his hat band
it takes him a moment or two but the lock finally clicks
then west slips inside apparently undetected except by an unimpressed gordon
moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil portraits of various loveless relatives
the one behind the desk is in the style of gainsborough
a loveless uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor two english setters by his side a holland and holland double held in the crook of his arm
west turns his attention to the desk blotter
theres a faint imprint where loveless drew the map
west takes his penknife and a pencil grates some graphite into the depressions
hes just about to do a rubbing on a piece of paper when
someone swipes it out of his hand
hands on hips she gives him a naughty naughty look
i said to meet me in the foyer
oh the foy aay
sorry ive never been much good at french
but instead of scolding him further miss east plants an over heated kiss on him
tongues are involved
as they break she gives a little nod of approval
she pushes him down into dr
so lets see mr
are you a dangerous spy of some sort
or just a handsome cowboy who likes to
that second one
she starts to undo the buttons of his trousers
but west has a job to do
well maybe he can do two jobs at once
is being the perfect party guest moving through the crowd chit chatting with this person and that in french spanish german when he sees something of interest
munitia and lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom lock it behind them
whats in there
as he starts upstairs amazonia appears blocking his way
big sturdy gal
yer dance card full
amazonia stares at him then spiels off a couple lines in a foreign language that makes gordons eyes widen
he understands what she said and its not flattering
gordon moves off in a shock
are locked in a passionate embrace
west manages to position her nearly naked rear end over the graphite powder
very carefully he stands pushing her buttocks onto the desk and then rolling her off
the imprint on her left cheek is perfect
but unfortunately its backwards
he lets miss east concentrate on what shes doing which from the sounds o
doesnt appear to be a demonstration of the correct way to butter corn
west spies a mirror on the other side of the room and raises her ass up into position so he can see the corrected reflection
comes into view
it clearly shows the meeting place to be malheureux point northeast of new orleans
but the mirror reflects something else of interest
the painting behind him has come to life
the loveless in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is pointing it at the back of wests head
suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an explosion rips the back of the chair where his head would have been
he draws and shoots the would be assassin who falls out of the painting dead
west turns to see
a surprised look on her face
a hole in her forehead
he lowers her head gently to the ground regards her map imprinted rear end
thanks for helpin me get to the bottom of this case
emerges just as a kentucky reel starts up
he weaves his way through the dance floor and spots the soiled dove look alike out on the floor
west reluctantly straightens his shoulders and cuts in
this bold move gets some looks of disapproval from the pecan pie crowd
both look straight ahead not at each other
west so as not to attract any more attention
his partner because shes scared shitless of this strange negro who keeps hounding her
real impressed the way you got the dance floor staked out
maybe one of your missin scientistsll cut in
dip thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight
twirl i found that our host dr
west looks over to where loveless is leading a contingent of foreigners out a side exit
is meeting mcgrath and his troops at malheureux point in an hour
bends her back so you enjoy the party
im gonna go save the republic
the soiled dove look alike is speechless
before he goes west leans in smirks
but i will say good work on your bladders tonight
theyre damn perky
and just to dig the grave deeper west lays hands on them and gives them a little squeeze
this immediately elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the bejesus out of the black cowboy
and hes not the only one
staring at him
we know what theyre thinking but the mountain man behind west says it for everyone
and with that gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal his own rope which he throws to the mob
west looks back at the character in amazement
before west can say or do anything guns are at his temple and hes swept out of the room
wild wild west rev
gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap seemingly uninterested in wests imminent hanging
in the hubbub of everyone rushing out for the hanging gordon heads up the unguarded stairs to the locked room
as he pulls out his high tech auto wind lock pick and quickly gains entrance to the door
hand held torches illuminate
the rope is tossed over a lamp post
pan down to where one of the mob dressed as george washington is binding wests hands behind his back
looks like were gonna have to teach yall a little lesson on how to behave in polite society
dont grab a white ladys boobies at the big redneck dance
is that the lesson
well i learned it
dont scratch your head with the shrimp fork
i got that one too
so whaddaya say we call this off
eases in stops at what he sees
and it sure aint scientists
beside the bed locked in an iron disco like cage is rita still wearing her scanty outfit
gordon squints at her gives a charming smile
i feel as if we know each other from someplace
try again buster
she takes a breath as if shes going to start screaming
gordon quickly holds up a hand
the wild wild west rev
while i realize i look like something straight out of james fenimore cooper
i mean you no harm
my name is artemus gordon
and you look like youre in trouble
to ritas amazement gordon opens his jacket and unbuttons his vest to reveal
a complete miniature tool shop
quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots
i was hired here as an entertainer
not that im complaining but what are you doin in here
looking up miles of leg looking for some missing scientists
not that im complaining
gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe
it becomes a pedal that operates the wheels rotation
now he removes a bit and handle from his vest and attaches the cable
starts to pump his foot
its a foot powered drill
im a special u
marshal on assignment from the president
almost impressed if youre so special how come youre lookin up here when loveless has em all workin down in the dungeon
rattles bars impatiently get me out of here and ill take you down there
wild wild west rev
the dungeon is cleaned out
it was the first place i checked right after i sampled the gumbo
bit heavy on the okra
but rita isnt listening to the food review
her minds racing
finally the lock clicks and the cage door swings open
gordon takes the distressed damsel in his arms lifts her out
suddenly a coquettish smile thank you
artemus was it
one doesnt forget a smile like that
now where in the world was it
have you ever played the empire room
the bijou cafe perhaps
west is lifted onto the back of a wagon
with the noose dangling in front of his nose west addresses the crowd
can i have everyones attention please
i think weve had a series of major misunderstandings and id like to take a moment to clear them up
first the whole drumming on the boobies thing
in my native land africa my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages
im sure yall can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to baton rouge
hell on a clear day we might even get galveston
all i was saying was howre you doing my names jim hows your mama
wild wild west rev
that redneck comment
im getting the sense that some of you took that negatively
you know some of my best friends are whiskey guzzling pot bellied rednecks just like yall here
then that slavery thing i dont see what the big deal was
hell who wouldnt want somebody to run around for them doing chores
are you going to get your big fat lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton
i dont think so
then lets head on inside and knock back some shine
come on back inside
to soiled dove i stand before you as a man who realizes he has done something wrong and i am prepared to do the right thing
will you marry me
soiled dove gasps
ill take that as a no
darling would it help at all if i said i thought you were a man
the camera finds the soiled dove
as west searches desperately for signs of rescue by his partner suddenly the wagon lurches forward
as they plummet toward the ground
the rope catches
as they slowly touch the ground
nobody is more confused than west
how the fuck did that happen
but before anybody can figure out gordons trick rope speak of the devil
the crowd turns with alarm to see
nostrils flared and wild eyed are having their rumps snapped by gordons reins
rita holds on for dear life as the mad mountain man drives the carriage at full speed right into the crowd scattering them
he sees his opportunity for rescue puts a foot into the back of george washington grabs his gun and somersaults into the air
lands squarely in the back
and just as the rope starts to stretch around his neck again gordon whirls around with a bowie knife and cuts it
west leans into gordons ear
the wild wild west rev
suddenly theres a volley of shots from some cracker sharpshooters
west responds with an amazing display of rapid fire marksmanship picking off half a dozen of lovelesss shooters even while the carriage bumps wildly on its getaway
still pissed to gordon hangm
to rita meet my trigger happy partner james west
who doesnt seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists
now west notices the half dressed bombshell in the carriage
this is rita
i found her locked in a cage in lovelesss bedroom
shes an entertainer
um maybe i havent been quite honest about that
my name is rita escobar
i came to find guillermo escobar the scientist my
gordons eyes pop
he was the one i almost rescued that night when
lightbulb thats where i know you from
fat can candys
you sang before i did
the wild wild west rev
that was me
burgundy dress with the bustle
gordon starts singing the song
west rolls his eyes cuts off the chit chat
look rita im sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case
when i find your father i promise ill send him back safely
and with that
west suddenly leaps over rita lands on the back of one of the horses
he grabs a handful of mane leans over and unclips the harness
and with a kick in the ribs west is off at a gallop leaving gordon one remaining horse and an awed rita behind to chew his dust
hes impulsive james
loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are sipping champagne
one of them is holding a little dog in his arms barking at something in the dark
general mcgrath stands at the railing uncharacteristically pensive
loveless rolls over hands him a glass of champagne
well general its been a long journey from new liberty
mcgrath visibly winces at the sound of it
mcgrath sir there isnt a day that passes that i dont contemplate it
yes and so do i
so do i
reflexively reaches for missing legs if id only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that i have today
mcgrath thats not what i meant
loveless looks at him puzzled then gets it
oh you mean the stomach churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre
loveless speaks for the benefit of the others
what was that nickname again
mcgrath reluctantly bloodbath mcgrath
the butcher of new liberty
a reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down to marsh
beyond that is the gulf of mexico
we recognize one of the rebs from the cathouse
he opens his pocket watch
they oughta be here by now
maybe were in the wrong place
rechecks map no were supposed to wait xactly on this here spot
suddenly they hear a clanking and screeching coming from the marsh
they ready their arms and get in defensive positions
what they cant see through the fog is
amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the center of the field
the contraption has a large cannon and gatling guns bristling from several ports
the rebs cheer their new weapon
the wild wild west rev
now a mortar appears through the turret and fires a rocket that explodes over the reb soldiers illuminating the field
as soldiers shield their eyes from the blinding light
unbeknownst to the rebs loveless has mowed and stained the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart board appearance
suddenly the tank turret opens fire on them
once over their initial shock the rebs fire back with their springfield rifles
but the bullets ping off the tanks impenetrable skin like goober peas
lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large binoculars on a stand
general mcgrath turns from the rail and faces loveless outraged
mcgrath why you sawed off sadistic bastard
youve betrayed us
loveless turns to him cocks his head
my dear general after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this
how did you and general lee repay my loyalty
you surrendered at appomattox
so who betrayed whom
loveless turns to munitia holding a steno pad
munitia make note
turret speed needs to be accelerated
to amazonia change gear ratio from
amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern semaphore
she begins flashing the new gear ratio
a bucket for the minister please
now in the b
we hear the gatlings open up
lippenreider is reading the lips of the tanks victims
mcgrath loveless i demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now
ignores him were going to need more loading drills
im hearing too much time between screams
as munitia scribbles dutifully mcgrath shoves her aside
he pulls his pistol
mcgrath for the last time give them the order to desist
loveless his back to him is seemingly unconcerned at having a gun barrel pressed against his skull
general i understand your distress
but believe me those men are not dying senselessly
it is for a far greater cause than you can imagine
as lovelesss right index finger finds a black button on the arm of his wheelchair
the steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually shotgun barrels facing fore and aft
mcgraths finger tightens on the trigger
mcgrath go straight to hell sir
wild wild west rev
mcgrath has a very startled expression as he looks down at the aftereffects of double ought buckshot
as he crumples to the deck loveless sniffs
bloodbath mcgrath indeed
the dignitarys dog starts barking jumps to the deck
it sits next to the fallen generals gramophone ear and cocks his head
with the rca logo invented we move back he sighs at his pale guests
they dont seem to appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter
well that concludes the festivities
ladies feed him to the crabs
munitia and amazonia unceremoniously dump mcgraths body overboard
loveless addresses the dignitaries
but my friends that tank is just a little ol toy compared to what this countrys greatest scientists are cooking up for me next
so if ive piqued your interest bring kilograms of your countrys gold to spider canyon four days from now
starts to roll off boat now if youll excuse me ive got a tank to catch
a black waits ominously on the tracks
its less a traditional train car than a riveted armored turreted fortress on wheels
also it currently lacks an engine
loveless over his shoulder to the foreign contingent
my destination is both the future
and the past
forget paul revere this will be the most revolutionary ride in the history of america
he looks dotingly at the tank which clatters up from the battlefield on its treads
then drives onto the tracks
wheels drop down out of the chassis the treads retract up and the tank backs into the rest of the train
its a neat modular fit
black death on rails
the foreigners watch with awe as
wheels up onto the tank train
he drops the expansiveness fixes them with a vipers eye
if you dont want to miss the ride have the last payment of kilograms of your countrys gold in my hands no later than friday
thats when i make our little proposal to president grant
one im ever so confident hes gonna accept
now a jaunty wave of his hat au revoir adios and ta ta
the dead men are all in the or ring
now a rider enters frame
west slowly dismounts transfixed by the slaughter on the pre fab battlefield
theres something hauntingly familiar about all this for him the mangled bodies the tread marks
but well find out about that later
west draws his weapon and begins walking through the victims
the pace of his search quickens when he isnt finding what hes looking for general mcgrath
have arrived in the one horse carriage
gordon is trying to recreate the crime scene
rita trails behind him his coat thrown over her shoulders trying not to gag as she passes the mangled corpses
it came up out of the lake
from the way these corpses are positioned laid down a degree pattern of cannon fire
then disappeared in moments
puts a foot on a body scratches his chin my god what kind of weapon is it
rita cant handle gordons clinical posturing
excuse me i think im going to be sick
as she walks quickly away west comes over a haunted look on his face
it just rolls on and on
makes a screeching sound like a wounded animal
got a cabin on top with a cannon
swivels round like an eagles head
you saw it
heard about it
thought it was crazy survivors stories
there arent any here
new liberty illinois the free slave town just over the border
just one week before the war ended in
i was in the th cavalry that discovered it
old men women children
they used them for target practice
the wild wild west rev
he looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it
gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain just shuts up
wests grim reverie is interrupted by moaning coming from the shoreline
they all follow the sound to find
general mcgrath washed up on the shore
west looks down at him
now rita still looking green around the gills rejoins the party
thats when i vowed to follow mcgrath to the end of the earth
as grey as four day old mullet mcgrath manages a smile for his relentless pursuer
mcgrath barely audible whats the matter west
thought youd be happy to find me
i was hoping to kill you myself
thats a nice way to talk to people
mcgrath youll have to live with it
as ive lived with the blame for new liberty
mcgrath fades out
west grabs him and shakes him
what do you mean
mcgrath opens eyes it was loveless
he operated the killing machine there
left it to others here
with the meaning of it all sinking in west grabs mcgrath by the collar and pulls him toward him
where is he
where did he go
the wild wild west rev
the general tries to speak
west puts his ear to the generals mouth
but before he can say it mcgrath closes his eyes for the last time
wests shoulders sag
then from behind
well i know that
west turns to her
ill tell you if you take me along
in no mood just tell me
the girls at the mansion
imitating a la lippenreider i vonder if my hair vill get frissy in ze desert
vhere is diss ooo tah anyvay
as west and gordon turn to one another in alarm
west and gordon climb up onto the wanderer and enter
west and gordon burst in surprising coleman whos got his feet up perusing the playboy of the day a mail order catalogue
full speed ahead
west snatches the catalogue out of his hands does a take at the pictures of chunky models in bloomers
as coleman quickly exits gordon looks out the window onto the platform
wistful i dont see why we couldnt have given her a ride back home to texas
it is on the way
on the way to utah where our president happens to be
maybe we oughta be worryin about that little coincidence
as the engine roars to life
rita gives a forlorn little wave as the train chugs away
we wouldnt have known where loveless was going if it wasnt for her
seems a bit ungracious
look all that would happen would be shed get in our way and id probably wind up gettin in the saddle with her
funny that you say that
because i thought she was more interested in me
rita disappears from view in a cloud of steam
west has every weapon on the train out for cleaning and loading
gordon is in the galley where he continues his conversation with west while preparing dinner
the wild wild west rev
from gallery you know ive been trying to place myself in lovelesss shoes
good luck on that one
weakly ha ha ha
you know i cant imagine what loveless a man without any reproductive organs could possibly want with rita
suddenly theres a whoosh and rita falls through the ceiling and plops in the chair just like west did earlier
he instinctively pulls his gun
puts it away as gordon muses about her anatomy
not realizing shes there not that rita doesnt have a figure that would inspire a botticelli
or a raphael
rita raises an eyebrow looks to the galley as gordon comes out with a platter of food
he still doesnt see her there
especially her breasts
did you notice the way one of them
cups his hands both of them actually
to say nothing of her buttocks
gordon turns and looks into the car
finally sees her
changes gears without missing a beat
and the group of foreign ministers at lovelesss party
what were they doing there
gordon gestures for west to join him at the pool table
rita immediately goes for the food
using pool balls heres france spain and britain
sotto voce how long has she been here
since the first breast
gordon turns to her exasperated with himself
i am so embarrassed
ill spare you
to rita make yourself a sandwich to take with you
youre getting off
rita hasnt even waited for anyones approval to start eating
west shakes his head at her chutzpa
i can help you
how could you possibly help us
well i heard you talking about why all those foreign guys were at lovelesss party
you want me to tell you
by all means
she uses the time to get another bite into her mouth
to gordon chewing this is fantastic
you can cut it with a fork
howd you cook it
someone appreciates him well in a daubiere
a clay pot
a french method which
west cuts off the chit chat
what about the foreign guys
they were mad about something you know
something about a real bad deal in louisiana on purpose
the louisiana purchase
and queen somebody somebody of france got swindled
queen isabella of spain
west rolls his eyes
gordon this is crazy
she doesnt know what shes talking about
west picks up the speaker horn and calls coleman
into speaker horn coleman stop the train
miss escobars getting off
over pipe who the hells miss escobar
grabs horn im a frightened starving half naked young woman who only wants to find her father
over pipe half naked
grabs it back coleman
stop the train
over pipe were not puttin anybody off
not out here in the middle of nowhere
west looks out the window
nothing but sagebrush and animal skulls out there
rita comes up close to jim fire in her big brown eyes
my fathers the only family ive got
what am i supposed to do
sit home and wait for news hes been killed
or go do something
what would you do jim
that gets the man of action where he lives
look i got nothing against you rita
its just that
whats going to happen when we catch up to loveless
with you on the train
she grabs wests hand
i know youd never let him take me back
ive seen you shoot
west kinda melts a little
this girl does have her charms
gordon a little jealous puffs his chest out
i assure you rita an attack by loveless would be an exercise in futility
stands for tour allow me to demonstrate how my design suggestions have made the wanderer impervious to attack
west draws his guns twirls them and reholsters
im the impervious part
completely armor plated
artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a metallic sound
then he smugly demonstrates that the light fixture is actually a gatling gun
an attacker would find the lighting inside extremely
finally he moves to the billiard table while rita nods and keeps eating
and if by some inconceivable fluke they did manage to gain entrance
rolls billiard ball into bumper an innocent billiard ball this way
picks it up presses the number but depress the number
a sleeping gas bomb
effective in under three seconds
gordon unclicks it triumphantly rolls it into a pocket
so rest assured rita
you are completely safe within these walls
west snorts at his obvious play for ritas attentions
i dont know about you maam but i know ill be sleeping a whole lot better tonight
yawns assuming loveless barges in here and feels like a game of pool
speaking of sleeping im pretty tired
artemus do you think i could borrow something to wear
west jumps in before gordon can answer
wild wild west rev
ive got somethin you might use
it aint stylish but its practical
west and gordon have bunked down on opposite couches both deep in thought
loveless kidnapped two chemists that means theres gonna be explosives
hes got a metallurgist so theres gonna be heavy armor
and hes got ritas father who according to you is the worlds foremost specialist in hydraulics
which means whatever it is
its gonna move
west sits up
so what is he building thats gonna make the president fall to his knees and surrender the country
a bedside heater
she needs a bedside heater
i mean it gets cold in there you know with the stained glass window right over the opens and rita emerges from the state room
such a pleasant girl
a real breath of fresh ass
wild wild west rev
you said ass
gordon and west react as colemans voice booms out of the pipe
over pipe we have loveless gentlemen
seven hundred yards and closing
as they scramble for boots weapons rita comes out of her room
whats going on
gordon ushers her to the back
stay back here take cover
meanwhile west pulls on his boot
when he stands on it a three inch stiletto snaps out of the toe
what the hell is this
i took the liberty of installing it while you were sleeping
west looks at him incredulously
leave my stuff alone
lovelesss tank train chugs into a mountain tunnel
the wanderer is just behind it
and goes into the tunnel seconds later
the wanderer blasts out of the tunnel
in the f
we might notice a metal post that extends up out of frame
coleman squints ahead
he sees the tracks up ahead are empty
am i missin somethin here
up on metal stilts
it lets the wanderer pass underneath it
then it lowers itself back down onto the tracks
the legs fold to the side and the tank train pursues its pursuers
loveless turns to his three distaff warriors
amazonia shall we disabuse our friends of the notion that ones problems are solved when we see the light at the end of the tunnel
as munitia swivels the cannon barrel
thru thru west and gordon are about to head forward when gordon glances out the back grabs west
the wild wild west rev
jim were the ones chasing loveless correct
as west shoots him a look then perhaps you could explain what theyre doing behind us
as west looks out the back too
a shell explodes just to the right of them
now another explosion to the left of them
the wanderer rocks precariously from wheel to wheel throwing a screaming rita back and forth between west and gordon
they couldnt fire the cannon at us from in front
any other questions
west jumps up on the pool table
would it put you out too much to throw me a rope and hit your little secret button
with a shrug gordon tosses west a rope and hits the same hidden button he had during their fight
west is gone as the pool table flips over
as rita covers her mouth in amazement
i taught him how it worked
west hanging upside down
he hand over hands himself back to the escape trolley
he slides his back on top of it then lowers it onto the track
little wheels fit on the inside of the track
once coupled west releases the cable and he shoots backwards gordon opens a panel in the floor and snaps up a winch with a large handle
he starts to crank it slowly letting out cable
out the back door we see west emerge from under the wanderer heading for lovelesss tank train
suddenly theres a ping
the teeth of the gears cant take the pressure and theyre flying off the winch
gordon realizing another invention of his needs some tweaking snaps out his pen and pad
as he scribbles a note rita considers the exotic pen holder
you know you could put a gun on that thing
gordon looks up at her disapprovingly
not you too
meanwhile on the tracks
off his wire tether he flies backwards at mph
it looks like his heads about to be smashed by lovelesss tank train
rita turns away buries her head in gordons shoulder just as
west slides under the train
he lies flat as the death machine roars over him
at the last second he lassos the rope around the rear axle
it slows him for a beat
hes gotten gordons trick rope
we see his silent scream artemus
he slides way behind the tank train then springs back
past the tank train
finally west slides back underneath and manages to grab hold of their caboose
he swings his legs up pulls himself around onto the step
the wild wild west rev
west makes his way forward to the smokestack
he tries to flip the flue closed steam scalding his hands
he doesnt see hudson come at him from behind
he wraps a garrote around wests neck pulls it tight practically crushing his larynx
munitia is bent over has her eye to the cannon sight
as she squints through the smoke at the wanderer up ahead loveless sitting behind her has his full attention focused on her tuchus
i have them square in my sights sire
distracted as do i munitia
as do i
looks up wry smile fire away
but its a little difficult with him stroking her buttocks
the cannon fires
gordon and rita are looking out the back when they see the latest missile headed their way
gordon pulls rita down at the last second as a huge steel arrow shoots through the door past their heads
and into the parlor wall
as metal barbs flick out locking the tip in and the steel chain its attached to draws tight
west and hudson roll around precariously
west claws desperately at the garrote
it looks grim for our hero until he knocks his boot heels together
his stiletto blade appears
summoning his last ounce of strength he mule kicks
sinking the blade into hudsons leg
west grabs him and shoves him head first into the smokestack
the big indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle
loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship before the compartment begins filling with smoke
choking clouds that send loveless et al into coughing fits
close the fire door
just in time amazonia swings it shut as the unvented boiler explodes sending a fireball ripping through the back of the train destroying it
gordon and rita are thrown across the car along with everything else inside as lovelesss trains sudden stop
jerks them with it
the screech of steel wheels scraping on iron rails is sickening
they clutch onto one another
as the wanderer skids to a stop
as they pick themselves up gordon looks to rita whos shaken up and scared
now footsteps coming up the stairs
i wont let loveless take me again
id rather be dead
recalling wests words thats not a good one to wish for
to defend herself rita grabs one of the sleeping gas pool balls rolling around on the ground
gordon leads her into the stateroom to lock her in but she grabs his hand
please artemus dont leave me alone
rita closes the door behind him and locks it
gordon and rita on the bed
gordon gestures to be still
the door handle jiggles
rita gets ready to arm the pool ball
hoarsely not sounding like him its me jim
its a trick i know loveless
click she pushes the number
gordon makes a grab for it
she drops it to the floor
standing in the doorway
he rubs a raw welt on his neck from the garrote smirks when he sees gordon on the bed with rita
but his smirk drops when he sees the pool ball roll between his feet spewing a purple cloud of sleeping gas
west gives gordon a wile e
coyote look croaks
too damn late is what it is
a sea of corn tassels waving in the wind
lovelesss destroyed train is in the b
the camera tilts down to find
lying on the ground with their backs to us
west props himself up looks over at gordon who has just regained consciousness
mimicking him an innocent billiard ball this way but depress the number and on impact
a sleeping gas bomb
west shakes his head disparagingly and stands
he feels the metal band around his neck and surveys the inch wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle
west is about to step over it
gordon grabs his leg
loveless is sitting in his wheelchair fifty yards from west and gordon
on lovelesss elbow sits miss lippenreider
she looks through binoculars and lip reads west and gordon
continue miss lippenreider
doing both voices in a monotone west
let go of my leg
listen to me
loveless collared us with the same metal device we found on morton
loveless turns to munitia who is loading two inch diameter metal discs into what looks like a cd changer clay pigeon thrower
i hope were not going to leave evidence behind like we did last time
nitro this time sire
as she arms the device and a red light comes on
through megaphone good morning gentlemen
i trust you slept well
west and gordon squint through the corn see loveless on their train
what have you done with rita
rita is it
rita is sleeping off the after effects in the stateroom
looks toward bedroom quite lovely isnt she
i might even become familiar with her myself
gordon takes a step
west stops him
and that would become one more reason why im going to kill you
west im sure a well endowed blackamoor like yourself must find it absolutely impossible
that a freak like me could fully enjoy the pleasure of a woman
but having witnessed my use of mechinology so far
wouldnt you think i could provide myself with something for the lower half of my body that was hard pumping and indefatigably steely
loveless looks o
and speaking of hard pumping
coleman full steam ahead
in the engine room
amazonia has a gun to his head
loveless takes his last shot at them from the back
what a marvelous train
you dont mind if i borrow it do you gentlemen
other than a lack of wheelchair access i find it a most comfortable way to pass the long miles from here to my laboratory in spider canyon
louder as they move off ill be seeing president grant soon at promontory point
what shall i tell him for you
im afraid it cant be that youre alive and well
and as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air
frustrated as the train pulls away from them
west tugs at the metal collar around his neck
gordon get out your little tool kit and get this damn thing off of me
gordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool kit
empty except for a note
gordon opens it and reads
gentlemen welcome to the loveless experimental camp for political dissidents
there are no guards
no barbed wire
as long as you stay within the designated perimeter you will stay alive
miss lippenreider is still eavesdropping for loveless through binos
how do you know its not just bullshit
step over the fence and find out
rita and i will put flowers on your grave every year
stands next to the little fence watching loveless escape
i dont have time for this
wait i have an auxiliary tool kit
gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it
but its too late
west has jumped over the fence
then he hops back inside it
he holds his hands out to gordon
west grabs gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him over the fence
now they hear a slight buzzing in the air and its not a bee
comes whipping over the corn straight for wests head
in a split second he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of the corn off and banks around for a new attack
now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start running like hell through the cornfield
is it too late to take it off of me now
the second disc machine light turns green and the second disc is launched
loveless is laughing his head off
certain of gordons and wests impending death he rolls his wheelchair inside
the wild wild west rev
is awakening from the effects of the billiard ball gas and tries to control her sense of dread and loathing
she smiles nervously at loveless whos being fawned over by his women
opening champagne bottle rita my dear not that im ungrateful to providence for bringing you back to me
rita jumps as the champagne cork pops
im just a wee bit curious as to how you managed to wind up with them
scrambling well they uh
sure that they could find you
and i thought if i stayed with them
theyd lead me back to
all my friends
munitia shoots a look at lippenreider
and not to give you a big head but
wrinkles her nose to loveless i kinda missed you
not buying it isnt that a coincidence
i miss me too
come running toward us
behind and above are two discs about to make a dive at them
the discs like giant razors are mowing off the tops of the corn stalks heading straight for their heads
west and gordon dive to the ground
the discs just missing them
west stands to run again
we see the back of his heads been buzzed
running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield
west sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them
head for that gully
west zigs out of the cornfield one way
gordon zags out the other
theyre both beat up and exhausted from running and flopping on the ground
breathlessly reaches the edge
and looks down
its no gully
its a canyon that drops feet down to a ribbon of brown water
and thats not the worst of it
west is on the other side of the precipice
theyre separated by about feet of air
they both see the discs closing in
when i give the signal
jump off the cliff into my arms
are you crazy
do you see whats down there
watching the discs approach five four three two
west holds out his arms
wild wild west rev
im not doing it
west takes a leap of faith
and finally so does gordon
meeting mid air
they drop out of frame just as
the two discs collide with a mighty explosion that is heard by
loveless raises his glass to rita makes a little kissing gesture
she looks like shed like to kill herself
are still in mid air both looking down
i just remembered
i cant swim
you wont have to
they drop out of frame and we hear a loud thuk thuk
stuck up to their necks in red riverbed mud
as they slowly begin to extricate themselves
maybe i should have stayed inside that fence another moment or two
wild wild west rev
west and gordon caked in mud are coming up a ridge below which is a stream
all right gordon whats your plan
how are you gonna get this damn thing off my neck
gordon turns to west simmering controlling himself
isnt that why youre here
cause youre the master of you know mechanical stuff
oh i see
now im the master of
as opposed to five minutes ago when i was trying to collect my thoughts and figure out a way to get us out of these contraptions
gordon starts moving towards west who is forced to back up looking a tad nervous for the first time in the movie
that wouldnt have been any fun for a certain somebody and i wont mention any names jim west
who decided to take me on a bracing romp through a cornfield and play a fanciful game of hide and seek with serrated spinning death discs while our only mode
of transportation is in the hands of a sadistic madman with weapons of mass destruction who kidnapped rita and is on his way to kill our president and take over the country
hey calm down gordon
wild wild west rev
hes completely lost it no
because im the master of mechanical stuff
and i have to help you
because youre the master of stupid stuff
you want to get that collar off
lets do it the fun jim west way
picks up a rock lets bash it with a rock
gordon you dont want to do that
crazy oh but i do
gordon grabs a rock and smashes wests collar
wests collar emits a low hum
suddenly west is thrown into gordon their collars locking
suddenly calm thats odd
what did you do
i didnt do shit
no you mustve reversed the polarity of the magnets
i did not do shit
hes had enough thats it west lifts his leg to gordons collar to push him away but then clang
the stiletto in his shoe dislodges and instantly sticks to gordons magnetic collar
wild wild west rev
for a mega millisecond west his foot stuck to his partners neck is stunned
but before he knows what even happened west flips upside down onto his shoulders
are you all right
oh im peachey
now help me get my boot off
first gordon trying to get some leverage puts his foot in wests crotch and pulls the boot
gordon struggles to free the writhing west from the boot attached to gordons collar
finally wests foot comes free
but when he sits up thwap
his collar is sucked into gordons belt buckle
west is face to face with his partners crotch
do me a favor
when youre telling this story to your grandkids leave this part out
west starts unbuttoning gordons belt
now when i undo your belt im going to run as fast as i can that way and you run as fast as you can the other way
youre going to run as fast as you can one way and im going to run as fast as i can the other
undos belt three
wild wild west rev
the men run in opposite directions
gordons belt on wests collar wests boot on gordons
they get about thirty forty yards
then theyre yanked backwards into each other
they fall in the water back to back
every time one rolls up and catches his breath the other is under water
rolling face up get off me you steaming pile of rolling face up im trying you son of a gurgle
rolling face upgurgle you
rolling face upgurgle yourself
finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land
they sit up out of breath stuck together back to back
i do not want to spend the rest of my life looking like a meatball on a plate
were going to have to discuss bathroom etiquette soon
bobbing in the stream
gordon grabs it out of the water
my auxiliary tool kit
i forgot all about it
it mustve slipped out of my pocket
why wasnt it attached to some spring loaded something or other that shoots out of your ass
wild wild west rev
because that my friend would be uncomfortable
gordon lips parched clothes tattered peers impatiently over the metal collar as west works on it with some lock picks
wests collar is already off
wild wild west rev
why didnt you tell me you had an auxiliary tool kit
i did tell you but in your zeal to run and leap off a two hundred foot cliff i dont think you heard me
west eats the grilled gila monster voraciously
and enjoys it more
he notices gordon watching him
gordon looks to the heavens and recites
take physic pomp expose thyself to feel what wretches feel that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just
gordons quote has gone on
he notices west watching him
you know gordon you can be quite annoying flaunting that fancy education
well truth be told i never had a fancy education not a formal one anyway
looks at gordons ring the harvard thing seems pretty formal to me
this ring isnt real
do you want it
wild wild west rev
takes ring off and tosses it into fire a prop
im an actor
i gave it up
i went by the name of arthur gordon
ever hear of me
how did you wind up in this line of work
the pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of our american cousin a light comedy at fords theater in washington
there was this one line i had
always got the biggest laugh in the show
one night it drowned out the gunshot that killed president lincoln
beat i decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again
walks slowly across wests outstretched hand
theres a spider on your hand
doesnt that bother you
she doesnt want any trouble
shes just trying to get warm
he puts the spider down into the sand
how come you know so much about the desert anyway
the indians taught me
i lived out here when i was a boy
gordon starts to ask west something but west doesnt want him to pry further
wild wild west rev
hey watch he points toward a small black wasp flying from above
the desert wasp
one of the worlds great hunters
shell kill the tarantula and lay her eggs on it so her babies can have something to eat
now im really hungry
beat how did your parents who i assume were negroes feel about you being raised by indians
they didnt have much to say about it
i was sent to another plantation when i was little
ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me
west can see the effect his story has had on gordon
did you ever see your family again
the wild wild west rev
stands kicks out fire they were at the camp at new liberty
now they both stare into the fire
finally gordon speaks
ill help you get him jim
west and gordon trudge through an endless sand dune side by side chests out jaws set
theyre partners goddammit
you have no idea where youre going do you
i know exactly where im goin spider canyon
gordon stops to catch his breath
stops looks back but im never gonna get there with you draggin that damn thing around
now we see gordons got the heavy metal collar in his hand
west grabs him and they start to walk away gordon listing noticeably
while a magneto of this power may not inspire your scientific curiosity it does mine
besides you never know when it might come in handy
gordon suddenly disappears out of frame
west stops to see whats happened to his partner now
the wild wild west rev
hes on his back arm holding the metal doughnut straight out over his head being dragged across the desert floor by some unseen force
gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for feet finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang
west deadpans this bit of insanity walks over and with the toe of his boot uncovers the explanation iron railroad tracks covered by drifting sand
when youre right youre right
well i think our partnership is taking a big step forward
you finally admitted i was right about something
west helps him up
then as or two heroes follow the tracks into the distance
towards spider canyon
how about admitting you were lost
dont push it
west and gordon trudge past the wanderer
its parked at the end of the line looks deserted
jim i know ive hallucinated it several times before so is that really the wanderer
thats the wanderer
gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not another mirage
they continue on to the rim of the canyon peer over the edge
reacting to what they see
and would it be too much to hope that im simply seeing a worlds fair down there
the wild wild west rev
yeah it would
thats loveless lair
a natural bowl that appears to have been made by a meteor is gouged out of the desert floor
in the bowl are several spectacular victorian style buildings made almost entirely of glass plus a huge silo
ant sized figures are moving around
now they hear a strange sound
to modern ears a whine as from a jet engine
loveless appears in the f
hes rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator
up up up he goes
as now more of the contraption comes into view
alloy girders multi levels control boards
all open in an eiffel tower like effect
west and gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a giant metal tarantula steps over the rim in full terrifying glory
eight legs five stories high
the thorax of the giant spider bristles with gatling guns and all manner of weaponry
as the shadow of the monster passes over their faces
now thats impressive
nice to see an invention that actually works
loveless is sitting in a captains seat feet in the air
hes surrounded by his adoring crew amazonia munitia and lippenreider
he spreads his arms wide world at his feet
they watch the tarantula head toward a narrow opening between two red rock outcroppings
dismissive well see about that
the fool doesnt even realize hes trapped
a volley of cannon fire explodes the impediment to dust
the tarantula marches on
west is dressing for battle
he straps his six guns on his hips flips the pool table over grabs a coach gun tucks that behind his chaps
he belts on his shotgun shell bandolero
an extra six gun gets tucked in the belt
another in his boot
pocketfuls of shells
the mans ready for war
gordon lets ride
pause you do know how to ride
he sticks his head through the door to
gordons nitro cycle is out
gordon fusses with it and some canvas
a horse i mean
i know how to ride a horse
when the situation calls for something primitive
how about now
theres a big spider stompin towards our president
but gordon wont be hurried
he has a big book out studies it then looks back to his nitro cycle
i was just thinking about another spider
remember in the desert when that little wasp killed the tarantula
west rolls his eyes impatiently
well the wasp had a small advantage
it could fly
gordon excitedly shows the book to west
pictured is an archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft
west looks at it in disbelief as gordon prattles on manically
in leonardo da vinci invented a flying machine called the ornithopter
though he never actually flew it
wests heard enough
he grabs gordon shakes him
theres no time for plans or half cocked inventions
they dont work
we gotta stick to what were each good at
as west drags gordon to the wardrobe
two riders galloping toward camera
as they thunder past we see west is in the lead jaw set
and right behind him comes
its artemus in disguise of course
and he actually can ride a horse
the wild wild west rev
being held in the stubby fingers of ulysses s
hes reading an inscription on it
may god continue the unity of our country
camera pulls back to reveal a crowd present to watch president grant knock in the famous spike
behind him two train engines are facing each other
the detectives scan the crowd for possible trouble
as this railroad unites the two great oceans of this world
now he swings back the sledgehammer
but at the top of his swing
starts to shake wiggle and actually pop out of its hole
as it begins to hop on the ground bounced by a resounding thumping
look across the desert to see
the tarantula in full view
people start screaming in terror as it appears over a ridge huge even at this distance
the metal beast closes the yard distance in seconds
the citizens flee
the detectives are not far behind them
the soldiers take cover and ready their weapons
grant stands his ground
even as a huge foot clomps down in front of him vibrating the camera
loveless talks into a microphone which booms his voice out through amplified speakers
well isnt this a coincidence
im out for a little mornin ride and right in the middle of nowhere i bump into general ulysses s
leans over edge mocking salute weve never been properly introduced
arliss loveless formerly with the confederate army
cool and collected grant lights a cigar
loveless what can i do for you today
to his military aides flank him left and right
i have a humble abode nearby and i hope youll accept my hospitality
i have a little proposition to make
what proposition is that
the unconditional and immediate surrender of the united states of america to the loveless alliance
i didnt realize we were at war
loveless gives the nod to munitia
the cannon blows the presidents train to smithereens
how about now
the crowd whod taken refuge behind it runs away in panic
all but one of them
a second president grant artemus gordon
he calmly lights a cigar on the flaming train strides up to the other grant and shouts up at loveless
in matters of war the person to talk to would be me
if theres anyone more surprised than the president himself its
loveless squinting down at the two grants
this new wrinkle has also attracted the attention of the love lettes and everyone else aboard
now just who are you
turns to president snorts hes just an actor hired to stand in for me on public occasions
a very bad actor i must say
a little puffy and overweight
as the president eyes him puffs on his cigar gordon grant apes his every move bigger mockingly
aside gordon youve got a lot of brass
you know him sir
gordon grant shifts his eyes toward
west running undetected to the rear leg
as the lone cowboy starts to climb up toward the belly of the beast
gordon grant turns to an army officer standing behind
loudly captain get this man out of my sight
and next time get me a real actor
as the bewildered captain starts to lead the president away
loveless has had enough
take them both
munitia manning a sort of cannon takes a bead on the two grants
she pulls the trigger
and a sticky white silk shoots out covering both grants with spider web material
was this part of your plan
im by your side sir
thats whats important
now munitia hits a lever and theyre hoisted up off the ground
they only get a couple of feet when
west shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop
all eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting
west has almost reached the lowest deck
now all the firepower of the tarantula is trained on him
amazonias on the gatling gun
munitia and several other goons on lower decks open up on west too
west takes cover behind the steel girders six guns blazing
all his guns blazing
but wests bullets as well as the union soldiers covering fire ping harmlessly against the tarantulas grows impatient with the gun battle
he pulls a lever
down below nozzles on the tarantulas legs suddenly erupt in clouds of skin scalding steam
west screams in pain and falls
to the ground his head hitting a rock
as the two grants witness it through the sticky spider ball
loveless wearing a black tunic festooned with medals and a prussian style helmet with a horse hair plume raises his arms nixon like as a band plays a flourish
bonjour buenas tardes and good day
great glorious day
a day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all
framed by a large flag featuring the spider emblem he looks out from center stage of a greek theater at the crowd of foreign dignitaries seated around him
oh how long have we waited
dressed in tight fascist brown tankwear rise from their seats and applaud
the only people not applauding are a row of haggard bearded scientists and the manacled prisoners gordon sans disguise rita grant and coleman
looks to englishman wasnt it old bean
most expensive cup o tea in history
as the englishman dignitary nods soberly
wests body hasnt moved
the only change is that now a line of ants crawls across his face
we watch hoping for a twitch something
but there is none
the ants march over lifeless eyes swarm onto the bloody cut on his head
if were not convinced hes dead
circles lower finally landing right by wests head
as the hideous carrion eater leans over wests face
a shadow falls across them
but instead of the pecking red beak a human hand appears in the frame
brushes the ants away
we hear an indian incantation over
wests eyelids flutter open
standing over him
blurry back lit by the sun the face of wests indian friend
the healer who can turn himself into a bird
as west sits up groggily feels his head
hey its okay
as he makes a mental note to always be kind to animals
loveless continues his speech to the foreign contingent
looks to hudson the indian manhattan for a handful of beads
raises his hand injun style how
to the mexicans remember the alamo indeed
humbly to crowd today im proud to be able to sit before you and tell you the wrongs will be righted
the past made present
the united divided
to thunderous applause
loveless signals for the flag to be pulled down revealing
there have been some significant internal changes which loveless now describes
the delegation from each country stands when they hear their name
great britain gets back the thirteen original colonies
off applause florida and the fountain of youth go back to spain
off applause texas new mexico california arizona revolve a mexico
off applause and the louisiana purchase reverts back to the king of france
in the front row rita leans over to gordon
queen of spain
king of france
i was close
jostles her shut up and listen to a real genius
finally loveless taps colorado kansas utah and nevada now labelled as loveless land
and a tiny piece for me to retire on
theres appreciative laughter
stumbles in and looks around discouraged
the place has been ransacked
the gun cabinets are empty the gatling lamp removed
all thats left is gordons nitro cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses
west tries every secret hiding place
finally he finds gordons belt buckle derringer
he opens the breech
only one dinky bullet
he throws down the belt in disgust
sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage
loveless unrolls a document signs his half of it
my partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible
personally i like the symmetry of it
after all wasnt it you who made us sign a surrender at appomattox
loveless snaps his fingers
amazonia drags grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands
never will i sign that paper never will the united states ever surrender
well sir were at loggerheads then arent we
and i suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record would mean nothing
grant sets his jaw intractably
hes right about that
so if you still refuse to sign this surrender
well start by shooting your man gordon
loveless whirls nods to amazonia who drags the president back to his seat pulls gordon out of his
rita cant help her outburst
artemus smiles at her extremely brave under the circumstances
he whispers to rita and the president
tugs at his vest dont worry im wearing the impermeable
rita turns to grant
what the hell is that
gordon has no time to explain as amazonia hauls him up on the stage
as munitia aims her rifle
gordon holds up a finger
if i may have one request
its that she aim at my heart
which has loved this great country so much
considers for a moment shoot him in the head
munitia cocks her rifle then just as loveless holds his hands up for the signal to fire
the lights dim
a candle powered spotlight swings across the stage and illuminates
a deep throated bluesy black chanteuse who starts singing the popular cathouse song hangtown gals
hangtown gals are plump and rosy
loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and forgets gordons execution instantly
and why not
shes young and beautiful in a rupaul sort of way
about six feet tall wearing the blue sequined number gordon had in his dressing room
accessorized with black mesh stockings big feather boa silver buckled belt lots of frilly petticoats for those can can moves
singing hair in ringlets mighty cozy
she winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out her derriere to the crowd
they stare mouths agape at this piece of ass worthy of othello
well maybe more than intrigued
a new girl
what a nice surprise
he motions to hold up gordons execution rolls to her
painted cheeks and frilly corsets
bends over showing her undergarment touch them
loveless hears this as an invitation reaches out with his hand and whap
she slaps him right in the face
and theyll sting like hornets
theres a hush in the crowd
loveless a red handprint on his face is a little nonplussed
amazonia moves in threateningly but loveless stops her starts to laugh
making her name up on the spot ebonia
why are you so cruel to me
ebonia has escaped a head cutting neck bracelet
but she probably shouldnt be teasing a man whos having ghost aches in certain amputated places
waiting to be executed
somethings not quite kosher about her for gordon
musing to himself i have a dress like that
now with the crowd singing along she pulls out all the stops
her gestures and dance moves become more exaggerated shes in the thrall of her audience
singing hangtown gals are lovely creatures think theyll marry mormon preachers
she sashays over to the french dignitary pulls his monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it steaming it up
as she pops it back on his face
singing heads thrown back to show their features
now she puts her cheek next to rita as if matching their relative beauty while picking the pocket of lippenreider
rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before ebonia hands coleman the keys to the cuffs
coleman looks from the keys to ebonia
he just caught on
go ebonia go
then ebonia prances on stage to gordon cuddles up to him
gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with a mixture of amusement and relief
of course its his id rather be dead partner jim west
not to sound ungrateful but youre a little over the top
west ebonia wraps the feather boa around gordons neck hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand
gordon looks worried
whats he going to do with a gun
as he tucks it up his sleeve
let me warn you about that dress
belts it out ha ha ha
an immediate standing ovation
the diversion allows coleman to unlock both grants and ritas shackles
grant looks at the keys
whered those come from
nods to ebonia captain west
their eyes practically pop out of their heads
one more time
the wild wild west rev
singing ha ha ha
suddenly the tassels on his bosoms are spinning to the delight of the crowd
suddenly blinks wait a minute
what the hell is this
he stops but his tassels are still spinning on their own
immediately two flame throwers explode from his cone like bosoms
maybe he shouldve listened about the dress
he turns to gordon questioningly and inadvertently incinerates one of lovelesss goons
he howls in pain runs panicked
right into rita
serves you right for staring at them
as she relieves the charred goon of his keys
loveless turns to the rest of his goons
off their confused looks points him
finally getting it they rush ebonia
even his th of july breasts arent a match for them
desperate west reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of gordons billiard balls
he depresses the number and rolls it at the guards
was that the eight ball
gordon grabs west and rita pulls them behind the bar
the wild wild west rev
that ones an incendiary bomb
an explosion rips the place and a santa ana sized fire starts immediately
rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a bearded scientist
she unlocks his neck collar turns to them and smiles
disappearing into the chaos meet me after the show
both west and gordon look after her with yearning as three goons charge them
coleman amazed at their torpor quickly grabs a rifle from the incinerated goon and opens fire
three goons drop
gordon and west exchange looks
not bad for an emphysemic old engineer
president thought you needed some lookin after
speaking of the president
hes grabbed a dead goons rifle and is laying down a pretty good field of fire himself
suddenly he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind
whap she sends a right to his chin knocking him out
she throws him over her shoulder and carries him away
as fire engulfs the place loveless has no choice but to retreat
surrounded by a cadre of his women who carry the unconscious president grant loveless heads through a round steel vault door
as amazonia swings the door closed the foreign dignitaries bang on the door begging for admittance
monsieur we are your partners
you cant let us die in this fire
its not the first time yall have been burned in america
he chuckles nods to amazonia who slams the door closed
emerge from the smoking lair coughing and gasping for breath
they watch helplessly as
clambers out of the bowl with grant captive on the bridge
this is diabolical
theyve got the president and ive still got that silly song in my head
freaking out cmon we gotta go
we gotta ride horse
west is watching the tarantula turns to calm him
right now we need a plan
gordon tries to compose himself
that flyin machine idea of yours
were you just acting like you knew what you were talking about
or could you build it
panning an expanse of canvas comprising a foot wing span
in the b
we hear gordon scribbling
now bernoullis principle states that the air flowing over a birds wings
is moving at a lower pressure than the pressure below the wing
thats called lift
course its just a theory
its never been tested
it depicts a wing cutting through the air
arrows indicating airflow
circular lines indicating life
only one problem its upside down
gordon remedies that
looks sheepishly to west who like him is wearing a leather flight jacket and goggles
youre not makin me feel any better
now they attach the wing to the frame which is connected to the nitro cycle
coleman his ever present cigarette dangling from his mouth readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and gordons design
they look like flash gordons spaceship
he passes them out
heres a coupla bon voyage presents
must you smoke when handling explosives
gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of the nitro cycle
west looks at coleman apologetically as he stuffs the bombs into his jacket
hes just a little nervous cause no ones ever flown before
west is barely on the back when gordon kicks it over and they blast out of frame
builds ground speed
gordon is nervous at the wheel
west gives him an encouraging pat
but their speed is not enough to get them airborne
were not getting enough lift
we need more speed
then in an uncharacteristic move by gordon he turns the machine around and heads for the cliff
thats the cliff over there you know
he guns the accelerator
yes i do know
and with that the nitro cycle goes off the cliff
it disappears for the count of five
then suddenly it swoops up and past camera
amazed it worked
looking down if you had to get one right im real glad it was this one
exhilarated with west like abandon yeee haaa
and with that they bank the desert wasp around and fly off to save the republic
is entering the town
loveless turns to grant his face beaten and bruised
president ill ask you once again
sign the surrender or i decimate this town
youve had my answer
lovelesss face darkens as amazonia hands him a tray of cotton balls
as he puts in earplugs i find the sound of people screaming while they get blown to smithereens ruins the ear for music
he offers them to the president
grant swats them away
and with that the tarantula opens fire on the town
theres a lot of stomping and smashing too
high above the tarantula
gordon lost in the joy of flight turns to west who is more of a white knuckler
i think ill call it
an elevation enhancer
why would you call it that
now west points to the tarantula and chaos below
go down down there
as if to a child you cant just go down there
flight depends on lift which must be calibrated to the angle of descent
shut up and go down there will ya
west reaches up shoves the make shift joystick forward
as the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the tarantula and gordon strains to keep control
loveless and grant are oblivious to our heroes above
he unlocks one of grants handcuffs presents him with a pen
have you had enough yet
would you like to sign the surrender or shall we set a course for denver
suddenly theres a loud whooosh and
west and gordon swooping down low
west unfastens bombs from his vest waits for the right moment
as they swing past the tarantula cannon he drops them
the big gun falls limp
the dumbfounded tarantula crew which has been whittled down to miss lippenreider amazonia and munitia
they never counted on having to shoot something in the air and cant raise their weapons any higher than degrees
west and gordon banking around for another sortie
loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos shocked
warning horns are going off
well ill be damned
its west and gordon
grant chuckles at the dauntless pairs pluck
keep that surrender handy
i think youre going to need it
dont be too sure
loveless thinks for a moment pushes grant out of the way and rolls over to the controls
he pushes a lever and the tarantula bends down on its knees
he barks to munitia
im through with diplomacy
take him away and kill him
on its front knees
now its rear end is tilted up in the air giving amazonia at the gatling gun a shot at
the bullets perforate the deserts wasps wings and blast through its struts
theyre going down
what does your boy da vinci say about puttin this bird down
i dont think he thought it would ever work so he didnt get that far
im open to suggestions
take out as many bad guys out as you can
gordon aims wasp at the tarantula kamikaze like just as
munitia cocks back the hammer of her pistol and aims it at the president
the wasp crashes into her
the shot goes off wildly and munitia falls off the deck to her death
as grant and the wasp hang over the edge
loveless at the controls
west and gordon bruised but alive climb off the wasp and onto the lower deck
they pick up the president and dust him off
sorry about that sir
nose up flaps down
have to remember that next time
son never apologize for saving a presidents life
as gordon realizes that hes finally made amends for that night long ago in fords theater
soon you all can fly again
this time with little angel wings
west gordon and grant turn to see amazonia and lippenreider with the drop on them
wild wild west rev
west gordon and grant are now under lovelesss control
gentlemen i am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity
why not swear an oath of loyalty to me
and forego your executions
well i guess maybe id rather see what happens when i stuff your ass into that cannon up there and fertilize the landscape
uh jim i think a polite no would suffice
loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens up beneath west
he goes crashing down a story
loveless sics amazonia on gordon and grant and proceeds down the ramp to the level below
lippenreider take over the controls
looks down at west we may not have a woodshed on board but that boy is gonna get a whoopin anyway
west plunges down into the metal chamber
oiled pistons thrusting
struggles to his feet
there out of the shadows steps
hes a mess
no hands just brass collars where they used to be
they lock eyes
so i guess youre the one whos gonna give me my whoopin
they square off
then a long steely blade shoots out from where his left hand used to be
wild wild west rev
i got one a those
west reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in his boot
knife guy responds by producing another blade from his other cuff
but youve got two of those
beat okay lemme talk to gordon ill see if he can
no time for talk
knife guy does a bad ass series of moves
the blades criss crossing one another at blinding speed
west unimpressed retorts with a lame shake of his stiletto and boot
and the fight begins
knife guy attacks
west narrowly escapes each thrust of the knife and attempts a kick to the groin
but comes up short the stiletto collides with one of the blades and snaps like a carrot
his only weapon
west rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack
sparks fly as the knife guy tries to slice and dice west but misses each time hitting the metal railing instead
west rolls to the floor sucking air
knife guy lands a kick to wests ribs
and to make matters worse
just showed up
he swings his wrench at wests head
west ducks but gets kicked in the back
he sails across the room lands flat on his back
makes an appearance
he hammers his shovel at wests groin over and over
west is in a crab position and backs up to avoid this
west finally gets a kick in it does a moderate amount of damage
wrench guy appears and swings his huge wrench at wests head
west escapes it barely
knife guy thrusts a side kick at wests chest but west catches his foot holds on for dear life
wild wild west rev
wrench guy is inbound with wrench in hand
he swings on west but west blocks it with knife guys leg
west punches both of them
wrench guy tumbles out of west stands
looking for a way out but
shovel guy attacks
west ducks and the shovel connects squarely with knife guys blades
west crouches and throws two simultaneous punches each connecting with a set of jewels
west stands follows it up with a right cross and left hook and these two jokers wind up out of frame
the wrench guy is on his feet and hes pissed
he attacks west lands a solid kick to the chest and west flies backward toward a
which he grabs
he scales the gears gets a solid grip then swings a huge arc across the room gaining momentum and kicks shovel guy and wrench guy at the same time
off their feet they go slamming onto the metal floor
knife guy attacks
west uses the chain to block the blades which are flying at him left and right
west manages to wrap the chain around one of the knives locks it down and heaves it into the gears
the blade snaps
no more mister knife guy
west drops a stiff right cross on the chin of the knife guy
wobbles his legs a bit
but before west can follow up
to replace the broken one
it stops about a half an inch from wests nose
a struggle ensues but west manages to wrap the chain around knife guys neck and string him up
west throws a kick to his back
knife guy hanging by his neck flies through the belly
the chain is on a track
and out of the mouth of the beast down into the abyss chain and all
shovel guy springs to his feet and swings on west
west grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession
wild wild west rev
wrench guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the action
but west uses the shovel to deflect the swing ing wrench
west gains sole possession of the shovel and mule kicks shovel guy out of frame
west spins just in time to land a crippling blow to wrench guys back
shovel guy grabs the shovel
he and west tug o war again
west ducks under the shovel and moves back to front with him
west elbows him in the ribs
he responds by putting west in a choke hold
west swings the shovel wildly but hits his target shovel guys head
west steps back gets his footing and for good measure whacks him in the back
wrench guy attacks
west defends himself with the shovel and lands a stiff kick to his stomach
wrench guy goes down
west turns hits shovel guy in the chest with the shovel and he goes down
wrench guy sneaks up on west from behind and swings at his head
west on instinct lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second
west has now found his rhythm
he swings and shovel and connects with
first the foot then the chin and last but not least the head boink
west drops the shovel and world wrestling federation style picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears
we wont see him anymore
west pivots and whack
shovel guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on wests jaw
west backs up and catches another in the stomach
shovel guy really shows what hes made of
he does a series of jump kicks round houses and fan kicks into the air
all perfectly timed all deadly
i learned that from a chinaman
west without missing a beat steps on the shovel which flips into his hand and whack
lands a clean one right on the top of shovel guys melon
i just made that up
wild wild west rev
shovel guy reels back and tumbles over the railing through the hole and hes gone
dont forget your shovel
west casts the shovel out into the abyss
upward is that all you got for me loveless
west exhausted turns and sees
all seven feet of him
the top of his head is a metal plate
extending downward encircling his eyes
west soaks him in sighs
uh i just threw my shovel out
so this really isnt fair
if you dont mind id like to
west at lightning speed throws a sucker punch spin ning back fist to metal heads jaw
that one really hurt
wests hand that is
metal head isnt fazed a bit
west throws another shot this time to the gut
then a kick to the groin
metal head has had enough
he effortlessly picks west up by his lapels and flings him across the room
west tumbles and lands right next to
he picks it up and starts swinging
a shot to the body ping
metal head lurches forward absorbing each blow with not so much as a twitch of the eye
he goes for the head
west is out of time
hes been backed up as far as he can go
his heels are dangling over the mouth of the beast a thousand feet above the rocky cliff
wild wild west rev
metal head grunts grimaces and pitches forward toward west slowly but menacingly
west braces himself
west side steps and metal head falls face first into the open air
downward you guys just dont get out enough
west slowly gets up
loveless is about to roll over him
he jumps up in the air grabs onto an overhead strut reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels
a smile comes to wests face as he watches lovelesss frustrated attempts at going forward and backward
when you get right down to it loveless you just cant beat a good pair of legs
thin smile youre obviously not a poker player mr
loveless presses a button the sound of mechanical gears engaging
suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath the wheelchair raising his body to a height of six foot ten
two pair always beats a pair
west stares up at him slack jawed
loveless rolls up his sleeves steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight
was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action
west responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that makes loveless spin around on the platform of his chair
wild wild west rev
well that hit a nerve
loveless imitates west by kicking with a lightning flash of an alloy leg
its a rib cracker that sends west sprawling
a mother perhaps
hes just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch
as west screams in pain
gordon tries to come to wests aid but amazonia points a gun barrel at his temple
gordon can only watch helplessly as
loveless begins a metallic flamenco hands on his hips his piston like legs kicking wests body and head
it feels so good to stretch my legs
west cant take much more of this hes about to pass out
loveless lowers his alloy foot over wests head and begins to crush it like a grape
i likes to beat my feet on the mississippi mud
gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries to hold off the metal foot
but hes slowly losing
gordon turns to his female captors throws his arms out beseechingly
when he does the derringer comes snapping out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his pen
stop this violence
gordon blinks at the gun
so do lippenreider and amazonia
grant knows what to say if gordon doesnt
they obey chucking their guns overboard
wests eyes are popping out of his head the mechanical pressure of lovelesss leg
stop or ill shoot
if possible wests eyes pop even further
looks up to see gordon holding the derringer on him from up above
you expect to kill me with that little pea shooter
if i have to
wild wild west rev
why is it that im unafraid
chuckles i believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and im stuck in the middle
on one end we have mr
west a man of primitive vigours uncomplicated by intellect
and on the other theres mr
a man of ideas but unlike myself lacks the passion to kill for them
hed like to be able to act his way out of it
and for some reason when hes actin someone always seems to get killed
loveless puts more pressure on wests head he groans
gasps shoot him gordon
im right about you arent i gordon
and thats why im gonna kill your friend here
then im going to kill you
the shot startles loveless west and even gordon
but when loveless realizes that hes not hit he laughs
after all that you missed
he gestures down lovelesss legs to a punctured metal tube thats spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over the deck rendering the foot on wests head powerless
west gets out from under rubs his neck to regain circulation
better than a fountain pen dont you think
nods behind gordon by the way your chivalrys about to be tested
gordon turns to see
the wild wild west rev
they smash into him driving him to the rail
as they pummel him trying to throw him over gordon realizes this is no time for passivity
he retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would make west proud
over the rail goes lippenreider
in that split second before she drops gordon mouths bye bye
before he can savor the moment further amazonia clubs him from behind
gordon whirls and hits her so hard it surprises them both
over the railing she goes
as amazonia hovers there president grant gives her the kick in the pants she needs to go sailing
to gordon impressed well be joining them in a moment if you cant stop that thing
gordon turns to see grant gesturing at the horizon
his eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling comes to a sudden halt at a foot cliff
lets see how clever you really are
gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that
west approaches loveless
theres going to be some payback
for almost four long years ive been trackin the animal responsible for the massacre at new liberty
and i hear thats you
but with the hydraulic fluid the fight has gone out of loveless
his mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes and loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the wicked witch
wild wild west rev
whimpering pathetically he uncouples his body from the useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair thats stuck against the railing
show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple
imitating his accent now now doctor
lets not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor ol me cripple talk
just buck up and say to yourself i am indefatigably hard pumpin and steely
loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it
after i kill ya i swear im gonna boil you down to axle grease
now thats the ol doctor i know
but the smile fades from wests face when he sees lovelesss shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist
west has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the i beam over his head just as loveless pulls the triggers on both barrels
the shots almost blow the heels off wests boots
they puncture a pipe behind him
steam spews out
this is going to have an effect on something
gordon and grant are trying different combinations to stop the thing
finally gordon throws up his hands
he doesnt know what else to try when suddenly the tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack and tilts forward
the tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter totters on the brink
wild wild west rev
the sudden stopping jerks loveless wheelchair free
despite his frantic efforts hes rolling toward the opposite railing
when the wheelchair hits a pool of hydraulic fluid on the deck it spins him around degrees
west jumps up grabs a girder
the wheelchair spins under wests legs and then clank it slams into the railing and wedges there
the impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward inches away from toppling over
the jolt shoots west off the girder
he free falls through the belly and out into the open air
thinking quickly he grabs onto the back of loveless wheel chair
his arms nearly torn from their sockets
his weight causes the wheelchair to shift now leaving it hanging on by a thread
west reaches out grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there
well ill be a monkeys uncle
how did we arrive in this dark situation
i dont know
guess im stumped
and im so cotton pickin afraid of heights
they just give me the spooks
ah dont be afraid loveless
with this being the last leg of our journey and all you should soak in the view youre really missing something
mister west im gonna cut this conversation short
good one loveless
i didnt think of that one
wild wild west rev
furious mister west
i am faced with a difficult decision here
on one hand there is the overwhelming love that i have for myself and on the other the raw seething hatred i have for you
now i could kill you very easily just by pulling this lever
he moves the joystick
the chair jerks back
but of course i would die along with you
i guess the only thing that i can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and i could enjoy immeasurable bliss
before i vanish
moving joystick back and forth what to do what to do
west grabs the joystick
allow me to make that decision easy on you loveless
because i want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than i want to live
why is it that i have a sneaking suspicion that although you are as black as the night on the outside
inside you are yellow
they lock eyes
you dont have it in you do you
you were right
lets cut this conversation short
west yanks the joystick back
wild wild west rev
his eyes widen
the wheels spin for a second finally catch and in a flash loveless and west free fall into space
a beat then
which is dangling from the belly of the beast
at the bottom of the chain is the knife guy from the fight scene
west is hanging on to his ankles enjoying a vindictive belly laugh
downward now that looked like it hurt
its driven finally into place to a rousing cheer
pull back to reveal that president grant his sleeves rolled up has delivered the blow
hats in the air handshakes pictures
the specter of loveless and his evil plot a fading memory
grant turns to west and gordon
gentlemen i now strongly believe the united states is going to be truly united
not because of this railroad
but because of you
the wild wild west rev
grant scans the crowd every race seems present at this momentous event
he reaches into his pocket takes out two silver shields
ive signed into law the creation of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the president and the country from lunatics like loveless
pins badges on their vests welcome to the secret service agents no
the president shakes both their hands
gordon resists looking down
uh just out of curiosity sir
whos agent no
grant just shakes his head some things never change
i dont think that matters very much do you
besides youll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment
hands them piece of paper see you back in washington
he snaps off a salute starts to go as they read it
gordon looks up very troubled
what about our train
over shoulder well im taking it of course
hell you let loveless blow up mine
as they look at one another in dismay
they turn to see rita approaching them from a crowd of scientists
shes looking extraordinarily fetching in a print dress and parasol
west and gordon sit up like dogs
you look great
ravishing a vision
she hugs west she hugs gordon
whos it gonna be
i just wanted to thank you for everything youve done for me
before i went back home to texas
whyre you going back there
why dont you come with me back to washington
or better still come with me to washington
i could introduce you to people i still know in the theater
shes not really an entertainer remember
intercedes i cant go with either of you
she looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other
its not that you both dont have your attributes
to gordon youre so sophisticated and such a wonderful cook
to west jim youre good with a gun
and have great legs
to both and youre both so brave
im afraid i havent been completely honest with you
professor escobars not my father
hes my husband
she gestures to a handsome goateed latino waiting for her
shaved and cleaned up hes not the old man we thought
why didnt you just tell us that in the first place
well i was going to
but would you have really brought me along if i said i was married
neither west nor gordon knows what to say
i didnt think so
she turns and starts to walk away
stops and smiles
at least you still have each other
as west and gordon look at one another
we gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful john ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices
you know arte
whats that jim
maybe ritas right
suddenly intruding into the f
is a huge metal leg
then another leg clomps down
and the tarantula comes into full view
as our heroes ride slowly into the sunset
theres a lot of other women in the world
thats easy for you to say
she didnt walk off with your best dress
