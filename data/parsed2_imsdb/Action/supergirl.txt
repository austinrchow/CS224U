revised screenplay th january
presents by david odell copyright all rights reserved and reveals the inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches
the city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes
the camera roams through the city observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful
graceful movement and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model
and now who can give me the electron wave functions for kryptonian covalent bonding
the five year olds eagerly raise their hands
the teacher points to one
the cube root of the wavelength over the natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared
the teacher smiles
well maybe that was a bit too easy
the camera roams on through the city following the sound of a strange ethereally beautiful singing
the camera discovers the source of the sound an artist sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a matterwand
the wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy
the artist whose name is zaltar sometimes whistles along in counterpoint
a small girl is watching him with fascination
her name is kara and she is seven
behind her the dome which encloses the city marks the edge of the limbo outside
what are you making its going to be a tree i think
whats a tree
its something they have on earth
you know where your cousin went
where is earth
didnt you study six dimensional geometry in school
yes i know the equations i just cant see it in my head
even i have trouble with that sometimes
earth is in outer space
and were in inner space
i dont understand
wait till youre older
here watch this
zaltar takes a small omegahedron out of his pocket and holds it in his hand
this is one of the four power sources of the city
i borrowed it from the guardians
look what i can do with it
zaltar touches his matter
wand to the omegahedron and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light
he touches his wand to the tree sculpture and the sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows
kara claps her hands with delight at the spectacle
zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork
he carefully puts down the omegahedron at his feet takes a small flask from his belt and drinks
you see a tree is a living thing
can you create life
no no just the illusion of life
a kind of half life maybe
a pale shadow of the real thing
but it is lovely the way the light plays over the surface
a womans voice can be heard calling in the distance
kara calls out in reply
im here mother
karas mother alura appears through the lacey architecture of the city
kara you shouldnt be so near the edge without a grown up
im sorry mother
i was keeping an eye on her
alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately showing shes not really angry
together they watch zaltars latest sculpture flickering with the play of inner light and shadow
thank you zaltar but she has to obey the rules
zaltar takes another swig from his flask
and lowers his voice confidentially
you and your husband have been kind to me alura
i have something to tell you im going away
zaltar bends down to kara and hands her his matterwand
put your fingers there kara
and press hard
she does and the wand makes a horrible squawk
kara laughs with delight
now go make something pretty
kara scampers away hardly able to believe her good fortune and starts to make all kinds of surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby
zaltar speaks to alura in a low confidential voice
ive discovered a new way into the phantom zone
but the phantom zone is for criminals
im tired of limiting myself to argo city
i want to do something new
im starting to repeat myself here with this airy glittery stuff
zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him
but zaltar you founded the city
we were all just refugees from krypton when you gathered us together and brought us here to the inner dimension
you cant abandon us now
you have a responsibility to us
in the background kara has been modeling a spiky insect like creature
now she suddenly finds the omegahedron on the ground beside her
she doesnt stop to wonder how it got there from beside zaltars feet
she simply picks up the omegahedron and touches it to the spiky creature
the creature suddenly flicks its wings and comes to life unnoticed by the adults
kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head glittering as if
it were made of diamonds
im an artist alura
my work comes first
other people come second
how can you create beauty
with a selfish heart
the spiky insect creature flies closer and closer around the little girls head buzzing angrily
her look of delight turns to fear
she tries to shoo the creature away
it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city
the spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it
with a giant whoosh all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole
kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind
she cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother
the omegahedron is swept toward the hole as well
kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane
kara the power source
kara reaches for it but it is too far from her and the omegahedron is sucked out into infinity by the wind
zaltar picks up the matterwand from where kara dropped it and touches her with the wand
she is instantly held fast
zaltar pulls her back inside
he gives her to her mother alura
then zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir
the wind dies down and all is silent except for the quiet sobbing of kara in her mothers arms
zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair tenderly
i didnt know
it was my fault
you arent old enough to use the wand
i shouldnt have given it to you
but the power source zaltar
it couldnt be helped
the city will have to make do with three
but what will happen
the guardians will be angry
they may even send me to the phantom zone
you see i didnt really have permission to borrow it
i must go explain to them
zaltar hurries off nervously
the camera holds on karas face as she senses this may be her last sight of zaltar
a beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers
butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower
the blondes name is selena
she is our ideal image of the girl next door who grew up into a dynamite lady
her current boyfriend follows along behind her lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road
selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak
and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth
over here george
its the perfect spot
george sets down the wicker basket and selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food
she unpacks fried chicken hard boiled eggs potato salad cold beer and a big rich creamy frosted devils food cake
you sure are a good cook selena
man that looks too pretty to eat
better eat it quick
it wont look too pretty when its all covered with ants
she hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard boiled egg
selena ive been thinking
its time i settled down and i dont know a nicer lady to settle down with than you
why george are you proposing
marry me selena
the hardware store doesnt bring in much now but
george i thought youd never ask
a shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up
with a loud plop and a spatter of icing the omegahedron falls into the middle of the chocolate cake
what the heck is that
they look up in the boughs of the tree overhead and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth
a squirrel frisbee
selena reaches out and picks up the omegahedron
it comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface as if made of some substance which repels other kinds of matter
selena holds the shining omegahedron in her hand and examines it turning it around and around as if hypnotized
her face takes on a new expression
almost as if the simple wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe
id swear i know just what this is but ive never seen it before
she stands up and walks across the checkered cloth in a beeline for the pickup truck
hey where you going
calling over her shoulder ive got things to do
what about my proposal
dismissively call me next week
maybe we can have lunch
she gets in the pickup and
she is ten years older now a young lady
almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen
voice over but kara you are too young to go
they are in the assembly amphitheater of the city where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen
kara is in the centre of the ring with adults seated in scattered rows around her
her parents zor el and alura are standing in front of her
i am almost an adult
this is what i want
but kara no one has ever gone from here to earth
the journey is dangerous
it was my fault we lost the power source
and it was zaltar who stole it
i allowed it to escape the city
ever since we told you how your cousin superman was sent there as an infant all you have wanted to do was visit this place
yes i do want to go
but someone must go
our scanning shows the power source has finally reached the earth
it could destroy everything unless someone brings it back
superman will return it
why havent you been able to contact him
he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago
he may be dead
but what can you a mere girl ill have super powers there
we cant wait
our lights are fading
look around you
when i was a child the city was bright and shining
look at it now
zor el and alura sigh
there is no denying that the brilliance of argo city has been much dimmed since kara was a little girl
what do your teachers think
zor el looks around the circle
a beautiful woman speaks
it would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier but the city cannot last much longer without the power source
it is her future shes fighting for zor el
very well let it be done
alura embraces kara emotionally fighting back the tears
kara too is struggling to control her own emotions
dont worry mother ill be all right
ive studied the transmissions from earth
i know their customs
kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents
but they are such strange unstable people
then i will learn to act strange like them
kara holds up a small handbag
inside we glimpse red and blue material
i have made clothing and copies of their money i will be fine
her father puts his hand on her shoulder
be brave my
as brave as my father
they embrace briefly
kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city
instantly transparent bubble forms around her
her parents watch as she floats away
she passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the city and off into an infinity of space
her sphere moves from blackness to a dark green limbo
the atmosphere thickens around her
soon it is unmistakably water and she is heading toward the light above
a fish darts past with a flash of silver
the sphere rushes upward faster and faster
it breaks the surface of the water
kara springs free of the bubble which disappears
she is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin superman
she lands on a nearby beach
she looks around her feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world
kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet
to her astonishment she crushes it to powder in her hand and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath
she looks down at her feet so firmly planted on the ground
she rises a few inches into the air and reacts with amazement
then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing
with a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward
kara loops and rolls swoops and circles laughing with sheer delight
kara swoops down at a herd of horses
the herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away
kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view
the she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow
she stares at it with awe
kara stands up smiling
she flies into the air again
she lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest
shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom
these trees are much more impressive than zaltars imitation back in argo city
she hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles
she sees a baby deer hopelessly tangled in the long canes
she shoots rays of heat vision from her eyes and slices through the tough stems
the fawn scrambles free and scampers off into the forest
kara watches it with a benevolent smile
she removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape
a big impressive house somewhere in the middle west
people mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors doeuvres off silver trays from
all the quests have a name tag on like at some kind of conference
selena the blonde who discovered the power source is circulating among the quests
she has changed since we saw her last
no longer the girl next door she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels
she walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed and graciously accepts the homage of the quests
a smile a nod a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention
but we notice odd details of the party the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols
at the refreshment table there is a big ten foot wicker sculpture of a female goat covered with paper flowers
and the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them
bianca a tall cold eyed brunette in black silk dress whispers in selenas ear
nigel is going to try something
dont worry about old nigel i can take care of him
hes just a sore loser
an elderly man in a three piece pin stripe suit grabs her elbow
i dont want much selena
i have simple tastes
what do you want
im sorry but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland
you know how she loves to ski
she can have it
i hate mountains
selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with bianca and strolls over to a sour faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette
cheer up nigel
its not the end of the world
it may well be
i know how you won that election selena
you cant fool me
i have plans nigel
you could come with me
im going places
youre not going anywhere
except back to nowheresville
youre too impatient selena
look around you all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship
some of their families have been in the craft for generations
you cant join and take over our whole organization in a few months
selena smirks at him self confidently
i just did
because i have the power
youre going to pay a terrible price
the power of shadow is tricky
use it too much and it takes over
nigel drops his cigarette stubs it out on the lawn and takes out his platinum cigarette case
biancas taught me all
need to know
ill be safe as long as i dont go too far
he holds the shiny mirror like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection
surface of the cigarette case
she is still the glamorous beauty but looming behind her
invisible to ordinary eyes
is a dark eerie shape of something hideous
quick as a cat selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery
all traces of the shadow behind her have disappeared
forgot you were trying to quit
nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently
nigel get out of here
and dont come slithering back
nigel shakes his head
you need me selena
im the only one who can save you from a terrible fate
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower
now burn rubber
nigel locks eyes with her
he takes another insolent sip of champagne
arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass
nigel spits out the champagne and drops the glass
everyone laughs at him
balefire on you selena
grinning you scorpios can never take a joke
all quests have fallen silent staring at the altercation between the two of them
you think you are on top now
well there is someone coming to challenge you
i saw it in the cards this morning
throw him out
two burly waiters seize nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking
you wont last a year selena
the cards dont lie
the crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation
bianca stands up on a chair
the crowd falls silent
lets not let one rotten apple spoil the party
i give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the circle selena
selena steps up onto a raised dais
and holds up her hands in an invocational gesture
thank you sisters and brothers of the craft
it is a great honor you have given me and i will try to be worthy
and when my secret plans are revealed you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when nigel was our leader
one of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel pot under a chafing dish
the fuel pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue
and now i call upon the great mother the spirit of nature to bless all our endeavors in the coming year
a woman in the
everyone looks where she is pointing
the huge ten foot tall wicker statue bursts into flames
panic and pandemonium
some of the quests run for safety
others try to throw water onto the blazing torch like statue but in vain
selena frowns at the spectacle and without a word turns and stalks into her house
the camera follows selena through the french doors and into her large living room
on one wall is a huge ornate gold framed mirror covered with a thick veil
selena sits down in front of a large hearth and opens a secret compartment in the floor
she reaches inside and removes a finely wrought metal box in the shape of a gargoyle and a pack of cards
she puts the gargoyle box on her lap and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns
the elderly man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden
outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard
someone runs by in the b
with a coil of garden hose
the elderly man walks over to selena timidly
is this nigels doing
its a warning thats for sure
maybe it was just an accident
mysteriously theres no such thing as an accident
everything has meaning if you can read the signs
the elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards selena has cast on the floor
then what does it mean
selena shrugs and puts aside her cards
dont ask me
i cant read the signs worth spit
a bus stops in front of the school
kara disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus
from now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity linda lee
linda walks up the driveway toward the main building
around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt blazer and white knee socks
many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress carrying a battered old suitcase
in front of the school lucy lane one of the older girls is batting in a softball game
she swings and hits one over the fence for a homer
linda watches the excited deliriously happy girls wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions
linda walks up the steps to the main building
linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall
myra the school bully passes with her spy and toady the loathsome muffy
as they pass myra speaks in a loud voice
geeze another barfy new student
theyre really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days
linda walks on up to the next f oor
linda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar mr
danvers turns from his desk and glares at her
dont you believe in knocking
the pre entry signal
she knocks on the open door
her manner is so open and guileless that mr
danvers though he gives her a strange look does not put it down to smart aleckyness as he normally would
what can i do for you
im linda lee
my cousin wrote you
danvers stares at her blankly
hes a bit absent minded
linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk
two beams of x ray vision are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes
the letters in your files
under k for kent
danvers opens his file and searches through it
i mean it would probably be there if you received it
here it is
youre the orphan
im so sorry about your parents
well try to make you happy here
he rises and walks around the desk toward her
he puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion
danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus
since your school records were lost in the fire we start you out easy first
youll have english latin french history art chemistry math biology and computing
later on you can add some electives
i think well put you in g dorm
he opens the door and ushers her into the dorm
danvers leads linda down the corridor
a girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal
man on the floor
immediately several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut
danvers smiles indulgently and leads linda along to one of the rooms with an open door
lucy lane still in her softball flannels is digging mud out of her cleats with a swiss army knife held over a wastebasket
danvers knocks on the open door in the pre entry signal of earth
lucy looks up
danvers come in and park it
lucy your roommate still home with anorexia
it wasnt anorexia
it was the food
linda this is lucy lane
you can room with her
show her around lucy i believe you know her cousin mr
lucy turns into a bundle of enthusiasm
she grabs lindas suitcase and leads her into the room chattering away excitedly
wow youre clarks cousin
clarks a hunk
my sister lois was a real nerd to let that one get away
youll love it here we have a great dorm some really insane characters i mean radical craziness
danvers slips away leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted
lucy puts lindas suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack
i can do that
whens the rest of your stuff arriving
she looks down at the nearly empty suitcase
there isnt any
this is all your clothes
lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside
her own bed
lucys bed is smothered with teddy bears and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers movie stars and tennis players
also a large painted poster of superman
i have money to buy more but i havent had a chance since
did you have a fire at your house or something
id rather not talk about it
an orphan are you
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth
oh wow i shouldve known
me and my big mouth
listen you can borrow any of my clothes you want
youre very kind
im real sorry linda i shouldve known it was something tragic if you show up without a wardrobe
here try on this
lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to linda
girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey
linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob
she sees myra put her stick between lucys legs and trip her
linda stops to help lucy up
she did that deliberately
shes a beast
the pack turns and heads back toward them the lead
myra slaps the puck directly at
steps in front of it to protect lucy
the and shatters
the girls mill confusion picking up the little pieces of with myra in lucy
linda puck hits linda around in puck
howd you do that
mustve been a defective puck
girls pile in and start to take off their uniforms
showers are running in the background
linda unlaces her shoes
lucy is unlacing beside her
keep an eye peeled for myra
shes out to get you
but what for
she just hates anybody who isnt afraid of her
linda and lucy seen from the shoulders up are enjoying a nice warm shower
linda looks through the tile wall with her x ray vision and sees myra next door fooling with the plumbing
whispering are they in
muffy myras spy nods yes from her look out position
listen to the screams when i shut off the cold water
she takes a huge wrench and starts to shut off a valve
her spy looks worriedly at the valve
but myra why dont you shut off the hot water and give them an ice bath
if you shut off the cold it could scald them
so they lose a little skin
serve em right
myra pulls on the wrench
linda shoots a beam of her heat vision through the wall
myra pulls on the valve but the wrench glows red hot in her hand
she lets go with a cry of pain
a pipe springs a leak drenching her in her school uniform
myra heads for the door to get out
more pipes spring leaks
myra is soaked her hair all bedraggled her uniform a mess
danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard
all the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens
except for linda who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom
now this is the kind of problem that used to take weeks before the computer
it still takes a long time without certain algorithms
linda stares out through the solid wall with her x ray vision
a cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds
the nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab
the baby birds when he gets there
slowly the cat inches along the branch
suddenly a beam of light hits the branch
it bursts into flame and falls down to the ground saving the birds from any future danger
the cat turns around like a felon caught in the act runs down the tree trunk and scampers away
linda smiles to herself
are you with us
she turns to look at mr
danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her
uh yes mr
she looks at the board
the answer is
linda smiles proud that she got the right answer
the other girls in the class laugh at her
even her friend lucy snickers
linda realizes she has made a mistake but is not sure how serious it is
the class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit
linda stays in her seat staring at mr
danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers
you may go linda
but try not to clown around in the future
she meekly heads for the door
he turns to erase the blackboard
something stays his hand and he looks at the problem
then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper
selenas cadillac drives past the school
softball in front
girls are playing softball in front
bianca is driving
selena sits in the back brooding
her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a built in bar
she suddenly calls out to bianca
stop the car
bianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt
the girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the cadillac
selena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car
i said stop i didnt say run into a brick wall
what is it
the coffer of shadow
look at it
the metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance
what does it mean
the one nigel spoke of
it must be near
they stare out the car window at the girls softball game which was resumed
what could be dangerous about a baseball game
it must be the girls
one of the girls
but which one
we have already attracted enough attention
bianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away
well bide our time and keep watch
young girls just cant keep a secret
if one of thems up to something well find out
and then like great cats we pounce
the car swerves slightly
bianca try not to be so bloodthirsty when youre at the wheel
linda is standing at the bathroom window of her dorm room looking outside with a melancholy expression
she slides the curtain across the window so no one can see in
lucy runs in fresh from her softball game and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats
lucys bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows
lindas bed across the room is austere and almost monastic with no family photos posters or toys
hey linda you in there
linda answers from inside the shut bathroom door
how much longer you gonna be
im cutting my hair
lucy crosses to the bathroom door
youre a maniac
let me do it for you
youll look awful
linda is in her supergirl costume and her blonde hair
her brunette wig is hanging on a hook beside the mirror
i can manage thanks
supergirl holds out a lock of her blonde hair
she looks into the mirror and shoots a beam of energy from her eye which reflects off the mirror and strikes her hair cutting off one inch of the blonde
i cut my own hair once
i looked so awful the only thing was to go totally punk
linda opens the door and steps out of the bathroom
she is wearing her brunette wig and her linda clothing
lucy is puzzled
your hair looks the same
it was just a trim
the student hall monitor sticks her head in the door and yells excitedly
hey guys gloria just got a package from home
whats in it
a hair dryer that makes popcorn
pig out time
come on linda
lucy hurries to the door
linda holds back
you go on
linda nods bravely and lucy dashes off down the hall toward the lounge
linda stands alone in the room
a beam of light from the setting sun shines through the room and casts a pool of light on the opposite wall
linda looks at the beam of light with nostalgia
lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by glorias new hair dryer
the package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair dryer
some of the girls start a playful popcorn throwing fight in the b
one of the girls is strumming her guitar and starts to sing theres no place like home
one by one the other girls join in
its a scene of high spirits and camaraderie in contrast to lindas loneliness
linda still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam
from down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing in improvised six part harmony
be it ever so humble theres no place like home
a tear of self pity and homesickness wells up in lindas eyes and runs down her cheek
she steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face
she suddenly hears aluras voice in her mind
kara my darling
is it you
where are you
in argo city
have you found the power source
mother this world is so big
i dont know where to begin to look
kara be careful
there is some terrible evil force coming near you
i can feel it
keep to your disguise
let no one know who you are
i have super powers
nothing can hurt me
there are more powers in the universe than we know
and more than we can imagine
be careful kara
and come home safely
the sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off leaving linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight
the soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall
mid pleasures and palaces whereere i roam be it ever so humble theres no place like home
linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench she is wearing the school uniform now
all around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle aged couples
there is a frantic bustle of activity
danvers sits at his computer which is spewing out page after page of a complicated printout
finally the printer stops
he reads out the bottom line
five billion two hundred and seventy one million nine thousand and ten
he sits back in his chair and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe
the campus is deserted
linda still pretends to read but her sense of loneliness is palpable
danvers is beside her looking down
no plans for the weekend linda
cant have you moping around the campus
why dont you come home with us for dinner
id love to
danvers and linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food
the dog begs for scraps
as the scene progresses mos the danvers bring linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food jokes and happiness
dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyones childhood
selena at her most glamorous in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls stands looking out the french doors of her mansion
she is staring shamelessly at ethan a handsome young landscape gardener
bianca is standing beside selena
is he your entertainment for tonight
he will be
in about five minutes
bianca exits and selena waves to ethan from the french doors
ethan is sketching the house adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing
he sees selena waving and walks over to her
finished your estimate
well theres several ways to go
come in have a drink well talk
she ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth
you must be very popular in the neighborhood
i always see your truck parked around
i have a lot of repeat business
people seem to like my service
i bet they do
whats that big black scar on the ground
like a fire
oh you know how parties are
always some damage
ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees
now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs
depending on how alkaline your soil is
selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch and then turns to a silver tray beside her
she picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses
i just love plants and growing things
it must be wonderful to have green thumbs
ethan looks at the drink with misgiving
uh no thanks i dont drink during the day
selena gestures outside
but look its almost sundown
ethan glances outside
selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted
really im not thirsty
now i could put in some honeysuckle there and there
selena pouts exaggeratedly
just take a sip or
ill be hurt
its an old family recipe im famous for them
he doesnt want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle
what is it
a passionfruit smoothee
well just one
he takes his glass with the extra ingredient and clinks it against hers in a toast
and to the seeds well plant together
ill drink to that
he takes a careful sip of his drink tastes and smiles
he tosses off the rest of it in one gulp
selena watches him triumphantly
now about my fee
he suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch
she leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red nailed fingers
and when you wake drown in my eyes and be all mine
the doorbell rings
selena looks up with annoyance
if thats the jehovahs witnesses again
she angrily walks toward the hall casting a fond look back at ethan
dont go away gorgeous
ill be right back
nigel in a skin tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell
behind him his porsche is parked in the driveway and beyond at the curb is a truck with ethans nursery and landscaping painted on it
selena opens the door sees nigel and tries to close it
but nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open
nigel get lost
i have to talk to you
youre wasting your breath
you used to listen to me
when you asked me to teach you something of the craft
i could teach you a thing or two now
ethan opens his eyes
he rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously
the room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours
ethan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart and lurches out of the french doors into the terrace
selena is listening impatiently to nigel and staring oddly at him
trust the wisdom of the ancients trust the great mother to protect us
are you staring at me like that
i was just thinking if i had your skin problems id use a good tannisroot ointment
nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion so he is completely thrown off his stride
nothings wrong with my skin
such a shame
you ought to take better care of yourself
selena closes the door while hes off his guard
nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection
his face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches
ethan staggers across the lawn still clutching his head obviously very ill
as he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn he mutters drunkenly to himself
selena enters and finds ethan gone
she is furious
she walks to the french doors
youll spoil everything
linda is playing chess with mr
danvers while his wife knits on the sofa
i think youd better be getting back to the dorm linda
the housemotherll expect you to sign in by eight
linda stands up from the chessboard
thank you both so much
it was a lovely lunch mrs
i had a wonderful time
and youre a terrific chess player mr
mate in five moves
she moves the pieces chonk chonk chonk chonk chonk
and there goes my king
got to hand it to you i didnt see it coming
she walks out the door into the night
what a lovely child
such nice manners
we must have her back dont you think
danvers grunts absent mindedly bemused at his loss
selena paces agitatedly in her living room
finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall
she puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it
show me ethan
she rips aside the veil
the image in the mirror shows ethan staggering drunkenly through the night cown the centre white line of a highway
cars whizz past him in both directions
the silly fool
lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive in in her thunderbird convertible talking to the foxiest dude at rindge tech
other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive in
lucy catches sight of linda walking along the side of the road
to the boy its my roommate
youll love her
shes really off the wall
lucy jumps out of her car runs over to linda and whispers urgently in her ear
theres this all night party at eddies
his folks are away
oh i dont know
im not signed out for an overnight
go back sign in and climb out the bathroom window
mccloskeys always zonked out shell never hear you
it doesnt seem right
please as a favour to me
so i wont be the only girl
linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre white line of the highway
cars honk and zoom past him
look at that guy
lucy whirls around and looks
what a space cadet
yelling and waving hey you dingleberry
get outta the street
ethan ignores them and continues to teeter deliriously
he sees the night as a fairyland of dancing blurred lights the neon of the hamburger stand the garish pumps of the gas station across the street the streaking head
and taillights of the cars on either side
all sound is similarly distorted and far away
why is he acting so strangely
i dunno but hes gonna get creamed
selena holds the metal box shaped like a gargoyle
she looks at the image of ethan in her mirror
power of shadows
bring him to me
the box in her hand glows with an inner light
there is a construction site next to the hamburger place
a giant bulldozer suddenly roars to life and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site
with no one at the controls the bulldozer drives out onto the street
ethan sees its gaping jaws and runs clumsily away
they snap at him with the clash of steel
he stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up
it wheels around and starts to carry him away with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth
the onlookers are stunned and horrified
omigod its a runaway
lucy sprints out into the street running after the driverless bulldozer
lucy come back
somebodys gotta do something
lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer
she climbs bravely up into the drivers seat and tries to tug at the controls
they are frozen
in desperation lucy yanks on the steering wheel
the bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station
a tourist is filling his station wagon at one of the self service pumps
his wife is bringing their toddler back from the rest rooms
the bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station
the tourist dives out of its path
the bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed
linda watches with mounting horror
and yet she remembers the warning from alura and stands frozen unable to intervene
lucy fights the wheel in vain
the bulldozer circles through the motel smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks
the bulldozer drives under the motel sign which hits lucy on the head knocking her unconscious
finally the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station
the utility pole leans at a crazy angle
its electric wires break and dangle down flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement
the river of gasoline from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines
the mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires his arms held out eagerly
instead of helping the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire
linda cant take it any longer
she ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant
an instant later she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as supergirl
she stands on the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign which hides her from the fleeing crowd
supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs
the toddler is blown safely nto his mothers arms
she grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and bursts into flames
the bulldozer with lucy lane unconscious at the controls and ethan imprisoned in the scoop is surrounded by an impenetrable ring of fire
supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who werent running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and
supergirl takes the unconscious lucy from the drivers seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer
supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber
ethan looks up as supergirl slides lucy lane in beside him
he sees supergirls face backlit by the raging inferno outside
everythings going to be all right
shes just unconscious
no broken bones
ethans swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with absolute clarity
a moment outside of time
the most romantic glamorous image imaginable the blonde backlit looking at him with concern her lips slightly parted
there is something about ethans ecstasy which holds supergirl for a moment
selena watches the image of ethan and supergirl in her mirror
her face is a study in jealousy and dismay
ethan in the mirror god
that was meant for me
im going to close this up again
dont leave me in here
its for your own protection
she pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal
immediately afterwards the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a fiery explosion
the entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky
a fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene sirens screaming
the tourist family watch from a safe distance their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle
supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with ethan and lucy safely inside
calling from inside whats happening
shouting over the wind im taking you to the hospital
within let me out
i have to talk to you
the firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam
the blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon
a bewildered policeman is searching for victims
wheres the casualties
you cant tell me theres no casualties
bianca enters and sees selena staring raptly at the mirror
i came as quickly as i could
what is the danger
its what we were warned about
selena points to the mirror which shows the image of supergirl flying through the air carrying the bulldozer scoop
bianca cant quite make out what it is at first
a storm dragon
no a super girl
supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance
there is no one around
supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal
two interns are chatting in the corridor near the doors
they jump at the sound of bending steel outside
what was that
maybe we better take a look
supergirl has strapped ethan and the semi conscious lucy onto wheeled gurneys
dont leave me
i have to
when can i see you again
tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream
she gives the gurneys a shove
the automatic doors open and ethan and lucy roll inside on the gurneys
did we use the laughing gas tonight
that was last night
then this is really happening
the two interns catch the gurneys and start examining ethan and lucy
hey fella can you talk
ethan begins to babble deliriously
where is she
it never hit me like this before
i love her
he sits up tears brimming in his eyes and grasps the intern by the lapels
where is she
i love her dont you understand
ill die if i cant have her
the intern pulls away and points to lucy who is beginning to come to
shes right here fella
no not her
the blonde the one who carried us through the air
she can fly
shes an angel
the two interns exchange a glance
one of them steps to a wall intercom
this is stenzl in emergency
we got a
send down the boys from psycho
i saw her
selena is brooding in front of her mirror which shows ethan in the hospital struggling with the two interns
selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil
she speaks to bianca standing beside her
why did she have to show up now
thats easy for you to say bianca
you can do it
youre the most powerful woman on earth
there is a pause as the implications reverberate
you own the coffer of shadow
nothing can withstand its power
ive been saving it
for the right moment
that moment is now
what good is a sword unless it be unsheathed
use it and no one will dare oppose you again
selena toys with the idea in her mind turning over the various arguments
a smile creeps across her face
not even nigel
selena goes to the secret compartment opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box
she looks at it with a dreamy far away expression on her face
what do i do
i dont know her name
the naming of names is not necessary
just concentrate on her face
your shadow will do the rest
selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid
inside is the omegahedron power source from argo city spinning around a strange dark region in its centre
selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring
power of shadow hear me
find her wherever she be
find her and destroy her
a black cloud of shadow bursts out of the centre of the omegahedron filling the room
selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed
even biancas face has gone white
the two women huddle together as a huge invisible presence fills the room with darkness
then the unseen presence suddenly smashes its way outside through the solid wall of selenas living room leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it
light returns to the room as the shadow departs
and from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away
selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room
next time remind me to do this out in the yard
yes of course it was foolish of me
bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the omegahedron which is still lying right where selena dropped it
but selena quickly picks it up herself before bianca can touch it
i think id better keep it
whatever you say
whatever i say
from now on
she shuts the lid of the gargoyle box sealing the spinning omegahedron safely inside
danvers is on the phone
the housemother still doesnt answer
danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression
probably drunk again
im sure linda got back all right
we should have driven her
danvers stands up and puts on his jacket
ill just drop by the school and
make sure shes all right
linda drives up in lucys car the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place
she drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm
linda gets out of the car and lets herself into the dorm with a key
inside she signs her name in the book
linda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room
the place is kind of spooky
linda enters the room she shares with lucy
she puts lucys car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of lucys family and of her half dozen current boyfriends
linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab undecorated corner
she lies down on her bed with a sigh staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood
suddenly she senses that something is not right
she gets up from the bed walks to the window and gazes out a t the deserted campus
the dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees
the tennis court is visible from lindas window and a city park adjoining the school property
the unseen monster is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches
a bolt of lightning flashes followed by a crash of thunder
the wind howls
a storm is brewing
far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks snapping them like matchsticks
the unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory crushing everything in its path its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake
linda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her
nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared her for this
for the first time since she left argo city her eyes show fear
and yet theres a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut
huge footprints sink into the damp grass of the campus
a bicycle rack full of schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech
the monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court
the shelter is crushed to kindling wood
the monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court crunching deep cracked depressions in the clay
the net stretches and groans toward linda as the invisible enormity comes closer and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part
the tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward linda and momentarily outlines the form of the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel
the only thing between linda and the monster is lucy
s parked car
the monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for linda
hey thats my roommates car
determination floods her face
she whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of supergirl
supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster
she raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice
leave this place and do no harm
something picks supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction
lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead
supergirl picks herself up shaken
she launches herself directly at the space in mid air ten feet above the monsters footprints
she crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact
supergirl falls to the ground staggered by the concussion
the irresistible force has met the immovable object
supergirl looks up and altering the wavelength of her x ray vision to a transcendental frequency paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible
a huge nightmare shape looming over her and reaching out to crush her with massive talons
then the image fades
supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole breaking it off at the base
supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole
she looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky
she flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her
again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole
supergirls face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run las vegas for a year
she looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below
suddenly supergirl dives down from the sky glowing with accumulated electricity
she embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy
the two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light
the monster is briefly made visible again by the energy
but this time it is shrinking shriveling up into a shapeless lump
the light fades as the energy is discharged
a dark shapeless lump detaches itself from supergirls grasp and flies shrieking away into the night
supergirl stands alone and exhausted her muscles trembling with fatigue
she turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm
danvers drives up the long driveway toward lindas dorm
he parks his car behind the flattened remains of lucys car and gets out staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle
he walks toward the dorm fear and confusion on his face
danvers pushes through the unlocked front door
he glances in the sign out book for lindas name
then he knocks on the door labeled housemother mrs
he opens that door and peeks in
a slovenly overweight woman in a housecoat is curled up on her sofa a bottle of whiskey clutched to her breast
she snores heroically
danvers walks quickly down the long line of empty rooms to linda and lucys room
danvers pauses at the door and looks in
supergirl in her blonde hair and red and blue tunic is lying asleep on lindas bed
to her linda
is it linda
supergirl looks up at him and smiles weakly
i didnt want anyone to know
but i was so tired
danvers sits on the side of her bed
are you all right
just need rest thats all
sorry about all the damage outside
i had to fight some terrible thing
an evil force
trying to destroy me
she sits up and looks anxiously at him
selena watches their image in her mirror
image you wont tell anybody will you
image not even my wife
and if theres anything i can do to help id be honoured
supergirl sinks back down and closes her eyes
thank you mr
she lapses into a deep sleep
danvers stands up and pulls the covers up over her in a fatherly gesture
he stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her and then walks out of the room closing the door shut behind him
linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital
lucy lane is sitting up in bed with a white bandage around her head
supermans pal jimmy olsen is standing awkwardly beside the bed holding a small bunch of daffodils
lucy is talking animatedly on her bedside telephone when linda enters
come see me
and smuggle in a pint they wont let me have anything but make sure its jamocha almond fudge
listen i got to run my roommate just walked in
lucy hangs up and turns to linda
hey linda babes
ive got so much to tell you i dont know where to begin
oh this is jimmy olsen he works with clark and my sister at the newspaper
nice to meet you
lucys told me all about you
your cousin clark taught me everything i know about the newspaper business
nice to meet you
she shakes hands shyly with jimmy then turns to lucy
im afraid i have some bad news about your car
ill get a new one with the insurance money
jimmy keeps looking at linda
do you have any theories about last night
how lucy and that guy got to the hospital
and all that damage at the school
the police are calling it a freak tornado
id like to interview you for the daily overlapping oh jimmy cant you forget about your career for one second
i mean you were there
do you think it was natural or like some people are claiming supernatural
i believe theres a rational explanation for everything
but i dont know what it is
can i quote you
lucy hands jimmy a stainless steel urinal
jimmy would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die
he steps into lucys bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower
lucy grabs lindas arm and whispers urgently in her ear
listen i know ive been saying you ought party more but keep your hands off this one will yak
hes private property
ive been waiting years for him to develop
hes cute enough to melt lead
jimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug
where is your cousin clark by the way
hes off doing a top secret uh investigation
i knew it
hes working on a hot scoop
bianca drives selenas cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone
selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim
to bianca this wont take long
keep the motor running
selena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor
her huge silk cape billows around her making her seem larger than life
nurses orderlies patients scatter to get out of her way
her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what shes doing there
she knows exactly where shes going to
she turns a corner and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her
he is sitting in bed an ice bag on his head drawing a picture of supergirl on a piece of cardboard
he is in pajamas and robe
selena steps beside the bed
he looks up
oh no not you again
what an adorable hat
they think i have a concussion
and you think youre in love
i know it
this love of yours will soon wear off
i gave you a temporary love potion
why should i believe you
its the truth
in twenty four hours youll forget all about that girl
reaches out and grabs her cloak with a grip of such urgency that she is pulled slightly off balance
then im not the only one who saw her
you did too
selena pulls his hand away from her cloak
yes yes i saw the whole thing
how could you be interested in that puny little girl
but she is real it wasnt just a concussion
forget her youre mine
i saw you first
selena sits on the side of the bed
she removes a vial of liquid from her bodice
i saw you continuing here
its an antidote to the love drug i gave you
ethan sweeps it on the floor where it shatters
he starts frantically ringing the buzzer pinned to his bed
you cant escape from me that easily
im afraid you dont know who i am
dont think im weak just because im a woman
i have power
give in stop fighting me ethan
i always get what i want
the door opens and a nurse walks in
would you stop screaming
there are sick people trying to sleep
get her away from me
to selena are you family
visiting hours are over
theyre over for you sweetheart
selena removes the gargoyle shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid
the omegahedron inside spins and sends out a powerful force which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside
the door slams shut
selena closes the lid of the coffer and turns to ethan
now you see who youre dealing with
ethan scrambles out of the bed and away from her backing toward the window
leave me alone
selena at the bed discovers his sketch of supergirl on the piece of cardboard
this is your problem right here
this girls driving you insane ethan
let me help you
i dont want your help
come back to my house
my cars outside
selena reaches out a hand to ethan
i never met a man i couldnt have and youre no different from the rest
the door opens behind her and two security officers push inside with guns drawn
okay whats going on in h selena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling
the men stare at the ce ling astonished
ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door
selena turns to look at ethan escaping and the guns fall to the floor and discharge
the security men run into ethans bathroom slamming the door behind them
selena ducks out into the corridor
ethan is running away down the corridor
frightened patients peek out of their rooms
the nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as selena emerges into the corridor
ethan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a heart lung machine down from the surgery
selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the heart lung machine
power of shadow seize him
the heart lung machine comes to life its lights flash its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like medusas hair its wheels turn around and it chases ethan
down the corridor
selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph
ethan looks behind sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm
a cart of surgical instruments rolls out of a closet in front of him its scalpels standing up and pointing at him quivering eagerly blocking his path
ethan dives through a swinging door to his left
a team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table
ethan runs through in the background
the surgeons continue with their work
the heart lung machine wheels through after him followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets
the surgical team doesnt look up from their work
several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after ethan and the other apparatus
one of the nurses finally looks up
doctor i think you re going to have a gas problem
i shouldnt have had the cabbage at lunch
ethan bursts into an empty surgical x ray room the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind
he slams the heavy lead lined door and bolts it shut
he hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door
he leans against the door panting his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat
suddenly with a whir of motors the giant multi armed c
scanner behind him comes to life its lights glowing and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him
ethan yells runs across the room climbs on a gurney rips a metal grill off the wall and dives into the air conditioning duct
ethan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him
lucy is showing off the controls of her bed
the door opens
lucy jimmy and linda look with amazement at whats outside in the corridor
a delivery boy enters with a spectacular floral arrangement
where you want this
over by the window
it must be from my sister
give him a tip jimmy
jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy
suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air conditioning duct
everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm
but lindas x ray vision lets her alone recognize ethan
gosh what do you suppose
well lucy its nice to see youre feeling better
nice to meet you jimmy
youre not gonna stay for the ice cream
i have to get back
im having dinner with the danvers
youre getting real tight with them
youre gonna be a straight a student just kidding thanks for coming
her phone rings and she picks it up
when are you gonna come see me
linda walks out of lucys room and quickly down the corridor
jimmy hurries to catch up with her
can i give you a lift
oh no thanks
its no trouble
id like to ask you some more questions
lindas heart sinks as she realises she doesnt know how to get rid of him politely
ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof
he turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top bashing it firmly closed with his fist
he straightens up sweat soaked bedraggled haggard and exhausted looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe
he heaves a sigh of relief and turns to see selena standing behind him her silk cape billowing in the breeze
ethan takes a beat to make sure hes not hallucinating then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the tall brick smokestack from the hospitals incinerator
he starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney
what goes up must come down
jimmy opens the door of his car for linda
its parked in the ambulance zone right behind selenas cadillac
i probably wouldve got a ticket without this press pass on the windshield
does clark get many tickets
linda pauses looking up at the sky
distractedly i wouldnt know
up in the sky
jimmy follows the direction of her gaze
ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney his robe fluttering in the wind
an escaped wacko
what a picture
jimmy opens the trunk of his car takes out his camera bag removes his nikon and starts fumbling around trying to change his mm lens for a telephoto
linda watches ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face
come down from there you foo
although she is forty feet below him ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear
continuing before you get blown off and kill yourself
ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start misses his footing and nearly falls off the ladder
jimmy gasps with anguish as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens dropping lens caps film boxes and filters all over the place
someones chasing him
say you think thats the same guy who was in the accident with lucy
the scoop of the year
he starts shooting film
his motor drive whirrs
itll be dark soon
come down while youve got the chance
ethan reaches the top of the chimney
he climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney
shell come for me
like she did the last time
he starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance
shes not coming for you
i killed her
ethan is staggered by this news
he reacts as though he had been punched in the gut
i dont believe you
its not true
shes alive somewhere
my love he falls off the chimney and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork
he hangs there by one hand
jimmy runs out of film
he frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one while ethan dangles
there goes my pulitzer prize
linda steps around to the other side of his car
bianca is staring up at the chimney from the drivers seat of the cadillac
she doesnt see linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below
a red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain
the iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as supergirl flies skyward toward the roof
ethans grip fails and he falls
supergirl appears snatches ethan in mid air and flies off with him into the clouds above
selena reacts with relief then realizing who has saved him her face clouds with resentment
jimmy olsens magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs
he turns to bianca who is looking up in the sky from beside the cadillac
hey lady did you see that
bianca gives him a glance of contempt
the girl dressed like superman caught that guy in mid air
maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined
supergirl carries ethan beside her her arm tight around his upper chest his arm over her shoulders
they are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset
he looks at her ecstatically his eyes drunk with love
she didnt kill you
that woman whos after me
she hates you
because she knows i love you
you love me
i feel ive always loved you all my life
ill die if i cant spend the rest of my life just looking at you holding you in my arms
we have to have a long talk about all this
i know just the place
hang a left at the amalgamated tower
selena comes striding out of the hospital scowling
jimmy olsen notices her and senses her aura of power
he drops his useless nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera
im not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me
shrewdly is it her thats bothering you or your gardener
selena looks at bianca with wounded dignity
i use men but im not addicted to them
i can quit whenever i want
she gets in the back seat of the car just as jimmy olsen snaps a photo of her with a polaroid
selena slams the car door and bianca drives off
jimmy examines the instant photo he just took
his eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image
the park is deserted in darkness
one by one the lights come on outlining a l the structures in jewel like fairyland colours
it looks strangely familiar
on some deep level there is a resemblance to argo city
the camera pans over to reveal ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes turning on the lights
supergirl stands beside him
this is my favourite place in the city
are you sure its all right for us to be here
they dont care theyre tearing it down for a shopping centre
he flips the last switch which starts the ferris wheel revolving slowly like a great spiral galaxy in space
soft music plays
it reminds me of home
where supermans from
it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once but we moved it to inner space
im sorry i dont understand
its not important
the important thing is im here to find something and i think you can he p me
come on lets ride
they walk to the slowly revolving ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars
i used to work here summers when i was a kid
ethan tell me more about this woman whos after you
lets talk about us not her
tell me where i can find her
i dont want you to go near her
shes bad news
ethan puts his arm around her shoulders casually no big deal
but be reasonable
if i dont do something to stop her shell try again
and maybe hurt you
ill be safe with you
we can stay together the rest of our lives
we cant do that
were from different worlds
just give me a chance to show how much i love you
love changes everything
love makes everything possib e
selena gets out of her cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate
a big sign says keep out
future site of funfair mall shopping plaza
she mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away the locks click open and the gate glides noiselessly ajar
se ena strides in imperiously
all this talk about love its silly
you dont like me
you hate me
there is such a look of tragedy on ethans face that supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes
of course i dont hate you
i dont hate anyone
what do you feel about me
i dont know
this is all so sudden
be ow them in the shadows of the spine snapper ride
theres one sure way to find out how you feel
let me kiss you
youre not afraid are you
of course not but
there are things we dont understand
if we wait until we understand everything well be dead
you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school
i guess one is all right
she closes her eyes parts her lips and leans forward
is this how
their lips meet
what a touching scene
her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you
ethan and supergirl pull apart
the ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again
selena is standing beside them
supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her
who are you
i am selena
give him to me
or youll both be sorry
i dont scare that easily
selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box
all right miss know it all
if i cant have him nobody can
she holds the gargoyle box out toward the ferris wheel
coffer of shadow show your power
ethan yells as his gondola falls off the ferris wheel and down onto the tent which covers the dodgem cars
he falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below
the wooden gondola shatters on impact
ethan sits up dazed by the fall and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him
ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees
another hideously painted car attacks him and another and another
he dodges and scuttles around desperately
finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars
supergirl reaches out to seize selena
but selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable glowing shield of force
supergirl tries to push through the shield in vain
supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the haunted house
at super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at selena
selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away ducking and dodging the rain of javelins
she turns too quickly and the gargoyle box slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel
selena moans with despair and pauses reluctant to leave without the box
this is the opportunity supergirl needs
the fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around selena effectively imprisoning her
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while
a cheap trick
cheap but effective
ethan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it
suddenly his car is lifted up carried through a hole in the tent roof and off into the night sky
he looks under the car
there she is carrying him to safety
she smiles reassuringly
selena is trapped inside the ring of posts fumbling in her bag
one by one she takes out dried herbs feathers dusts and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word
no thats not it
sis o reb
ka ma hoochie
bianca appears out of the shadows
selena looks up embarrassed
sure glad you didnt let make a monkey of you
shut up and get me a hacksaw
bianca pauses uncertainly
why dont you use the coffer of shadow
evasively i dont feel like it right now
she didnt take it from you did she
that little girl
now go on get me some tools
theres no need
i learned the craft from my grandmother
bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it
sycoraka fkah skoo
the bars fall down like boiled spaghetti
selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity
now bring the car
we must call a meeting of the seven
bianca hurries off toward the parking lot
selena watches her until she turns the corner of the haunted house
then selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the gargoyle box
there you are
come to mama
she takes out the box s ips it inside her cloak and stands up
she casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat and strides off after bianca
supergirl lands ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful deserted tropical beach
palm trees wave over a white sand beach
the blue ca m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains
gaily coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda
ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w th awe at the beautiful scene
i thought id show you one of my favourite places
we could be very happy here
but i have to go back
i brought you here so youd be safe
you cant just abandon me
his words strike a sensitive nerve in her
ill stay for a while
ethan is filled with enthusiasm
iii build a house right over there with a veranda looking out to sea
and ill plant a garden
papayas pineapples bananas mangoes anythingll grow here
and iii fish in the lagoon and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe and ethan when i said a while i meant a couple of hours
ethans face falls
he looks at her beseechingly
well maybe a little longer than that
she smiles and takes his hand
together they walk along the beach
rolls royces limos and maserattis parked in the driveway
it looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club
a helicopter lands on the front lawn
the elderly man from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane
behind him the helicopter takes off again
selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily
the president was giving a speech
i couldnt just walk out
youre more afraid of the president than me
no of course not
waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party
bianca is talking to erica a red haired female dwarf
a proud barefoot american indian woman in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular young black man in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry
nigel is sulking in the bar his face covered with tannisroot ointment
selena enters with the elderly man in the banker pinstripe
they all form a circle in the centre of the room
let us begin
i invoke the rule of seven
the circle is complete
you better have a pretty good explanation for this selena
we are in great danger
a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft
but superman has been away
it is not superman i speak of but his cousin kara
she knows we exist
then she must be destroyed
how did she find out about us
that is unimportant
now that she knows she will become curious and learn more
when she learns we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries of persecution she will try to stop us
we must destroy her first
but how can we destroy her
by the rite of ultimate power
one person must volunteer to take on the combined power of us all
nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at selena
you want to take our power for yourself
selena reacts calmly speaking in low modulated tones as if to an overstimulated child
nige you know the one who takes on ultimate power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit
selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it
inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly
continuing which of you is willing to make that sacrifice
you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power
maybe youd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself nigel
why get rid of her at al
youve used the coffer of shadow too much
it is beginning to rule your heart
nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror
then bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it
bianca stands challenging nigel daring him to try again
selena looks at the gargoyle shaped coffer of shadow sitting beside her hearth
it too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital
selena wonders for a beat if maybe nigel is right
can the shadow be ruling her
let us vote
they all draw their sacred white handled knives out of concealment in their clothing
nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward
then one by one the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward
they all look at nigel
his shoulders sag with dejection
i invoke the rule of seven
do you agree
nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence
i have no choice
his knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward
everyone joins hands in the circle
a fire springs to life on the hearth
someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue
slowly the heavy opulent living room begins to change the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks the
walls start to melt away
outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon
the house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins
the smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward
the only thing remaining of selenas house is the hearth and the coffer of shadow
selena stands up and walks out of the centre of the circle toward the coffer
she opens the lid
she pulls the glass vial off the golden chain around her neck and drops it into the coffer
ethan wanders along the beach with supergirl holding hands
she stops to pick up a seashell
ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache moans and collapses on the sand
supergirl kneels beside him
ethan what is wrong
ethan opens his eyes and looks at her
he speaks in a voice of bleak despair
she said it wouldnt last
what wouldnt last
whats the matter with you
ethan sits up wincing like someone with a bad hangover
i dont love you any more
just like that
like turning off a light
he struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily
i feel awful
all that romantic garbage
all that mushy talk
he lurches off into the undergrowth toward the interior of the island
she plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him
where are you going
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said
i sort of like what you said
that makes it worse
but i dont understand
he stops and stares at her for a moment
of course you dont
were from two different worlds remember
he stalks off into the jungle leaving her behind hurt and bewildered
a barbaric ritual
selenas companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums
the floor is covered with a red mist
in the middle of a column of fire a figure like selena seems to float
the ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti ness
selena steps forth from the column of fire
she is clothed in a shimmering garment white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence
the six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe
selena seems to glow with an inner radiance
she laughs and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in midvale
in her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty she seems too large too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl
what do you mean we
she turns on the kneeling six
they cringe from her
selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear
ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water
supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment
then she comes and sits down beside him
are you still mad at me
im not mad at you
it seemed that way to me
i know i was acting funny im sorry
i miss it
what i had before
whats not there now
its like i woke up and found part of me wasnt there any more something that made me feel really alive and aware of things
it was like for the first time in my life everything fitted together perfectly you and me and the world around us like we were a wonderful song
he falls silent and tosses a few pebbles into the stream
the guitars are out of tune and the words dont make sense and somebody unplugged the mike
i don it know much about these things but maybe if you had that feeling once
it can come back
he turns to her hopefully
you think so
i dont see why not
but what if it wasnt real
feelings are real
once youve had them theyre yours forever
ethans face lights up
the future begins to exist for him again
hey listen when all this blows over maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other
and maybe something might
what do you think
are you asking me for a date
youre a good looking girl
and im available
arent you forgetting about selena
shell forget about us eventually
in the polished surface of her mirror selena makes a scene appear ethan and supergirl on the tropical island
image theres something very dangerous about her
image i know what it is
she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle
inside theres a silvery ring
supergirl becomes very excited
thats the power source that was lost from argo city
thats what i came to find
where does she live
in this big old house on orchard avenue but you better stay away from there
i can see through walls
i could surprise her
the only thing i cant see through is lead thats why i didnt see the power source at the amusement park
she stands up
dont leave me
youll be safe here
ill come back as soon as i have the power source
he stands up and takes her hand
before you go
just one kiss
for old times sake
and you can see how you feel about me right
she closes her eyes and parts her lips
slowly their lips come together and touch
then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking
but before either one of them can go one step further ethan disappears with a flash of blinding white light
a cloud darkens the sun and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale force winds
selenas laughter can be heard from somewhere far away
supergirl flies into the air
supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed searching for ethan and selena
she hovers like an eagle for a moment then speeds straight upwards
supergirl flies back to north america faster than she has ever flown before
supergirl zeros in on selenas house like an exocet
supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door ready for anything but what she finds the front door is ajar
she pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges
she walks slowly inside
supergirl looks around
the house seems deserted and drastically neglected
cobwebs hang over everything
the dust has the thickness of a hundred years
moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries
rats cavort along the baseboards
bats sleep in the chandeliers
in the living room supergirl finds bianca crouched in a corner gibbering mindlessly
bianca too has changed she is dressed in rags and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles
when she sees supergirl she cries with fright
hey take it easy
i wont hurt you
it was her coming back
but i thought
maybe changed her mind
nigel warned us
wouldnt listen to him
what are you talking about
dont want to know
dont go near her
i have to find her
supergirl looks into biancas eyes with her calm heroic gaze and bianca comes somewhat to her senses
bianca points to the adjoining bar
supergirl walks over warily and sees five golden cages suspended among the bottles
nigel and the four remaining members of the circle are imprisoned in them shrunken but alive
nige is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel
he sees her and calls out
shes waiting for you
on taliesen mountain
stop her before its too late
supergirl gets a look of determination on her face
she turns and flies out through the french doors and heads straight up into the air
ethan is in a dark shadowy place bound to a stake with stout cords
sticks of wood are piled all around his feet
selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power
she looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before
she offers him a glass of water to drink but he turns his head away violently
im wise to your tricks lady
i could force you
if that worked you wouldve done it already
no you want me to drink it of my own free will
well let me tell you sweetheart itll be a cold day in hell before i fall for that one again
go on talk big
ill soon have you purring like a kitten
she puts the glass of water in a basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above
there is a straw in the glass at such an angle that ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible
youve been without water for a whole day
lets see how thirsty you get in a week
you vicious careful dont make me angry
i start fires when im angry
she glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away
the camera follows her revealing that she has been talking to ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room
her new house is enormous
where before she lived in a mansion now she dwells in a palace
the fireplace is seven feet high the living room floor is wide as a football field and
the french windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the north transept of chartres cathedral
selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butlers pantry each now the size of a basketball court
back in the fireplace ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby
he pokes the straw with his forehead
the glass swings slightly
the glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm
he gauges the swing of the glass and at the precise moment grabs for it with his mouth
he catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done
he bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth
the glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash leaving ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his
he leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders
a droplet of blood falls into his hand
he drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it
he grins and sighs with relief
then spits to clear his mouth
slowly he saws
at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand
one by one the strands part
ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps
he quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace
he looks around the mammoth room
the coast is clear
he spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth and dashes out of the doors to the garden
ethan sees a green plastic garden hose which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas
ethan remembers that he is very thirsty
he picks up the hose rinses out his mouth hurriedly and then takes long desperate gulps of the water
behind him he hears selenas laughter
he drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig
the same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time
the plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours
at the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding selena
she approaches him seductively fully confident of her power
as she comes nearer the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos
selena speaks and her voice is a close miked throaty purr
i told you id win
ethan is held by the spell of her magic
and yet there is part of him that still resists
you can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him and then give in as she comes closer and i touches him
with her hand
a zap of energy passes between them at her touch
he embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss
he is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply
she rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure
supergirl flies over the rockies toward selenas house
supergirl flies over selenas new house
for the first time we can see the enormousness of it a grotesque towering monstrosity that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape
supergirl lands and walks toward the towering french doors of the living room
but something distracts her
she turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right
supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants
she walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool
in the bottom of the shallow pool she sees ethan securely bound
his eyes stare wildly
dead or drowning
she leaps into the shallow pool and sinks over her head
a polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly
it is a door to the phantom zone
supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field looking out in despair
ethan is not there with her
his image has disappeared
the real flesh and blood ethan appears with selena from behind the strangler fig
they look in at supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the phantom zone
selena laughs at her but ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall
selena notices ethans wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him
enjoy your prison supergirl
supergirl calls out to ethan her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field
supergirl is seen in reverse beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison
dont let her do this
beyond the threshold of the zone selena in her conservatory kisses ethan with fierce lust
he returns her emotion forgetting all about supergirl
it isnt true
the image of selena and ethan begins to recede getting smaller and smaller until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness
the flat two dimensional polygon that is supergirls prison whirls away through space
behind the transparent surface we can see supergirls face stained with tears
another kind of reality
unlike anything we have ever seen
the crystal prison lands on the ground of the phantom zone and shatters
supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around
the landscape is utterly strange and alien with a feel of stark oppressive sterility
as far as the eye can see there is no sign of life
supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly
she hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat footedly on the sand
with a shock she realises she cant fly
she hops a few more times with no more success
she picks up a small rock from the ground
she tries to crush it in her hand
angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can
instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away
she scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand
she takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away
she is barely able to disturb a few grains
she drops the sand and sits down on a rock forlorn and dejected
suddenly she hears aluras voice very faint and coming from a long distance away
kara where are you
i can hardly hear you
we were so worried
you disappeared from the scanners
im lost mother
in some awful place
i cant fly anymore
and im weak
kara you must not give up
we must retrieve the power source
the city is dying
then send someone else
the dimension barrier is stronger
we no longer have the power to push through
but mother im lost
you must try
the rest of her sentence fades out and is lost
mother i tried
i really tried
kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly
the delegate from uritania is going on in esperanto denouncing the latest outrage against his peace loving country
a few bored delegates of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones
the dign fied president of the general assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate
with a flash of light and a chok ng cloud of sulfur fumes selena appears beside the podium
she is in her shimmering white robe
the dozing delegates wake up with amazement
the uritanian delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone
inside the translators booth the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window
the eight translators stop translating and stare at the scene below
selena is about to speak in the microphone when two security gquards attempt to step onto the podium
selena reaches out toward them
a field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts
the delegates gasp at this act of magical violence
nations of the world
i bring you tidings of a new age
the president of the general assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel
selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance
instantly the presidents gavel turns into a live eel
the president drops it with horror
selena continues her speech
i bring you a return to the ancient true worship of nature our sovereign queen and mother
and i bring you myself as her representative here on earth
the uritanian suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on selenas shoulder
a whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates
the delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats
selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar
from this moment forth all science religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden
and in their place i will teach the one true way of our ancient grandmothers
the president of the general assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to interrupt selena
you are talking about the end of civilisation as we know it
and its about time too
i do not know who you are or what evil force you represent but it will take more than a few threats from you to make mankind turn back the
clock and abandon thousands of years of progress
selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks
he finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates
i dont need threats to destroy civilisation
i have something better
she snaps her fingers in the air
immediately a rain of money begins to fall all over the general assembly
paper money and coins of all nations
selena looks at her work with pleasure
then she disappears in a flash of light
the delegates blink with astonishment
the only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air and the money
one delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets
suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing
the only exception is the delegate from the united kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity and looks about with mild disapproval
supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the phantom zone
we have never seen her like this before sweating her hair unkempt streaks of dirt and grit on her face exhausted and full of despair
she stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope banging her head on a rock
she sits there a big rip in her uniform rubbing her bruised forehead
it is hard to imagine her any worse off
she hears a sound vaguely familiar
she looks around for its source
she follows the sound crawling slowly along the base of the ridge
the sound gets louder and as she approaches
it is a sound of celestial spiritual beauty the music of the spheres
suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the phantom zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine
the harsh monochromatic sterility of the phantom zone gives way to a riot of bright colours
a dome like building protrudes from the ground
all around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of argo city
in the clothing of argo city is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand
he turns and catches sight of supergirl
it is zaltar
zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to supergirl
he kneels beside her on the sandy ground
is it you
she is obviously exhausted
zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink
she drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid and feels strength returning to her body
what is this place
this is the phantom zone
but why did you come here from argo city
i was on earth
you crossed the dimension barrier
i went there to find the lost power source
shouldntve done that
but the person who has it
tricked me and sent me to the phantom zone
its dangerous to use a power source on earth
it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces i know
well nothing we can do about it
come into my house
you can stay with me until i build you your own place
i expect you wont want to mix with the others not our type of people
he helps her to her feet and over to his house a sort of argonian gothic cathedral half buried in the sand
the curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of zaltars work on argo city
zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right
a few hundred parasangs that way
i avoid them
and you should too
zaltar leads supergirl past the singing sculptures
she smiles as she passes them and remembers his tree in argo city
mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam
just feels a little like a tiny bit of argo city
cant seem to get away from that style
must try something new
he helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room
in the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools models and unfinished projects
did everything just right
nobody telling you to change this move that around
thats the secret of happiness
are you happy zaltar
what kind of a question is that
of course i am
i do whatever i want
all the time
but what about other people
dont you miss them
they have reached the ground floor
zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall
he squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction
i look at them all the time
every planet in the galaxy
its quite boring
here rub some of this onto that bruise
he carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp
you look at them
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere
if you have the right tools
zaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor
he passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a window into another world showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a
water buffalo in a rice paddy
there you see
what could be more boring than that
he waves his hand and the image disappears
could i see the place i just came from
zaltar sighs with great martyrdom and starts to fiddle with his controls
itll only make you sad
he shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image
this goes closer
this moves it around
and this begins
he gestures with his hand and the window opens again
supergirl zooms the image in as fast as she can trembling with desperate urgency
the image on the table dissolves from high above a city down to the financial district
bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large imposing banks
passersby ignore the bonanza and trudge dejectedly on
chaos and pandemonium on the floor
not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see
brokers are trying to strangle one another
the crunch of breaking knuckles
people are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money
the store manager shakes his head and sends them away
the only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm a little old lady carrying a rembrandt in a nice gold frame
a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock
the camera zooms down and dissolves through the roof to a mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to selenas reception room
generals in uniform diplomats wearing their medals pinned on their formal suits bankers in pin stripes and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths
a secretary opens the door to the reception room and the dignitaries all surge forward
no more audiences today
all of you
through the open door selena can be glimpsed sitting
on her throne like chair with ethan kneeling at her feet resting his head in her lap like a pet animal
the secretary closes the doors leaving ethan and selena alone
she strokes his head
outside crowds can be heard chanting her name selena
they want me
doesnt it make you proud
selena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony
ethan follows her sullenly
they walk out onto the balcony
the crowds scream her name
she waves smiling
ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face
smile lunk head
youre not a gardener any more youre prince ethan now
ethan lifts his hand and waves half heartedly
the crowd is enormous held back behind police barricades
guards in the special livery of selenas service hold back the surging tide of humanity people
praying chanting walking on their knees cripples on crutches the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives
and in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers
huge banners display selenas portrait
images of her are everywhere
supergirl reels with shock at the scene that horrible woman
wouldnt listen to me
knew it would make you sad
he starts to gesture the image away but she puts her hand on his arm stopping him
i have to see this
the roadside complex where lucys traffic accident occurred
the hamburger place is boarded up
the area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street
all of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of selena
the only writing is in mystic symbols
a lone figure walks furtively along the street
it is lucy lane her face disguised with dark glasses
she goes to the rear of the abandoned hamburger place and knocks four times
the door opens quickly and she ducks inside
the restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop
a few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills
freshly printed pages are hung on clothes lines so the ink can dry
the truth about selena is the headline over jimmys photo of her getting into the cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind
lucy crosses to jimmy olsen who is tying up bundles of handbills
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan
the danvers have been arrested
how do you know
i saw them dragged out of the administration building
did anybody notice you
i cant help it if men notice me
we could be executed for treason
she kisses him on the nose
nobody saw me
jimmy gives her another bundle of handbills
helmeted guards in the livery of selenas service kick down the door
and rush in weapons drawn
they smash up the print shop and arrest everybody
jimmy and lucy are handcuffed and dragged away
the danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark enormous cavern
jimmy and lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells
i sure wish superman was around
he wouldnt let any of this go on
not for one minute
i wish theyd tell us what theyre going to do with us
i heard stories
i dont think you wanna know
there is the clank of an iron door and ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in selenas livery
he walks past the cells glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside
lucy calls out as he passes
we were in a disaster together
oh yeah the girl in the hospital on the other stretcher
say do you swing any weight around here
can you get us out
its all a misunderstanding
we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place
ill mention it upstairs
he turns to go but jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve
the blonde girl who saved your life where is she now
buried memories rise to the surface of his mind bringing pain
no one will ever see her again
supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily decisively
the window of the zone closes and the image of ethan disappears
she crosses to zaltar who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders
zaltar please help me
of course my dear
what can i do
help me to get back to earth
where my friends are
they need me
zaltar looks pained and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers
theres no way out of the zone
no ones ever escaped
thats why they send the criminals here
if theres a way in there must be a way out
no thats not true theres well
no he suddenly has an idea vaguely forming at the back of his drink sodden brain
he toys with it while supergirl leans forward eagerly waiting
he changes his mind several times about whether its possible or not each time changing his facial expression
supergirl has the feeling shes watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces
there is a way
i knew it
but its impossible
no it wouldnt work you couldnt its too if it didnt work youd be swept into a singularity no youd never make it
forget i mentioned it
supergirls heart sinks
she rocks back clutching her knees trying not to show her sadness
i could do it
she is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again
then teach me how
no its no good you cant practice you only get one go
a thing like that
sure you dont want a sip of this
its delicious i think
he takes another sip of his drink
tell me how
to do it
if you could do it i can
he looks at her shrewdly appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance
takes a long time you know learning the wand
just begun to understand it myse f
give things a kind of life can also take away life works backwards too
besides i cant let you take my wand
only have the one what would i do
id be helpless
its out of the question
then come with me
leave the zone
what would i do on earth
you could do anything
you could sculpt mountain ranges
draw with rainbows
youd have superpowers
got you in a lot of trouble didnt they
i have to get back to earth
my friends are in trouble
and unless i bring back the power source argo city will die
he looks at her kneeling beside his couch tears streaming down her cheeks pleading with him
oh all right
he stands up takes his matterwand and heads for the stairs up to the surface
supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted
she runs after him up the stairs
youre going to take me back
going to try
didnt say i could
they emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone
zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings then strikes out with long energetic strides
supergirl hurries to keep up with him
i heard my mother ask you once how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty
she was wrong zaltar you have a generous heart
not doing this for you
just sick of this place thats all
wretched singing sculptures always yowling at you
supergirl scampers along beside him smiling
zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead
ethan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging lucy lane and jimmy olsen in chains
lucy calls out to him
hey i thought you were gonna mention us upstairs
bitterly well thanks a pile fella
ethan watches them dragged away
he has a puzzled expression on his face
selena is staring into her magic mirror
her face is white with fear
whats going on
selena snaps irritably at him
i dont know
you seem afraid
youre a regular einstein arent you
the truth dawns on him supergirl
selena doesnt answer but looks back at the mirror
ethan moves to her side and watches with her the image of the phantom zone
zaltar leads the way firming their path with the matterwand and then hauling himself and supergirl forward over an upward sloping undulating surface
behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff constantly sweeping backwards and downwards away from their goal
selena looks up and realises ethan is behind her looking intently at the image
quit staring so hard
youll strain your eyes
she puts her hand on his cheek
he turns away from the image of supergirl and looks deep in selenas eyes
youre not going to hurt her are you
selena is furious
her eyes get that dangerous look
you cant put her out of your mind is that it
i guess i cant
im ready for her
ill show you
selena walks out the french doors followed by the dazed ethan
danvers lucy lane and jimmy olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory
the ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are gigantic golden serpents their tails around an overhead beam and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of
a fifth cage hangs there empty
the water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow
selena shows the arrangements to ethan
unless supergirl agrees to go away forever the serpents will drop them one by one
selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high melodious note
the fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool
the empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes
ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples
why the empty cage
that one was for you
but i thought id wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here
id hate to lose you ethan
selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder
ethan cries out with terror
selena looks down at what he sees
behind selena distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface is a giant monstrous shadow being its arms outstretched almost enveloping her but invisible except in reflections
selena steps away from the pool shaken by the sight
you dont get this far without paying
a certain price
she turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory followed by ethan
if only i hadnt made that speech denouncing her
im not afraid to die
im proud of you
she stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely
lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their
jimmy is looking at her
shyly ive been in love with you for years
remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom
and put your fingerprints on my lens
i was trying desperately to get youre attention
you mean we couldve been
you know what
all this time
you bet your ass
why didnt you tell me
youre supposed to guess
she reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely like the danvers
zaltar is continuing his climb but the way is getting steeper and he is tired and short of breath
why are you stopping
one thing you musnt do
he continues forward and upward firming their path with the matterwand
the wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the phantom zone
because of the inherent curvature of the phantom zone vortex they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now
supergirl is close beside zaltar helping him along not merely following as she had before
the throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed
zaltar stumbles and drops the matterwand
the vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards down to where they have just climbed from
supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past
but now she is being swept backwards
supergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her
she stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion
thats the way
but now zaltar is being swept backwards toward her
she points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide
you can use the wand
better than when i was a child
she hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress
i remember you then
cute thing you were
like your mother
selena stands watching the image of zaltar and supergirl in her mirror
beside her on the floor is the coffer of shadow now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin
it pulses and glows with inner light
the lid of the coffer of shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out
flaming spheres of ball lightning begin to whizz past zaltar and supergirl
zaltar is startled and he stops his forward progress
never saw anything like that
yes mustnt stop
grimly its selena
im getting so i can recognise her work
another flaming sphere whizzes toward them
it hits zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path
he starts to roll backwards down the vortex
use the wand
he is being swept faster and
faster away from her receding like the image of ethan when she was trapped in the zone
zaltar throws the wand to her and then is swept away out of sight downward to his death
he calls out after he disappears
voice over goodbye
she begins to be swept backwards but she uses the wand and stops her slide
gripping the wand fiercely she starts to forge ahead
all the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that selena sends down the vortex
youre not going to win selena
i wont let you
suddenly supergirl enters another area of the vortex
she begins to move forward upward without clawing her way
she accelerates moving faster and faster
supergirl lands in a deserted sunny meadow
she collapses sobbing on the grass
the matterwand lies beside her
you never had a selfish heart
she looks up at the sun shining down serenely bathing the earth in its life giving rays and returning her superpowers to her
wherever you are zaltar thank you
she stands up and flexes her muscles
she no longer looks tired or disheveled
her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight
she picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air flying faster than a speeding bullet
supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof
supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the french doors
ethan and selena are standing against the opposite wall next to the veiled mirror
youve had your fun selena the game is over
she has hostages
and two of your little friends
its just one more crime youll have to pay for
ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words out there
selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck
supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the french doors
jimmy olsens cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns
hey what gives
the blast of superbreath blows the cages of lucy and the danvers away from the pool as well
the serpents loose their grip arid the danvers and lucy land beside jimmy in the fern bank
selena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme
all right supergirl
the games not over till the last cards dealt
selena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen coffer of shadow sitting beside her on the floor
the omegahedron inside spins
all the furniture in the room suddenly launches itself at supergirl
huge oak refectory tables alabaster thrones marble urns iron firegrates shie ds and armour bronze statuary and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her
ethan stands in the corner ducking the stray fragments that come his way
youve run out of things to throw selena
selena points her hand at supergirl with a gesture of attack
the coffer of shadow emits a dense black mist that darkens the room
a giant invisible hand seizes supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles
supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack
its her shadow self
her dark side
how do i fight it
turn it against her
supergirl raises the wand and applies it to her own body
there is a flash of blinding light and supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of selena as she was at the fairgrounds
there are now two selenas in the room the real one beside the coffer of shadow and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar
the real selena is first astonished and then furious
power of shadow kill her
the second selena calls out to the shadow self in selenas own unmistakable voice
i am your mistress
do not harm me
dont listen to her
you are my shadow you must obey me
the real selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesnt notice ethan creeping along the wall toward the coffer of shadow
ethan lunges for the shining omegahedron inside and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal
ethan rolls over and over on the floor away from selena clutching the shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a
fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock
ive got it
the power source
the real se ena cries out with despair
and then the shadow attacks her
the real selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her
ethan hands the power source to the second selena in the bar
ill take this back to argo city
it is you then really
without a word the second selena kisses him on the lips
its you all right
ill make it easy for you
she again applies the wand to her own body
there is a flash of light and once more supergirl stands before him clutching both the power source and the wand
i couldnt help what i did before
she drugged me
i never doubted you for a moment
supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the real selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness
supergirl touches the shadow with her wand
there is a cosmic musical chord and the shadow is destroyed it falls to the floor in a rain of hard dark cinders
the real selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow
she looks at herself in the mirror
she is changed into the softer more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the omegahedron
there is no more evil shadow looming behind her in the mirror reflection
she turns to supergirl and ethan
i can never thank you enough
selena points to the glittering omegahedron supergirl holds
ever since i found that thing ive been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare
you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time
your nightmares are over
im taking this back to argo city where it wont be misused
to ethan you could come too
it might be safer for you
i have friends in the resistance
theyll vouch for me
i figure i might get a million bucks for my memoirs
ill come back as soon as i can
what about me
theyll make hash out of me around here
supergirl and ethan exchange a glance
selenas innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen
theyll string her up
do you want to come to argo city
whats it like
its the most beautiful place in the universe
supergirl holds out the matterwand to selena
grab hold of this
it forms a force field for the journey through inner space
selena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the french doors
supergirl and selena fly through the prison
supergirl melts open the locks with beams of heat vision
the prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing
all the people of midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street
statues banners mystic symbols giant tarot cards old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze
people are smiling dancing holding hands drinking the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring
selena and supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun
where is inner space
but water is always the door
they plunge down into the suns reflection on the sea surface
supergirl and selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space
supergirl is tired but triumphant
the omegahedron glows brightly in her hand
selena looks around her with awe and wonder
will they be angry with me for stealing the power source
theyll be grateful
if you hadnt found it it would still be lost
look up ahead
yes i see it
shining like a jewel
