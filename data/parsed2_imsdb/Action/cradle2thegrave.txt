end of the day
an armored truck moves through the city of los angeles
the armored truck pulls up
an armored truck guard emerges from the back with a satchel and heads inside
a large foyer
security station and elevators
party sounds can be heard from a second floor balcony
douglas is the security guard manning the station
seeing the armored car guard entering he picks up the phone and dials
into phone last deliverys finally here
the armored truck guard approaches the security station
as he and douglas exchange paperwork the armored truck guard references the sounds from upstairs party
introducing a new line of jewelry
wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring
told her to spend a little time with the family jewels first
an elevator opens
a second security guards inside
handing over the satchel and heading out keep it real
we see the security guard with the satchel use a key card to gain elevator access to the lower floors
as the elevator doors slide closed
an exclusive showroom
display tables empty
at one end of the room the elevator
at the other end the open door to a walk in vault
the elevator pings and the doors open
the guard emerges with the cart
pushes it across the room to the outside of the vault
a man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading the cart into the vault
a train arrives
people jostle on and off
one man remains on the platform
carrying a large leather bag
a cylinder hanging by a strap over his shoulder
the train doors begin to close
a fist inserts itself between the doors
they re open and a man steps onto the platform
fait joins miles
they watch the train pull out
they check to make sure the stations empty
then jump off the platform into the tunnel and disappear
the man in the suit has finished unloading the cart
he closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the door securing the vault
fait and miles run down the dark tunnel staying close to the wall
falls toward the deadly high voltage third rail
out of nowhere faits hand grabs miles jacket
just before he hits
inches from the rail
fait pulls him back up and away from the danger
keep it tight
miles nods again and they set off
sounds of the party continue from upstairs
at the security station the guard douglas looks up from a magazine and scans the security monitors
depicting the empty vault empty vault anteroom various empty store areas and the elevator in which we see the man in the suit riding up
douglas settles back in with his magazine
fait and miles reach an access door tagged with paint
fait starts to open it
suddenly the tunnel is filled with the roar of an approaching train
fait and miles leap to the wall
press their backs against it as tightly as they can
the train whooms past inches from their faces
when its gone miles sighs with relief
fait cracks the access door
fait moves quickly miles following
fait makes fast lefts and rights following more spray paint
they branch off into a small dirt floored space deep in the sub foundation of a building
overhead is a flat ceiling
on the ceiling his flashlight finds a spray painted circle
without a word miles begins assembling equipment
fait pulls out a cell phone
a man duncan su sits in a rental thunderbird
sus focused intense listening to a fancy walkman through headphones
we hear what he hears
only theres no music just static
suddenly on sus headphones a phone rings
su grows even more alert
we hear a man with a french accent answer the phone
were in position
the stones are there
not for long
su didnt like what he just heard
curses in chinese
and takes off
perched on the side of a cliff above the pacific next to the park
the top floor is at street level
su easily gains access to the roof of the building
he moves to an exact position just at the ocean side edge
its an eight story drop
su faces in
hops backward off the roof
falling feet first through the air su momentarily grabs onto an eight floor balcony rail slowing his descent then lets go
momentarily grabs a seventh floor rail and lets go
grabs a sixth floor rail
hangs on this time
vaults lightly onto the balcony
a large free standing fish tank bubbles away
nearby christophe is packing to leave town
where are the stones
sees su standing behind him
french accent who the fuck are you
the chinese boxing version of a bitch slap
whos getting them for you
much more violent than a bitch slap
ill tell you
a plasma torch burns through the metal reinforced slab overhead
fait taps miles who turns off the torch
fait hammers at the last layer
a hole appears under the private display table where it cant be seen by the rooms security camera
fait communicates via a high tech transmitting receiving earwig
douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security monitors again
everything a okay
a limo pulls up outside
a uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo moves to the back and opens the door
a very attractive woman in a short tight dress emerges
escorted by the chauffeur the woman daria enters
she approaches the security station
up close in the light darias even more alluring
and knows how to wield it
im here for the reception
douglas scans a list of names
checks off hers
you can go on up
front elevator to the mezzanine
daria turns toward the elevator
then doesnt go
just glances up toward the party suddenly unenthusiastic
i hate these things
dont you hate these things
im just here to do my job
daria looks back at douglas
studies him a moment
liking what she sees
then again you never know who youre going to meet
she shifts her wrap baring cleavage
then leans over the desk
giving douglas an eyeful
ill bet youre a lot more fun than any of those boring people upstairs
douglas is unaffected
just looks at her blankly
i have a job to do
daria doesnt understand why hes not interested in her
then she glimpses douglass magazine lying on the desk
the magazine is genre
males for males
big pecs big penises
daria steps back
well i suppose i should go up and see what theyre selling
daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur tommy
what happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce as daria walks toward tommy she whispers into a hidden mike change of plans
tommy hears it over his earwig
fait and miles have heard it too
into his mike tommy
a look of alarm on tommys face
into his mike uh uh
this isnt a conversation
its an order
tommy knows he has to
then still to tommy her voice again at normal volume why dont you keep my purse
i shouldnt be too long
daria hands tommy her purse
palms the key card from him
then heads toward the elevator as
tommy replaces the sick look on his face
does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station
leans over the desk with a yummy smile on his face
note the following scene is intercut with scenes thru
douglas looks up from his magazine
i hope you dont take offense at this
but i just have such a weakness for a man in uniform
if thats your thing
uniforms definitely my thing
i mean i see a sailor im thinking mmm seafood
im not actually supposed to be
talking on duty
honey this is a flirting
but youre probably just another good looking man wasting it all on women
worlds full of fools
douglas lets him see the genre magazine
i always have a hard nightstick
put away the pictures of those underfed white males and lets broaden your horizons
i like sunsets and puppy dogs and im big in the pants
just hope im not too cute for you
and dont tell me its a color thing hon or ill come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks
im hooked up
another big hot cuddly black love jesus got there first
this day and age sweetie i can appreciate the monogamy
saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe and its okay by me
even if you are just breaking my heart
guess ill just have to come in here someday let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me
i can be pretty rough
dont you get me all excited now
i was just learning to accept my disappointment
tommy sticks out his hand
but you can call me rachel
shaking hands douglas
and man i really gotta get back to what im supposed to be doing okay
he looks away
scans the monitors
everything looks normal
seeing douglas is unaware of whats happening in the vault tommy relaxes
ill leave you alone
but is it okay if i just stand here and stare at the muscles ill be missing for the rest of my life
daria gets in
looks back to make sure tommy has douglass attention
instead of going up daria uses the key card to access the controls to go down
as the doors close daria shoots a wink back at
who furtively flips her the bird
never missing a beat with douglas
fait emerges from the hole beneath the table
on the monitors we see fait in the vault anteroom and daria descending in the elevator as tommy keeps douglass attention diverted
fait holds a small digital camera next to the rooms security camera
mimicking the security cameras slow pan fait films the room
when hes done
we see the panning shot of the room on the monitor
fait pulls up an on screen menu clicks on repeat
whereupon the mini movie begins playing in a continuous loop
as fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera daria steps off the elevator putting her hair up ready to work
on the anteroom monitor we see the monitor on faits camera slide into position making the room look empty as tommy continues diverting douglass attention
fait and daria push the display table aside as miles shoves equipment bags through the hole in the floor
fait opens the leather bag revealing tools a tripod three steel cables and a long rectangular box
miles grabs a high tech drill
begins boring a hole high up on the vault door
fait hands daria the tripod to set up while he uncoils the steel cables attaches them to the wheel on the vault door
then opens the rectangular box and lifts out whats inside
a surface to air missile
fait sets it on the tripod
miles the hole drilled picks up the cylinder hed had slung over his shoulder
pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen
miles injects the nitrogen into the hole
a crackling sound as the super low temp liquid spreads out inside the vault door
the outside frosts over
fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the sam
final checks of the rig
speeding through l
calling on a cell phone
i want to report a crime in progress
fait is the last one down through the hole
he looks at the others
fait pulls out a remote control firing device
he pushes the button
the sam ignites with a blinding flash and streaks across the room
the steel cables instantly snap taut and
rip the vaults wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck out of the door
they felt a rumble
tommy covers earthquake
douglas checks the monitors
everything looks okay
bet you know how to hit a ten on the richter scale
the crew re emerges through the floor to find the vault door in pieces and a hole the size of a sub zero where the sam augured into the opposite
faits already swinging open the vault
this will trigger the silent alarm
we got eleven minutes
miles moves down the rows of drawers using a tool to pop all the locks
fait and daria follow behind quickly pulling out the drawers and emptying jewels into nylon bags
fait empties drawer after drawer
all white diamonds
he opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds
and stops admiring them
i love colored stones
look at this
he holds up a small faceted blue diamond
two point seven million
into the bag
whose shit we stealing anyway
drug dealers and money launderers
works for me
then something else catches his eye
he holds up a small pink diamond on a chain
this i can use
and pockets it
fait moves to her
darias fishing into a nylon bag she found in a drawer
pulls out a handful of
large black diamonds
many more in the bag
he takes the bag
stows it in his jacket
suddenly faits cell phone rings
sus speeding through los angeles streets
your employer betrayed you
the police are on the way
leave the black stones
who is this
you know the ones i mean
dont think ill do that
fait just hangs up
tommy and douglas hear approaching sirens
the sirens stop outside
swat cops the works
all heading for the front door
tommy whispers urgently into his mike
five at the do
then aloud to douglas better move my car
fait grabs a bag of jewels
leave the rest
swat swarms in
tommy exits behind them
tommy gets in
a swat cop signals him
move it out
fait miles and daria run
fait miles and daria blast out the access door
fait kneels feels the track
stopped the trains
then were in the rabbit hole theyre sending down the snakes
then daria comes with me
to miles i got no idea where you should go but you know where to end up
su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives
running like hell
rounds a curve
ahead are the rear lights of a stopped train
approaching the front of another train stopped at a station
fait signals daria to stay put
then pokes his head around the corner of the train
swat cops hustle passengers off the train
one swat guy helps another up to check the top of the train
the second cop jumps back down
fait turns back to daria
signals her to climb up onto the top of the train
then begins climbing after her
as fait reaches the drivers window he sees another swat cop approaching the trains driver checking under seats etc
fait has to climb fast
the swat guy and the driver getting closer
faits leg just clears the window
they dont see it
as fait rolls onto the top of the train
the noise causes the swat cop to react
to the driver hold it
a moment as they stop and the cop looks around
the cop checks the drivers compartment
radios trains clear
the cop exits
the driver enters his compartment
another swat cop stands outside the drivers window
okay to go
just hang tight
during which just above them
fait and daria lie very still
fait winks at her trying to relax her
darias still tense
he raises his eyebrows slightly
shifts his gaze down
she doesnt get it
finally follows his gaze
sees her position is giving him a full view of her cleavage
she looks back at him in disbelief
that does it
she relaxes and smiles back
under which a voice crackles over the swat cops radio
to driver okay
get this train outta here
whereupon the train jerks to a start
running toward the rear of the stopped train
leaping onto the rear steps
out of nowhere a foot catches him in the head sending him flying back down onto the rails
there is su in front of him
youll have to come and get em
su moves on miles
miles throws a solid punch at him
su and miles fight on the track behind the stopped train
the deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous
miles is a street boxer
but hes no match for su
when miles is subdued su grabs the bag of jewels makes sure miles doesnt have any more then goes
the tunnel ceiling whizzes by above fait and daria
intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches from their heads
every time the train takes a curve they both slide toward the edge
fait places a calming hand on top of darias
the car takes a wide curve
darias body flips to the side
she loses her grip
screams as she starts to fall off the train
fait reaches for daria losing his grip on his bag which plummets off the train
fait cant grab her
the train jerks again
he starts sliding away from her off the opposite side
fait thrusts out both hands as far as he can
just snags her at the last second
grips darias wrists with all hes got
theyre now draped across the curved roof of the train
hands in the middle
if daria slips or fait lets her go they both die
su gets in
empties miles nylon bag into his lap
a fortune in gems and jewelry pours out
su sifts through it increasingly agitated
what he wants isnt there
he throws the bag down cursing in chinese
fait is at his limit
his grip starts to loosen
when the train begins to slow
they pull into a station and stop
fait releases daria and she drops to the platform
fait jumps down on the other side
hes lost the bag of jewels
knows theyre gone for good
he feels for the bag of black diamonds
still has them
unseen fait joins daria on the platform and hand in hand they melt into the crowd of commuters
a stretch limo and a cadillac escalade wait on the tarmac next to a gulfstream which has just arrived
the jet door opens and a man emerges with a bodyguard
the man ling is asian about forty
emanates grace and power
as ling descends the steps and two thugs from the suv go to retrieve baggage
a woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet ling
shes also asian
dressed in american casual
shes not smiling
as ling approaches her enjoying california
charles the bodyguard answers for himself
hope were not here long
i hate sunshine
ling kisses sona on the lips
then we may have a problem
lings mood quickly darkens
the exchange was just robbed
lets hope that was part of the plan
swarming with police
su steps off the elevator
hes carrying the bag of jewels he took from miles
whos in charge
who wants to know
su flashes i
we dont see it
the cop scopes it a moment
hes clearly impressed
as he leads su toward his superiors in the vault
vanessa eight is in her pajamas playing sim coaster on her computer
the door opens
you know its past your bedtime
just a little longer
imitating sweetly just a little longer
school tomorrow baby
fait stands over her as she shuts down the computer talking her through the commands making sure she doesnt dawdle
do not save
whereupon he whisks her out of her chair flies her once around the room and tucks her into bed
you bag some zs now you hear
wait a second
i think theres something behind your
oh please that is so lame
its in your hand
she takes his right hand opens it and turns it over
takes his left hand opens it and turns it over
puts his hands together
when he opens them there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain
howd you do that
fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her
then fait looks up
addresses the air above her
angels east angels west north and south do your best
guard her watch her while she rests
a bedtime ritual
when shes alone vanessa holds up the diamond which catches every bit of available light and shines in the dark
then she rolls over and closes her eyes
vanessas nanny tonita is there
to tonita shell stay down now
she wont listen to me lately
ill have a talk with her about it tomorrow
still to the nanny i got some work to do in the office
you can go on to bed
im watching tv if you need me
tommy and daria are there
what the hell happened
fait puts a finger to his lips
leads them across the room to another door
fait shuts the door
should we be considering a long vacation in a warm foreign climate where theres no extradition
faits thinking it through
the guy who called was only interested in the black stones
christophe sold us out
just then miles enters
you made it
by the skin of my ass
some chinese dude kicked me around the motherfuckin block
busted my ear piece
he takes the broken communication device out of his ear and tosses it on the table
snagged my loot too
maybe time to
rethink the no gun policy
little ass whuppins nothing
least you didnt have to play all foxy with the rent a cop
fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds
means this is all we got
so what do we do
you all wait to hear from me
wherere you going
to get some answers
miles moves to go with him
i got your back
i got us into this
ill call you if i need you
daria moves to him
their eyes meet
fait gives her a kiss
christophes arms are wrapped around the large fish tank one arm over the top the other through the legs of the stand
his hands are bound
he cant move
his beaten face is pressed to the glass
large weird fish swim past in front of him
the weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side of the tank
looking through at christophe
ling straightens and walks around the tank
sona is with him
so is charles the bodyguard
the two thugs stand sentry near the front door
christophes eyes follow them
so this is mr
only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look
apparently were not his first visitors today
please monsieur ling ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder
whatever youre going to say
make it the truth
sitting in the middle of the large lot which is full of hot goods and military surplus equipment
the tanks turret is spinning around
the cannon elevating and depressing seemingly at random
the cannon stops
having locked on
fait standing in front of the tank
from inside the tank a muffled voice
a hatch opens
archie a fairly straight ahead looking man pops his head up out of the tank
as archie climbs out of the tank and joins fait want it
give you a good deal
reactive armor twin m machine guns mm smoothbore cannon
guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line
how about a marine corps assault hovercraft
i got other business
fait and archie walk to a work table
nearby two men unload hot tvs from a truck
one man calls to archie
were outta room over here arch
stack em in the office if you have to
then archie turns his attention back to fait
you werent downtown tonight by any chance were you tony
dont know what youre talking about
ever see black diamonds before
white blue yellow pink
lou diamond phillips
whereupon fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table
archie pulls out a loup
studies them a moment
you got me
find out how much theyre worth
there a timetable on this or yesterday
thats what i figured
faits heading out
ill be back
i gotta go fuck over a guy who fucked me over
fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick
stops a moment his back against the closed door while his eyes adjust to the dark
then moves quietly out into the room
looking for christophe
fait continues moving around through the room
when he steps in something wet
he bends down and checks it out
the carpets soaked
his eyes go to something
fait finds a cord and turns on a switch
the light in the fish tank snaps on
stuffed inside the tank
sleeping with the fishes
looks dead to me
fait turns around
sitting on a sofa
guess you got to him first
fait does the math
youre the one who called me
the one who took on my guy
who the fuck are you man
my name is su
i want the black stones
make me an offer
you can walk out of here
fait launches himself at su
gonna fight his way out the door
a much better fighter than miles
hes saved by the bell the phone rings
the fight stops
the phones near fait
the answering machine picks up
leave a message
i know youre there mr
fait pushes the button for the speakerphone
ling and sona
enjoying hotel room service
lings on a cell phone
the man for whom mr
christophe arranged to have the black stones brought into the country and deposited at the jewelry exchange
the man who wants them back
maybe you didnt understand me
the stones are already mine
i got em im selling em
so get your bid in or go fuck yourself
i dont have time for this
that your final offer
i can be a very dangerous man mr
fait just hangs up
everybody think im the fucking goodwill or something
look ive had a shitty night and so far i got zip for all my troubles
so i dont know who the fuck you are and i dont care
but hear this you can beat my ass around the block all night brother it aint gonna get you those stones
a long beat
the two men facing off
as su stands aside giving fait a clear path out
fait slides into his porsche and drives off
faits checking his rearview mirror
sees a black cadillac escalade pull away from the curb and follow
fait doesnt need it
hes about to punch it
a cop car turns a corner and falls in beside him
fait throttles back
the cops turn off
fait hits it
traffic ahead forces fait to turn into an alley in a semi industrial area
behind him the escalade tries to follow but is cut off by the on coming cars
we stay with fait
he guns down the alley
reaches an intersecting alley
guns it out of sight
finally forcing its way through on coming traffic and speeding down the alley after fait
the escalade reaches the intersection
crashes into a dumpster rolled into its path
the dumpster forces the escalade into a wall
two men start to get out of the escalade
we recognize them lings two thugs
we barely have time to realize that faits escape has been blocked by construction equipment down the alley
hes had no choice but to turn and fight
which is what he does rushing the passenger
the battles ferocious and fast
ultimately faits out muscled and out gunned
hes forced back against the open door of the escalade guns to his head
give us the stones
man how many times i gotta tell people im a business man
make me a motherfucking offer
heres your offer
he cocks his pistol
that shit aint gonna do it biggie
cause i aint scared of guns and i aint got the stones
then youre gonna tell us where they are
spins through the air
the bottle knocks the gun from one killers hand
the gun skids under a nearby chain link fence
the person who threw the bar
the fights on
using all means available
during the battle a killer tries to reach the gun behind the chain link fence
almost gets it
two vicious dobermans guard dogs for the junkyard behind the fence leap out of nowhere snarling and snapping and smash into the fence
the killer jumps back barely escaping with his arm
the fight continues
fait and su wear them down
behind the fence the dobies want flesh
every time someone crashes into the fence theyre right there trying to get a piece
also every time someone crashes into the old fence we see a series of chain link connections loosen and break
until it happens one too many times
the entire fence goes down
the dogs are out
the nearest targets su and fait
su and fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and evading the ferocious attack dogs
finally su kicks one dog flying
whip kicks the other off fait
the two men run for the escalade
the dogs are up in a flash
su spots an abandoned car
a rear door is open
fait follows right on his heels
the dogs close in
su reaches the car
dives through the open door
somersaults over the rear seat
kicks open the far door and rolls out
fait dives in right behind him
the dobies leap in after fait
faits airborne completely through the back seat and out the other side of the car
clears the door
su slams the door shut
we watch a two doberman pile up against the suddenly closed door as su leaps to the cars other side and shuts that door too
trapping the snarling foaming dogs inside
the bad guys are gone
and faits cell phone is ringing
as fait digs out the phone to su man what the hells up with these fucking stones
into phone go
archies had the shit beat out of him
we got a problem
surveillance camera footage of archies
five armed african americans faces hidden under baseball caps enter archies place put archie up against a wall and start to beat something out of him
i did what you said right
put it out on the street trying to get info on the stones
next thing i know the jackson five here show up
now there are three significant elements to notice here
one im outnumbered
two theyre heavily armed
three theyre gonna beat me like a bongo drum
archie fait and su are watching the monitor
on screen archie surrenders immediately
i mean hey i coulda resisted sure and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever but then see im thinking how would i be able
to tell tony what happened to the stones
what good am i dead or on life support
so i threw in the towel
reluctantly of course
for your sake
you saved yourself to tell me
so tell me
who are they
whatd they say
give us the stones motherfucker
that kinda thing
thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information
did you call the police
are you crazy
then again maybe you are crazy cause i have no idea who you are
big question is whos behind the boost
re footage i dont know that but i know they got great guns
i cant even get those
special forces only
hes wired into everything going down in this city and he can get that kind of firepower
gotta be him
runs the biggest outfit in town
what warlords are to afghanistan chambers is to l
and you want to take him on youre on your own
game over for me
beat then and now that im truly fucked what the hell are you anyway
you got some i
su takes out his wallet and shows him
doesnt mean shit to me
let me see that
archie takes it reads
central security bureau
you read chinese
but i know cop in every language
what you some kinda asian james bond
the stones belong to my government
yeah well theyre chambers now
and even governments dont go to war with him
under which faits cell phone starts ringing
im starting to hate this phone
answers what now
lings on his cell phone
i hope youve reconsidered
hey its mr
youve made this difficult mr
let me make it easy
cant wait to hear
i have your daughter
shes very pretty in her pink pajamas

reveal vanessa in the limo held by charles
on lings signal charles uncovers her mouth
i want my stones mr
you think about it a moment
let me talk to the chinese gentleman whos with you
dont you hurt her
thats up to you
fait hands the phone to su
he has my daughter
he wants to talk to you
su takes the phone
in chinese with english subtitles hello
i thought i killed you
i have the stones
let the girl go
do you really want one more person to die
we see this resonates with su
and then he simply hangs up
whatd you just do
i said i have the stones and wont negotiate for your daughter
it will confuse him
buy us time and keep her alive
what the fuckre you talking about
that asshole has my daughter
look i know him
then i want the stones you want your daughter
well get them both back
well work together
i gotta work with you
you have no choice
fait realizes what this means
we gotta go see chambers
beat then oh god
large empty brightly lit
the door opens and the limo pulls in
the limo stops inside the hangar
to charles re vanessa find a place to put her
then as charles forces vanessa out my daddys gonna come and kick your butts
sona just reaches out and slaps her
it hurts and surprises vanessa
tears come to her eyes
but shes faits daughter she wont let this bitch make her cry
charles takes vanessa out
lings mind is still on the phone call
su says he has the stones
but why cut me off
why not negotiate for the girl
it doesnt make sense
the buyers fly in tomorrow
should we stop them
well never regain their confidence
beat we need information
find the right people
pay whatever it costs
somethings not right
somethings happening with the stones
what about the girl
well need her
she stays alive
fait and su
fait on the cell to tommy
im on the way to chambers
yeah i know but i got no other choice
just get the word into his pipeline that im coming and want permission to visit
ill get back to you
hangs up maybe chambersll have a heart and give the stones back
then yeah right and maybe hell join the peace corps
su looks over
im sorry about your daughter
how old is she
this aint the biography channel
lets just get there
a long beat
moving by outside
shell be nine in september
mine is fifteen
ill just kill em
i wish it were that easy
then about time i got the
whats this all about
the stones arent what you think they are
then how about the guy who has vanessa
hes exactly what you think he is a thief and a killer
a battered ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar
we see vanessa inside the camper
ling thug covers the windows with black spray paint
ling thug hands car keys to charles
whered you get that piece of shit
lets just say grandma and grandpa have a long walk back from the
youre sure you cleaned it out
everything except the denture cream and adult diapers
vanessas still screaming
its getting on charles nerves
im sick of her already
he marches toward the van
unlocks the rear door and slides it open
vanessa is standing inside still yelling
you shut up
go to sleep
vanessa reaches over and flicks on the campers tv
turns it up loud
giving him stink eye defiance as
charles slams the door shut
now that vanessas made her point and charles cant see her anymore her boldness begins to subside
she lies down on the bed and curls up alone and scared inside the dark camper
vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it
connecting her to her father
not making the fear go away but giving her strength
as he drives just as if he can sense vanessas need for him angels east angels west north and south do your best
guard her watch her while she rests
off which as su regards him
a prison guard escorts fait and su past cells each just as dreary spare and institutional as the next
that is until they reach the last cell
the last cell is guarded by two convict sentries
hanging blankets cloak the cell entirely from view
fait su and the prison guard stop outside the cell
one sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets covering the open cell doorway revealing
after a walk through kansas this is the land of oz
the last cell is as comfy colorful and a well appointed as joels office
jump chambers a large brutal looking inner city crime lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the terms of his incarceration
chambers puffs a cuban as a prison trustee willy chickens sets out breakfast before him fresh squeezed oj eggs benedict large juicy sausages fresh breads and pastries french press coffee
la times ny times wsj maxim hustler and the daily mail
the guard leaves fait and su turns to go
the guard metz stops and looks back

chambers eyes fait and su through his cigar smoke

fait takes a sudden step toward chambers
su stops him
slopes no dope
he indicates behind them
the two cell sentries are wielding prison shanks
so is willy chickens

chickens is happy
thrusts the knife at fait
su reaches out and catches the blade
catches it with just the thumb and forefinger of one hand
and holds it like that
holds it hard
chickens cant push and cant pull
doesnt know what to do next
finally yanks really hard
su lets go
chickens goes backward ass over teakettle
then to fait say hey to daria
and dont forget your shoes
fait and su walk toward the porsche
i used to look up to that guy
all i wanted was to be like him
in taiwan i could force him to talk
this aint taiwan
then only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take em
you make it sound easy

theyre about to get in the car
looks back at the prison
suddenly realizing something
theyre at his club
how do you know
i can feel it

i thought chinese people were all mystical and shit
we like to gamble
its no guess
but i could be wrong
well hit the club
you gotta see archie
hes gotta remember something about the guys who took down his place
what if he cant
pretend its taiwan

russell the science and technology end of lings operation carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five ton truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption which
hes in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar
he puts down what hes carrying next to the contraption and starts back for something else when he sees charles is looking in the back of the truck
get away from there
russell hurries over extremely edgy almost manic
what are you doing
take it easy
just seeing if i could help with something
its very delicate equipment
just stay away from my truck
stay away from my truck
stay away from my truck
sonas emerging from a trailer office nearby
and now we can hear vanessa whos begun screaming inside the camper
i want my daddy
charles backs up continuing to address russell
im backing away
im backing away
i want my daddy
i want my daddy
charles joins sona
re russell someone give the geek his ritalin
at least hes doing his job
which is more than i can say for some people
i want my daddy
i want my daddy
sona tosses charles a roll of duct tape
tape her up and gag her
as vanessa continues to scream charles moves to the van unlocks the rear door with the key remote and pockets it
then opens the door
vanessa bolts out crying and clamps her arms around his waist
i want my daddy
i want my daddy
i want my daddy
get the hell off me
he pries loose her arms from around him
keeping a grip on her wrists with one hand charles turns her around to face away from him
hes about to start duct taping her wrists
waste of time
i can think of a better way of shutting you up vanessa back kicks him hard in the nads
charles howls in pain and lets her go
quickly vanessa jumps back inside the camper
vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut
we suddenly realize she has the key and remote
the crying just an act she put on to pickpocket charles
vanessa pushes the remote
thunk go the door locks
charles still in pain is surprised to hear this
feels his pocket
realizes the key and remote are gone
yells to sona she got the key
vanessa climbs into the drivers seat
puts the key into the ignition and starts the engine
puts it in d
to reveal vanessas rigged a soda can to the pedal
an extension for her short legs
as her foot tromps down on the can
the windows are blacked out and vanessa cant see where shes going
but shes going
the camper careens around the large space
charles scrambles after
vanessa keeps driving blind pedal to the metal
the camper veers toward the rear wall
crashes into a support post
as charles yanks vanessa from the wrecked van unhurt
a hostess bar but very high end
no strip club cheese
for extra money private rooms for private pleasures
its day but the place is wall to wall with korean men
chambers african americans maintain low visibility at the door behind the scenes counting the register etc
odion a dangerous looking chambers main man moves through the crowd to daria waiting near the front door
long time no see
then checking her out like cognac
just getting better
then so what brings you around
sometimes you need an old friend yknow
with a capital t
thought you and him were tight
bonnie and clyde
used to be that way
not treating me right these days
the kids all he cares about
what do you want me to do
man i dont know
probably nothing you can do
then hey yknow this is crazy
i dont know what i was thinking
i shouldnt even be here like this
daria starts to go
odion stops her
nah hey hold up
back in the day
just always seemed like you and i had something special between us
didnt know you thought so
i always cared for you odion
thats why im here
you looking for a job
i need something
so maybe you could work here
oh man i dont know
you were the best
not many girls pulling in two gs a night
yeah but its been a while for that
might not remember how
just like a bicycle baby
you dont forget that stuff
daria considers it a moment
dont know how jumpd feel about it
having me back
hey you let me worry about jump
then meantime why dont you come on in and you and me can yknow talk some more about it
daria knows the look in his eyes
gets the subtext
odions drinking her in
then as daria reaches out and slips her hand into odions smiling at him su and archie
they have boxing matches in the day
not exactly boxing
started holding em during the daytime to fool the cops
the man you remembered how do you know he will be here
but chambers owns the operation so i figure its a good place to start
then this is it
they turn into
a cavernous industrial building
cars parked on the perimeter
as they park
how will you recognize him
i didnt see his face
but ill know his pinkie ring when i see it
round cut with square mount
good color and clarity
i remember thinking what it would do to my face if he hit me
off sus dubious look as archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself
archie and su exit the car and approach a guard manning a gate to the fight arena beyond
how do we get in
leave that to me
then to the guard hey man how you doing
got a fighter here i want to enter
su shoots him a surprised look
my mans gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy bye
hell go in there and get all chinese on em the teeth are gonna fly the bloods gonna run
gonna be fun
youre number twelve bruce
he hands a card reading to su
as archie and su make their way toward the arena i didnt come here to fight
you wont have to
that was just to get us in
they reach the arena
its also huge
packed with men
hazy with smoke
loud with betting cheers and boos
a large chain link cage stands at the center of the room
inside two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the shit out of each other
like at a gallagher concert front row fans have sheets of plastic over their laps
whenever a hard kick or punch lands the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to shield themselves from flying blood
good day over a million dollarsll pass hands in here
find the ring
he looks around
lotta african american males
could take a little while
as archie starts moving through the crowd looking at hands and su follows
daria and odion enter and odion closes the door
he starts to take her in his arms
daria slows him up
guides him back toward a sofa
put on some music
odion puts a disc in the stereo
cranks up some hip hop
odion switches music
a slow tune fills the room
now just relax
daria just stands there a moment getting her body into the music
then starts dancing for him
slow and sexy
and odions eating it up
fait and miles climb onto the roof with gear bags
via earwig mike tommy
tommys behind the wheel wearing a pest control uniform
here come da bug man
the doorman watches tommy drive up in the pest control truck put on a respirator get out unreel feet of pest spray hose from the truck and advance toward the
what the hell you doing

i mean hey im here doing my job
anyway putting that aside if you had gotten your notice youd know theres a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed
cause foreign peoplere bringing all
their scary assed foreign bugs over here

tommy starts to go
wait wait wait
citys really gonna come and close us up
quickern a zip loc

the doorman considers it another moment
lets do this
you let me start with a couple small rooms yknow offices or something someplace you dont have customers
upstairs so the fumes dont bother anybody
ill pop off a couple bug bombs and then well do the rest later
the doorman considers a moment
then yeah okay
get the bombs and come on
daria keeps dancing
peeling off layers now
odions starting to salivate
what chambers cell is to a normal cell this place is to a normal office
no expense spared
think joel again
a large zen fountain burbles meditatively in the center of the room
the door opens
the doorman admits tommy who looks around in amazement
just do your thing and go bro
he positions the bug bombs
he sets off one
as he goes just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in
off the closing door
fait and miles grab gear bags and mobilize
clip onto ascender descenders and lower themselves to a second story window
a window into
where the bug bombs hiss away
fait tries the window
he quickly tapes it
he and miles climbs inside
grab the bug bombs and toss them out
as miles locks the door fait opens a gear bag and pulls out a folding metal detector
uses it to scan the entire room quickly floor walls ceiling
gets low volume ring offs from various hidden metal
but hes looking for something bigger
he gets it when he sweeps past chambers big desk
removes a desk panel
there it is
the safe is small but highly secure
take it down
miles finishes assembling a barrett
a big gun
opens an ammo box labeled depleted uranium
darias down to bare essentials still dancing slow and sexy for odion
miles loads one of the massive d
cartridges into the barrett
even with the music theyre gonna hear it when i fire this tank buster
get ready to move
miles aims the barrett directly at the safe lock
miles odion starts
what was that
basically the locks just gone
burned through by the du slug
fait swings the safe door open
odions heading out the door
when he stops
looks back at daria
a realization dawning
sometimes you need an old friend
he steps toward daria
then opens the door
a chambers man outside the door addresses odion
it came from the office
dont let her leave
the man enters
shuts the door leering at daria who starts putting on what shes taken off
faits tossed the safe
whatre you talking about
im telling you theyre here
whatre we gonna do
faits started searching the room
tearing it apart
what about you
i gotta save vanessa
i gotta find em
im not leaving you
yes you are
someone starts rattling the locked door
fait doesnt stop
come on man
give it up
shut up and get the fuck outta here
thats an order
chambers men are trying to break down the door
out the window
onto the ascender descender
daria finishes dressing
yknow i got the big one
her response is a front kick to the head
followed by a spin kick knocking him out
then stepping past him keep it in your pants
odion and his men break down the door
faits still searching
desperate to find the stones
desperate to save his daughter
he fights off the first men to reach him
a wild animal
fights off another
the guns are out
all pointed at fait
daria walks out the front door
willy chickens hovers near chambers who is talking as he eats another meal
at first we dont realize who chambers is addressing
if youre willing to pay five youre willing to pay ten
youre willing to pay ten youre willing to pay twenty
im not selling till i know exactly where the ceiling is
whereupon we see who hes talking to ling
you like foreplay
how much money do you want for the stones
i hate foreplay
fuck the warm up drills girls gotta get in there and be ready to score points
bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop
beat so instead of us going back and forth doing warm ups my ideas for you to think of a number
a very high number
a very final number
a number so high and final itll get me off good bam right when i hear it
chambers hasnt looked at ling the whole time
still isnt looking
forks up some lobster meat
chickens face suddenly appears in front of him
ling slams a lobster claw deep into chickens neck
chambers doesnt wait for whatevers next
fast for a big man
but ling is much faster
quickly and quietly beats chambers like a drum
chambers knows when its finally tent folding time
croaks surrender through the blood and swelling okay okay
aint worth my life
ill take the five and call it a game
ling emerges from the cell through the blankets
closing the blankets behind him
to the sentries whove heard nothing mr
chambers is resting
he says not to bother him
off which as ling walks away
no one will bother him
the lobster fork driven deep into the base of his skull
archie still looking for the man with the diamond pinkie ring
su still following
by the way when we do find him what then
ill handle it
in the cage a fight has just ended
the losers unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning airplane propeller
the winner doesnt look much better
the midget ring announcer steps in with a mike
seven advances elevens out
next up eight versus twelve
eight versus twelve
fighters report to the cage
as archie and su continue the search youre after the stones too huh
no response from su
i did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about em
guess who get back to me
my defense department connection
now i think hes calling me about this surplus f tomcat im trying to get my hands on
turns out hes calling to tell me about a rumor outta taiwan about black stones in the ring we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the midget calls out
to su only theyre not jewels number twelve
theyre suddenly seeing the card in sus hand a fight club fan grabs his arm and raises it
yells out twelves right here
su pulls his arm back
id be scared of him too
su glances into the ring seeing the bruiser for the first time
the bruisers beckoning
lets go chickenshit
su waves them off
the catcalls start
archie leans into su
i know it wasnt the plan
but if you dont fight theyre gonna toss us out on our asses
we might never find the guy
a long beat
su hates this place
su hates archie
faits in handcuffs
a big cut on his head
being escorted by two cops to the stairs leading out of the club
to odion as they pass him hes pretty beat up
fell down the stairs
enjoy the jail sex fait
as they continue up the stairs better have the e
s look at his head
near but not too close
the club visible in b
daria miles and tommy watch as fait is led into an ambulance
via earwigs were still here to help you t
anything you want us to do
the paramedic treating him doesnt understand
his cuffed hands
fingers feeling the inside of his belt
finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the leather
popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed out recess in the belt
fait has a hidden handcuff key
struggling against their duct tape bonds
vanessas hands are taped together behind her back
theres tape around her feet
tape over her mouth
the tv is on nearby but shes not watching
vanessa struggles a moment longer but cant break the tape
finally gives up trying
just lies there
tired and scared
the crowds yelling and betting as number eight leaves his corner and advances on su
su has nothing against number eight
hes just trying to buy time
so he dodges his opponent
not exactly running
fighting by not fighting
a target one moment gone the next
again and again number eight swings and misses
number eight delivers a knockout blow
unfortunately its against himself
the momentum of a missed punch carries him headfirst into a metal post
number eight drops
as the referee counts over number eight su uses the chance to find
still checking out the hands of african american men in the crowd
not making any friends as he does it
number eights on his feet
moving in again
suddenly he sees it
dodges number eight again
sees archie signaling hes found the guy
gets nailed by number eight
a solid hit
exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight
su turns to him and bows
su turns heads out of the cage
the crowd roaring its disapproval
the midget ring announcer bars sus path
get back in there
su moves him aside
the midget resists
five other waiting fighters come to the midgets aid
forcing su back into the cage
its now su against them all
daria tommy and miles wait
two extreme moto riders dressed in leathers have pulled up in a truck and gotten out to eat
in the back of the truck is a motorcycle and a four wheel atv
the two men ogle daria
to her looking good
she ignores them
to each other so she can hear nice rack
like the upstairs like the basement
shut up assholes
looks past the paramedic
past the cops talking outside
sees the hot dog stand in b
sees the truck with the motorcycle and atv parked near the stand
the paramedic finishes bandaging fait
to the cops outside hes all patched up
a cop calls inside to fait
into his mike get ready to move
and we see
the handcuffs arent on him anymore
fait reaches the rear doorway
knocks one cop down
shoves another aside
and takes off running
faits caught the cops completely by surprise
it takes a few moments before the cops give chase some on foot others by car
fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand
to daria miles and tommy looking on get the car
as daria miles and tommy quickly mobilize fait jumps into the bed of the truck
jumps on the atv
the moto riders suddenly realize whats happening
fait blasts out of the rear of the truck
right through the nylon mesh tailgate
fait flies from the truck bed
lands on the hood of a police car
gets big air off the windshield
clears the rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels
as fait tears off and cop cars follow one of the moto riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the remaining motorcycle
his friend calls to him dont let that fucker get away
the moto rider fires up the motorcycle
drops it into first
dittoes faits leap out the back and screams off in pursuit
vanessa still taped up
tv still on
we go now to this breaking story
airing a chopper shot tracking fait on the atv
youre watching a man on an all terrain vehicle leading police in a high speed chase through downtown los angeles
spokesman says the man anthony fait vanessa looks over in surprise
commandeered the a
after escaping from police officers while being treated at a local hospital for injuries resulting from his earlier arrest for robbery
and this is certainly one of the wildest chases weve witnessed here in l
down streets sidewalks squeezing through places police cars cant
over under around through doesnt matter
the atvs fast strong and maneuverable
one problem so is the moto cross bike
the guys right on faits ass
matching move with move
overhead police choppers follow faits every move
while on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path
but whenever fait meets a roadblock he somehow finds an escape
at one point he uses an outdoor escalator
at another point he blasts through the hotel bonaventure
thisll be a news highlight for days to come
the place is bedlam
in the crowd bets are going down on the battle royal now in full effect inside the cage
su versus the five fighters
and the midget
the different fighters use different fighting styles against su
kickboxing grappling aikido kali american street fighting
su uses all his own skills and whatevers at hand
at one point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another opponent
at another point su wields the midget like a fighting staff
one by one su starts reducing the opposition
and so is the moto bike
still on his tail
fait veers inside a building
the bike follows
fait and the moto bike ascend the stairs
up and up
fait reaches the top floor hallway
nowhere left to go except
out the window at the end
thats just where he goes
and where he goes the moto bike goes
the atv and the moto bike make the first leap
onto the roof of a next door building
from there its rooftop to rooftop
jump after jump
longer and longer
the moto bike eats it in a spectacular crash
the moto rider walks away but his chase is over
faits atv screams down another street still chased by cops
into his mike yo
above ground parking garage in chinatown
its down to su and the kick boxer
the kick boxer spins and kicks and punches and
su just ties the guy up in his own clothes
ties him into a pretzel
cinches him tight
looks for archie
cant find him
cant find the guy wearing the ring
and hurries out of the cage
fait jukes the atv in the entrance
up the spiral ramp
moments later police cars skid up and seal the entrance
on tv a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police
and it looks like this chase will end here as police seal off the building
off vanessa watching
su runs into the parking area
archies in the t bird
sitting a little unnaturally in the front
where is he
decided to leave early
whered he go
su looks inside the car
where archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring
holding a stun gun to the guys cheek
good thing i brought my stunner
he zaps the air
then puts it back to the guys cheek
okay bud wanna start the q and a
on tv the chopper zooms in on a familiar car as it rolls down the exit ramp toward the police barricade
heres a car coming down the exit ramp
we see the police approach the car
the police apparently talking to the driver
the police let the car pass
now letting this car drive on as the search inside continues
vanessa notices something about the car
the car turns giving the news chopper a better zoom angle of the people inside and
vanessa sees daria miles and tommy
which could mean only one thing her daddys safe
and soon hell be coming to get her
with a rekindled hope inspired by her fathers escape vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct tape bonds
when just as its about to seem hopeless again her eyes go to
the chain and pink diamond pendant
vanessa bends over and lowers her head until the necklace slides off onto the bed
then turns around and picks up the necklace behind her back
holding it as taut as she can between her hands she begins sawing away at the tape around her wrists
the gangs all here
all eyes on the club
i knew the stones were in there
question is how do we get em out
place is slamming nonstop
a long beat
fait doesnt answer
something isnt right
thats what im getting
where the hell is he
then everyone stay put
off which as he and su go music pumps downstairs as su and fait cautiously move down the hall toward chambers office
no chambers guys
i dont get it
they reach the closed office door where they stop and listen
su and fait exchange a ready ready look
then su opens the door
su and fait enter unchallenged to find
odion and the other chambers men
i get it now
su ignores the bodies quickly moves to the zen fountain where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom
then are they there
su doesnt answer still searching
this cant fucking happen
they gotta be there
then at last su holds something up one black stone
it takes fait a moment to understand
the rest are gone
fait cant believe it
what the hell happened
who got em
how do you know
howd he get here before us
summed up in one word vanessa
then trying he has the stones
theres no reason to keep her
hell shes a little girl shes eight years old she cant hurt him
he can let her go
he can just fucking let her go
su just looks at him
not a chance
and he knows fait knows it too
for fait its as if his life just ended
what the hell am i gonna do
we need to go
fait doesnt move
then suddenly it all explodes as rage and fait picks up the large stone ball spinning atop the fountain and screaming hurls it into a large display of exotica destroying
fait looks at su who meets his eyes
off which as su mobilizes him and they go
ling pours the black stones out on a table
to sona and charles were back in business
i dont have to baby sit much longer
i hate kids
is everything else ready
we just have to test the device
russell whos been working on his scientific contraption nearby speaks up
dye master oscillator
and not test calibrate
which im now ready to do
when the goggles are on russell hits a switch
inside the contraption brilliant green laser beams begin bombarding a sensor
vanessa succeeds in using the necklace as a saw to free her wrists from the duct tape
she quickly rips the tape from her mouth
untapes her ankles
then tries to figure out what to do next
begins searching the camper for anything that might help her escape or fight
looking through the glove box she finds a cell phone
an old model
so old it takes her a moment to figure out exactly what it is
then she pushes power and
the phone turns on
low batt flashes on the screen
faits desolate sitting on the sofa staring off
daria tries to comfort him but it doesnt help
miles and tommy stay close and stay silent
even archies quiet for once
the only noise is su speaking into a cell phone in chinese to someone who is obviously his superior
i lost the stones
ling has them
i dont know where he is
i have no way to find him
what do you want me to do
under which the phone begins to ring
faits too upset to care about answering
vanessas on the old cell phone
we hear ringing on the other end
answer daddy answer
the phones still ringing
after another moment
want me to get that
which finally mobilizes fait to reach over and answer
vanessa whispers urgently
which gets everyones attention
come get me
i want to go home
okay baby okay
just calm down
under which in b
su quickly ends the phone call to his superior
still in chinese ill call you back
continuing to vanessa where are you
i dont know
im in a van inside a big building
they painted the windows
i cant look out
try to see something
vanessa puts her eye to the window
finally finds a small gap in the paint
just some chairs and bright green light from russells contraption
i see chairs
and theres green light
fait repeats for the others benefit
you see chairs and green light
wheres the light coming from
i cant tell
is it bright
the green light baby is it bright
really really bright
to su its real bright
i know baby
just hang in there faits voice drops out as the battery dies
fait slams the phone down in frustration
but sus mind is on what she told them
hes doing it here
selling the stones
a dye laser emits green light
he needs it to activate them
what the hell you talking about
what are these stones
archie answers it
doomsday in disguise
all eyes go to him
theyre some kinda new synthetic plutonium
small and portable but mega powerful
this fuckers making bombs
not making them
yeah hed need a big operation for that
just demonstrate the stones work and sell em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid
he makes millions they make the bombs then
look out world
okay so we know what hes up to
hows it get us to vanessa
su considers it a moment
the buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly
accessible by aircraft
vanessa said shes inside a big building
could be a hangar
man theres dozens of little airports around here
wed never get to em all
flight plans show destinations
all aircraft file em with the aviation administration
if we could get a list we could maybe figure out where the sales going down
daria call the aviation people

we need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight
everyone else get ready to move
miles the no gun policys revoked
you break out the heat
tommy you gotta get us a diversion
i can help with that
do it all fast
ling sona charles and russell
russell finishes testing his contraption
switches it off
then removing his goggles were operational
the others remove their goggles
sona checks her watch
the buyers arrive in less then an hour
ling holds up a black stone and examines it
were selling conscience for money
a look at the others
then a broad smile of
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face
but its a lot of money
he puts down the stone
a glance at the camper
be ready to kill the girl and go as soon as the sales over
faits finger indicates a spot
fait su daria and miles
five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other
sounds like our best shot
it better be or my babys dead
he and su exchange a look
then lets go
noselight beaming the chopper lands next to four other high end biz copters including an agusta a outside the hangar where the bruised ling killers stand guard
vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the windows
an internationally diverse group of men some occupying the chairs some studying the contraption some clearly muscle
across the room sona and ling greet the new arrivals
in all sixteen men have arrived for the sale
there are five buyers one russian one african one pakistani one egyptian one french
the french buyer is in a wheelchair
each buyer has brought with him one right hand man and one to three bodyguards
vanessa shifts her view revealing
charles standing nearby
too close for her to escape
charles turns and
quickly before charles can see her she steps away from the window
theres no way out
daria and miles following in their car
so tell me
how the hells taiwan fit into all this
one of our scientists made the stones
tried to go into business for himself
we stopped him
recovered the stones
ling betrayed us
he took them
he was one of you
we were partners
six of us
he killed the others
he thought he killed me too
beat so whatre you really after the stones or the payback
lets get it all
youre the worlds foremost arms dealers
you all know that weaponry equals power
and in the world of weaponry nukes rule
but nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle
but what if it werent
thats the question that brought you here tonight
and heres the answer
ling holds up a single stone
in its present state its completely inert
zero radiation zero volatility
whereupon ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a table
folds the velvet over
then whack hits it hard with a mallet
he unfolds the velvet
the stones smashed to pieces
ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to russell who places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule then inserts the capsule into his contraption
everyone puts on goggles
then russell hits the switch and the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver of stone which begins to glow
russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical readout on the contraption races up the scale firecracker
and it just keeps going
new world order
as the buyers absorb this
russell shuts off the beams
russell removes the capsule and hands it back to ling who holds it up
one small fragment
transformed into a source of immense energy
more powerful than weapons grade plutonium a hundred times its size
a beat as this sinks in
the purpose of todays sale is to begin trading a new commodity on the black market and establish its value
there are fifty stones available in the first sale
the opening price is one million per stone
the buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit
at the same time theyre all crunching the numbers on calculators
ling looks on as sona runs the sale and russell uses a laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market analysis for sona to consult
the pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel out the situation
five at one million
sona is silent
silence means no
five at one point two
three at two million
well take that
six at one five
ten at two million
near their cars
note from now until the battles over its night
at the airport fait su and faits team will all communicate via earwigs
miles what do you see
atop the building next to lings hangar
the five choppers rest on the wide tarmac below between the two buildings
miles scans lings hangar through the scope of a silenced sniper rifle
finding the ling killers outside the hangar
two sentries my side
then scanning inside lings hangar through windows sales at this end
theres a camper with painted windows
middle of the hangar
vanessa said she was in a van
thats gotta be it
to daria when we get her you move her outta
ill keep her safe
sus reached the top of outside stairs
opens a door and enters
high above the floor su steps onto a catwalk
the sale continuing below
more heated now
eight at three
nine at three
ten at three one
well take that
there are now thirty seven stones available
and now in more and more rapid fire succession five at three five
eight at three five
twenty at three
is already sighted in
pulls the trigger
one ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down
before the second killer has time to react he catches a bullet in the shoulder
tommy and archie
watch out for the camper
the sales now a frenzy
five at five million
six at five
seven at five
ten at five
ten at five one
archies abrams tank blasts through a wall and into the hangar
archies head pops out of the drivers hole
at the same time tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted machine gun on the stunned group
russell watches the advancing tank
i knew it
i knew it
fait and daria enter through the hole in the wall using the abrams for shelter
vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see whats happening
charles is drawn away by the advancing tank
she looks back into the camper
finds a heavy iron skillet amid the stove utensils
she shatters a side window
we find vanessa jumping out of the camper
vanessas out of the camper
running this way
to daria stay
and hes gone sprinting after her just as
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar doors
she jabs a button and the nearest door begins to motor open
hears the opening hangar door
sees vanessa and goes after her
vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs
then finding charles coming after her theres a guy after her
a bullet rips through the collar of his leather coat
just behind his neck
just missing him
but he keeps coming
charles rolling out under the door
the bullet ricochets off the pavement right next to him
in a flash hes up and running
heading out into the darkness of the airfield after vanessa
meanwhile back inside
in here the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes its slow approach
archies not a great driver
tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group
just be cool
at which point russell breaks for his five ton truck
i said dont move motherfucker
russell just keeps going
slides open the side door in the back of the five ton revealing
a twin fifty machine gun
dangerous even for a tank
russell vaults in and takes aim
he starts firing
people start running
rounds take big chunks out of whatever they hit
what do we do
the questions answered for him
he somehow does the right thing
tommys machine gun begins ripping chunks out of the five ton and everything near it
tommys a horrible shot the guns more in control of him
russell finally dies under a hail of heavy lead
s some major firepower
howd that little shit get one
couldnt fucking listen
intercut with which
ling and sona are moving toward the limo
ling has the stones
su is there
blocking the way
su easily blocks the counters
knocking sona back
never taking his eyes off ling
sona whos fallen back against a buyers bodyguard quickly takes the bodyguards small full auto scorpion and turns the gun on su
su dives for cover as the burst shreds the area where hed just been standing
as sona continues hunting su
ling getting into the limo
to archie and tommy as he signals dont let him get away
as a result of which
having just waxed russell see ling in the limo
is out of ammo
he switches to the
tanks machine gun
as archie steers toward the limo tommy begins blasting away
lings trying to drive out when the
slugs punch holes in the limo
the tank keeps coming
ling bails out as the tank crushes the limo
intercut with which
play cat and mouse
su rapidly runs out of room to hide
he cant get away
faces the inevitable
daria appears from nowhere
kicks the gun from sonas hand
to su re ling now running from the crushed limo get him
su goes after ling
and now its daria vs
sonas a better fighter but darias got passion on her side
its a good fight
until at last sona finds the scorpion
she swings it up
daria executes a sudden improvised double move that strikes sonas arm in such a way as to cause her to point the scorpion at herself just as she fires
the burst rips through her chest and kills her
and now heres whats been going on outside
as charles runs from the hangar chasing vanessa across the tarmac into the darkness of the airfield
flips to night vision on the sniper scope
charles and vanessa become clearly visible
charles is closing in on her
cross hairs find him
the bullet knocks his gun from his hands
charles is slowed but keeps going
charles reaches the flight line
parked planes a gas truck a shed etc
he disappears behind the equipment
sweeps the rifle looking for charles and vanessa
he comms fait
lost em behind the gas truck
stops behind the gas truck
looks around for vanessa
no sign of her
charles notices the door to the gas truck isnt closed all the way
he whips it open
theres vanessa hiding inside
charles grabs her
yanks her out struggling and kicking
time to end this my way
drop the girl
charles looks over
fait is there holding a gun on him
vanessas relieved and excited to see her father
put her down
charles lowers vanessa to the ground
he releases her
vanessa runs to her father
dives into his arms
its a little more energetic than fait was expecting
suddenly charles uses the distraction to rush in behind her
he hits fait hard
a kick sends the gun flying
charles keeps coming
charles keeps pounding
faits hampered by vanessa
she wont let him go
fait stays between charles and vanessa
guarding his little girl
barely managing to fend off charles a seemingly unstoppable force
the fight winds through the planes under wings through struts
fait charles and vanessa
no clear shot
the fight continues
faits suffering under charles brutal attack
vanessa causes fait to stumble near a plane
charles moves in
faits hand goes to a set of chocks set against the planes wheel
the chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by a length of nylon rope
fait turns to vanessa
fait jumps to his feet
swinging the chocks
not quite like nunchakus more like a medieval mace
and now all of faits fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat the living shit out of charles
charles tries to fight back but hes out matched by the chocks and faits emotion
the punishing blows land like thors hammer
a mighty swing nearly takes charles head off
charles is unconscious before he hits the ground
fait stands over charles
tosses the chocks down
he moves back to where vanessas still hiding
he scoops her up
father and daughter hold each other tight
during all of which also intercut
ling having just escaped being crushed in the limo runs out just as
four helicopters take off one after the other carrying the buyers away
the fifth chopper an agusta a is powered up waiting for the wheelchair bound french buyer being helped by a bodyguard
ling intercepts them
knocks out the bodyguard and tips over the frenchmans chair
then jumps into the agusta
ling puts a gun to the pilots head
su having left daria to fight sona inside runs out
the agusta begins to lift off
su starts running toward the helicopter
runs under the rising aircraft
just in time to
grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels
as the chopper transfers to forward motion su struggles to get a foot hooked on something anything
in the process he kicks against the helos sleek underbelly
ling hears the thumps
swinging beneath the agusta
to the pilot retract the gear
the pilot hits the wheels up switch
the gear begins to retract
disappearing into the bottom of the chopper
in a second therell be nothing left to hold
shoot it down
su lets go
drops fifteen feet to the ground
behind him having clanked out of the hangar the abrams tank is stopped
the turret swivels toward the agusta
archie aims the cannon
can you hit it
tommy slides a shell into the breech
archies locked on
he hits the trigger
the big cannon fires
the agustas tail is blown away by the cannon shell
archie and tommy exult
shot him right in the ass
i did it
i cant believe it
thought you said it was no problem
what do i know
the pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from crashing
the out of control agusta swings back toward su and the hangar losing altitude
then smashes into the tarmac ripping open the fuel tank spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large skidding circle around su before crashing
into another chopper and bursting the spilled fuel ignites
a circle of intense fire
with su in the middle
the agusta pilot still alive has been thrown outside the circle
but lings only path of escape takes him inside
into the circle
he emerges with the bag of stones
su is waiting
you were lucky last time
you wont be lucky again
the final fight begins
the two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire using everything they can lay their hands on
each the equal of the other
each knowing its a fight to the death
for a long time the fight could go either way
ling gets an arm around sus neck
like charles su thrashes and flails
like charles he cant get away
ill kill you fast
you wont feel a thing
you will what happens next happens in an instant su breaks the hold
hooks one of lings arms
a direction it cant go
lings arm bones snap tissues rip
ling screams in pain
su pulls the ceramic capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from lings pocket
slams the capsule deep into lings open mouth
ling gags choking on the capsule lodged in his throat
his horror stricken eyes meet sus
su lets him suffer another moment
then in subtitled chinese this is for our friends
and su strikes him in the throat
a spearing open hand blow with his fingertips
hard enough that
the ceramic capsule shatters
releasing the hot glowing white sliver of stone into lings windpipe
the fragments super high energy radiation instantly beginning to cook lings body from within
the power of a few thousand microwave ovens turned on all at once
lings bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as
as light beaming from his eyes and mouth ling flash cooks from the inside out
not simply burned
his seared and darkened skin shrink wrapped mummy like around his skeleton
in a moment its finished
lings dry roasted remains topple over
su has closed a chapter
su and fait meet on the tarmac
su has the stones
faits holding vanessa asleep in his arms
sirens approach in b
the two men regard each other a moment
we got it all
then what happens to the stones
theyll be destroyed
they see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive in b
looks like ill be doing some jail time
man you just helped save the planet
laws gotta allow for that
a look between fait and su
ill do what i can
thats good cause i mean we make a helluva team yknow
to su well not you cause youre law enforcement
but the rest of us look a white guy comes in handy now and then

fait looks at vanessa again
finding a new purpose in her eyes

faits eyes meet tommys
fait looks to daria for her answer

then they turn and start walking toward the arriving cop cars
daria and miles follow
