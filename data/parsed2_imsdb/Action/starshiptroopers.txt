troopres are calling big k with the th mobile infantery division
it s an ugly planet a bug planet a planet hostile to life as we igkkkkkk
blood hits the lens as the correspondent is cut in half
the camera catches a glimpse of huge claws as cap trooper johnny rico blows away something big big with his pulse cannon
comon lets go
on the bounce the cap troopers move out among them dizzy flores ace levy and kitten smith
the camera pauses unsure
the camera follows
the pulse of bug batteries is blinding
cap troopers scream as they are torn apart right and left by an enemy seen only in disorientating glimpses
the group splits into two and the camera follows johnny
something slices kitten smith and he goes down screaming
johnny stops to help his comrade
a claw slashes into him

we glimpse the hideous jaws of an arachnid warrior
the camera hits the ground

oh god help me
please help me
his eyes glaze over as he remembers is beautiful just and quite pleased with herself because johnny rico is clearly infatuated with her
the end of another school year and for me no doubt another failure
rico pay attention
the teacher jean rasczak a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand scowls at johnny bemused
but as soon as rasczak turns back to the class johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desks touch screen
here in history and moral philosophy weve explored the decline of democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos and how the veterans took control and
imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since
you know these facts but have i taught you anything of value
why are only citizens allowed to vote
rasczak points at lanny with his stump its a reward
what the federation gives you for doing federal service
rasczak is crestfallen makes a big show of patience
something given has no value
havent i taught you dimwits anything
i guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential
johnnys cartoon meanwhile is taking shape johnny and carmen flying round planet venus in a space ship
when you vote youre exercising political authority
youre using force
and force my friends is violence the supreme authority from which all other authority derives
carl jenkins a superintelligent geek jumps in
gee we always thought you were the supreme authority mr
in my classroom you bet
whether its exerted by ten or ten billion political authority is violence by degree
the people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it
dizzy flores athletic pretty no nonsense chimes in
my mother always says that violence never solves anything
i wonder what the city fathers of hiroshima would have to say about that
rasczak points at carmen
they probably wouldnt say anything
hiroshima was destroyed
johnny presses send on his desk and the cartoon appears across the way on carmens screen
naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor
the contrary opinion violence never solves anything is wishful thinking at its worst
while rasczak looks away carmen throws johnny her wonderful smile and johnnys gone checked out flying round venus
people who forget that always pay
they pay with their lives and their freedom
dizzy notices the dreamy look on johnnys face
so does rasczak
he points at him with his stump snaps johnny to
tell me the moral difference if any between the citizen and the civilian
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue
a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic of which he is a member defending it if need be with his life
the civilian does not
the exact words of the text
but do you understand it
do you believe it
uh i dont know
of course you dont
i doubt if any of you here would recognize civic virtue if it bit you in the ass
a bell rings
rasczak shrugs indifferent
well thats it
have a nice life
walk with their friends
several couples hold hands
johnny tries to take carmens hand but she demurs
cmon lets see if theyve posted the math final test yet
hey rico we gonna take tesla
how should i know
youre captain of the team
join other students around a multi screen kiosk
first thing fleet academy looks at is your math scores
wish me luck
carmen enters her name receives her score
good for you
then she spots carl across the way talking with marco
i wanna talk to marco
his sisters at fleet
carmen rushes off
johnny checks his score
crushed he makes sure no none else has seen
carl walks up to him
you still havent kissed her yet
whats the hurry
others are waiting
carl points out dizzy talking with friends
did you read her mind
dont have to
some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss
you can tell by the way she looks at johnny
yeah but i want carmen
you got it bad
carmen returns to johnny as carls heads off
dont forget about this afternoon
to carmen hes always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss
carmen blushes covers
shes flying starships
can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes
you gotta have nerves of steel
reflexes are critical i have good reflexes
carmen notices the way dizzys looking at johnny doesnt like it one bit takes johnnys arm
cmon johnny well be late for biology
is an older woman very spry also blind
johnny carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables
for our final today please identify the mouthparts the abdominal organs and for extra credit locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia
you may begin
the students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs centimeter arkellian sand beetles laid out for dissection
aw cmon its just a bug
just a bug eh
we humans like to think we are natures finest achievement
im afraid it isnt true
this arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways
it has fewer moving parts can reproduce itself in vast numbers and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality makes the perfect selfless member of society
better put your goggles on
johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser
green fluid sprays from the slit
carmen turns away looking ill
our galaxy is teaming with insect life
we have identified over two billion species so far
human life it would seem is the anomaly
but we re intelligent
human minds have invented art mathematics and interstellar travel
true we know of no insect society that has produced a shakespeare an einstein or a cherynkov but before you let that go to your head take the example of
the arachnids a highly organized highly evolved insect society
she points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall arachnid warrior
they are relatively stupid by human standards
workers have an iq of warriors around and yet the arachnids have colonized planets
over a million years of evolution nature has provided the arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space
johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack
bug guts gush out
well if thats the crop that must be the gastric caecal
she heads for the door hand over her mouth
walk home from school together
on the math final
no one could be that dumb with numbers
well at least you didnt lose your lunch over a bug
who cares about bugs
you cant go anywhere if you dont know math
dont be so sure
i like you even if you are dumb with numbers
then how come you wont hold hands with me at school
i dont want everyone to see
why wont you kiss me when were all alone
how come thats all you talk about anymore
its all i think about anymore
indeed they are all alone now
the look in johnnys eye says how about it
carmen grins reaches for johnnys hand
and johnny stand together near a bank of transporters
you cant walk me home
i thought you were going to help carl
carl can wait
johnny my dads home today
johnnys face darkens with frustration
whats he got against me
i mean i m a teenager
you cant be a citizen when youre only a teenager
its not you johnny
your parents are rich they dont need to be citizens and that stuff means a lot to my dad
hes a veteran
well if your dad doesnt like me how come were such good friends
sometimes i do what i want eh
carmen steps into the flux
johnny grins happy to be in love
is hard wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise carls basement workshop
carl concentrates on the image of a playing card the six of diamonds displayed on a monitor
dont think about it
go on instinct
ace of spades
the ace of spades appears and the computer indicates no match
carl puts another card up the jack of diamonds
statistically speaking you shouldve accidentally guessed right by know
in addition to psychic dolt this test also proves im unlucky
two of hearts
luck is not a factor
no one really knows why some people are sensitive and some arent
federal studies like this might provide a clue
the next card up is the nine of clubs
i wouldnt want to know what everyone was thinking
four of spades
suddenly a giant yellow frog jumps onto the keyboard fritzing the monitor
johnny removes the blindfold
cyrano you big yellow turd
johnny knows this frog scratches him on the neck
he just wants attention
you dont play with him like you used to
carl concentrates for a moment
go bug mom cyrano
cyranos eyes widen
he hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time
carl clears the screen
how do you make him do that
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my moms leg
he is going to go eat it
from upstairs carls mom shrieks
carl promise me you wont ever do anything like that to me
dont be afraid
cant do humans
cmon lets go
carl puts up more cards johnny misses them all
ten of clubs
you still gonna sign up for starside r d
passport to the universe
who wouldnt want that
ive been thinking about applying for federal service too
your father will never let you
its my decision i think id make a pretty good pilot
ive good great reflexes
you need that for maneuvering you know
only in male applicants make it through stellar navigation
so what do you think your chances are
no uh seven
if you cant do those numbers you havent got a chance
all i know is carmens going to be a citizen and i dont think itll work out for us if im not
how excruciatingly pathetic
now try and pay attention
carl puts a card up
queen of hearts
the computer indicates a match
johnny peers around at the monitor
it is the queen of hearts
well what do you know about that
and other students wearing orange and black sing the uni high song
the scoreboard says regional final
across the field fans wear red and gold and sing another song
and other uni high tigers all exceptionally robust young man and women suit up in their orange and black uniforms
they tumble good and they hit hard
dizzy bounces a jump shoe to johnny
the spring fires and vaults it high into the air
johnny catches it puts it on smiles cocky at the tesla giants who suit up in red and gold
we tumble good too
powered by jump shoes the play is gymnastic
johnny moves the ball flips high in the air over the giant defensive line makes ten meters before he is brought down
cheers as johnny runs back to join his team
he sees carmen waving glad that johnny has seen her among all the people
and other tigers listen as quarterback dizzy calls the plays
kick three fade left
they make fists then breal for thevline of scrimmage
have the ball
the giants quarterbackassigns zander barcalow handsome super confident to guard johnny
times running out
the scoreboard shows tigers giants three minutes and counting on the clock
a lot can happen in three minutes
johnny takes the handoff flips over a gauntlet of giant guards
zander hurls himself at johnny misses
zander tumbles into the crowd loses a jump shoe
looks up and sees carmen smiling as she offers him a hand
she helps him up
he holds her hand longer than necessary
are you alright
im getting better
runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers
the tigers lead
johnny frowns when he sees carmen talking to zander on the sidelines shaking his head smiling
finds his shoe straps it on
so what are you doing later
everyone is going to the dance
i dont know
its my last night as acivilian
i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow
zander heads for the field
carmen follows interested
youre going to the academy
thats where i want to go
id love to talk to you abou that
a referee blows his whistle at zander signalling impatiently
im all ears
dont you have to finish the game
are in possession
zander lands hard in front of johnny
dont get any ideas
shes my girl
you can never be sure
johnny scowls at zander turns his head to look back at carmen
she waves smiling
the giants pull ablitz
zander knocks johnny on his ass and the giants score
its tigers giants and less than a minute to go
orders up the next play
johnny keeps looking over his shoulder because zanders back talking to carmen again
flip six three hole
dizzy slams johnny upside his helmet with her forearm
you were drifting
flip six three hole
on one got it
just throw me the ball diz
they make fists and break
takes position again across the line from zander who now grins at johnny broadly
johnny doesnt grin back
at the snap johnny breaks for open field
dizzy throws johnny catches it trips zander up painfully and hurls himself into the end zone as a horn sounds the games finish
rush onto the field as the school band strikes up a victory march
tigers do flips in the air
giants look dejected
zander picks himself up watches johnny leave with carmen
walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture
hes all spiffed up for the big dance
his mother catches him preening in front of a mirror by the transporter in the hall
who said you could grow up so fast
last time i checked you were only five years old
you had such a bright little face
aw dont get mushy
johnnys father enters carrying a federal service catalogue
this came for you today
i presume on your request
a lot of my friends are doing federal service
you arent thinking of applying
have you lost you lost your mind
id rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life
its aterm of service not a career
i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years
johnny people get hurt
people get killed in the federal service
if something happened to you i dont know what i would do
who gave you this idea
its that teacher
whats his name
you know the one i mean
there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station
rasczak doesnt do that at all
he sorta discourages you really
good because youre going to harvard and thats the end of it
its my decision
oh is that how it is
wait you two
dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this
can you guess what it is
a trip to the outer rings
whadya think of that
santori and zegema beach ive always wanted to go there
good good then its all settled
a year at harvard and youll see this federal service is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves citizens and take airs for the rest of
wait a minute
carl is doing his federal and he isnt inferior
hes the smartest kid at school
carls a fine boy
johnny puts on his jacket
i dont know what they teach at harvard but i think im pretty good enough the way i am
well thats what youre saying
youre saying that im not good enough the way i am now
johnny stomps out the transporter goes zappp
why did you go and do that
he was all ready to go zegema beach
at the farewell dance is dressed up
rasczak and other teachers chaperon
a spotlight finds the band leader
alright everybody this is the last dance so lets turn down the lights and make it a slow one
the lights go down
dizzy dressed pretty brightens when she sees johnny standing alone near the dance floor
hey rico wanna dance
actually diz i promised carmen
too bad for her if shes not around
dizzy pulls him onto the floor holds him close
you know its sad
most of us probably wont see each other again after tonight
there is an invitation here
johnny doesnt take it
you still gonna play for brazil
looks like unless tokyo lets me start
well anyone who gets you is lucky
how come we never got together
dizzy looks at johnny meaningfully
carmen crosses the room stunning in her formal
cant we just be friends diz
uh look diz
guess you gotta go
youre the best
johnny heads for carmen
dizzy watches jealously as carmen takes his hand
she looks around for someone to dance with
carl a nerd in a tux waves shyly
johnny wants to kiss her carmen playfully avoids
isnt it great to be in love
how do i know if this is love
it wouldnt be so romantic if we werent
outa the way you two
carl and dizzy dance by dizzy smiling bravely because carl is a terrible dancer
johnny goes in for the kiss again
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation
aw youre in love with me
you just dont know it yet
johnnys confidence makes her smile
johnny moves in to kiss her but the music ends
the lights come up and people head for the doors
johnny sees rasczak
wait i want to talk to mr
ill meet you outside
johnny heads over to rasczak
what is it rico
i just wanted to say thanks cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year
smiling well its not really my job to please
hope you learned something
i wanna join up mr
i think i have what it take to be a citizen
good for you
go find out
well my parents are against it and i know its my choice but i was wondering
what would you do if you were me
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has
use that freedom
make your own choice rico
walks out and finds carmen talking with zander
he wears the blue uniform of a fleet pilot trainee
carmen examines his fleet pin a pair of silver wings
johnny this is zander
yeah we know each other from the game
no hard feeling eh chum
none at all
good luck at the academy
zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic
walk together along the river holding hands
he just got accepted to the fleet academy
isnt that great
yeah sure i guess
no i mean if he can get in maybe i have a chance
what are you talking about
we both know youre gonna be a pilot
zander is going for pilot too
you two have so much in common
carmen pulls johnny to a stop looks him in the eye
johnny rico youre jealous
i cant help it
hes nothing like you
i dont even know if youre my girl
carmen smiles leans in close to johnny
are you the boy for me
im gonna do it carmen
im gonna sign up for federal service
they kiss tentatively but the passion grows and they break apart breathless
making out as they wait their turn
there are a few other people around including a policeman
lets never stop
hey you theres a place for that
without stopping johnny pulls carmen into the flux
kissing at her front door
johnny moves his hand tenatively to carmen s breast
she takes his hand smiling puts it under her shirt
i love you carmen
she puts her mouth on his and they melt together
the door flies open and carmens dad stands there
carmen its late
see you johnny
carmen ducks inside
her father looks johnny over
he carries a terrible battle scar oon his face
i dont want you around carmen anymore
maybe carmens gonna make her own decisions from now on mr
carmens dad reddens
hed like to punch johnny out
carmens gonna be a citizen
she dont need you and your rich family
the federationll give her everything she needs
dad leave him alone
carmens dad slams the door in johnnys face
meet carl in front of the induction center where a staedy flow of prospective citizens file through the main doors
is missing one arm
he smiles broadly at the three teenagers
fresh meat for the grinder eh
where do we sign
he turns in his chair to grab the forms
johnny and his friends see that he is also missing both legs
the recruiting sergeant catches them looking smiles even wider
here and here and here
as he signs johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the recruiting sergeants chest
we hear music the mobile infantery anthem plays softly in honor of distant battles
welcome to the adventure of federal service
follow the blue line
are routed into different lines joining other hopeful civilians
a colonel makes a speech over the loudspeaker
there is no guarantee of service
we dont need all of you
it costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks
many jobs are hazardous to your health
if you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form a
thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights
and others in the line strip down
the guy in front of johnny is don athletic and cheerful
they took my sister theyll take anybody
grimaces as a technician installs an interface plate on his side drawing fluids
oh this is the part that hurts
a psych officer sits down across from each candidate
no talking please
im going to ask you some questions
please answer all questions truthfully
well know if you dont
here in buenos aires
the psych officer checks johnnys response on a meter
is poked and prodded subjected to aural visual and pharmacological stimuli and scanned from head to toe
are your parents currently citizens
which do you think is more important courage or confidence
courage i guess
please complete this sentence
i want to be citizen because
i want to be a citizen because
well because of my girl sir
sits across from a major who views a list on a monitor johnny cant see
im happy to tell you that youve been accepted for federal service
wow thats great
looks like youre quite an athlete
boy look at those reaction stats
the major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list my job is to dertermine what youre best suited for
i want to be a pilot sir
sorry son no way
your school records say you dont have the math skills
johnny swallows this
he knew it was coming
the major deletes pilot from the list then several other items
that rules out the scientific and engineering applications and im afraid we reserve non military options for candidates who are frankly less able bodied than you are son
he turns the monitor around and shows johnny the list
the only thing left is mobile infantery
it looks like the only thing youre good for is cannon fodder
im putting you down for the mobile infantery
proudly takes the federal service oath with about twenty five other people a gleaming silver fleet pin on her chest
she looks around for johnny sees him grinning at her
of my own free will without promise coercion or inducement after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath do now enroll in the
federal service of the terran federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the service
walk out together happily hand in hand
i wonder where carl is
you dont suppose
naw i made it carl made it
just then don rushes past shamefaced crying
he was in the group with me
i guess he didnt
dont make him feel worse
the recruiting sergeant is getting ready to go home
hes got legs now and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on
he grins when he sees them staring
they put me out front to discourage the weak hearted but at the end of the day i go home
howd you kids do
im gonna go for pilot
good for you
we need every pilot we can get
johnny holds the door for carmen and the recruiting sergeant
suddenly carl appears looking a little paler than usual
hey carl whats wrong
did you get starside r d
i dont believe it
i got games theory
well everyones a little impressed by this
thats military intelligence
way to go boy yo
next time we meet ill probably have to salute you
what about you son
the recruiting sergeant beams offers a prosthetic hand
well good for you
the mobile infantery made me the man i am today
just what johnny wanted to hear
they watch the old sergeant walk away
music the mobile infantery theme
carmen takes johnny and carl by the arm as they walk
lets all make a vow
lets swear well always be friends no matter what
ill go for that
well were gonna be millions of light years away from each other and chances are well never see each other again but sure
i cant wait to tell my dad im in
hes gonna be so happy
my fathers probably gonna kill me
stands sullenly as his father rages at him
youll resign and thats all there is to it
it might look bad but if thats the worst you suffer
i wont quit
im telling you you will
youre not going back
youre going to go on vacation
im not going on vacation
i want to be acitizen
its my decision
i made it
johnny turns for the door
his father throws his last shot
you walk out that door youre cut off young man
you understand me
alright thats it youre
walks out grim sees his mother tears in her eyes
johnny why wont you change your mind
does citizenship mean so much to you
well yeah sure
i hope so
i hope you dont ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform
johnnys face reddens
dont talk about my girl that way
johnny turns on his heel heads for the transporter
looks for carmen among hundreds of young people bound for federal service destinations
recruits wear civilian clothes
everyone else is in uniform
outbound group ursa minor and tyko now transporting at bank
now he sees her entering struggling with luggage
johnny rushes to help her and soon he is carrying all her bags
my dad had to help me pack
suddenly hes afraid hes never gonna see me again or something
it was sweet but it took forever
anyway i guess im ready to go
at the freight station carmen enters her federal i
card and gets numbered tags for her bags
im wearing everything i own
johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt
im sorry your parents were so mad
the federationll give me everything i need for the next two years right
carmens already moved to the next line
you talk to carl
he left this morning
he couldnt say where
carmen logs in enters her destination luna tereshkova fleet academy
the tickets station spits out a pass
its exciting but its scary too isnt it
going someplace new where you dont know anyone
carmen heads toward a bank of transporters
johnny stops her takes her by the arms
im gonna miss you
ill miss you too johnny
i love you
outbound group a tereshkova all sections transporting at bank

she scans her pass but johnny stops her again

we all have one thing in common
we were all stupid enough to sign up for mobile infanterie

which is funny because johnny says i joined up to be with him but why would i do that
he doesnt even like me

everyone look down at johnnys crotch laughing
johnny blushes grabs a towel and exits the shower
pans the barracks with a little handcam neat bunks in a row other recruits lounging around in their skivvies
i know its not much but its home
over theres my bunk where i dream about you every night
ace kitten smith shujumi and breckinridge dance around and moon the camera

johnny moves the camera away from the guys
katrina walks by from the shower with dizzy mugs into frame
hey whats going on

johnny heads for the door

watches the end of johnnys letter
ace continues to sing

the letter ends
a bald cadet pilot smacks her on the arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit
orbit in five ibanez
first one there gets to fly
grinning carmen grabs her duffel takes off after her
and the bald cadet race for the hatch past other recruits
gets there first jumps into the pilot seat
the bald pilot takes second seat
looking it down
two late cadets duck in through the closing hatch door
oh no not ibanez again shes crazy
on my mark in three two one
straeks upward from the lunar floor past orbitting training platforms where cadets in brightly colored pressure suits float against the earth which hangs beyond the horizon
blasts past a destroyer orbiting in dock zips between corvettes and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of luna
the two late cadets are terrified
geez i thought i liked to fly fast
this is nothing
today i get to fly that
now visible from behind a host of smaller ships starship athena of older design but impressive
arrives on the bridge dark cramped all business
she salutes the instructor captain deladier s
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty maam
take the number one chair ibanez
follow all instructions of you supervisor
carmen turns for her station but stops in her tracks
her supervisor is zander barcalow now a nd lieutenant
what are you doing here
im the guy whos gonna teach you to fly this crate
carmen logs on
the ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee
you must be some kind of a hot stick
should i call you sir
only when i give you an order
prepare for departure
carmen and zander go to work
its amazing us running into each other like this
maybe its fate
i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy solid math a little wild on the stick but a natural
when it turned out it was you i made sure wed run into each other
alright take her out ibanez
all eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick
the ship shudders under her hand
she winks at zander
in simulation my supervisors could never keep up
this isnt simulation anymore
takeer out easy cadet
oh yes sir
twenty five by five roll seven
and dont exceed port speed
carmen rocks the stick and the view from the bridge spins smoothly away from the dense orbiting yards os luna toward the outer system
they revoke our flight status
oh i see
carmen jogs past lumbering freighters
steady as she goes number one
prepare for warp
number two design for jupiter orbit
star drive in three
space appears to bend
zander and carmen share a smile
they blur together becoming one then wham
disappears in a flash of blinding light
have been divided into two teams
red team includes ace katrina breckinridge and djanad
johnny shujumi kitten smith and dizzy are part of blue team
the object of this exercise is to capture your enemys flag before your enemy captures yours
bronski passes out morita smartrifles
these weapons have been modified for this exercise
if your enemy hits you your suit will fail
you will be unable to move
you will be as good as dead
bumps the magnification of her heads up display to survey blue teams flag guarded by two recruits
she jumps down to joining other red team members on the move
its right over the next ridge
only two guards
johnny kitten smith and dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass
djanad and the others collapse as their suits fail djanad laughing because playing at war seems funny
you are now prisoners of the blue team
tell us your plans or die
name rank and mind your own business is all you get from me
opens fire as the blue team appears
shujumi and other blue team members go down in an ambush led by breckinridge
johnny dives for cover and finds himself sharing it with dizzy
im going in
kitten smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team
ace and katrina open fire from two new hidden red team positions taking kitten and his team down with a cross fire
man theyre defended
no way in
flip six three hole
run a flip six three hole play and you might score
johnny looks at the course in a new way nods
you got it
johnny tumbles open ground vaults into the air
dizzy takes out breckinridge as he rises to fire
johnny lands knocks out katrina then ace
he picks up aces fallen morita
watch johnny firing both moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining red team defenders
he grabs the red team flag and hurls it into the air like spear
kids got some moves
line up in the door of a skimmer the militarys standard utility aircraft to practice drops from altitude
rico im making you sqaud leader
sir thank you sir
dont stand there dumb
johnny jumps plummeting toward the earth
next in line ace scowls
have some free time
johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons that designate him as squad leader
look at him
do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself
zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose i guess
i just want you guys to know that ill never do anything that i havent asked you to do first
johnny approaches dizzy
couldntve done it without you diz
dizzy smiles shakes
bronski walks through with the mail
johnny grabs the e disk pops it into his handcam
the fleet mail logo appears bet its from my girl
johnnys pals gather for a look
carmen appears dressed down to skivvies in her quarters aboard starship athena
hi johnny i wouldve written sooner but theyve really got us going every moment here
yeow rico you dont deserve that
im glad youre doing so well
if they havent made you squad leader by now im sure you will
johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously
all it takes is the love of a good woman
the image changes abrupltly
now carmens wearing a trim blue flight suit
she stands the camera on athenas gunnery deck
outside the rings of saturn sparkle in bright solar light
look at that
isnt it beautiful
i had to show you
its great to be out here on my own
im just not some little girl from buenos aires anymore
im gonna be a starship pilot and im gonna see the universe
she sighs and thats also the problem because i dont really want to get married johnny
i dont want to have kids
i want a command a ship of my own and you know i dont think thats gonna leave a lot of room for you and me
johnny is stunned
all the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do
i know thats not what you wanted to hear
but i have to follow my heart
im afraid youll hate me and i couldnt stand that
write me alright
write me so ill know that well always be friends
the fleet mail logo appears again end of message
johnny shuts the handcam off
ace puts a hand on his shoulder
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out
its what i deserve
whadya talkin about
i joined up for her
i wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for her
im a fool
you made squad leader on your own and hey you still got me to kick around
johnny smiles in spite of himself
johnny turns for the door flipping the chevrons like a coin
dizzy watches him leave
shed so like to comfort him
arm their marauder power suits
zim and bronski wear command model suits with rank designations
johnny checks weapons scans the electronics on each squad members power suit
with the marauders visual capabilities all you have to do is look at something to hit it so you will exercise extreme care on my firing line
do you get me
sir yes sir
the live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide
if you do not hit your target it will shoot you
fifty blackened automated target drones fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls gullies and three story building facades
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury but if you are hit you will be non operational and your team score will suffer accordingly
rico has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check
sir yes sir
on a signal from zim the live fire combat range comes to life as the target drones take cover and disappear from view
perfect score for this exercise is
b company came through last week with
i expect you to do better
take out the target drones as they appear
halfway through the course a recruit takes a hit and goes down immobilized
djanad has a clear shot but breckinridge gets in her way
youre in my line of fire breckinridge before the others can react a second drone appears
everyone kisses dirt
pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead
shujumi rises to fire a round slams him back to the ground
johnny and djanad knock out the two drones
alright no more screw ups
ace takes point
diz you and kitten smith cover the flanks
djanad youre rear guard
the squad resumes ist advance
breckinridge bangs on his helmet
there is something wrong with his head up display
whats the problem
lose another rifle were gonna mess up our score
let me see
breckinridge takes off helmet hands it to johnny
djanad turns on breckinridge
her head up zeroes him
how come when something goes wrong its always you breckinridge
thats when djanad trips on a loose stone
she fumbles her rifle and it discharges
the round tears the top of breckinridges head off
the recruits stare in horror
zim arrives with bronski on the bounce
rico you are relieved of squad command
levy mcintire you will escort private rico to the c
the recruits watch johnny leave stare aghast at their dead comrade
no one looks at djanad who stands alone sobbing
stands before the c
braced by katrina and ace
zim and the c
are both saddened by the proceedings
rico did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet
sir yes sir
breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction and i asked him to show it to me sir
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit rico
sir no sir
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise
sir i needed everyone in my squad operational sir
i wanted to win sir
sigh you disobeyed safety regulation
you may of course demand trial by court martial
sir no sir
do you freely admit to the charges made against you
i guess i do sir
zim looks out the window
djanad dressed for travel in civilian clothes crying as she heads off down washout lane
sergeant weve lost two recruits over this incident already
is there any possibility of salvaging this man
zim i believe so sir
well try administrative punishment
until then you are confined to your quarters rico
looks out the window to the parade ground where a post has been erected
the recruits look up as zim enters
alright lets go rico
johnny takes off his shirt
ace who now holds the chevrons of squad leader watches feels bad for his pal
stand with recruits from other platoons
johnny is led to the post and strung up as the c
reads the charge
for incompetence of command for failure to abide by safety regulations in a live fire exercise for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate
zim steps up to johnny offers him a red rubber mouthpiece
bite on this
recruit trainee john rico is sentenced to administrative punishment
johnny takes it in his mouth
his tear away shirt is torn away
johnny stands at the post alone
corporal bronski a big man with an unhappy task unrolls his whip
you may carry out the sentence
johnnys face wrenched by pain spontanous tears a terrible sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece
dizzy flinches for johnny
ace looks away
zim watches without any apparent emotion
johnny faints sagging against his tether
cruises past metric tons of star class destroyer fighters and landing boats lining her open hangar deck
works alone on the empty bridge
zander brings coffee for himself and carmen
you read my mind
third watch always seems to last forever
oh i dont know
depends on who you are spending it with
he caresses her hair
she kisses his hand
zander notices the plot map
no i replotted the course
its more efficient this way
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all huh
hey check it
zander slides into his chair runs a check
you know i was talking to captain deladier and she said
dont change the subject
am i right
well whadya know
dont mess with the boss
so whatd the captain say
she got a command
and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her
she thinks were good together
you and me huh
zander turns his chair so they are very close moves a finger along her hand up her arm and playfully around her breasts
i have a feeling about us
were good together way ahead of the curve in every department
i seem to be able to anticipate your needs
you know what i want
carmen grabs him between his legs
no what do you want
zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately
she brteaks it off gets serious for amoment
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet
day and night cycle
they start to caress again when suddenly alarms sound
captain deladier appears on the hot screen still waking up
captain we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed
carmen and zander frantically check their displays
it looks like an
in this part of the system
carmen and zander see it through the front screens a huge asteroid tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed
carmen breaks glass that reads emergency retros arms the switch within and fires the rockets
torques to one side
the asteroid grazes the ship cutting ahuge gash in athenas hull
ice and rock travelling in ist wake shreds zander brace themseves as diamond hard particles pound the front screens
the ship continues to tumble
loses its mooring tumbling into other craft explosions ripping the deck
are sucked into space
others hang on frantically as automatic doors seal athenas wound and their fates
deladier arrives on the bridge now crowded as other flight officers rush to their stations
zanders going through star charts
whered it come from
trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone
number contact fleet and tell em theres a loose asteroid headed their way
communications are down maam
were lucky to be alive maam
deladier notices carmen staring at a monitor stunned
a dead cap trooper trails in the wreckage of the flight deck
good work number
thank you maam
wears his civilian clothes pcks as the other recruits get ready for the days training
no one says anything
he moves stiffly careful of his back
it stinks you goin
i dont stay where im not wanted
if they didnt want you they woulda kicked you out amigo
hey they humiliated me in front of everyone
im just supposed to take it huh
well im not gonna and i guess that proves i just cant cut it
corporal bronski leans in impassive
your calls going through rico
take it there
a nearby vu phone lights up
the screen flashes ringing his mother appears when she picks up the other end
you little rat
you havent called you havent written
its been so lonely here without you
the screen splits as johnnys father activates an extension
wheres your uniform
johnnys mother makes a face to shut him up
well its just good to hear from you

well all have dinner

well talk it out and have a good glass of wine
well we love you son
the sky in buenos aires seems to darken perceptively
johnnys mother looks out the window
oh my whats that
looks like rain
this time of the year
the transmission ends abruptly
a phone company logo appears your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference
please try your call again later
johnny zips his duffel hefts it gingerly over his shoulder
well see ya
you take the stroll down washout lane youre only proving one thing johnny
whats that diz
that you dont have what it takes to be acitizen
dizzy turns on her heel and marches away
signs form a
zim stands as witness
now you sergeant
zim signs bitterly
thats it son
you can go
and zim turn to other things
johnny picks up his duffel and heads out the door
walks alone sad
a skimmer hums by overhead and he looks after it
out across the parade ground he sees the glint of marauder power suits as recruits tumble the obstacle course
reaches the little white fence that leads to the transporter
he turns back for one last look and notices people running to the comminications shack
kitten smith runs by
hey kitten whats going on
joins others to see whats on the federal net
recruits non coms and officers gather without any sense of military decorum
people cry openly among them corporal bronski
millions dead a city in ruins
on screen the smoldering ruins of what was once a huge city
oh jeez is that geneva
goddam bugs whacked us johnny
buenos aires has been wiped of the earth
nothing lives in what was once called the latin paradise
johnny is horrified
dizzy is suddenly standing next to him
aw johnny geez
the federal court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the arachnid threat
johnny sets his jaw turns and runs for the c

animation illustrates the insect treachery
the meteor derived from here near klendathu in the arachnids home system

shrugs turns away watching the news of the coming war
zim tears up the a

out of the ashes of buenos aires comes first sorrow then anger
the only good bug is a dead bug

so youre not to worried about fighting the arachnids
hey shoot a nuke down a bug hole lotta dead bugs am i right

some say the bugs were provoked by human attempts to colonize within the aqz that a live and let live policy is preferable to war with the bugs
yeah well im from buenos aires and i say killem all
and his friends drink at a crowded bar
around the room theres singing and dancing a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement but nearby a veteran drinks alone

johnny looks up and sees carmen
she lloks graet in uniform with the hat and the lieutenants bars on her shoulders
johnny remembers himself snaps to attention salutes
dizzy and the others follow suit
carmen salutes back sheepish
guess i oughta lose the hat when im off duty eh
dizzy disgusted turns back to ace and kitten smith
carmen tucks her hat under her arm
her hair is very short
what happened to your hair
what do you think
everyone did it when we got our wings
you dont like it do you
its alright i guess

carmen shakes her head sadly
sometimes i forget
then it hits me and i cant stop crying
i try just to be happy im still alive
you dont look very happy to see me

life is so different from the way it was
one day youll see what i did was best for both of us
zander leaves a group of fleet officers to join them
everything coposetic lieutenant
zander you remember johnny
zander and i are a flight team now
zander puts his arm around carmen gives her a squeeze
best in the fleet
i get it
this is the part thats best for both of us
dont do me anymore favors eh
johnny turns to leave
forget it carmen
the mobile infantery does a thankless dirty job so they naturally tend to be short tempered thoughtless and rude
johnny turns back to face zander
you got something to say about the mobile infantery
you heard me
wanna make something out of it private
not with an officer no sir
doesnt mint stupid cap troopers
everyone can see whats about to happen
a circle is forming fleet on one side mobile infantery on the other
lets disregaed rank
everybody hear that
rank is not an issue here
zander takes off his hat
whats he gonna do
johnny punches him right in the nose
zander goes down bleeding
ace and kitten smith grab johnny
whoa easy there buddy
zander staggers to his feet ready to fight but fleet officers pull him back
carmen looks at johnny the hate in his eye the blood on his fist
whats wrong with you
hey its just a vestigal response to procreation
carmen turns away stung
johnny immediately regrets
dizzy for her part couldnt be happier
forget it johnny
cap troopers and fleet werent meant to mix
grinds his teeth as a laser mounted on a robot arm finishes slicing an intricate pattern into his arm
dizzy ace and kitten smith awtch grinning passing a bottle
ace pours booze directly into the fresh wound
no this hurts
well heres to it
were gonna fightn and were gonna win
they put their arms side by side
each has a similiar scar lightning bolts on a shield and the words death from above
mobile infantery rules
death to all bugs
dont get any on you
of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet
the mobile infantery anthem plays loke holst pounding and relentless
the invasion has begun
and his platoon wearing fully armed marauder power suits wait to drop with other cap troopers
their mood is grim
lieutenant willy easy going and confident enters
officer on deck
everyone snaps to attention
we got hot poop straight from the top willys wildcats is in with the first wave
means more bugs for us to kill
this does nothing to break the tension
now if you follow orders and remember your training i guarantee youll make it back alive
there are none
next we got a little last minute briefing from military intelli gence i think youre gonna like
the briefingplays on head up displays and the ready room screens
a captive bug warrior clicks and shrieks as federal scientists torture it
the troopers cheer
everyday federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help
the head scientists turns and speaks to camera
johnny and dizzy share an amazed grin noticing a difference in their old friend something that speaks of
to defeat the enemy we must know the enemy
take for instance your basic arachnid warrior
minimal iq armored completely lethal
you can blow a limb off
carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off
the insect screams
and its still combat effec tive
but heres a tip aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good
carl fires again
the bug kicks and squeals as it dies
carl tosses the pulse gun aside
now while you are out killing bugs we want you to be our eyes and ears
the bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward earth
we need to know how they do this
if you encounter any plasma report it immediately to your superior
good luck and good hunting
the briefing ends as klaxons sound
this is the captain speaking
all personnel prepare for drop
we are at d minus three and counting
johnny and the other troopers climb into capsules on the port track
dizzy gives him thumbs up
the capsule seals as it moves with the others down the firing tube
gets the shakes as the capsule bumps and booms toward the firing tube
willy appears on the head up display
smash the entire area kill anything that has moren a couple legs and dont any of you loafers come back aboard with unexpended bombs
sweat rolls down his face hyperventilation
stream toward klendathu from the rear tubes starships of bull run
we move down the line past mannerheim dauntless george marshall and yamamoto to the rodger young
holds rodger young in tight maneuver
suddenly a burst of blue bug plasma rips past the starboard bow
from the planet
according to military intelligence itll be random and light
drop is complete maam
two more bursts of bug plasma streak past
steady as she goes number
burn when they hit atmosphere outer skin tearing away in big silver sheets
takes in entry data from the heads up display
surface in twenty fivr seconds lz has been identified beacon is in place
watches nervously as deadly bursts of bug plasma fill the heavens around the battle group
below the surface of klendathu fairly bistles with outgoing defensive fire
this isnt random or light
someone made amistake
thats it were empty maam
out the front screens a blast from below hits george marshall amidships and it reels into yamamoto
both starships begin to burn
someone made a big goddam mistake
get us out of here number
carmen dodges past burning ships avoids collision with dauntless and then ka wham
carmen flies out of her station and into camera hard
johnny is sitting on air
surface in fifteen seconds
deploying chute now
the chute pops
across the sky lit by outgoing bug plasma he can see hundreds of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer
its quiet in the clouds then looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield
plasma blasts exploode into the sky
thousands of bugs boil out of the ground to defend against the invader
surface in five
johnny burns his chute off drops the last hundred feet and lands on the bounce
of bug batteries screaming voices on the com concussions shaking the ground
none of it compares to the sound of his own racing heartbeat
lieutenant willy shouts
up there on the ridge
well nuke those bug positions from theaaaaaaaa
a hopper an airborne arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and pop out wings for gliding lands on lieutenant willy and cracks his head like a nut
johnny and ace open fire backing away
pulse rounds tear it apart bug guts gushing
lieutenants bought the farm
wheres the sarge
i didnt see him
now comes a flood of workers building ever advancing fortifications and with them hundreds of deadly arachnid warriors
here they come
ace whatre we doing
dizzy and the others open fire simultanously
the whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons
shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects
you want some
dont waste your ammon on the workers
shujumi cant hear
a warrior finds him rips his leg off hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs
he fights screaming
a claw reaches for his face ripping the top of his head off
lets get out of here
now the ground opens behind her and a huge meters tanker bug lumbers out of the ground its funnel shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes
the tanker bug sprays and hits katrina
she screams as her legs melt out from under her
warriors converge to feed on her
ace wants to help her but johnny blocks him
cmon katrina was right

a hopper pounces on kitten smithm and he goes down screaming
johnny touches down stares in horror as kitten smiths head rolls past his fee
johnny opens up with his pulse cannon
the hopper attacks puts a claw right through johnnys thigh
crushing jaws close around him crushing cutting his flesh
johnny brings the muzzle of the pulse gun under the hoppers nerve stem and splat
blows its head apart
where are you
but dizzy cant find johnny and soon shes lost in the smoke
johnny looks down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes
now two more arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping smoke
he fires his pulse rifle empty and dropping it crawls desperately dragging his useless leg
oh god help me
please help me
a third arachnid warrior rears up in front of him deadly jaws slashing down toward him when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a point
blank pulse cannon

johnny reaches out
a steel hand takes his dragging him back as bugs attack
his rescuerss pulse cannon thunders overhead

a bloody bandage wraps carmens head
zander nods grimly
of crewmen and cap troopers are being off loaded via conveyer belt
zander and carmen make their way up the steep companionway beside the ghastly conveyer belt

carmen takes his hand
zander kisses her

so whos got time to get married
carmen lets his hand go and leaps through the hatch
zander falls back onto the conveyer belt finds himself eyeball to eyeball with a horribly maimed trooper scrambles to get off
joins carmen in the crowded common area where dead bodies compete for space with wounded awaiting triage
survivors watch casualty lists scroll ba on a federal net terminal
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers
youd probably get a promotion out of it
im not kidding
marriage is no funny theres almost no wounded at all
hey bugs dont take prisoners
carmen looks at the words at the net terminal would you like to know more
she bites her lip enters johnnys name
in an instant she has the news oh no
tears fill her eyes
she rushes away
zander looks at johnnys name on the screen shrugs presses the erase button
finds carmen sagging against a wall weepimg
im sorry carmen

zander puts an arm around her
she holds on tight
oh zander im a fool

zander kisses her hair
tears roll down her face
no dont you see
no one can wait for anything anymore
we should get married
zander holds carmen as she sobs feeling lucky
floats suspended in fluid mouth hanging open his skin white as death
a low underwater knocking wakes him
he opens his eyes and sees ace and dizzy outside the tank
ace holds up a kia list pointing at johnnys name laughing rico john v kia
their voices are distant and garbled
dizzy cups her hands against the side of the tank
two more days
johnnys wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue
johnny gives a weak thumbs up
the knocking sound continues
a steel hand taps the side of the tank
johnny grins astonished
the man wearing it is his former high school teacher now a lieutenant jean rasczak
consisting of starships their tender freighters and other supply craft
stows his gear along with ace and dizzy
acroos the room a collection of battle hardened vets check out the newcomers
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires
he was our teacher
he was great
yeah well i hear hes a real nutbuster
the roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit in nd brigade
only took casualties on big k
they size up the roughnecks
there are scars power prosthetics and one big sugar watkins wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck
seeing as how were about all thats left of st brigade youd have to call that an improvement
to sugar watkins you top kick
are you kidding
they always get killed

i wouldnt mind
corporal birdie turns gives johnny the once over
dizzy looks her over
not too big but shes tough
where you been besides big k
i always wanted to go to zegema beach
its not there anymore
is your lieutenant as bad as they say
birdie belts him and ace goes down
no one talks about the lieutenant that way
he saved my life
ace jumps up ready to fight but other roughnecks block him
same for me
johnny and dizzy shrug
aces on his own
sounds like he is quite a guy
sergeant gillespie steps into the room
everyone snaps to
this is for you new people
i only have two rules
rule one everyone fights
rule two no one quits
if you dont do your job ill kill you myself
do you get me
we get you sir
he points at johnnys earring with his steel hand
get rid of the jewelry
i hate it
welcome to the roughnecks
the roughnecks cheer
rasczak smiles vaguely
theres a new sky marshall and a new plan
were gonna clean out the systems outlying klendathu one planet at a time
tomorrow we hit tango urilla
after fleet glasses the planet m
stand sentry on earthworks that tower the entrance to their colony where an endless line of workers enter bearing foodstuff appropriate to this exotic jungle planet
a distant sound
a warrior looks up curious
suddenly a formation of tac fighters screams down from high orbit and a white hot nuclear firestorm burns consumes the landscape
bugs scream as they twist and kick in the wall of flame
heat melts the dirt into dark glass
ash turns the sky red
the out of the smoke come rasczak and his roughnecks
spread out teams of three
when you locate a bug hole secure it gas it and close it
streak by overhead
on the ground johnny dizzy and ace are on the bounce
ace spots a bug hole where workers and warrors have broken through the glassed surface
rockets take out warriors
bug guts go flying
dizzy sets workers on fire
johnnx and ace step over burning bug carcasses to the rim of the hole and fire their gas rounds
fire in the hole
johnny drops an h
round and theyre in the air when the explosion collapses the entrance to the bug city
you new guys over there
we could use some help
boil out of the ground
birdie sugar watkins and other roughnecks are about to be overrun when johnny touches down wuth ace and dizzy
looks like youve got a little bug problem maam
stow it trooper
give it verything youve got
the cao troopers let the bugs have it but the insects keep coming the living crawling over the dead and now trudging up out of the ground comes a the
tanker bug starts to spray creating a toxic perimeter around the hole
rasczak arrives just as birdie takes a chemical hit falling to ground minus an arm screaming
johnny jumps landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole
it turns with surprising speed
johnny flips up onto its back cracks its armor with his pulse cannon
sugar in for pick up
rasczak and sugar watkins pull birdie to safety
johnny fires a rocket into the hole hes made in the tanker bugs back and jumps clear
the big bug explodes
gas that hole and close it
the roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole
johnny touches down beside rasczak
whered you learn to do that soldier
uni high tigers sir
dont you remember
i was captain of the team
im not interested in nostalgia rico i need a corporal
youre it until youre dead or i find someone better
rasczak turns away gives birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer
dont worry birdie your next arm comes with a factory guarantee
dizzy and ace gather around johnny clap him on the back
way to go amigo
im gonna need a squad leader
big k taught me i aint executive material
what about it diz
a snappy salute looks like im your girl sir
tac fighters reel by over head
suddenly bug plasma shoots skyward from the flatlands below
several tac fighters are blown out of the air
flaming debris rains down
saddle up roughnecks
thats our trash
roughnecks head out on the bounce
and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery a charred circular pit some ten meters across
inside something is moving
what kind of stinkin bug is that
johnny jumps the magnification on his head up
down in the pit a giant translucent plasma bug rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery
you never seen how they do it before
johnny shakes his head
swollen breeder bugs gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly
its making me sick
the plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction
its gonna pop
the plasma bug explodes in its cauldron
a blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens
now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew
sergeant gillespie points
a hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the roughneck position
we must be right over the colony
lets get some air support eh
fleet this is roughneck patrol over
rasczak moves off down the line giving orders
corporal i want pulse cannons there and there
rifle teams spread out along the ridge
sugar bring up that flame thrower
fleets pulling the battle group back to safe distance
theyd like us to knock out those batteries sir
theyd rather spend our lives than risk their ships
whos got the nuke
thatd be me sir
heat it up
dizzy activates a tactical nuke
it makes a distinctive highpitched squeal
roughnecks you may fire at will
the roughnecks open fire
bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing
a warrior breeches their line
sugar watkins torches it
the nukes ready light flashes
im hot sir
johnny blows a warrior away from the edge
dizzy leans over and fires
the rocket streaks down toward the battery
an explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white
when color returns johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the bug battery
now comes the part i hate the most
we go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead
fight their way down gassed out tunnels into bug city
they meet warrors at every turn and kill them
helmet lamps make weird shadows of dead bugs piled everywhere along the way
you knew the lieutenant before the war
what was he like
he was a teacher kind of a know it all
always had this little smile
geez i dont think ive ever seen him smile
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared
johnny joins rasczak ace and dizzy and they blow away several warriors guarding the entrance of a large chamber
are eight meters long with corpulent bodies and tiny heads
only one survives and though she is herself dying her abdomen rippled by life within continues to undulate
all dead except one sir
kill the bitch
dizzys pulse cannon rips open the dying queen
thousands of wriggling premature bugs come spilling out
horrified knee deep roughnecks set them afire
unload pre fab barracks from hercules cargo boats
rasczak stands banging a spoon on his mess kit
tango urilla is now bug free
means the roughnecks have killed a helluva lotta bugs
rasczak kicks open a cargo module
beer kegs rool out
he kicks open a second module
inside musical instruments
ace picks up a violin
i expect the best but i give the best
habve some fun
thats an order
leads a little quartet plays a sweet fiddle
roughnecks laugh and dance
dizzy tries to pull johnny into the fun
nah i dont do that anymore
you used to dance
i said no

well excuse me sir
dizzy heads back to the others
johnny turns and finds rasczak regarding him with an odd sad smile
yopu asked me some advice once rico

lieutenant brigades on the com
rasczak heads away
johnny joins dizzy
johnny takes her hand bows implishly
may i have the honor
he pulls her out among the others and they begin to dance
ace watches with a grin puts some spirit in his fiddle
is in holo conference with an intelligence officer at we received a distress call from planet p priority code requesting reinforcement
i thought th brigade cleaned out p
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago
thats why micom wants onsite assessment
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed
the intelligence officer reddens
take your group down to p and have a look see
leave the thinking to us lieutenant
thats not your job
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs major and if youre walking me into a trap bugs dont lay traps
they arent intelligent
unlike you theyre stupid enough to follow orders
thatll be all major
the intelligence officer disappears abruptly
a new hologram appears
rasczaks jaw drops
its his former student carl jenkins now a colonel weary and pissed off
this conference is over
do your duty lieutenant
thats an order
rasczak recovers salutes stiffly
are making love
the door pops open
rasczak stands there
dizzy ducks under the covers
johnny manages a salute
corporal the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately
get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics
whos that with you
dizzy shows herself grinning
report in ten minutes
rasczak slams the door shut on them
they fall back into one anothers arms laughing as they resume lovemaking
what kind of name is that
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy
move through canyons of towering wind carved rock formations
gillespie carries the communications package
i dont understand it lieutenant
its not getting anything from th brigade
not even their transponder
keep trying sergeant
walk in a column far below
something is watching from the above
hoppers lots of them moving from rock to rock for better position
sees something out of the corner of his eye
the hoppers hit
several roughnecks go down
everyone opens up
dive bombing bugs are blown to bits
roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground
johnny watch out
a burning bug hurls itself at johnny
johnny jumps out of the way as dizzy fires blowing it apart
the deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks
move out into the open
in the distance they see th brigade hq a walled compound and partially constructed landing pad
gillespie put in call for retrieval
were off this rock
gillespie do you read me
two hoppers are pulling gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast
throw a rifle
dizzy tosses her morita to rasczak
gillespie writhes in the hoppers claws
rasczak fires killing gillespie
i expext any one here to do the same for me
rico watkins flores levy prepare for rear guard action
the rest of you make for th brigade
johnny and the others cover the roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls
johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air
a second wave of hoppers come in
for now the sky is clear
is meters by standard issue pre fab
the roughnecks land on the compound wall
inside worker bugs graze on the remains of dead cap troopers strewn over the complex
jeez command really humped the bunk on this one
rasczak turns away
roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically killing the workers
rico youre acting sergeant now
my last sergeant lost the com pack
put together a search team and find the radio shack
we need retrieval
surveys the aftermath of the last stand with rasczak insect and human dead everywhere
its here sir
enter the radio room
a dead major is slumped over the console with hole in the back of his head
johnny checks the equipment

diz see what you can do
im on it
dizzy goes to work
rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead majors head
whats that look like to you rico
looks like a bug was in his brain sir
lieutenant i think youre gonna wanna see this sir
in the middle of the floor is surrounded by carnage
dirty bugs came in right when they were having chow
gas that hole and seal it
then they hear a sound
tap tap tap
rasczak signals for quiet
tap tap tap tap
its coming from the kitchen
the noise is coming from a freezer
ace stands ready to fire
johnny levers open the door jumps back as general owen tumbles out face first
officer on the deck sir
pick up the general
roughnecks prop him up
general owen tries to talk but no words come out
rasczak bends down to listen
you gotta get me out
general owen sir
the old man grins hugely relieved
at ease lieutenant
thank god for you for all of you
this is grand
so wheres the boat

diz whats with the uplink
dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls
workin on it
they get in your mind
they make you do things
they did it to farley
he points at the hole of the dead majors head
the distress call
the bugs wanted us to rescue you
oh you can be sure of it
they were biding their time
waiting for the most opportune moment
rasczaks lost interest in the general
hes on the com
to all roughnecks this is rasczak
prepare for attack
we are going to be attacked
they werent gonna do it to me
i know too many secrets
rasczak looks at general owen with contempt
fire in the hole
an explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole
blinks as he steps out into the light
roughnecks snap to attention
general owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen collapsing to his knees
all of my boys and girls
the roughnecks are shocked
theyve never seen a general break down before
lieutenant rasczak slaps owen hard
your soldiers dead and youre not
i wish youd shoot me
and it looks like rasczak just might but just then ace touches down next to johnny and rasczak
lieutenant we got trouble
and johnny join other stunned roughnecks to see thousands of bugs on the march from every direction
bug batteries open up in the distance
warm it all up
everything you got
levy collect the big guns from the towers
watkins put general owen with the wounded
rico wheres my communications

johnny runs for the communications room

johnny races out the door
is white hot as roughnecks on the walls unload nukes
johnny crosses the compound lands next to rasczak on the wall
boat coming down sir
the roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes
all nuked out
johnny scans the battlefield
nukes have turned the surface into dark glass
now out of the smoke come the bugs steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet
jeez we musta killed a million already
not enough i guess
sugar watkins sees genera owen in the compound below stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers
general stay with the wounded
sir the general
ah the hell with him
hoppers sweep into the compound
the roughnecks open fire
general owen make easy pickings for ones that get through
form a circle
if no living bug comes over that wall we cannot be harmed
dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the roughnecks fall back into the compound
bugs pile in over the walls
the circle affords them degrees of kill zone
rico flores watkins levy
we control the sky until retrieval
rasczak sugar watkins johnny and dizzy stand back to back in the center of the circle sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers
hoppers are blown to pieces
getting low here sir
rounds and counting sir
make every shot count
johnny looks up
a retrieval boat hurtles down through bursts of bug plasma takes a grazing hit rights itself with retros and lands within the circle
roughnecks cheer saved
sergeant secure the boat
roughnecks move to protect the boat
the hatch blows open
board the wounded
dead bugs ring the compound walls forming ramps for living insect soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers
move to retrieval on my command
first group now
the circle shrinks as roughnecks fall back and board the boat
more and more bugs pile in over the compound walls
suddenly the ground collapses under rasczak
he falls in to his waist vomits blood as something chews on him from below
cover us ace
ace and the others fire from the boat
johnny and dizzy fire at the ground around rasczak
rasczak stops screaming
they try to pull him free

the compund wall collapses
a wave of bugs charges in
rico tellem to glass this goddam planet

weakly rasczak picks up his pulse gun checks the power

johnny and dizzy run for the boat
rasczak opens fire picking his shots but soon the bugs are all over him
cmon you sons of bitches

at the boat dizzy turns to look back at rasczak
a hopper swoops down on dizzy its claws ripping into her abdomen
johnny blows the bug off her back
blood sprays from a deep gash in her neck
johnny picks her up tries to stop the blood with his hand
the life is leaving her eyes
hang on diz
dont die on me
a tanker bug breaches the broken wall
ace jumps out to help his friends
the hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays
the boat blasts off dripping metal
holds dizzy in his arms drenched in her blood fighting g forces as the boats heads for orbit
i bought the farm didnt i johnny
no youre gonna be alright diz
its alright cause i got to have you johnny
medics push johnny aside go to work on dizzy
slams into the cockpit
out the front screen violent bursts of bug plasma fill the sky as they break atmosphere
get on the com and tell fleet to glass that rock
the co pilot turns around
his eyes narrow
on whose authority corporal
this would be mine sir
acting sergeant john rico
ive assumed command on this mission
the pilot turns around
i thought you were dead
im not but alot of my soldiers are
glass the planet
carmen punches up fleet command
rodger young this is inbound shuttle de ruyter with an official request from the mobile infantery to bombard planet p
returns to dizzys side as the medics struggle to save her
blood pours out of her mouth
her body thrashes
a medic slaps her
her head lolls mouth open eyes blank
they drop her and move on to the next casualty
johnny sits there stunned
carmen enters from the cockpit
negative on your request
fleet command has the battle group on standby
carmen sees dizzy lying dead on the deck
we gotta choke on the mud and the blood and fleet cant be bothered to spit
no i think somethings up
the sky marshalls here
she points out for a viewing port
fifteen battle groups ships strong lay off planet p all of them dwarfed by the sky marshalls flagship buenos aires
i thought you were kia johnny
that was just a mix up
you look so
i dont know you look like youve really been in it
what happened to your eye
carmen touches the scar over her eye
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k
i like it
lands on the flight deck of the rodger young in the midst of the flotilla
enters watches carmen dress
she hums as she checks herself in the mirror touches thr scar over her eye smiles
where are you going
that girl who died on the way up his girl
how do you feel about him now
i dont know zander
enters as johnny speaks
dizzy is laid out in dress gray
the surviving roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects
dizzy bought the farm
she was my good friend and friens are the best luck anyone gets
but in war we must go on without our friends
we take with us their memory and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death
let me tell you what it is dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting
several intelligence officers march into the bay
officer on deck
everyone snaps to attention
colonel carl jenkins strides into the room
his eyes are hollow and he looks grim
he returns johnnys salute nods to carmen
please continue sergeant
dizzy wouldnt want our tears
shed want us to remember her
with a vengeance
so go out and kill a bug for dizzy
kill as many as you can
you are her revenge and every bug you kill honors her death
johnny nods to the gunnery crew
they load dizzys body into a tube
johnny steps back salutes dizzy
womb to tomb cap trooper
womb to tomb
the crew chief fires the tube
out the viewports a pulse of light disperses into space
the roughnecks file out
carmen takes johnny and carl by the hand
well look at this
the three of us back together again
how are you carl
johnny im sorry it had to be your unit on planet p
that mission had a very low survival probability
bugs laid a trap didnt they
elegant proof of intelligence isnt it
we thought there might be a brain on p
you knew and you sent them anyway
a colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a brain
we think generations
woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasnt a brain
carl sees the way carmen is looking at him like hes a bug
you dont approve
well too bad
were in this for the species boys and girls
its simple numbers they have more and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths
didnt they tell you colonel
thats what cap troopres are good for
carl allows himself a tiny smile
hope youre ready for more
were going back to p to capture that brain
the roughnecks are always ready sir
i hear they need a new lieutenant
want the job
ill take it
until i get killed or you find someone better
suddenly everyone has someplace to go
hope you get your brain bug carl
its good to see you two
it reminds me of the way things were before
carl turns abruptly and heads away
his entourage follows
take care wilya johnny
see you on the bounce
steps onto the bridge
theres a new number sitting in zanders chair
shes right out of tereshkova and she looks scared
carmen turns to captain deladier
wheres lieutenant barcalow
he requested a combat assignment
theres always a need for experienced pilots on the ground
i had no choice but to let him go
he said youd understand
carmen bites her lip takes first chair
deladier feels bad for her knows shes made a painful decision
are suiting up
officer on the deck
roughnecks fall in
johnny steps into the room
there are many new and much younger faces
i only have two rules
rule one everyone fights
rule two no one quits
if you dont do your job ill kill you myself
do you get me
we get you sir
to ace sotto voce whore all these kids
we got reinforced
most ofem just got outa boot

cap troopers set fire to huge piles of dead bugs
bulldozers push bodies into a mass grave among them rasczak
johnny walks past with his team
well take this high ground
lookouts there and therte and up there
if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor hood well be the first to know
fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers
down there on the flats eh
listen up roughnecks
our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet
alright cut it out
we will deploy from skimmers in teams of six
if the bugs open up a battery we put it out of business
a hercules cargo boat hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground johnny has intended forb his h
johnny scowls marches over to the boat and confronts a fleet officer
wouldya mind moving your boat
better talk to the boss
the cargo bays open to deploy fleet skimmers
zander jumps down to oversee the operation
youre standing on my h
this is a fleet driven operation son and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground
you can have everything else eh
you heard the sky marshall
move it all down suddenly in the distance bug batteries open fire not one but twenty
zander and johnny share a look of concern
rodger young prepare to receice outgoing fire
to his crew chief ill take the first group
saddle up boys thats our trash
begins to take a toll on the battle group as the orbiting ships lay their eggs
cap troopers are scliced as they drop
turns to carmen
carmen dodges other starships turns to her new number
prepare for warp
the rodger young takes a direct hit
is cut in two
the rear section explodes the forward section begins to burn towards the bridge
calmy evacuates the bridge
power fails and so does the gravity
this is rodger young were going down
repeat this is rodger young were going down
and captain deladier run for the lifepods
an explosion flips the corridor
captain deladiers leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her
carmen hits the release pulls her free
deladier pushes carmen away
leave me lieutenant
thats an order
no way maam
pushes into the chaotic life pod bay
panicked crew shoving screaming fighting
the ship pitches
they tumble landing near a pod
carmen jumps for it pulls deladier in after
disintegrates as lifepods shoot away toward the planet
navigates through a graveyard of floating wreckage dead cap troopers someones trombone
she sets her beacon and the pod plummets downward
this is lieutenant carmen ibanez in lifepod ry
im going in
board the skimmers
zander approaches johnny upset
whats your problem now lieutenant
the rodger young just burned up
johnnys face falls
far in the distance a glowing pod plummets toward the planet
johnny tracks it on his head up
is shaken violently as the pod hits atmosphere
hits and goes straight through the crust of planet p
comes to rest
carmen blows the hatch pulls deladier out grabs a morita pulse rifle
tunnels lead in every direction
this is lieutenant carmen ibanez
is anyone receiving
grabs the handset from ace
carmen this is roughneck base camp
what is your present location
sees a warrior coming at her from out of the shadows
carmen fires a burst and kills it
now there are two
carmen backs up firing but there are too many
my present location is degrees south by degrees east
situation is extremely hostile
they have her
she puts the barrel of the morita in her mouth but a claw cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle
and zander are horrified by what they hear
weve gotta go get her
you know as well as i do shes probably already dead
johnny knows its true swallows bitterly turns away
thats when he sees it
nearby the ground shifts a claw breaks through a hole opens up and bugs boil up out of the ground
here they come
they turn and see a second bug hole open up
were outa here
lieutenant get your men into the skimmers
this real estates about to go buggy
hey just calm down im giving the orders here the entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new canyon
the hercules boat topples crushing skimmers and unfortunate fleet personnnel
and the surviving roughnecks pick themselves up
the are now meters below the planets surface
above them bugs line the wide rim of the newly formed canyon
form a perimeter
through the dust exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and piling out of them by the score deadly arachnid warriors
johnny throws zander a pulse cannon
make yourself useful fly boy
the roughnecks open fire at the charging bug horde
warriors are blown to pieces
gas grenades fly and h
rounds close tunnels
a maimed warrior gets through and heads for zander
johnny and ace team up to blow it away
zander takes a deep breath loos around impressed
the roughnecks have killed a great many bugs
ace get on the com
tell fleet we need retrieval
sugar salvage some armor and suit up lieutenant barcalow
sugar watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way
fleet command says retrievals no go
the battle groups at safe distance
and we got another problem
ace points out a tanker bug thats been brough up to the rim
johnny sees another
looks like theyre gonna hose us down
johnny chews on this
listen up roughnecks
were gonna head west down through bug city pick up any rodger young survivors we run across and join a company
we get you sir
zander awkward in a power suit confronts johnny
what do you think youre doing
im gonna save carmen
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective
they hang you for that rico
yeah thats right
johnny and zander stare each other down
johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him
leads his deadly force through enemy territory
the roughnecks kill everything that gets in their way
zander lends his inexperienced hand
barcalow save power dont waste it on workers
ace tell aardvark were on our way
warriors appear in the tunnel behind them
sugar close the tunnel
fire in the hole
sugar watkins fires an h
round and seals the tunnel
opens her eyes
she can hear bugs clicking
shes in a pit filled with human dead
a nearby carcass wears a uniform from th brigade off in the dark she hears human moaning
she crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound
the moaning turns to screaming
its coming from outside the pit
she pulls herself up to peer over the edge
sees hundred of bugs at work warriors workers and dozens of small meters chariot bugs
aworker walks pas stepping on her but pays her no attention
she sees the source of the screaming captain deladier is hold between two warriors and shes screaming because of what she sees the brain bug is huge meters and pulpy
i has vestigial legs that cannot support ist weight and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs
a thorn like palp unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes driving deep into deladiers head and sucks her brains out
carmen watches horrified as deladier dies
the suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit
she screams as its claws slice into her limbs
now the brain bug comes for her
she sees the palp unfold the thorn like spike coming toward her
carmen is no longer looking for escape
all she wants to do is die
suddenly every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen
carmen hears it
a high pitched squeal getting louder
johnny enters the chamber alone
the warriors move toward him
he holds up a nuke source of the high pitched tone
the ready light flashes
the brain bug emits a series of harsh clicks
the warriors freeze
you know what this is
johnny makes an explosive sound
the brain bug slowly withdraws its palp
sure you do
youre a big fat smart bug arent you
johnny moves toward carmen
the brain bugs multiple eyes track him
the warriors holding carmen threaten
johnny turns on the brain bug his finger on the nukes trigger
ill take you with me
the brain bug clicks
the warriors back off
johnny reaches for her
take my hand
chariot bugs move the brain bug down a hole
workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed
johnny drags carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from
the warriors charge
johnny throws himself on top of carmen as the roughnecks burst into the chamber guns blazing
the fight is furious point blank deadly to bug and roughneck alike
sugar watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off
zander takes a claw through the gut
he blows it away sees his intestines hanging out of the wound shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting
a warrior rears up over johnny and carmen
ace throws him a morita
johnny catches it pumps three rounds into the bugs nerve stem
he struggles out from under the dead warrior
every bug in the chamber is dead
are you hurt
carmen throws her arms around johnny
zander takes this in
carmen sees him then his wound
oh youre hurt
ace takes a look at his wound makes a face
zander pushes him away struggles to his feet
can you walk
clenched teeth not a problem
lets get some armor on her and the well get outa this stinkin bug hole
various components are gladly passed forward
johnny and ace help her putting it on
i thought i was dead
lucky for me you jokers showed up eh
it wasnt luck
rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you
is it true
yeah if i live through this theyll probably hang me
now comon lets move out
double time it racing for the surface
they come to a fork
we gotta be near a company by now
the tunnel floor drops out
five roughnecks disappear into the hole
warriors climb up into the tunnel
the roughnecks bachk up fast shooting
zander staggers collapses
johnny drops to his side rolls him over
how bad are you pal
been better buddy
johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score
alright were gonna carry you
nah i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before its too late
gimmee the nuke
zander checks his pulse cannons available power
dont be a hero
this is my farm
now cmon give me what you got and get out of here
johnny nods hands him the nuke
carmen sees whats happening
zander what are you doing
just giving you something to remember me by baby
he grabs her and kisses her
johnny drags carmen away
zander opens fire as the first warriors reach his position
race desperately for the surface
they hear the chatter of zanders pulse cannon and the screams of dying bugs
tears stream down from carmens face
and the surviving roughnecks make it to the surface
a subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone into the air
and the others enter a companys perimeter
no one notices their arrival because everyones gathered in a big circle watching the brain bug
they got it
several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture
carl approaches it without fear puts his hand on the thing
whats it thinking colonel
carl smiles in a cruel way
johnny and carmen approach the general
sir id like to turn myself in
dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime
and you freely admit to it
is what this man says true lieutenant
