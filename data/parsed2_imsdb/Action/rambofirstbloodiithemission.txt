first blood by james cameron december a drab green sedan with u
army printed on the door stops at the steps of a fortress like colonial style building
iron bars cover the windows
the lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves
a crt style printout appears at the bottom of frame as the doors open and two powerful mps one of whom was driving emerge
the other opens the rear door for colonel samuel trautman who stands eyeing the imposing facade of the hospital
trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of command sternly but without arrogance
he takes the stairs with purposeful strides the mps falling in behind him
hold on the sign above the main door as they go inside a gray metal door bearing the sign neuropsychiatric wing bangs open and a massive orderly in white passes
he is followed by the two mps trautman and a short doctor who hustles to keep up with the others
low angle dolly preceding the entourage as they stride forward
the mps are grim faced and walk in step
trautman and a doctor singleterry silently walk through the corridor
they pass the open day room where somnambulistic patients sit like statuary watching the young and the restless or watching the wallpaper fade
bleak light from an overcast day filters through the barred window
the vets seem older than their years and although some show the physical scars of combat there is no doubt that the greatest trauma for these men is behind the
as they pass the open doors of the rooms of the chronic ward haunted eyes turn toward them
as they approach the nurses station for the chronic ward the orderly nods
the head nurse turns to her console
hits a button on the console
as a solenoid operated bolt snaps back with a loud buzz the orderlys good hand shoves the door open
the entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined with locked doors
occasionally faces appear at the safety glass windows set in the doors
men whose souls have fled
their eyes track us as we move past
an emaciated man in an untied hospital smock and bare feet stands as if lost in the center of the corridor
dollying as they detour around the man whose clawlike hand catches at trautmans tunic
a hoarse demented shouting issues from one of the doors a desperate wailing from another
close on door latch as keys rattle and the door opens
wider as the group enters a dark service stairwell
the single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically a pulsing twilight
maintenance never gets down here
they descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a sliding track
the mps flank lewis as he unlocks the door
so what am i supposed to do
cant transfer him to leavenworth
so i put him in an isolation cell that hasnt been used since the spanish inquisition
rolling aside on metal tracks
this area of the hospitals basement has been used for little but storage in recent years
stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust leaving only a narrow walkspace
the steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open except for the last one
maybe you should have tried cutting him some slack
lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and removes a small rifle
he feeds a syringe like shell into the single shot bolt action
continuing whats that
tranquilizer syrette gun
borrowed it from the animal control department
trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snort and steps up to the cell door
gimme a break
nods toward door open it
the two mps flank the door
one pulls on the latching lever
the door swings open revealing blackness
muttering thinks hes the fucking prince of darkness
one mp tries the switch beside the cell flicking it several times
he glances apprehensively at the other mp and they step into the dark cell
tight on a hand dimly outlined as it twists a light bulb a half turn in its socket
in the sudden light the mps face an imposing figure
john rambo wearing only a pair of filthy jeans stands ready before them
the single light bulb on the low ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body
a nasty piece of machinery
long matted hair coils onto his shoulders and an unkempt beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are deep reptilian
his position though not overtly threatening suggests a willingness to strike without warning which gives the m
trautman steps forward between the mps
at ease rambo
rising from his slight crouch to stand composed balanced
continuing to mps wait outside
he closes the door until it latches
mind if i sit down
rambo motions to the narrow bunk dropping into an oriental squat himself as the colonel sits
trautmans manner with rambo is familiar somehow paternal
a bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly
continuing i hear youre not enjoying it here
i could take it or leave it
trautman sighs and leans back
seems like im always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other doesnt it
am i out of here
that depends on you
pause christ look at you
i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment
all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas
and you have to make it rambos last stand
there were treating me like a headcase
hard to believe
you shoot up one little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun
one little dogpatch town
and everybody figures your wrappers broken
no sense of humor
pause what did you expect
an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce
rambo looks at his hands
when he finally speaks his voice seems distant disembodied
in nam i flew gunships
million dollar equipment
back here nobody trusts me to park cars
i keep thinking its going to be okay
but ive been out six years and its not okay
sometimes i feel like im coming right out of my skin
the colonel nods slowly
he notices a battered shoebox on the floor beside the bed
the cell is absolutely devoid of personal articles otherwise
this your stuff
as trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of the men in rambos special forces unit
they are horsing around in and out of uniform
a younger cleanshaven rambo is among them
he is grinning broadly in one shot
it seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now
the best i ever trained
coldly those men are all dead
glancing up youre not
he fishes something from among the pathetic debris of rambos life
continuing congressional medal of honor
plus what else
two silver stars four bronze stars two soldiers medals four vietnamese crosses of gallantry and
uh a handful of purple hearts
i never wanted that stuff
what did you want
haltingly i just wanted
i dont know
after all that
i just wanted one person one person to come up to me and say you did good john
and mean it
pause after all that
you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in
the colonel studies rambo a moment then stands abruptly
continuing lets take a walk
rambo and trautman cross the manicured grounds escorted by the two grim mps
a number of wheelchair bound vets enjoy the sunshine b
and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress
still the impression is of the detritus of war left scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys
as the two approach a conservatively dressed man waiting on a bench under a plane tree stands
kirkhill extends his hand in greeting but rambo coolly half turns to reveal his hands locked in wrist cuffs separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably
at his sides
kirkhill grins affably
drops his hand
good to meet you rambo
how are you
rambo scans kirkhills face noting the cold scrutiny all but concealed in the smile lines
coldly you a spook
kirkhill drops the smile
cia special operations division
rambo turns to trautman
i dont work with spooks
not after that op in cambodia
im authorized to get you out of here
i thought thats what you wanted
considering whats the job
classic special forces op
in and out
shrugs non committally we like you
pause at least the computer at langley likes you
pulled your file because of various factors
im not jumping blind
kirkhills eyes get hard
its yes or no
in or out
if its out we will not have had this conversation
if you come in you will not be working for us
do you understand
rambo seems about to turn away
to kirkhill tell him
ill take responsibility
kirkhill looks pained like he has gas
what they call the democratic republic of vietnam now
as he takes that in
his eyes seem to see all the way there already
emotions go through him
exhilaration mixing with terror of the demon he cant turn away from
he nods slowly
we left some people behind there john
this just occurred to somebody now
we dont leave our men rambo
rambo and trautman lock eyes
something flows there
trautman knows his soul
you got it
he whips one hand around from his side tossing the manacle bar at a surprised kirkhills feet
the wrist cuffs are still closed
rambo stands alone in his cell the door open behind him
he hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions the scraps of memory dead friends and symbols of valor and violent death
he upends the box spilling everything into the open toilet
and walks out
clomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruits marches past in close order drill
the drill sergeant bellows cadence
three fo your lef lef right lef
other lef shithead
square those pieces away
square em away girls
as the platoon marches past exiting frame to reveal a sign mounted beside a security checkpoint in a formidable chain link fence
kirkhill accompanied by his basilisk eyed aide strides past rambos two mps flanking the door into a small room
the room is an austere cubicle with the armys typically drab furniture in early functional
the cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at a single table with a seated figure
rambo looking like he may have been there for centuries
the aide hands rambo a sealed folder and extends a clipboard and pen for him to sign off
this is your mission packet
quietly overlapping sign here please
memorize it here
it doesnt leave this room
rambo unseals the folder removing a sheaf of photocopied documents as kirkhill perches on the table next to him
continuing the twenty four hundred american servicemen missing in action in vietnam laos and cambodia are officially listed presumed killed
certainly most of them are
rambo is leafing through the contents of his packet
he skips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy x prints
continuing but reports keep filtering in
sightings by refugees
finally we feel weve got enough to proceed on
rambo studies the prints
they seem to be high altitude surveillance photos of a small compound of buildings surrounded by forests
continuing memo e on top will cover the details
an abandoned vietnamese army base in the north central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp
as you can see the intelligence is soft
these landsat photos show huts
it could be anything
flat whats the plan
this operation is in two phases
recon and rescue
you are phase one
your two man team will probe the site confirm the presence of american pows if any make photographic and tactical observations then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the
we dont try to pull out any of our guys if we find them
the phase two assault team will get them out
not pleased we just take pictures
dont look so disappointed
it should be hairy enough
even for you
kirkhills voice continues over the image of the crowded airport terminal as rambo carrying a cheap flight bag weaves among jostling orientals
your flight to bangkok is at
rendezvous with colonel trautman at the indra
youll meet your number two man lieutenant brewer
he doesnt get a packet
you brief him verbally
after a flurry of passport stamping rambo clears customs and makes his way to the main exit
rambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of bangkok in may and stands scanning for a cab
bangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is chaotic with traffic
stepping through throngs of asians and tourists rambo reaches for the door of a beat to hell citroen taxi hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish
he spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder
sorry old buddy i saw it first
an american in his late twenties the man speaks with one of those hard to dislike southern accents
probably north carolina
he is lanky but muscular with boyish good looks and hair cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble
though dressed in a loud hawaiian shirt and madras slacks it is painfully obvious the man is military
his arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made up thai girl
affable i kinda got an important date
rambos eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into the taxi
the american grins cockily and tosses his bag to rambo
well share it
get your tail in there sweet thing
the american and the girl pile into the broad front seat to the chagrin of the lizard faced thai driver
to driver indra hotel
and dont take the scenic route smiley
i know my way around this burg
rambo speaks quietly to the driver in thai
thai subtitled same place for me
the girl giggles as the american slips his hand up from her stockinged knee between her thighs
ah you fair flower of the orient
she giggles like a chirping bird
continuing to rambo she thinks everything i say is funny
dont you angel pie
man thai women are the best
got the kinda legs i like
feet at one end and pussy at the other
he turns to rambo who hasnt commented or taken any observable notice of him
continuing you dont say a helluva lot do you pal
you speak english
the girl coos to the american in pidgin english
you got money
i stay you whole week
sweet thing theres nothin id like more than to wugga wugga with you for a week but tonights all we got
he lowers his voice conspiratorially leaning close to her
continuing see im on this secret mission and tomorrow mornin i head out to
rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar
thats enough brewer
the american freezes at the sound of his name
realizing youre rambo
pause ke rist
rambo speaks sharply to the girl in thai
thai subtitled get out
the driver confused skids to a stop and the girl gets out into the din of a cluttered shop district
a flash of slit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as the taxi moves on
brightening jeez i never would have guessed
you undercover lieutenant
trautman sipping a gin tonic at the window spins around as the door flies open
brewer storms in followed a few paces back by rambo who closes the door
to trautman he says hes team leader on this show
controlling his fury begging the colonels pardon but i understood i was up to lead my next mission
not this one
youre on communications and camera
same image intensified gear you used in el salvador last year
this clown almost blew mission security on the street
im not jumping with him
now back up there buddy
sharply listen up
you two are married as of now
get used to it
to trautman i say we tape him to a chair
a small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain forested slopes
wreathed in low clouds the mountains march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of gray like a japanese watercolor
near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is assembled
an enormous sikorsky ch sky crane lowers a winnebago sized conex container as another roars by
an army corps of engineers work crew stripped to the waist scurries through the rotor wash
the blasting air raises curtains of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the supervisors
a vietnam era huey uh d helicopter nimbly touches down nearby
rambo in the pilots seat slips off his headset and climbs down
brewer and trautman in fatigues jump out and join him as kirkhill approaches
dollying with them as they emerge from the rotor noise and kirkhill motions them toward the mobile tactical i didnt know you were a stick man rambo
i was crossed trained in gunships
to kirkhill how long have you been setting up
about hours on site
they pass a tent like camouflage canopy under which an all black sikorsky uh blackhawk helicopter squats ominously
it has no markings or insignia
there is another canopy behind it the contents of which are screened from view
nearby is a cluster of conex airlift containers two of which are joined together to form a building like a double wide mobile home
another unit contains a roaring generator a fourth is topped by tracking gear
cables snake through the mud connecting the units
kirkhill notices three work party grunts kibitzing nearby taking pictures of each other with a pocket instamatic
he snatches the camera from a surprised young corporal
this is a covert operation numbnuts
he opens the camera and drops the film in the mud
the corporal reaches petulantly for the camera
kirkhill drops it casually in the mud as well
to trautman entourage check out the command hut
he opens the door to the large conex unit and follows the others inside
the hut turns out to be a humming electronic womb
in the subdued light banks of video monitors glow and the status lights of upright computer units line one wall
workstations for tracking communications and long range coordination create a claustrophobic jumble of modular equipment racks
they wipe their muddy feet and enter the air conditioned command center
rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear
he runs his hand over one console causing a seated technician to glare at him
all this is for us
to rambo they call us the field unit meat puppets
rambo and brewer walk in under an expanse of net camouflage on poles
sunlight streams through the foliage cover creating bright mottles on a black object f
camera pulls back and booms up as rambo moves forward to reveal the object as an all black jet
it is a modified gulfstream peregrine a small sleek single engine executive model with all insignia and i
as they consider the aircraft
ever do this from a jet
they turn to see a lanky long haired man in a leather flying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far side and approach them
grinning just have to jump fast
two other air crewmen jump down from the open rear passenger door of the plane
you the pilot
extending hand yeah
he gestures to the two in the door lifer and fuhrman
doyle is a product of the sixties school of ultra cool his brain a little torched by too many methed out night missions
fuhrman the co pilot grins too much and lifers eyes are just plain scary
you boys air force
were private contractors now
you ever do a tour in country
eye corps mostly
to brewer how about you
defensive vietnam was a little before my time
so was korea know what i mean
rambo and doyle glance at each other
solidarity before new meat bozos
as the head of a torque wrench finishes a rough map of local southeast asia scratched hastily in the dirt
with each word he plops the torque wrench onto the appropriate place
gesturing as he continues
a straight dash across the laotian panhandle through the annamese mountains
some good dicey bits there
and on to the drop zone
eighteen minutes each way in communist airspace
we go low to stay off radar
in the rhubarb babe
grinning mowin the lawn
trautman looking a bit uncomfortable in kirkhills electronic lair paces behind the seated special operations officer
how long before youre fully on line
let me buy you a coffee
he turns to a vending machine nestled improbably between two racks of electronics
you think theyll find any
feeding in change pows
i dont know
but either way itll get that subcommittee off our necks
the league of families leans on congress
then they lean on us
like we dont have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries
he pounds the machine which refuses to vend
trautman watches the special operations officer banging ineffectually on the coin return amid a million dollars worth of equipment
a tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flight shack for doyle and his ground crew
crates serve as tables and stools and gallon fuel drums are the back wall
doyle with rambo and brewer continues the game plan
a couple klicks from insertion we go vertical to ten thousand and you punch out
navigate in free fall like a regular halo jump
youll have a good moon
to himself i got your moon right here
doyle notices that brewer has casually lit up a cigarette
we got fuel on the deck
i dont like flying without a plane
brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping area
rambo plucks the cigarette from brewers lips
no smoking on this mission
its not healthy
he looks brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into the pool of gas
which puts it out
son of a bitch
rambo saunters away
appreciatively nice trick
works nine times out of ten
the steel planking of the pre fabricated runway rings under their feet as rambo and brewer run laps
brewer between breaths is chanting a monologue as they draw near
call in to base camp by transat
proceed to point tango november for rendezvous with our ground contact
co phuong bao
in same tone weve been over this three times
brewer rolls his eyes
co phuong bao
the guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at ban
flatly start over
face down in the dirt near the flight line rambo and brewer are banging off pushups under the floodlight
mechanically to target at ban kia na
we probe the site
to himself overlapping ninety
then proceed downriver to extraction at point echo delta
doyle takes us out by helicopter we all live happily ever after and thats the last time rambo
i swear to christ
they both collapse face down breathing heavily
brewer rises first
gettin old huh
pause second set
when rambo rises it is in pushup position only this time using one arm
one two three
brewer lifts an olive drab box onto the table inside the open tent
it looks like a large field radio with a complex console set in the top
transponder satellite relay
he taps a small collapsible dish antenna on a tripod connected to the box by a curly cord
continuing the signals coded into infrared pulses picked up by the spy satellite bounced to the ground station in okinawa and relayed to the hut
he points to the mtoc nearby
continuing no radio source
nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on
show me how it operates
thats what im here for
show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land
frustrated were leaving tonight not in a week
he sees rambos expression
rambo sits on his cot hunched over some minute work
with surgical precision he hones the trigger mechanism of a flat black crossbow pistol
rambo raises the crossbow cocked but empty
it fires smoothly to his satisfaction
close on shipping crate as a crossbar pries the lid off
as he raises a telescope like piece of equipment
revealing brewer surrounded by shipping crates
he sets the scope on a long empty table and attacks another crate working under a harsh fluorescent lighting unit
brewer pulls electronic test gear out of bubble pack and sets the units on the table
he hefts an automatic rifle and checks the action
another electronic gadget joins the growing array on the table
another smaller automatic a mac machine pistol is lifted out of packing
close as brewers hands thread a silencer onto the barrel of the mac
tight on rambos hand holding a special forces lile knife
he runs a whet stone along the blade methodically
brewer is calibrating his starlight scope image intensifier using a wave form oscilloscope
satisfied he begins mounting it atop the assault rifle
very tight on rambo working in almost total darkness streaking his face with two shades of green camouflage makeup
the effect is unearthly
brewer wearing headphones is running a calibration tone through the audio processor of his telescopic microphone
he clamps it onto the assault rifle
covered with green greasepaint
using a candle he expertly darkens the blade of his lile knife
brewer is standing at the end of the long table which is now laid out like a banquet with an incredible assortment of gadgets weapons supplies kits canteens rations etc
doyle lounges nearby watching the bugs dog fighting around the fluorescent work light
you jumping with all that
they turn to see rambo watching them from just outside the pool of light
a spectral figure
brewer glances at the array of stuff
you break your leg ill have to shoot you
he turns and vanishes in the dark
i think he means it
you got that right
anybody ever tell you about that guy
brewer turns quizzically toward him
what about him
a black maw
the vanes begin to turn
the rising whine becomes a steady roar
as a ground crewman disconnects hoses from the sleek black fuselage
as the blue fire roars in the exhaust throat
the air convulses
moving beside the black ship past the wing to the rear door
as it comes to a stop the side door filling frame
lifer enters shot reaches for the door latch
total blackness until light spills in from the opening door
rambo sits statue like hands on knees wearing a black blindfold
adjusting his eyes for night vision
hes dressed for the mission tiger stripe cammies jump pack chute pack hands and face mottled with camouflage greasepaint
lifer leads him out
dollying before rambo being led as if to execution
blue and red taxi lights send strobe flashes of color across his face as he approaches the aircraft
rambo is led to the seat next to brewers
trautman helps lifer strap him in
plugs in his intercom jack
brewer eyes him cautiously
hed move away but all the other seats have been removed
filtered ready to roll lieutenant
rambo adjusting his headset
lets do it
keep it clean rambo or ill nail your hide to the shed
you got it sir
trautman exits and the steps are rolled away
doyle is all business now
zen rollercoaster requesting clearance
filtered you are cleared zen rollercoaster
the wheel jacks are pulled
the jet rolls forward
the aircraft hurtles down the runway gathering speed
the nose picks up
it clears the end of the runway and then the treeline by a few feet
the interior is lit only by a single red light above the door
brewer watches the forest below through the open doorway
the door itself has been removed
the roar of the airstream is ferocious
a sleek silhouette above the moonlit forest the jet flashes across the rolling terrain just above the treetops
moving with the aircraft as it dips and rises with the lands contour
the rain forest below is a rushing blur
this is known as some serious flying
doyle is hunched forward nose inches from the canopy
drinking in the jungle
all the lights in the cockpit are turned off
fuhrman uses a taped over penlight to read the instruments
doyle is beyond instruments
switching communications to burst mode
kirkhill and trautman are hunched at the main console
awacs two five has acquired
they are holding timeline
trautman watches the glowing dot representing the drop jet crawling almost imperceptibly across a computer generated map of central laos
the sleek jet races toward the towering annamese range ahead
fuhrman is grinning
into mike here comes the sexy part
rambo sitting impassively removes his blindfold
the plane begins to pitch and plummet wildly
brewer lets out a rebel yell
i love it
moving with it as it slices through a twisting canyon like a knife
it slithers between the mountainous flanks
rambo is methodically checking his pack and harness seemingly oblivious to the insanity outside
filtered we just entered viet airspace gentlemen
eight klicks to insertion
to brewer via headset stay tight on me brewer
i dont want to have to go looking for you
a technician turns from the secondary console
awacs niner one via subic bay reports them approaching insertion
five by five
the mountains fall behind and the tiny jet hurtles down across the foothills flying nap of the earth
rambo slips his free fall goggles into place
filtered stand by to climb
a vietnamese farmer trudges down the road with two heavy buckets on a pole carry across his shoulders
a distant whining becomes an approaching roar
like a thunderbolt the black jet flashes over the top of the hill just ahead thirty feet off the deck
the farmer is tumbled by the blast of air
he looks up
the jet has gone into a ball busting vertical climb and is instantly lost among the stars
viet subtitled son of a bitch
doyles voice is matter of fact despite the gees they are pulling
approaching ten thousand
eleven seconds to insertion
slowing to two thirty
the ready light changes from red to yellow
rambo unbuckles from his seat
lifer steadies them at the door
continuing three seconds
have a nice day
the ready light turns green
rambo takes a single powerful running stride from the opposite wall and is out the door
brewer is right behind him
the jet dwindles and is gone in a moment above the tumbling figures
on rambo stabilizing his fall
he switches on his pack strobe
shouting into mike you read me brewer
faint read you
home on my strobe
he sees the distant flash of rambos strobe below him and banks toward it like a fighter plane
he comes alongside the team leader and they dive together
rambo cuts the strobe
angle down as a solid layer of cloud rushes up
they plunge through and the landscape below is an awesome vista
an unbroken carpet of dark rain forest with a narrow meandering river like a platinum ribbon
rambo sights on a distant bend in the river spreads his feet and dives
they shoot across the uprushing landscape at mph
numbers flicking feet
their canopies deploy with a muffled crack simultaneously
looking down past his swaying feet as the moonlit jungle rushes up
a mahogany tree lunges like a huge hand
the dark maw swallows us in blackness
moonlight filters down through the foliage of massive trees showing as shafts in the swirling night mists
this is one of the most primeval forests on the planet a place of violent growth and death filled shadows
massive tree roots grip the earth entwined with vines that climb swaying into the vaulted canopy above
water drips constantly
and life is everywhere
churning in the shallow pools under the bark in the sweating fruit
leaping through the matted foliage above
a figure rises behind a rotting log like a being from interstellar space
rambo removes his goggles and headset then shrugs out of his chute harness
he looks around slowly
taking it in
to himself man what are you doing back here
brewers voice is a reedy chirp from his headset
he raises it to his ear
keep it down man
i got problems
brewer is face to face with a mangy pig which grunts its annoyance
he is stuck up to his knees in the mud of a small fenced yard containing a few pigs and chickens
the yard is adjacent to a large thatch hut and four or five additional hootches are visible farther downslope nestled among the trees
brewer holds a finger to his lips cautioning the pig to silence
he lays backward in the black slop as a vietnamese man in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the nearest hootch an island of light in the dark forest
smoking a cigarette he looks around perhaps scanning for the source of the faint crashing he heard a moment before
following a dirt road little more than a trail between the hootches an old woman approaches
she is barefoot and pushes a rusting bicycle laden with an enormous bundle of firewood
brewer struggles to free himself straining in silence as the pigs step disdainfully around him
the man flicks away the cigarette
he laughs raucously at something the old woman says and hurries to help her carry the firewood inside
brewer looks up at his chute billowing quietly in the branches overhead
the old woman pauses at the door spits a shot of betelnut juice into the yard and goes inside
the door bangs shut
sighing with relief
suddenly a dark object shoots into frame seizing him
brewers head snaps around
the object is rambos hand painted camo green
rambo drags him with a sucking pop from the mud
the team leader glares
a freezing whisper thats one
brewer pauses a moment assimilating the implicit warning
then reaches for his harness buckles to free himself
with the hootches visible b
rambo moves silently off along the trail
brewer lumbering under the enormous pack crashes through foliage to catch up
he curses under his breath
rambo moves wraith like through the undergrowth appearing and vanishing there
then not there
brewer stumbles over a root thuds to the ground
rambo stops looking back
his expression grim
he turns and moves on disappearing into the foliage
brewer scrambles up following
tight on transat screen as the last letters of the following message appear revealing brewer hunched over the tiny crt screen atop the transponder box typing at a keyboard the
size of a pocket calculator
rambo squats motionless watching intently
brewer hits the send button
the chief telecom tech turns to kirkhill
its coming in
kirkhill watches the message print out on the main screen
turns to trautman
on the money
a cheer goes up in the command center
the home team just scored
rambo squats studying his waterproof terrain map
he glances at brewer who has finished assembling his weapons and gear
looking like a martian stormtrooper with his exotic weapons and surplus equipment
he is sighting through the scope of his assault rifle
fully assembled it is as big as a chrysler and looks straight out of star wars
what do you call that
crisply modified m a and over under m grenade launcher with sionics sound suppressor tracor starlight scope and lac r laser sighting system
batteries not included
wounded this is state of the art firepower
rambo picks up another device a cylinder like a flashlight with a curly cord running to a pair of earphones
ac system big ear telescopic mike with built in audio processor
can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at meters
rambo gazes around him
uh huh right
pause lets saddle up
wheres your stuff
rambo flips open his rucksack
incredulous thats it
some c a map and a knife
theres a compass in the handle
brewer gestures at the russian made ak slung over rambos shoulder
and a beat to shit ak
every twelve year old in nams got one of those
brewer hefts the separate rucksack containing the transat
this things pretty heavy
you got room for it
rambo snorts disgustedly
just a thought
using a stream bed to navigate through dense growth rambo glides his legs smoothly through knee deep brackish water
brewer follows swatting and batting at clouds of mosquitos
a viper glides past them roiling the surface and disappears into twisted tree roots
you wanna know why i stood up for this show
moving off no
i was in the brig
they gave me a deal
i blew up this colonels golf cart with an m
he wasnt in it or anything
it was the symbolic value
seemed like a good idea at the time
thats a real good reason to wind up in nam
ive seen worse places
there are no worse places
rambo leads them up a steep trail as a dense night fog creeps over the ridgeline above
as he moves along a narrow game trail
shapes loom out of the mist revealed as harmless trunks or vines only at the last second
as they top the rise the trail opens out onto a plateau like cleared area
ahead an enormous stone face wreathed in vines looms from the mist
as the two walk into the atrium of a ruined wat or buddhist temple
brewer looks awed
serene despite the ravages of centuries two stone buddhas thirty feet tall sit flanking the stairs to the ruined temple
trees and vines all but obscure the cracked and tumbled forms of ornately carved walls
the central courtyard is open to the sky
spire like structures are dimly visible in the fog beyond
hushed this place is a trip
he has pulled up his pant leg to reveal three squirming black worms attached to his calf sucking on him
rambo moves off scanning unconcerned
get used to em
lighting a cigarette his hands tightly cupped around the glow
rambo slaps it out of his hand
stomps it out
hissing you fucking crazy
i need it to burn these things off
i had it cupped
rambo takes the pack from brewers breast pocket and grinds it into the mud under his boot
ive had enough of your bad ass indian scout bullshit
youre years out of date
im makin a career out of teaching you the hardware
as far as im concerned youre just along to back me up
and i heard about you
about how twitchy you really are
kill any civilians lately
brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a knife to his throat so rapidly hes not sure how it happened
rambo is in his face speaking very softly
listen real careful freshmeat
i dont know why they sent you
maybe they didnt want to waste a good man
but you screw up once more and ill kill you myself
rambo whips away moves quietly off
shaking with rage brewer levels his weapon at rambos back
then he realizes how silly that would be
frustrated he jogs to catch up
man are you strict
moving in the shadows rambo walks through the ruins noiselessly
a voice emerges from the mist behind them an almost childlike lilt
you are first tourist here in long time
brewer whips around centering the aiming dot of his sighting laser on a figure sitting on a ledge above them
sitting cross legged and unperturbed is a diminutive vietnamese woman of about
the dot of brewers laser is centered on her forehead like a hindu prayer mark
she is absolutely beautiful with wide calm eyes and strong but sensuous mouth which curves now in a small quirky grin
you come here see buddha
ask for truth
or just lost
whispering should i waste her
rambo pushes his rifle barrel aside and takes a step forward
when he speaks it is in fluent vietnamese
viet subtitled im not lost
just looking for someone
viet subtitled someone called maybe night orchid
viet subtitled thats right
viet subtitled im co phuong bao
to brewer shes our contact
grudgingly impressed i didnt know you spoke vietnamese
co slides down from the ledge and stands before them almost two heads shorter than rambo
her lithe figure is not entirely concealed by her loose black pajamas
she wears her hair in a long single braid and has the delicate hands of a child
this is brewer
to brewer her name is co
it means virgin
my mother was comedian
he sticks out his hand but rambo motions no
she bows slightly
uh you speak pretty good english
whered you learn
university of saigon
have masters degree in economics
not use too much now
communists in charge
you got time
want to eat
co reaches up onto the ledge her previous perch and pulls down a small pack actually a food tube of the sort worn over one shoulder by viet cong and
other vietnamese guerrillas
opening it nuac mam
she unrolls several rubber tree leaves holding rice with a pungent sauce
rambo takes the food and the proffered chopsticks and squatting begins shoveling it expertly
you really got a masters degree
i only sound like forty year old in your language
brewer fumbles with the sticks
switches to fingers
whats this stuff on the rice
fermented fish sauce
brewers expression is less than enthusiastic
with co leading through the maze of aimless game trails the group makes its way parallel to a modest river the how do we get upriver
i have arranged transportation
we meet soon
but i think you to be disappointed
i go up to this camp two months ago
empty for years
rambo stops puzzled
why would they send us to a deserted camp
lets just do it and get out
go have a jacuzzi and get laid in bangkok
know what i mean
rambo moves on still concerned
somethings a bit off
well check it out
how come we didnt just drop near the camp
save this hassle
does a jet make noise
switching to viet subtitled where did you find this clown
viet subtitled i thought he was with you
viet subtitled crazy motherfucker
whats she saying
she likes you
says youre dinky dau
dinky dau thats me
you wanna meet jake the one eyed snake
rambo motions suddenly for a freeze
co walks on ahead toward the river as the americans melt into the shadows
a house sampan wallows among the naked tree roots in a brackish inlet off the main river
on deck are two men loosely speaking
possibly two of the most misbegotten specimens the orient has to offer
they raise their ak s as co approaches
exchange a few quick syllables and co turns motioning rambo and brewer forward
as they pass two more equally unwholesome looking men emerge from concealment and follow them to the sampan
everybody grips their weapons tightly
under his breath these guys look like theyd sell their mothers
sometimes they do
theyre river pirates
before they step across onto the sampan co introduces the captain in vietnamese
wearing all manner of jewelry including four wristwatches and a pair of filthy western style jeans a size too large captain trong kinh grins and motions them aboard
the grin reveals bare gum where his upper front teeth would be
obviously broken out in a fight
wa ky number one
you come number one sampan
viet subtitled thank you captain for your hospitality
you speak english very well
grinning wider captain kinh motions them inside the cabin a rambling and dilapidated structure of corrugated sheet metal and woven bamboo
kinh barks orders at his men who cast off from their moorings and jump aboard
the first light of dawn is breaking through the trees
a raisin faced woman in an ao dai holding an infant shuffles aside as rambo steps down into the dim smoky interior
brewer co and kinh follow
the two americans must stoop in the scaled down structure
every conceivable space is crammed with scavenged or looted detritus ammo cases hubcaps radios a tv with no back books dead chickens an ice cube tray a toyota bumper outboard
there is no operant logic to most of it
looks like my room in college
we sleep here today
safe here while go up river
what about patrol boats
kinh opens a greasy wooden locker takes out his pride and joy a russian made rpg rocket grenade launcher
his grin glistens evilly in the gloom
a beautiful sunrise backs the treeline stretching long shadows across the quiet camp
the interior resembles that of a motor home complete with bunks kitchenette and a small bar
kirkhill is on the phone pacing
his reptilian aide lounges on a bunk
to phone no sir
were already committed
theyre in the jungle right now
i say we play the hand through
if they find something we just bury the report later
its still airtight
pause yes sir
he hangs up
runs a hand through his hair
to aide goddamn it
now the goddamn satellite shows the camp occupied
some trucks or something
grimly oh boy
its getting dicey
their manner becomes guarded when a knock at the door interrupts them
the aide unlocks it and admits trautman
im a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here
i thought id go out with the extraction team tonight
unless you have an objection
not liking it its not necessary
thats a pretty hairy ride
full colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing
trautman is calling him on it with a deadpan response
shrugs expansively have fun
kinhs hideous sampan churns upriver slowly powered by an ancient outboard motor
it passes other river traffic small hand powered sampans manned by figures in broad conical coolie hats
with the exception of a rare powered craft the scene is that of a vietnam unchanged by centuries
the ebb and flow of regimes and ideologies has little altered the basics of life here
rambo watches through a chink in the sheeting of the cabin as the timeless landscape rolls past
a view of the shoreline as brown children splash naked in the shallows where a row of hootches marches up the hill on stilts
the squeals and laughter come clearly across the water
rambo turns his gaze to the sampan interior
two of kinhs men co and brewer all sleep soundly
rambo watches co her face serene in sleep
the water is coppery silhouetting the sampan as it churns on
kinhs wife squats on the foredeck smoking a long stemmed clay pipe
the walnut faced woman hands rambo two bowls of nuoc mam
he passes one to brewer
have some armpit sauce
opens a c ration can
to co how did you get started working for the spooks
they talk to me at university before fall of saigon
everybodys makin deals
my brother captain in arvn
need papers to go united states or north vietnamese will execute
they make deal
i stay here and do work
my brother and my son can go united states
cos eyes drop and her whole demeaner deflates slightly
he twelve now
not see him for eight years
wheres his father
killed in war
her voice and expression convey the fatalistic acceptance of one who has seen death in all its forms
expects it as an element of daily life
wheres nguyen now
noting his concern huntington beach california
its nice there
hes probably digging every minute
got a surfboard
breaking girls hearts
distractedly nguyen is good boy
co gazes at the sunset beyond the door
a tear runs down her cheek
she catches herself
wipes it away almost brutally
she abruptly goes on deck
some hardened guerrilla fighter they gave us
rambo freezes him out with an evil look
suddenly there is a commotion on deck
the roar of a powerful engine
co bursts in a moment later
a fast launch roars toward them silhouetted by the setting sun
uniformed soldiers on deck bring twin caliber machine guns to bear
rambo and brewer dive under filthy bunks
lock and load their weapons
co pushes junk in over them
kinh rips open the cabinet
slams the shaft of a rocket grenade into the launch tube
co barks an order at him
lowers the weapon
co removes a small packet of north vietnamese bills from inside her blouse and hands it to kinh
the patrol boat pulls up in an arc almost swamping them
the soldiers on deck wear the uniforms of the north vietnamese navy
the deck gunner racks the bolt on his r
the captain shouts rapid vietnamese on a loud hailer
kinhs men lounge on the sampan indolently looking like fishermen on an evening trawl
the scrawny woman feeds an infant at one sagging breast
the patrol captain draws his service pistol and jumps down into the sampan entering the cabin
co sits demurely on one bunk as kinh greets the officer
the officer begins poking through kinhs possessions
he tugs at the crate under the bunk where rambo lies concealed
the crate beside his head moves
the officers boot is visible through a widening crack
an argument in vietnamese is heard heating up
grips the mac tightly releases grips releases
sweat runs into his eyes
looks severe as he contemptuously thumbs through a sheaf of bills
kinh gesticulating pathetically adds some more to the stack
after a tense moment the officer kicks the crate next to rambo and stalks out tucking the payola in his tunic
he jumps off the sampan and the patrol boat roars on
rambo and brewer allow themselves to exhale
how you doing brewer
shaken i need a vacation
with co leading rambo and brewer move furtively along a tortuous trail
it has rained recently and the forest is alive with glistening reflections dripping water
the trail winds up a steep embankment
as they reach the top of the rise camera booms up over the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a compound beyond dark except for moonlight
watches from concealment in the foliage
he is invisible with his camo makeup except for darting eyes
looking between the leaves scanning the prison camp
two shabby wooden guard towers stand at diagonally opposite corners of the compound
there is a simple fence of barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a main gate with a sentry box
three long wooden barracks form a u filling most of the compound
the place seems deserted
check the tower with your scope
brewer raises the rifle sighting through the massive starlight scope
the image is bright lurid
black and white with a greenish cast
like contrasty daylight
he pans up the tower
a russian made p
mm machine gun sits pointing skyward
the tower seems unoccupied
wait a minute
a brief glow of light illuminates the face of a tower guard hidden in shadows
whats he here for
nearby another guard saunters out of the forest dressed in nva regular privates uniform with the sleeves rolled up casually
his ak is slung over his shoulder
slips the telescopic microphone out of his rucksack and clamps it to the side of his scope
he slips on a pair of small earphones and pans the rifle scope mike over the nearest barracks unit
five six guys
somebody talking in his sleep
a toilet flushing
take some shots
brewer locks a mm slr camera to an adapter on the starlight scope
he starts clicking off some shots
brewer then scans the long hut across the compound
he whips off the earphones in pain as a low scream echoes across the camp
it fades into a delirious moaning
nodding grimly bad dreams
brewer clicks away
a tiny engine whining draws their attention to the main gate where a young woman on a lambretta scooter pulls up to the sentry shack
brewer zeros on her as she greets the gate guards
cyclo girl whore from village
business slow there
rambo takes the earphones listening to the girls distant chattering
shes making him a pretty good deal
apparently the guard agrees because he opens the gate and the girl slips inside
by the far tower
brewer pans to the distant shape
its a guy in a cage
hes real scrunched up in that thing
let me see
the image is of an emaciated figure slumped in a bamboo cage
the mans skin is ghostly white
he seems almost a living skeleton dressed only in ragged shorts
his wrists are clamped in a wooden stock and blood runs down his arms from the abraded sores
though gaunt and filthy he is clearly caucasian
angrily torture cage
lets get some shots
moving slowly in as he hands the kluge back to brewer
that guys not going to make it
nothing we can do man
rambo decides in that moment
im getting him out
are you crazy
were supposed to take pictures and split
youre gonna blow the whole program
you never been in one of those things
i suppose you have
rambo holds his wrists up right under brewers nose
showing the chafing scars
when they tell you to do something and then you do it
john wayne is dead man
rising you take pictures and split
im going in
brewer throws down his rifle
he can barely form words
then a slow grin spreads
how we gonna do it
moving with brewer as he belly crawls to the edge of the cleared area just a few yards from the wire
he is right under one tower hidden among ferns
as rambos silhouette crosses to the wire farther down
dollying with rambo at ground level as he crawls under the wire and undulates from shadow to shadow
he reaches the nearest building
rambo moves on in silence
he is barefoot the pale skin smeared with mud and carries only the pistol crossbow
without rifle pack harness or grenades to clatter he moves like a spirit in the material world
rambo raises one eye slowly over a window ledge
inside several guards sleep soundly under mosquito netting
their rifles are stacked against the far wall
snoring ludicrously loud
he bats at a mosquito grunts
moving with rambo as he crawls among the support posts
he freezes as a light is snapped on above him
it streams down through cracks between floorboards
moving very slowly rambo squints through a gap
a low angle on a uniformed guard rummaging in a tiny prehistoric refrigerator humming to himself
he takes out a can of coke recognizable although the label is in chinese characters
rolls it slowly across his sweaty forehead
the foam now runs onto the floor drips into rambos eyes
the light snaps off
rambo moves on
there are two rows of rusted iron bunks set out like a hospital ward
most of them are empty
like the man in the cage they are gaunt scabrous
dressed in ragged peasant clothes too small for them
one man bathed in sweat moans and tosses with malarial fever
another is wrapped so tightly in a fetal position his face is between his knees
they have padded the bare springs of their cots with mattresses of rubber leaves
rambo stands a few feet from them as if giving a benediction the crossbow raised in one hand
he moves on leaving no trace
the guard reclines in a folding chair nodding to the beat of unheard music
a sony walkman is clipped on his belt and he has the earphones over his gray peaked cap
he takes a last drag and tosses a cigarette over the parapet
tight on brewer hugging the ground as the smoldering butt lands five feet from him
in the pool of light from a floodlight
he groans watching the smoke curl up
starts creeping his hand toward the butt
the man inside opens his eyes when rambo touches his broomstick neck feeling for a pulse
his lips are parched and there is a horrible bruise around one eye
barely audible whore you
come to get you out
man you are one scary looking motherfucker
can you walk
i could a couple of days ago
rambo quickly picks the lock on the wrist clamps and then slips his lile knife from its sheath
starts cutting the lashings on the bamboo cage
whats your name
dave de fravio
the door gives way and rambo steadies de fravio as he slumps forward
shakes his hand good to meet you dave
okay im going to carry you
dont cough or make any noise
sure thing rambo
you gettin the other guys too
not this time
well be back
rambo slings de fravios gaunt six foot frame over his shoulder in a firemans carry and heads off in a crouching run
crossing a pool of light b
as the sentry lounges in his shack
brewer seems to have lost sight of rambo
he scans the camp to the treeline and back
the filterless cigarette is smoked almost to his lips
a booted foot smashes down on his rifle pinning one hand
he looks up at
a north vietnamese guard who holds an ak in brewers face
with his headphones on brewer hadnt heard the quiet approach from behind
brewer closes his eyes in profound misery
there is a soft thunk
brewer opens his eyes as the ak falls into the grass
looks up to see
the guard is leaning back against a tree motionless
the vaned tail of a crossbow bolt protrudes from his neck under the jaw
he is pinned to the tree quite dead
rambo appears from the undergrowth still carrying de fravio crossbow in hand
to brewer thats two
brewer and rambo carrying the pow rejoin co on the ridge where they had left their gear
rambo sets de fravio down and reaches for his boots
the pow looks dazedly at his rescuers
his eyes in hollow sockets track from one to the other
weakly you guys are real
sorry i mean
i talk to people all the time
i know a lot of them arent there
but this is real isnt it
youre taking me home now
thats right buddy
de fravio sits frozen for a moment then a dry sob wracks his entire body and he puts his arms around brewer
he cries with utter abandon quietly while brewer looks at him helplessly
brewer looks at rambo with a stricken expression
then puts his arms clumsily around de fravio like somebody holding a baby for the first time
co touches rambos hand
motions lets go with a cock of her head
a stocky sergeant of the guard stands over the partially concealed body of the guard rambo killed
he raises his whistle and sends a shrill blast across the camp
lights come on in the guard barracks
the sampan waits beyond a screen of trees as brewer calls in on the transat
co is helping de fravio walk unsteadily down to the boat b
the river bandits eye the tall death like figure suspiciously
wed better go for the emergency lz at point zulu sierra
tell them weve got some heat but dont mention de fravio
brewer starts typing
doyles ground crew is removing the camouflage canopy from the uh blackhawk helicopter
the turbines are warming up with an ascending whine
doyle and trautman f
turn as the door to the command trailer bursts open and a tech runs out
youre go for extraction
kirkhill says wind er up
heres the hardcopy
trautman takes the printout
to doyle alternate lz zulu sierra at
it says may have heat
dont be late
all our love
scowling at his watch lets get that tent down
de fravio seems a little more in focus as he sits huddled with the others in the cramped cabin
i gotta tell you its just luck you guys came when you did
they move us around a lot
we only been at that camp a week
got a smoke
what kind of raggedy ass rescue you call this
why were you in the box
well i caught this cobra see
you mean the snake
its not hard once you get the hang of it
in the wrist
anyway i did what i always do when i get one
straight faced put it in the guards barracks
pause man they got pissed
they beat the crap out of me but
its kind of a tradition
you oughta see em run around
chuckling you got a bad attitude
de fravio grins showing bad teeth as well
i know it
de fravio eyes co as she hands him a plate of rice and meat
youre pretty cute
doing anything this weekend
smiling eat slowly
dont make yourself sick
she exits with the dirty cooking utensils
when co closes the door to the cabin kinh sidles up to her and rapidly whispers something in vietnamese
he seems to be eliciting a response and eyes her warily
co freezes indecisively then nods yes
in the stern b
one of kinhs men is talking quietly on a beat up military style field radio
his voice is masked by the sound of the outboard motor
co whispers something and holds out her hand palm up
kinh grins gaptoothed
he pulls a
pistol from his belt and slips it to her
runs his finger along the curve of her neck
she quietly pulls the cocking slide chambering a round
the sampan glides into the brackish estuary amid half submerged trees
it is the original rendezvous point
everyone assembles on deck with rambo helping de fravio through the cabin door
brewer checks his watch
twenty five minutes
wed better roll
an ak muzzle is pressed into his kidney held by one of kinhs men
two more are covering brewer who had just handed his rifle to co while donning his pack
kinh steps up grinning
takes rambos rifle
a fourth guard eases an arm around his neck a long knife held under his jawline
it has all happened smoothly and with precision planning
wa ky number ten
yeah fuck your mama san too
kinh backhands him to the deck
his eyes cold looking at co
she advances on him
her black almond shaped eyes glitter alien as the depths of space
she spits in his face
kinh snorts a feral laugh
rambo doesnt react
her eyes dart to the side
something a microsecond flash of understanding passes between them
enraged beyond belief you slope bitch
she whirls on him drawing the
it is enormous in her childs hand
her expression is terrifying
the renegade behind brewer rockets backward his face rambo moves slapping his guards elbow driving the knife across and away
his teeth snap shut on the mans forearm
the knife falls
rambos hands are simultaneously seizing the other guards ak just as he fires
rambo holds his hand on the mans trigger hand aiming the gun
bullets rake from groin to face on the third man standing opposite them
he spins back his rifle blasting away harmlessly into the sky
co places the muzzle of the
against kinhs temple
his grin is long gone
rambo drives the butt of the second mans ak into his stomach twice
the bandit lets go
firing blind over his shoulder rambo vaporizes the head of his guard whose hand he still grips viciously in his teeth
he releases the hand
almost like spitting out the dead man
clutching his stomach the last bandit leaps to the shore
fifteen rounds from brewers silenced mac stutter quietly into him
he pitches face down in the mud
a cloud of blue cordite smoke disappears in silence
the whole thing lasted four seconds
what just happened
rambo moves over to co
she seems to sag depleted
he takes the
from her limp fingers
viet subtitled are you okay
answering in english yes
but i lose many merits in next life
whyd they want us
they heard about escaped prisoner on radio
more than we pay
they sold us out
now im pissed
they were fools
to think there would be reward
and to ask my help
rambo puts his hands on her shoulders
pig dog kinh say meet them here
whole garrison from con cuong is out
nodding grimly lets go
at treetop level the all black uh roars down a forested valley at mph using no illumination but the moon
as it rises and drops with the terrain
once again doyle is night flying in a blacked out cockpit putting the landing skids through the treetops
trautman stands behind the seats in the main bay
night air roars in the open door and lifer on door gun dangles his legs in the windstream
the rain forest is a dim blur very close below
shouting back in indian country
just like old times
he racks the bolt on his m and grins
trautman nods politely and looks at his watch
rambos group circles the ruins as they head for the landing zone
the trail skirts an escarpment which drops over a hundred feet to the ca river below
not far from the overgrown spires of the wat is a stream which breaks over the cliff in a graceful waterfall dropping unimpeded into a lagoon
the vista is quite stunning in the moonlight
brewer is struggling with both packs plus the heavy transat since rambo has de fravio and co has her own pack
brewer scrambles slipping back on the steep trail
lets ditch this transat
we dont need it
rambo considers for a moment then pulls away some underbrush beside a collapsed wall of the ruin
bury it here
brewer gets out his entrenching tool
a cold pre dawn light suffuses the rain forest giving it an expectant quality
rambo scans the ridgeline with brewers scope
figures of twenty or more vietnamese soldiers can be seen threading among the trees
to co you better take off
aint you coming with us sweet thing
my orders stay here
she turns to head off along a diverging trail
rambo touches her shoulder
see you in california
her grin is ironic
land of big px
maybe i take you for a ride in my cadillac
rambo watches her go
a tiny anonymous peasant girl
trautman watches over doyles shoulder as the helicopter roars between the walls of a mountain pass
the ship is buffeted by turbulence bouncing and dropping violently
turning three minutes
the steep slopes fall away and doyle dives the ship across the rolling foothills
we hear a faint call barely audible over static
filtered zen hammer this is slam dunk one do you copy
roger slam dunk one
what is your position
rambo is crouched with brewer and de fravio in a hollow beside an earth dike
they are taking automatic weapons fire from the trees nearby
spurts of earth leap up around them
rambo is shouting in a controlled articulate voice into a small prc field radio while brewer lays down suppressing fire with his m a
yelling zen hammer
the heats on
were taking fire
watch for my smoke
red and green
northwest corner of a big paddy
to brewer lets move
rambo and brewer carrying de fravio charge up and over the dike as the ground is ripped around them
rambo hurls two smoke grenades down the dike wall
columns of red and green smoke begin roiling upward
the dike on which they are pinned down forms part of the enclosure for a complex of terraced rice paddies which occupy the few flat acres of this hilly terrain
the flooded fields reflect the pre dawn sky like plates of burnished metal
rambo slams in another clip and fires in short controlled burst
brewer hands a captured ak to de fravio
the ex pow opens up with a vengeance
go for it man
various angles as three troop trucks slide to a halt on a rutted jungle road disgorging squads of nva troops
mortars are set up
they fire with a the americans duck as a mortar round explodes in the paddy behind them throwing up a geyser of mud
brewer picks up the prc mike
on radio you guys comin or what
through the front canopy distant wisps of red and green smoke can be seen
the paddies rush by below in a blur
we have you on visual
we are coming in
how many are you
we got an american pow with us
relay to command
they have one of ours
kirkhill is pacing behind the main console
i have an awacs relay
zen hammer reports the ground team has an american pow with them
kirkhills reaction is unexpected
he whips around
what did you say
grinning theyve got one of ours
as a look of frustrated rage is replaced by deadly calm
loudly this station is now on condition bravo
the puzzled techs drop their headsets and leave
continuing to tech go to your comint priority frequency
give me the mike
zen hammer this is coach one
this is an alpha kilo victor command priority
filtered roger coach one
i want you to abort the operation immediately
fuhrman cant believe it
say again coach one
he presses the helmet headphone tight to his ear then turns to trautman cupping his hand over the mike
to trautman he wants us to abort before pick up
it is confirmed
to mike coach one
we have them in sight
pause yes sir
doyle looks at both of them and shrugs
to doyle i thought you liked those guys
but they aint payin the rent jack
stay on your heading captain
cant do it
thats an order
implacable sorry sir
trautman has his hand on the butt of his
when he hears the clack of a rifle bolt over the rotor noise and turns
lifer has an m in his lap not exactly aimed at the colonel but not aimed away either
smirking we aint uncle sams misguided children no more colonel
were independent contractors
thats right sir
we dont like this but we are working for mr
you pathetic scum
looking down well if there werent pows before there are now
rambo half supports de fravio with one arm and fires his ak with the other as they slog through the calf deep water
mortar rounds explode on all sides
they watch the uh skimming in low across the paddies blasting up a curtain of spray
almost to them
it veers in a tight bank and climbs out
wheres he going
to radio hey zen hammer where are you going
pause do you read zen hammer
son of a bitch
theyre ditching us
the water is shot into spray around them
a mortar shell lands so close it knocks them down drenching them with slimy black mud
the radio disappears in the water
rising brewer takes a round in the thigh
disappears for a second
comes up gasping
rambo watches the uh diminishing to a black dot
he is so consumed with rage that his expression goes slack
a murderous disconnection from conscience
and yet in that same moment a tremendous surge of blind will clears his mind a determination to survive to get out at whatever cost
to find whoever did this
it is no longer just a mission
it is a very personal piece of business
he turns and lets his rifle drop into the water
he takes de fravios and throws it away
through gritted teeth the fuckers left us man
they left us
brewer wallows weakly his blood streaming out into the muddy water
de fravio looks stunned lost
he sags to his knees
it gets quiet
in a ragged line the nva soldiers advance to the top of the dike
finally almost eighty looking down at the americans
rambo slowly raises his hands
over the shoulder of co watching from behind a screen of foliage as the ring of nva troops converge on the tiny figures of rambo brewer and de fravio
tight on co her expression enigmatic
she turns and darts away vanishing into the forest
kirkhill is pouring scotch over ice in two glasses as the door behind him bangs open
trautmans expression could slice a steak
have a drink
kirkhill offers a glass to trautman who ignores it
kirkhill sets the glass down and sits at the dinette motioning trautman to sit as well
shrugs you got five hours
ill tell you about secretaries of state and funding committees and diplomatic relations
trautman slowly sits opposite him his demeanor becoming more reasonable
take your time
were all adults here
this is a war
a very quiet very intense war
people get sacrificed
not my people
kirkhill freezes glancing down
the muzzle of trautmans service
is jammed into his groin
continuing but youre right
some people do get sacrificed
now tell me why you pulled the plug
you think im some whacko
i like to hurt people
im doing a job here
if i knew whats right or wrong id be a goddamned priest right
so i follow directives
i do what im told
if your boy had done what he was told there wouldnt be a problem
dont dance me kirkhill
youll be walking funny
trautman leans on the
a bit and kirkhill backs into the seat cushion
look it was a screw up alright
they werent supposed to find anything
we thought that camp was empty
this mission was a scam from the word go
word came down
they wanted an answer
and they knew the answer they wanted no pows
but it had to look good
the whole dog and pony show
kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch
realizing rambo and brewer were selected as write offs
it was clean
rambo was a decorated vietnam vet a former pow himself
if he came out and said no pows the sub committee would buy it
he gets himself caught hes a private citizen a whacko acting on his own
if he gets proof it gets lost somewhere between here and d
rambos gotta be a hero
thinks hes starring in his own war movie or something
he put me in a corner
terminate with extreme prejudice
thats a crock
we dont say that
do you have any idea the shitstorm if hed gotten back with that guy
if it went public
the white house would have to act through channels
were talking ransom
four billion bucks in war reparations to vietnam to get the others back
thats billion colonel
with a b
for a few guys thatve had their brains in a blender for ten years
a pain in the ass to everybody
theres no way
the colonel has let the pistol drop until it is dangling forgotten
so there never was a phase two rescue team
of course not
you cant get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after tehran
after a long silence trautman nods
its going to be okay
the colonel is one of the boys
trautman doesnt take the glass
reasonably i understand your position
pause i understand how a maggot like you can just slide out of a jam on a trail of slime
and call it expedience
kirkhill slams his empty glass down
his tone becomes self righteous
youre out of your depth trautman
im acting correctly here
not your gung ho jungle ace
pause its over
its not over
you made one mistake
trautman clicks the safety and reholsters the
his eyes ablaze face crusted with dried mud and sweat
revealing him under guard arms bound painfully tight behind him in the back of a troop truck
he is seized by two viet soldiers and dragged forward off the truck
de fravio hits the ground behind him and brewer moaning on a stretcher is unloaded
his fatigues are matted to the skin by dried blood from hip to knee
camp commander captain vo quoc vinh strides across the compound
he is fairly twitching with suppressed rage at the loss of face brought on by his useless guards
he screams orders as the troops dismount roughly dragging forward the three captives
a viet sergeant turns the captives over to chief guard sergeant tran van tay with a quick salute
the instant vinh stops shouting tay begins like a relay
the prisoners are prodded forward
rambo walks beside a wide eyed brewer
are they going to torture us
a guard shoves rambo on ahead as brewers carriers stop at the door of an isolation cell
looking back hope they kill you by mistake
rambos guard slams his rifle butt into the americans belly half doubling him over
the door to a tiny fetid room is opened and brewer is dumped off the stretcher and flung inside
he lands on his knees and gasps in pain clutching his leg
the door clangs shut leaving stifling gloom
groaning this aint happening
de fravio is helped back to his bunk by one of the other prisoners
there are few moments in human experience as devastating as the return to prison especially this prison
the absolute abandonment of hope
several of the pows sit near him silently offering their support
it is evident that two of the men b
are as autistic as de fravio having succumbed to that withdrawn plane long before
jensen a prisoner with one leg settles beside de fravio on his bunk
puts a spidery hand on his shoulder
we were pulling for you dave
we hoped youd make it
de fravios eyes focus
the merest spark of the old defiant de fravio glimmers wanly
low angle on sgt
tay powerful and vicious looking as a rabid ferret
he raises one fist holding a length of rubber strap cut from a truck tire and smashes it down there is a sickening thud against flesh
grimacing from the blow
there are board red welts over both collarbones oozing blood in places
showing rambo on his knees at the center of a bare concrete room
a single window admits a shaft of red dusk light like a spotlight
rambo sways in the spotlight glistening with sweat stripped to his g
in the four corners of the small room are guards with rifles
others crowd in the doorway grinning and jostling to see
the truncheon descends against rambos face
he sprawls onto the floor face down nose streaming blood
vinh enters with a strident shout stopping tay from another blow
the two officers exit at a run leaving rambo on his face before the guards
an unearthly wind and the thunder of several helicopter rotors fills the camp
two american made huey helicopters descend to lumpy landings near the guard towers
one is a uh d slick troop carrier and the other is a uh b gunship outfitted with a pedestal mounted minigun and m door gun
captured from the arvn in both ships bear the insignia of the republic of vietnam
beyond the guard tower and dwarfing the two hueys an enormous helicopter roars out of the setting sun
running lights and strobes flash as the massive silhouette drops into the courtyard raising a blast of dust
it is a soviet mil mi assault helicopter
its double blister canopies look like huge insect eyes
the stubwing weapons pods bristle with rockets and cannons
it is painted with jungle camouflage and bears the red star insignia of the soviet naval air wing
the viet officers and guards cringe against the rotor blast as the ship settles
the side door slides open
dolly back preceding two russian officers who tower above the vietnamese as they stride across the camp
vinh points to the concrete blockhouse and the officers stride past him without slowing
he falls in behind them trying to keep up
jensen turns from the window as the mil mi s jet whine fades
its those russian interrogators again
everyone looks grim
vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident yells as he follows the two russians into the room
the soviets stand in front of rambo
the shorter of the two lieutenant commander yati podovsk has the slight build and unremarkable features of a bank clerk though for a man in his forties he is in
the other lieutenant palyushin is another story
he is a tall broad slab of combat muscle his black hair cut short as a scrub brush
thick and functional as state sculpture his features cannot fill his broad flat face
both wear the khaki field dress and black beret of the naval spetznatz brigada the special operations brigada
at palyushins feet rambo finds himself looking up at his soviet opposite number the black beret
in russian put him in the chair
palyushin hauls rambo onto a wooden stool against the wall
podovsk sits next to him on a small metal desk
it is almost dark and the only light is from a single bare bulb
viet to vinh thank you captain vinh
leave one guard please
vinh exits with tay and the other three viets
podovsk adjusts his wire rim glasses and considers rambo
he turns rambos bloodied face gently examining the injuries
these people are so
vulgar in their approach
i am lieutenant commander podovsk
i do not know who you are
will you tell me
podovsks english is lightly accented but clear and articulate
he has a nasal condition however
rambo doesnt answer
not even your name
silence this is a poor beginning for an intimate relationship
by tomorrow or the next day you will tell me things you would not tell a lover
podovsk notices the long criss crossed scars on rambos chest and back
continuing i see you are no stranger to pain
then of course you must know how senseless it is to resist in the long run
is it possible you have been among my vietnamese comrades before
podovsk catches something as rambo breaks his gaze looking away
i think that must be it
where were you held
im getting ahead
sometimes i get too eager
my comrade and i in our capacity as advisors have been sent from our center at cam ranh bay to discover from you certain things
for example whether you are working directly for the american government
who your contacts were
and on and on
quite a list
will you tell me these things now
rambo gazes at a point in space
continuing of course you wont
but as a moral man i felt compelled to ask
he stands with a shrug of finality and gestures to his massive assistant
this is lieutenant palyushin
to him you are a piece of meat
in russian to palyushin proceed
on palyushin walking forward
the guard in the sentry box glances up from a newspaper at the sound of an approaching motorbike
a young woman wearing an ao dai and coolie hat rides up on a honda scooter and stops by the shack
as she steps up to the guards box and coos something to the sentry
he grins to see a new face among the whores from the village and one so pretty
revealing that she is co as she dickers price through the sentry box window
he unlatches the gate
an iron bed frame has been brought in and leaned vertically against the wall opposite the door
rambo has been tied to the frame spread eagle by lengths of coat hanger wire around his ankles neck and forearms at the elbows
palyushin is setting up a box like piece of equipment on the small desk
there are wires running from the bedframe and from a metal plate about the size of a paperback book taped to rambos belly
palyushin clamps the other ends of the cables to terminal posts on the box which has a large rheostat knob and several switches and dials
i was sent here because of my command of your language
it will be frustrating if we cannot have a nice chat
russian to palyushin ready
palyushin nods and douses rambo with a bucket of water
russian test please
palyushin without ceremony twists the knob
rambo convulses with an explosive muscle contraction
slams against the springs
his veins swell as if to burst
the lights of the camp dim flickering under the current load
rambo slams convulsively against the electric grid formed by the steel bed
his teeth are clenched as if he has tetanus
the lights come up to normal brightness
de fravio closes his eyes sharing a ghost of the pain
rambo hangs from his bonds heaving and shivering
podovsk turns to him conversationally as if he were an acquaintance at work rather than a man being tortured
here is something you might be interested in
he draws a folded piece of paper from his pocket
a transcript of the conversation between your helicopter pilot and his commander intercepted and unscrambled by our overworked cryptography staff
here we are ah coach one
we have them in sight
and the reply abort immediately
return to base camp
he graciously shows rambo the printout
it seems they intentionally abandoned you on direct orders
there are the people you protect with your silence
with your pain
he snaps his fingers and palyushin cranks the knob
the lights dim
rambo fights the scream unleashed within him with every fiber of his being
straining like a demon every muscle sharply defined and rock hard
almost kindly but you must scream
there is no shame
it bursts out a roar that frays his vocal cords
co moving stealthily in the shadow of a wall pauses at the sound of the scream
notes its direction
in the darkness brewer rages against the inhuman screaming pounding the wall
rambo hangs so limply that he might be dead
podovsk moves in to check as rambos head begins to rise
as he looks up
his eyes seem like diamond drills
there is such determination born of rage in his expression that podovsk stops
takes a step back
snaps his fingers
rambo convulses and begins to scream
podovsk nods to his assistant
cuts off the current
but the scream continues
gets the lieutenant looks up puzzled
rambo is going berserk
his body is an out of control machine lashing and tearing at the frame
the scream breaks and becomes a ferocious howl
the viet guard steps forward alarmed and unnerved
his rifle is raised warding off evil
podovsk motions him back and steps closer himself
the bedframe begins to twist creaking and warping under rambos frenzied assault
podovsk takes a reflexive step forward
rambos hand shoots out free suddenly like a grappling hook
palyushin hits the current
rambo jerks podovsk into a headlock a death embrace
to palyushin nyet
the russian lashes about convulsing in the current
the lieutenant cuts the power
rambo snatches podovsks makarov pistol from his holster
aims it at his temple before palyushin can reach for his
the black beret eases his hand away from his holster
a figure slips through the door behind him
co cuts his throat in one motion with a bush knife
she covers palyushin with the guards ak as she circles to rambo who is still enmeshed in metal wreckage
rambo smashes the makarov into podovsks temple twice then holds palyushin transfixed by his pistol sights as co works quickly at his bonds
there are superficial cuts on his forearms ankles and neck from the wire
rambo screams hideously and with cold premeditation to mask the sound of her work
the effect is bizarre surreal maniacal
whispering we get out
they not want me
rambo steps from the wreckage and advances on the hulking black beret pistol ready
again he screams almost a war cry now and smashes his fist into the russians face with the force of his entire body behind it
the big mans head ricochets off the wall into a second piledriver punch
palyushin goes down
podovsk groans and stirs until rambo twists the knob
despite a bad connection podovsk jerks spasmodically under the collapsed metal frame lying in the puddle of water
before co can use the knife on palyushin capt
vinh enters his expression agape
he turns and bolts
vinh dashes out shouting maniacally
behind him rambo hurtles through the door a blur and smashes vinh against the concrete wall
vaulting over the crumpled camp commander without slowing rambo hits the outside door at a full run
just as sgt
tay is opening it from outside
tays ak flies from his hands as he tumbles back
rambo spins into him with a flying roundhouse kick which pitches him onto his back an inert heap
the transformer box shorts out under the continuous load frying with a bright flash
the lights of the camp go out completely
with co close behind him rambo runs toward the compound fence
a shout from nearby
a running guard and co open up with their assault rifles simultaneously
the guard dives for cover
rambo lifts the wire for co to wiggle under
she reciprocates for him as the tower guard spins his long unused pk machine gun and opens fire
co fires from the shoulder
the tower guard flinches at the unexpected return fire
his shots go wild
cos ak empties
she drops it
rambo and co make it into the forest running full out
more aks open up behind them
both tower pks
handheld preceding rambo at a dead run as he crashes through foliage
the forest is an insane blur
tracers whip by ruler straight lines of red light
bark explodes from tree trunks around them
leaves are ripped into green confetti
they angle away from the blind firing
stop at a game panting you are amazing
co is furious at his dawdling
pointing down trail di di mau
she spins and sprints away along the trail disappearing in a moment
rambo hesitates an instant then runs the other way
palyushin his nose and mouth streaming blood claws his way up the desk and reels across the dark room to podovsk
he hurls the metal frame off his superior who groans feebly
a guard holds sgt
tays shoulders as he retches
palyushin strides out of the interrogation blockhouse and jerks the sergeant to his feet by his collar
he points to the forest
viet subtitled find
he releases the viet sergeant and briskly walks toward the mil mi
tay weakly calls orders b
rounding up his guards
the russian pilot is waiting dutifully near his machine as palyushin approaches
the black beret makes a circular hand signal
wind her up
rambo at a dead run zig zags along the dark game trail
the path steepens and he claws at exposed roots
climbing as much as running
behind him is the rising sound of rotors
using hand lights to follow his footprints tays squad of six guards jogs into the jungle
behind them through the trees the massive assault helicopter and its escort of hueys rise into the night
the three choppers switch on their high intensity searchlights as they thunder overhead
shafts of light pierce the jungle
rambo is climbing rapidly using roots as handholds to ascend the steep trail
the whump whump of the helicopters approaches the glare of light flickering behind him
rambo moves into a densely woven thicket
the guards are ascending the trail like hounds
rambo crashes through foliage as a searchlight sweeps it races over him backlighting him as he dives off the trail
the searchlight flicks past him
tracers rip down through the trees
rambo tumbles rolls comes up running
he tears through the jungle in a frenzy
the foliage is alive with blasting air
he dives over the edge of a muddy ravine dropping through tangled vines
catching clawing dropping
he runs on
they cant target him
he hits a solid trail and sprints really covering ground
the shaft of light scans back and forth behind him
then farther away
theyve lost him
for the moment
as the choppers circle seemingly dueling with lances of light
rambo moving rapidly but more carefully glides among the trees
he stops at the bank of a tiny stream setting down knife and pistol
scooping stinking black mud from the stream bed he begins to slather it over his pale skin with quick sure strokes
eyes closed as he smears the goo thoroughly over every exposed area
his eyes open
it is a neolithic feral visage that turns away into the foliage
moving forward cautiously
unfamiliar with tracking and little else really except bullying weak prisoners they crash around clumsily falling and cursing in the dense thicket
moving in absolute silence nearby
fifteen meters away is a small wild pig asleep under a knot of vines
rambo fires the makarov hitting the earth near the pig
it squeals and leaps up
wave their aks looking for the source of the shot
they hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the right
movement in dense brush
they open fire
the crash of sustained fire is deafening
they blast blindly away lighting up the forest
their attention is so focused the din so loud they do not notice a dark figure moving up behind them
rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket knife buried to the hilt hand over his mouth
tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others finally stop
they move away advancing on their target
tay gingerly parts woven branches revealing the pig riddled with hundreds of
he turns to the others
viet subtitled wheres trang
the other guards look around puzzled
a shadow in shadows
he slips the clip from the ak he has liberated but finds it almost empty
sets it down quietly
tay spreads his men out to sweep the area in an arc
the guards advance stricken with a growing unease
low angle through the trees as the soviet assault helicopter passes overhead its searchlight sweeping
the canopy of foliage lashes violently as the rotor wash blasts through it
monkeys shriek and leap about
as the godlike shaft of light moves through the brush behind him
passing within a meter of him
he moves quickly off
the disk of hideously bright light passes over two guards blinding them
one trips and goes down
the other the outermost man of the sweep waits for him to rise
viet subtitled vuoc
the guard moves cautiously to his friends last position
ahead face down in a shallow stream is the body of vuoc his blood running away with the water
approaching the body warily the guard plays his flashlight around him in a full circle
featureless matted vines and mud
suddenly a pair of eyes kneeling over vuoc in the f
behind him there is silent movement among the gnarled roots and vines in a muddy embankment
blending flawlessly with the mudbank rambos mud encrusted figure has been in plain view yet concealed until he opened his eyes and moved
he emerges noiselessly and moves up behind the guard looming above him
palyushin mans the forward cockpit the weapons bay
his hands clutch the handles of a machine gun as he scans the jungle below
the pilot directs the searchlight as he flies
palyushin touches his nose gingerly
it is clearly broken becoming a thickened purplish mass
realizing they are without their flankers the two center guards call out and move toward their last positions
they stand together at the top of the mudbank gaping at the two bodies sprawled below
isolated calling for his men to sound off
he hears a distant shout then a quick burst of gunfire
there is no answer
palyushin points at something on the ground
the pilot banks arcing around his searchlights target
tay moves forward hypnotically as if transfixed
the celestial shaft of the searchlight burns down ahead
like a vision he sees the bodies of his men sprawled in the quivering disk of light
one has been stripped of his clothing
he stares around terrified staggers back lip quivering
tay drops his rifle and runs back through the jungle
rambo climbs steadily
the mud dissolving in sweat runs in streaks off his body
he has stopped to slip on the fatigue pants he took from one of the guards
the pants come to mid calf but the material will protect against brambles and insects
he has also acquired an ak with extra magazines
his pockets bulge with soviet made grenades
rambo moves on into the mountains
tay stumbles out of the underbrush into a pool of light
the headlight of a viet army troop transport
a squad of men runs past him into the jungle fanning out
another truck arrives
the search is on in force
an f phantom jet taxis amid moving ground equipment under the floodlights as the sky slowly lightens
pan off the flightline onto trautman gazing out the window of a small office
he looks haggard
with the receiver cradled at his ear he is waiting for a call to connect
did you get my telex
pause yeah i know what time it is there
do you know what time it is here
look is there anything you can do up the line
you owe me one
im calling it in
pause yes this time
pause i know youre a general and im only a colonel
long pause so thats it huh
pause then frostily thanks buddy
he slams the receiver into its cradle and sits pondering
he is about to make a somewhat bizarre decision for a full colonel
trautman opens the door and the young corporal in the office beyond turns in his chair
get me a loach im going back out to ban bung kla
there is a scraping sound and light appears as a cement block is removed at floor level
de fravios face appears in the rectangular hole
whispering hey brewer
brewer crawls stiffly to the opening squinting at the glare
hoarsely i could use a beer
the cement block wall of the cells adjoins the raised wooden barracks
de fravio and jensen have belly crawled beneath the building to the cell where they have long used a loosened block to communicate with prisoners in the hole
your buddy made it out last night
the place went apeshit
how come he didnt take me
maybe because youre shot in the leg
listen how long do they keep you in this disease hole
i was in there for a month once
de fravio did three months
how do you keep from coming unglued
concentrate on a problem
like i built my dream house in my head brick by brick
board by board
if something really takes a day i thought about it for a whole day
i built a shopping mall
they slide the block into place and brewer sits in front of it coughing to hide the scrape as the door is opened by two guards
morning light blasts in blinding him as one guard hauls him roughly to his feet despite his wounded leg
menacingly watch it
dont fuck with me man
jerks a thumb at himself im dinky dau
the guards guffaw and drag him off
a line of viet soldiers moves through the shimmering jungle
as they move past revealing others beyond and the tops of parked trucks
the move ends on rambo watching from the branches of a tree as they move by only a few meters below
the choppers search methodically nearby
brewer is trussed tightly his elbows tied together and drawn up painfully by a cord attached to a ceiling fixture
palyushin looms in front of him holding the truck tire bludgeon
podovsk looking the worse for wear with a bandage covering half his face sits on the stool
the gaze of his exposed eye is malevolent
wearily i think you know where he is going
is there a rendezvous point
some guerrilla contract
a transmitter perhaps
earnestly no way
if i say anything
the interrogator scowls briefly perplexed
rising i cannot be responsible for the safety of the prisoners if he is not captured
this government now considers the existence of pows an embarrassment
an unmarked grave in the jungle may be their solution
i am only an advisor
advise my dick you siberian scumbag
palyushin explodes with a brutal blow to brewers ribs which doubles him over in agony
he struggles to regain his breath dragging at the air like a terminal emphysema patient
brewer slowly raises his head
sneering ke rist
whattaya trying to do man tickle me
palyushin snarls and smashes the truncheon down even harder
rambo runs crouching along a shallow gully trying to duck around the end of the advancing line of viet troops
he emerges from dense foliage onto a dirt track sideroad only to see a flanking squad of about ten men jogging toward him
they shout and hit the deck opening fire as he dives on into the underbrush
rambo runs zig zagging radically as small arms fire laces the woods around him
he crashes through foliage abandoning stealth
long lens whip panning with rambo as he charges down a long slope the trees a green blur
he crosses his arms over his face and batters through the brush with blind force
rambo bursts out of the dense tangle dragging streamers of vines and finds himself in an explosion of squawking he is in the muddy door yard of a rural hootch
part of a small hamlet of about a dozen buildings
pigs scatter grunting their surprise as rambo sprints across the yard
over a low rail fence
between the hootches
soldiers charge down the slope behind him
rambo emerges onto the main street at a dead run tearing a swath through the everyday village activities
the viet peasants scatter as the fierce american charges through their midst
a giant by their standards to begin with rambo is now a mud caked nightmare trailing vines and brambles
his face a mask of dark streaks topped by encrusted hair
he crashes into a panic stricken young man on a bicycle spilling them both
comes up running
rambo changes course to intersect with an ancient truck which is accelerating away headed out of the village
the truck rusted and mud caked into a brownish lump on wheels is hauling a load of chickens in a wire mesh cage on the flat bed
rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points his pistol through the window at the terrified old man driving
viet subtitled keep driving
rambo clings tightly as the truck rattles and bounces over the rutted road which shortly emerges from a stand of trees to run along a field of elephant grass
rambo sees soldiers converging on the road through the trees on the other side
behind him more emerge from the village and open fire
a bullet shatters the filthy windshield and the old driver loses control
the truck veers into a ditch slews hurling up a sheet of water and flops ignominiously on its side
rambo lands clear
the old man begins to sob helplessly
the chickens scatter in all directions
close on rambo freeing a rusted gas can from the twisted wreck of the truck bed
wide from behind the soldiers as they pour ak bursts into the truck meters away
a figure dashes from the now burning vehicle into the field of tall grass disappearing
two troop trucks are deploying soldiers as a group of officers stands near the chicken truck
tay climbs down from a six by cab
directing operations is capt
his face is bruised and abraded and one arm is on a sling
vinh motions tay impatiently toward where he stands at the edge of the elephant grass and tay wades into it joining him
beyond them the coarse grass becomes an impenetrable wall almost eight feet high
vinh snorts in disgust at tay and points at some trampled stalks
there is a bright smear of blood and beyond another
vinh cuffs his sergeant
viet subtitled you see
not a demon
now we find where hes crawled to die
tay indicates that the others should go ahead of him to have that honor
a line of thirty regulars moves into the grass
only the radio antennas of the squad leaders are visible above the waving stalks
the helicopters arc in from the distant ridgeline converging
pov handheld moving slowly through the grass
the point man parts the stalks ahead
it is a quiet eerie world with only the swish of the grass and the occasional sound off calls of the troopers
there is a clear trail of blood smeared on the grass indicating a serious wound
various closeups of the regulars as they advance each man realizing how utterly isolated he really is in his own island of space in the green sea
it is hot
some of the soldiers have their fatigues unbuttoned sleeves rolled up
sweat pours off them
pov handheld following the trail of blood
the grass is parted ahead and a small clearing comes into view
slowly moving up on something lying in the grass
two chickens their throats cut are lying beside the gas can which is upright with its cap off
a bizarre little shrine
there is no sign of rambo
reverse on the squad leader puzzled wary
insert rambos hand strikes a match igniting a wet trail of spilled gas with a whoosh
the squad leader looks up seeing the river of fire snaking toward him through the waving stalks
he turns panicked
crashes into the men behind him
shrieks at them to move
they trample over each other to run as the trail of fire reaches the can
tay sees a tremendous fireball erupt ahead
he freezes in his tracks as the nightmare begins again
shrieking a man runs toward him on fire charging past
vinh shouts futilely into a radio
firing blindly several troopers open up
from the trucks it is apparent that the grass is burning on its own in a long line where the fuse was laid out and in a widening circle around
the explosion site
black smoke rolls through the grass and troopers stumble about coughing as the wind carries it toward them
the choppers have moved in close overhead and their rotor wash fans the fire adding to the confusion
as he snakes rapidly through the stalks
hurls a grenade
runs on navigating by instinct in the dense smoke
is knocked down as a grenade detonates near him
a trooper helps him up sees a figure running nearby
hitting one of their own
the din is incredible the pandemonium absolute
a viet soldier reels through the grass
obviously a recent conscript the soldier is probably only years old and like all vietnamese looks even younger
he is terrified
he stumbles over the body of another trooper
as he rises a shape slashes through the grass right in front of him
he has never seen an american but it looks as monstrous as the descriptions
he raises his ak but rambo is quicker kicking it out of his hands
the kid flops on his butt and finds himself staring up rambos rifle barrel
he closes his eyes and pops into his mouth his buddhist prayer medallion hanging from a chain around his neck
he bites down and waits for oblivion
when he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him but grass
nearby vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back dim shapes rushing blindly through the murk
he staggers coughing out of the stand of grass to see tay sitting dazed nearby
tay gives him an evil smirk
barking orders like a maniac vinh calls for mortars to be set up
five mortars are positioned
mortar bombs poised above the launch tubes
the helicopters clear off
when the last wounded man is dragged clear vinh signals for a sighting round
it explodes beyond the wall of flame
the mortars open fire
the field explodes seconds later with the first salvo
earth and shredded grass are hurled skyward
a second salvo lands
and on and on pulverizing the entire area
rambo watches fascinated by the tremendous destruction unleashed on innocent acreage nearby
he slips slowly into the woods glancing back frequently at his trail
he stops occasionally to replace a disturbed twig or leaf or to rearrange branches when he passes through
the mortars thud on distantly as he creeps away
full shot as palyushin delivers a crippling blow to brewers ribs
brewer cries out hoarsely and slumps
close on brewer as his head slowly rises to look at the big russian
panting this your first day
podovsk catches his assistants hand before he swings
you think you can provoke us into beating you unconscious
we are not that
ive had it with you ratface
dont piss me off
podovsk takes the fan belt from palyushin and smashes it across brewers face
brewer scream hideously
we see only the top of his head
we dont want him to rise up but he does agonizingly
blood streams over the area where his eye is already swelling shut
dont say anything brewer
god damn that
shouting do it again you fuck
screaming come on
i love it
you hear me
i love it
podovsk looms before us swinging in slow motion into the lens
the scene fades out
under overcast sky rambo emerges at a steep walled ravine
there is a swaying suspension bridge of rope and woven vines crossing to the jungled slope beyond
looming at the top of that slope is the ruin of the wat on its plateau wreathed in streamers of blowing mist
not far away is the waterfall pouring itself into the gorge below
rambo stops at the far side of the bridge examining the vine cables
he starts pulling grenades out of his pockets
palyushin crosses the compound to the huey gunship which has just touched down
the other huey hovers above the trees b
the big russian appreciatively pats the minigun bolted in the main door as he climbs in
palyushin enters the cockpit motioning for the vietnamese pilot to take off as he slips a headset over his black beret
the ship rises and the two hueys bank across the jungle
the telecom tech turns as kirkhill enters
handing him a sheaf of papers more awacs intercepts
the russian takes time to translate
kirkhill scans a long printout transcript
hes giving them a run for their money
says here theyve got two hueys from danang
i didnt know those dinks had hueys
half their air force is our stuff
sir theres something else
a transat relay
just came through
he snatches the sheet from the tech
it reads stares at the sheet for a long time
rambo finishes dismantling the transat unit
he sets the pieces back into the hole of the cache he and brewer buried before their run through the jungle
he begins shoveling earth back into the hole
a beautiful purple moth orchid drops onto the ground by his hand
you not so hard to catch dinky dau rambo
rambo looks up along the tumbled stone wall
sitting near the top in shadow perched on a tree limb is co beaming like a cheshire cat
howd you get here
climbing down took bus most of way
i knew you would come here
he helps her down the last few feet and stands looking at her marveling
and howd you sneak up like that
dont want to get shot by you
anyway you need me
you think you are
she uses a viet word
in vul nerabo
but you get ass kicked without me
rambo has to laugh
were a pretty good team
co looks him over carefully
she touches his forehead
you look like hell
come up to the ruins i have medical kit
rambo lets her lead him to the path up the hill
the stone buddhas look on complacently as co attends to rambos minor wounds
during the ensuing conversation she cleans applies salve and bandages the wire lacerations and the numerous slashes from brambles and saw edged elephant grass
you try get across laos
get to thailand
got some business there
what are you gonna do
shrugs go united states
maybe teach economics
how you going to get there
you cant trust the spooks to pull you out
theyll use you up and throw you away
i go with you
i couldnt get you in
co stops her work and replies very quietly
yes you can
cos gaze holds his and her cheshire grin flickers
rambo realizes she is serious
the silence drags when he realizes how good that sounds to him at this moment
and how small a price that is to repay her
with finality okay
you got it
she seems a bit shocked then smiles impishly
you too easy
cos hands have been all over him but only now does he become aware of them on his shoulders
she draws her face up to his but rambo pulls back from the kiss
co looks puzzled as he slowly disengages from her contact
you dont feel love rambo
he leans back against the wall
why you dont feel love
her tone becomes aggressive dead inside maybe
you make yourself dead already so they cant kill you
she advances on him until her face is close to his her words finding their mark
continuing bucu bullshit
pause i have enough death already
she points into the undergrowth nearby to a ghostly blossom growing there among the tangled vines
a flower like that need good soil to grow
many time under earth is bones of animal
killed in jungle
make soil rich
grows most beautiful flower
you call orchid
many deaths in jungle
many beautiful flowers
rambo studies her intently
an emotional moment for him
he takes her flawless face in his hands draws her closer
suddenly his head snaps around
a distant thudding of copter rotors becomes audible growing slowly louder
rambo leaps up sprinting to a crumbled parapet
below in the valley the two hueys are slowly scanning like angry insects
a column of viet soldiers jogs across the swaying bridge
as the lead man approaches almost across the bridge
the object is a cluster of grenades lashed to a tree to which one of the main support cables of the bridge is attached
a fine wire runs down to the bridge walkway
the wire pulls a pin
rambo whips around as an explosion rips through the jungle
the bridge begins to collapse dumping half the soldiers into the ravine as one side drops
the others run back
the second cable tears away
the bridge swings down spilling the remaining men
the two hueys bank steeply and roar straight toward camera passing overhead
rambo and co head into a trail which leads down the backside of the plateau
rushing toward them is a platoon of viet regulars
rambo opens fire scattering them off the trail
he and co make it back to the wat as return fire rips through the jungle
rambo throws two grenades down the hill and sprints with co deeper into the maze of the ruined monastery
the soldiers fall back as the grenades detonate ahead of them
palyushin speaks into his helmet radio
viet subtitled get your men back
im beginning an attack run
the huey thunders toward the ruins banking in an arc to aim the minigun
rambo sees the huey coming in on a high arcing trajectory and knows hes in trouble
dragging co he dives under a section of wall which has collapsed like a lean to
palyushins thumb depresses the fire control switch
an awesome roar fills the sky
a column of orange fire blasts from the minigun as its gatling gun barrels rotate in a blur
one of the most ferocious anti personnel weapons used in the vietnam war the general electric m minigun fires six thousand
mm rounds per minute
since every fifth round is a tracer the impression is of a solid shaft of fire sustained between ship to ground
the sound is not that of a machine gun but rather a solid held note of thunder like a god belching
one of its nicknames was puff the magic dragon
the effect on the ground is unbelievable
trees are blown to kindling
the foliage is pulverized and blown upward like mist
the tracers hit the ground like an orange curtain stripping the stones of growth blasting up a cloud of emulsified jungle
in their crevice rambo and co huddle covering their ears
a fusillade of chips and splinters whips around them
suddenly the thunder cuts off
rambo rolls out
fires well aimed bursts at the retreating huey
palyushin hears rounds whacking the underside of the ship
he calmly orders the pilot to turn back
rambo crouches in the opening watching the ship bank
terrified what was that
hes coming in on our open side
they sprint across the courtyard as the minigun roars again
the curtain of devastation sweeps toward them as they run
they make it behind one of the buddhas just as the hail of death passes across it
the rounds blast a layer of weathered stone off the serene face
behind rambo the second huey pops above the trees firing with a conventional door gun an m
rambo fires back
tracers flash around him
co cries out
she is slammed against the wall
the second huey banks away
rambo crouches beside cos crumpled figure
palyushin turns to the pilot
viet subtitled return to staging area
we have to reload
rambo cradles co whose blouse is drenched with blood
it runs over his hands as he holds her helplessly
she is as white as the jungle orchid
her eyes focus slowly on rambo
almost inaudible dinky dau rambo
rambo is rocking her willing the life to stay in her his expression anguished
my name is john
very weak it doesnt hurt
why doesnt it hurt
palyushin coordinates the air operation
viet subtitled air two circle in a holding pattern
russian subtitled air three are you in position
in the spacious main cockpit which overlooks the lower weapons bay blister podovsk is seated with the russian pilot
russian subtitled ready air command
russian subtitled begin your run
the pilot turns to podovsk
russian subtitled how many are down there
the pilot looks at him strangely
the massive assault helicopter noses down and thunders forward across the jungle
very close on rambo rocking gently
youre gonna love it there
itll be great
we can do what we want
you and me
go to the beach
watch him ridin his surfboard
cos eyes are glazed half open
she is gone
somehow this one tragedy renders all the others pale
continuing oh god
he kisses her mouth fiercely
trying to make her live to infuse her cooling flesh with some of his vast will
russian subtitled meters
rambo lays co with infinite gentleness in the lap of the stone buddha
in the lap is one slightly cupped hand palm upward stripped of foliage by the minigun
co lies in the palm barely filling it
single sniping rounds whack occasionally near rambo
he is oblivious
rambo removes the tiny buddhist prayer medallion from around her neck and puts it on
straightens her clothing
looks up at the broad stone countenance
its expression is as always enigmatic
he turns as the assault chopper approaches running dead at him
two long metal cylinders detach from the stub wings and drop beginning their characteristic tumbling
he spins and runs leaving his rifle
rambo slashes through the trees like a madman running with everything he has
behind him the napalm canisters hit the ground at the edge of the ruins
an enormous fireball blossoms through the jungle
the canisters inertia carries them forward spewing twenty meter long arcs of flame
the inferno engulfs the buddhas and rolls forward through the trees silhouetting the tiny running figure of rambo
just as the firestorm reaches him he dives at a dead run off an embankment
into a rushing mountain stream about five meters wide
rambo dives to the bottom as a sun bright canopy of fire rushes across the surface with a muffled roar
the stream is only about two meters deep and is swiftly flowing
the napalm on the surface lights the bottom orange despite the daylight
he seems suspended in a fiery maelstrom
moving with rambos figure we dive at giddy speed over the tortuous streambed like some weird amusement park ride
rambo tumbles over and between smooth boulders
he strains to hold his breath as the fire diminishes above
then it is gone
he is clear
suddenly the rocks end dropping away
rambo tumbles clear of the falling water as he drops down the face of the cataract seen earlier
he hits the surface of the pool with a tremendous splash
boiling with turbulence as he surfaces gasping
he weakly sculls at the surface as the current carries him along
above on the escarpment a fire storm rages lighting up the jungle
the buddha is at the heart of the holocaust reminiscent of a self immolating monk
cos pyre is magnificent
the pool at the base of the cataract empties into swampland near the ca river
rambo lets the increasingly torpid flow carry him until he catches sight of a familiar object the abandoned sampan of the river bandits still moored among the huge tree roots
rambo clambers aboard and goes into the cabin
still in its wooden locker is the rpg rocket grenade launcher and a rack of rockets in a carrying pack
with rapid movements rambo dons the pack and picks up the launcher
moves to the stern
pulls hard on the starter rope of the filthy outboard
across the estuary one of the hueys is moving over the trees getting closer
the motor starts on the third pull
the viet pilot banks motioning to his door gunner
below them is the sampan chugging across the estuary
the pilot descends as the gunner opens fire
caliber slugs riddle the sampan sending splinters flying
it explodes its incredible hoard of junk hurled flaming into the swamp
the huey lowers farther rotorwash whipping the water into churning froth
the viets scan the debris spotting a floating body
as the corpse rolls slowly over
it is kinh the crazy bandit leader
the huey hovering meters away begins to turn toward us
something rises from the surface scum in close f
among the gnarled tree roots
a hulking figure dripping water and mud and strands of swamp weed
the launcher tube across his shoulder
as he wipes filthy water out of his eyes and returns to the scope sight blinking taking his time
the hueys m opens up walking a parade of waterspouts toward him across the water
with a tremendous backblast the rocket leaps out a fiery arrow and strikes the huey square in the canopy
the huey drops into the swamp its rotors twisting up and flying off
the fuel tanks explode
rambo pivots reloading
he takes aim and fires again
the rocket roars into the rain forest the blast sending approaching soldiers scattering
fires again flinching away from the rocket exhaust
his expression is grim his movements methodical
he pivots again
rounds start hitting around him
he holds position
beyond the trees off the river road the troop trucks are parked
nearby is a refueling truck for the helicopters
rambos rocket makes a direct hit
a fireball blasts up and out seeming to fill the jungle
palyushin sees the smoke rising from the carnage ahead as he returns with the minigun reloaded
he motions the pilot to hover over the partially submerged wreckage of the other huey
whip panning with rambo as he sprints along the horizontal trunk of a fallen tree
he vaults off the end
catches a skid of the hovering huey with one hand
palyushins door gunner swings his sling mounted free around to bear
rambos hand shoots up catches him pulls him out
the pilot feels the weight shift and looks back seeing rambo on the skid
he pulls pitch hard
the huey climbs arcing radically
rambo slips dangles
he crashes through the upper branches of a tree as the huey climbs banking in a tight arc
the rain forest rolls beneath his dangling legs
he heaves himself up
palyushin lurches out of his seat
he spins in time to see a filthy bloody and very intense looking rambo clambering in the gun door
he rushes rambo with a kick but rambo ducks and swings the m door gun on its mount blocking the russian
the two lock eyes and square off crouching in the low compartment
the pilot turns around and gapes in amazement allowing the craft to sideslip
palyushin lunges as the huey pitches wildly
rambo blocks in a sweeping shao lin chun roundhouse ending in a fierce hammer punch to palyushins face
they trade blows and blocks furiously finally grappling like wrestlers
they crash together into the wall by the minigun ammo canister
the huey yaws and recovers
open space roars outside as they strain near the doors trying desperately to maintain footing on the pitching floor
palyushin goes half out the door but clings tenaciously surging back inside
he hammers into rambo slamming him mercilessly back
a vicious kick drops rambo
the black beret grabs his hair and hurls him two handed toward the door
rambo desperately catches the handles of the door gun stopping his plunge into space
his weight swings the gun around in its sling pointing it into the ship
completely outside the helicopter rambo hangs from the handle with one hand
pulls the bolt with the other
and drills a long burst into palyushin at point blank range blasting him out the far door in an explosive spray of blood
the pilot turns terrified as rambo advances on him
rambo eases up beside him slipping his hand onto the reaching across he opens the pilots door
and flings him a figure tumbles from the low flying huey and splashes into the estuary
the huey dips and bucks then rights itself and flies off as the pilot surfaces gasping
kirkhill looks like he hasnt slept in days as he stirs his ten thousandth cup of machine coffee
well have they got him yet
the tech rereads the comint transcript
it looks like he shot down one of their gunships
and then he uh
took the other one
kirkhill sinks slowly into a chair
tay is sitting on the steps of the guard barracks looking a bit like a lost soul
the sound of a rotor gets louder
a shadow falls upon him
he looks up squinting
a shape an outline
in the glare of the sun
tay has a moment of apprehension
rambo unleashes the minigun
the left guard tower vanishes in a cloud of falling splinters as thunder rolls across the valley
the huey pivots nimbly
the minigun roars again
an orange lightning bolt vaporizes the right tower
as the thunder fades
tay starts to run
the prisoners dive for cover
three off duty guards in the guards barracks go for their rifles
they dont make it
the guards barracks seems to disintegrate as the minigun sweeps across it
a shock wave of destruction behind which only flying kindling remains
he pivots a last time and annihilates the sentry post with a one second burst
three guards have managed to take cover behind a truck by the main gate
they begin firing
low angle on the huey a roaring silhouette in the metallic mist
the minigun speaks
the truck is ripped open like aluminum foil shrapnel flying
the guards cease to exist
a spray of red mist and tattered scraps of uniforms settles to the ground
it is all over in seconds
the huey settles to earth in the center of the compound
tay crouching squints against the rotor blast
wild eyed capt
vinh steps from his partially collapsed office and raises his side arm pistol
tay snatches it from him with a terrified cry and an expression which says are you out of your fucking mind
flings the pistol away and turns toward the huey
out of the boiling blasting dust and smoke a figure to tay rambo is death incarnate
he is encrusted with dried mud dried blood streaked with rivulets of sweat
his eyes burn
rambo has detached the door gun from its sling and with the feed belt over one shoulder carries it like a rifle
he motions with the muzzle
tay and vinh flop forward face to the earth hands laced behind their heads
rambo moves past them eyeing the wreckage of the camp warily
the door is kicked open and rambo is there silhouetted
brewer is a sorry mess but alive
he raises his head blinking
gawd you look awful
trying to rise hold your pantyhose
here gimme a hand
rambo helps brewer who is nearly crippled with pain to his feet and supports him as they exit
the seven prisoners are helping one another into the copter as rambo and brewer hobble up
can you handle the door gun
tay and vinh are still face down and de fravio covers them with an ak found in the rubble
smoke swirls in the idling rotor wash as the barracks begins to burn
am i dreaming this
this is not real right
to guards i oughta grease you pricks but ive known you too long
lets go de fravio
when de fravio is aboard crammed in with the others in the main bay rambo remounts the m and jumps into the pilots seat
he brings up the rpms
the turbine whine increases
brewer crouched behind rambo yells forward
we got company
you better pull some pitch buddy
behind them diving out of the suns glare is podovsks massive assault helicopter
rambo pops the huey off the ground and runs hard at the treeline
the mil mi nosegun begins firing and the ground erupts behind the huey fountains of earth chasing it as it climbs out
at full climb the laden huey barely clears the trees and rambo immediately banks tight to get out of the noseguns field of fire
the soviet chopper tightens its arc but swings wide and rambo spirals back
brewer swings the door gun and gets off a long burst as the ground reels dizzyingly below and the horizon tilts
you know what that things packing
its a soviet mil mi
mm nose cannon heat seeking rockets and wire guided missiles plus
rambo noses the huey down building speed
tail high it shoots across the treetops its nose radio antenna ripping through the uppermost foliage
rolls on its side in a tight turn despite its bulk
twice the size and power of the huey and faster at the top end the high performance assault ship is a formidable opponent
but rambo pits skill against technology using the agility of his craft as his primary strategy
past the dodging huey as the soviet ship falls in behind steadily gaining
who flinches as trees rush by seemingly inches away at mph
the pows are flung against the bulkheads as the huey plummets and swerves
i think im gonna be sick
the pilot turns to podovsk
russian subtitled theyre approaching the border
should we notify the laotian air force
well take them ourselves
inside the computerized weapons bay the gunner hunches over his tracking screen
rambos huey is a shimmering blob weaving behind a targeting reticle
the ranging radar emits a rhythmic pinging which increases in frequency
two air to air rockets flash from support pylons on the stub wings and roar toward the huey two hundred meters ahead
as the rockets skim past missing only barely to explode in the jungle
through the front canopy as the huey flies through the rising fireballs
rambo sees what he needs a narrow river a tributary of the ca slicing through the rain forest
the soviet juggernaut is gaining as rambo dives his gunship onto the deck tearing down through an opening in the trees and skimming over the surface of the river
the soviet craft cant follow
the enormous trees form a canyon the walls of which overhang the river
rambo is actually zig zagging beneath the jungle canopy in places
they flash in and out of dense shadows
the landing skids throw up spurts of muddy water as the huey banks
two more rockets arrow toward them
one explodes in a tree above
the other flashes past
hits the river ahead
they fly through a wall of spray
brewer gives his rebel yell
this is just like fucking star wars man
puzzled star wars
brewer grins realizing
slaps him on the shoulder
youre gonna love it
shouting how much we got left in that minigun
brewer opens the enormous ammunition canister
couple of seconds worth
rambo is plugged into some insane second sight knowing the curves before they curve
he flies with absolute concentration
the pilot is sweating trying to stay on rambos huey
were in laos sir
i know that
to gunner fire all your rockets
take him down
as the forest explodes around them
the chopper is buffeted
the forward canopy is shattered by shrapnel
rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest
his left arm broken above the elbow
one of the prisoners is moaning holding his bloody forehead
rambo pulls up on the collective sending blinding pain through his arm
the huey shoots up out of the jungle spinning as it pops up
it slips sideways through the air seemingly going out of control
then it arcs back roaring right at the camera
podovsk watches rambos turn realizing he has stood to fight
russian subtitled weve got him
the pilot stares apprehensively as the huey comes at them
in the weapons bay the tone of the ranging radar rises to a shriek
the gunner tenses to fire
rambo throws the gunship sideways and climbs in one motion
bringing the minigun to bear
he is a samurai and the huey his sword
facing the soviet leviathan clear eyed in the void way as they say
it will be a battle of one stroke
feeling his breathing
feeling the ship like an extension of himself
the minigun blast forth its stream of fire
a shadow passes over him
as the soviet ship thunders over them and flies on
the barrels of the minigun continue to rotate dry firing
clicking like an air ratchet
showing the riddled glassless cockpit
the slumped bodies
as the mil mi slowly brodies sideways and drops gracefully into the rain forest
it shears through trees breaking up and explodes rambo is tensed like a thousand volts are flowing through him
slowly he relaxes
he knows they have made it
exultant the thrill of victory the agony of defeat
rambo banks the huey ascending toward the mountain pass and beyond thailand
lifer lounges in the gun door of the blackhawk as the ship sits at ready turbine idling
getting ready to go somewhere
lifer turns to see trautman step around the fuselage of the chopper
youre not cleared to be on this base anymore
quietly i know
the battered huey lumbers and dips over the terrain barely in control
rambo seems drained of color sunken into the seat flying on nerve
several of the prisoners are asleep
the wounded mans forehead has been bandaged
brewer is holding court
and theres this guy with a black helmet and cape right and hes got this sword
except its not a sword its light
theres the mekong
they look forward as a broad river appears beyond a ridge line less than a kilometer ahead
the thai border
a cheer goes up
a home run
seeing something as they approach the river
the black sikorsky rises slowly above the trees directly ahead
rambo he blinks trying to clear his vision which has become light and shimmery
the hovering ship looks like the archangel of death
it seems like a vision
he flies straight toward it
kirkhill has cleared the operations center
he is alone
to mike when the unidentified helicopter has crossed the river into thailand shoot it down with air to air rockets
then proceed to the crash site and fire your remaining rockets into the wreckage
is this understood zen hammer
filtered ah sir
im experiencing a little hearing problem
what are you talking about
filtered well uh
ive got something in my ear
what doyle has in his ear is the muzzle of colonel trautmans m
behind them on the deck of the gun bay lifer is out cold
a tarpaulin among a stack of ammo cases where trautman had been hidden is thrown back
doyle knows better than to mess with him
trautman switches off the radio as kirkhill shouts incoherently
as he approaches the black sikorsky rambo sees trautman with a rifle to doyles head
he nods as they pass
rambos huey passes by them crossing into thailand
escort them on in
rambos huey followed by the sikorsky descends toward the landing field
as the techs and other camp personnel stand watching kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field glasses
the image of the huey seems to waver insubstantially through the long lens
it looks like a death ship the flying dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the helm coming in out of the dusk sky
he slowly lowers the glasses
face ashen kirkhill backs into the command center and closes the door
the huey sheers sideways across the staging area
its skids clip the top of the motc shearing off communications gear
it hits the ground
slews around scraping hideously
the sikorsky settles behind it
the two choppers whine down
standing beside the cockpit trautman gets on the sikorskys loudspeaker
all base personnel
prepare medical facilities to receive american pows
a cheer is raised among the ground contingent as they surge forward
sliding painfully out of the flight seat
brewer gawks at the pool of blood collected in the hollow of rambos seat
rambo goes to the gun door
takes de fravios ak
dollying with rambo as he limps toward the motc with relentless determination
the well wishing ground personnel fall back letting him pass
sees him and strides forward to intercept
dollying as he approaches the command center
kirkhills aide in dark glasses moves forward to restrain him
rambo motions him aside with the ak
goes to the door
it is locked
the lock is shattered by a long blast from rambos ak
the door is kicked open
rambo stands silhouetted
he looks like what we never saw in the monkeys paw
he moves into the humming command center among the mission control electronics reeking of the jungle blood and death
as rambo walks to kirkhill looming
kirkhill quails as rambo grasps him by the collar and flings him backward into a chair
he raises the ak
muzzle to kirkhills forehead
pulls the trigger
the weapon clicks empty
hold on kirkhill trembling
rambo steps unsteadily out into the waning light
he takes a deep slow breath
starts to walk
he salutes as he passes trautman but says nothing
in the b
they are carrying the pows in stretchers or pushing them in wheelchairs toward the medical trailer
rambo watches brewer posing with his arms around jensen and another pow for the grunt we saw earlier
his pocket instamatic is clicking away
expansively cover of time magazine baby
rambo walks away
de fravio propped up on one elbow on his stretcher as he is carried past gives him a broad appreciative grin
you did good buddy
rambo stands blinking for a second
he raises his hand in a big thumbs up and allows himself to grin
