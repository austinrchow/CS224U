by tony gilroy based on the novel by robert ludlum the darkness is actually water
a searchlight arcs across heavy ocean swells
half a dozen flashlights weaker beams racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging fishing fishermen struggling with a gaff something in the water the body
the sailors all talking at once three languages going brave chatter to mask the presence of death jesus look at him what
you never saw a dead man before
look look he was shot nudging the body dont dont do that hes dead you think he cares
so have some respect its a stopping as the body moves
convulsing coughing up sea water the sailors freaked jumping back standing there as the man begins to breathe
too small for all the people in here right now sailors sweeping off the table rough hands laying the man down the captain brutal and impatient watching from the door
as giancarlo tears through the clutter searching for a medical kit buried in the shambles
giancarlo is sixty
a bloodshot soul

you do what you can but were not going back
pure steel now you understand me
to the rest of them lets get back to work
giancarlo watching them run out
snagging a quick pull on a pint of rum hes got stashed and transformed into a makeshift operating room
a light swings overhead
the man layed out across the table
sounds groans words snatches of them all in different languages
giancarlo playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron
cutting away the clothes
turning the man on his side
two bullet wounds in the back
probing them judging them
now giancarlo with a flashlight in his teeth tink tink tink bullet fragments falling into a washed out olive jar
now something catching giancarlos eye a scar on the mans hip another fragment exacto knife cutting in tweezers extracting a small plastic tube not a bullet at all and as
it comes free the mans hand slams down onto giancarlos and we smash cut first person pov we are staring up at youre awake

long dead pause

the trawler plows through heavy seas
giancarlo is hunched over a desk tweezers and flashlight busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of the mans hip
the man is bandaged
hes sitting up and it must hurt like hell but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right now
hes staring around the room at his body at the walls haunted what if it doesnt come back
still working that tube i told you

the man cant rest
too busy trying to make sense of all this
i can read
i can read that sign on the door

giancarlo pulls his pint
takes a hit
offering the bottle you drink rum
i dont know
the man stands at the rail staring out to sea
he turns to head inside there a surfcasting rod propped against a locker
the man picks up the rod flips the bail traps the line now hes casting far out into the darkness
and for the first time he smiles
a ratty old espresso machine
the man standing there staring at the thing like its a test
then his hands begin to move trying to pack a grind trying to fit it in turning on the steam and the whole thing explodes
the man alone doing chin ups on the deck rail
hes still bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell but hes pushing himself
using the pain bathing in it maybe even hoping that it will hold some answer for him
a chess board
wooden pieces jumbled in a box
the man hesitates takes a black knight from the box lingers for a moment and then places it on the board
hes off and running
he knows this
placing pieces faster and faster still setting it up as we one of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet
the man standing before a pitted tarnished cataract of a mirror
staring at himself
and then he speaks
in perfect french i dont know who i am
do you know who i am
do have any idea who i am
and then he stops
wipes away the perspiration just beading on his forehead
in perfect dutch tell me who i am
if you know who i am please stop fucking around and tell me
just that face
who am i
and what else is inside there
sailors hauling in the nets
the man still bandaged but healing working beside them
earning his keep
a small colorful fishing village
the trawler motoring in
the man buttoning up borrowed clothes
giancarlo pulling some cash from his pocket offering the money its not much but it should get you to switzerland
i wont forget this
giancarlo gives him a look
shakes his head and the ticket window
the man and a ticket agent
una sola via
una sola via
a helicopter shot a bullet train speeds through snow capped alps
we move in on a window and staring out is
people all around him families businessmen normal people going about their lives
the man turns back to the window but hes not watching the scenery hes looking at his reflection
his face suddenly plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel
and out of the darkness into night and the helicopter shot as the train races toward zurich
a video monitor full frame meet wombosi
hes an african ex dictator think idi amin crossed with mobutu
hes in some sort of throne room
and hes angry
bodyguards and a translator hovering nervously around him
what this is is news footage an interview conducted by a german tv station
he speaks english no no no the time is not right my enemies are too strong
im telling you to wait for this you understand
im telling you this and im making a warning to all those peoples out there that think that my powers have become so weak that they can play with me

stopping freezing on that image and marshall a cia bigwig has the remote control
and the floor

some of you very closely
twelve cia mandarins sitting around the table like kids in detention
we will tour the faces as marshall continues but the guy were interested in is named ward abbott
picture a sawier slicker john poindexter
he was an irritation before he took power
he was a problem when he was in power
and hes been a disaster for us in exile
the tape wombosi likes to send us messages through the european media
this is an interview we pulled down from a local german television station in dresden
weve been getting these little broadsides every couple of months
he knows this he knows that hes writing a book about the agencys history in africa hes going to name names
its basically a shakedown
abbotts face says this is news to him
his hands suggest otherwise
this interview and ill make the tape available for anyone who wants it he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt
he says its us
he says hes got proof
beat the overwhelming negative ramifications of this should be obvious
hard and dry the director wants to know if there is any possible shred of truth in this accusation
no hands go up
the man wandering through the terminal
passing a pizza place closing up for the night
the man checks his funds
just enough for one cold slice
the man walking aimlessly
the man trying to get comfortable on a bench
its chilly but this will have to do until morning
just settling in when authority german cant you read the signs
the man turns
two zurich cops coming toward him
on your feet
the man makes his feet
theyre on top of him now
the park is closed
theres no sleeping in the park
lets see some identification
the man not sure what to do
ive lost them

pulling his nightstick come on hands up up the man raising his hand slowly zurich cop reaching up to pat him down look im just trying to sleep okay
german again i just need to sleep zurich cop has heard enough giving a sharp poke with the nightstick into the mans back and thats the last thing hell remember
because the man is in motion
a single turn spinning catching cop completely off guard the heel of his hand driving up into the guys throat and cop behind him trying to reach for his pistol
but the man still turning all his weight moving in a single fluid attack a sweeping kick and cop hes falling catching the bench trying to fight back but the man like a machine just unbelievably fast three jackhammer punches down down down and cop head slammed into the bench blood spraying from his nose hes out cold and cop writhing on the ground gasping for air struggling with his holster the man his foot down like a vise onto cop s arm shattering the bone cop starting to scream and then silenced because the man hes got the pistol so fucking fast hes got it right up against cop s forehead right on the edge of pulling the trigger he is hes gonna shoot him gasping pleading no please god no please dont please no my go stopping as the man slams the gun against his temple and this fight is over
the man standing there
in the silence
two unconscious cops at his feet
blood on his pants
what just happened
how did he do this
and theres the gun in his hand
and god it just feels so natural checking it stripping it down holding it aiming it like this is something hes done a million times before
this is something he definitely knows how to do
and then he stops cold
throwing down the gun
running off into the darkness a deep inner office
an ops office
unlabeled and anonymous
a backwater project center hidden deep within the langley facility
several rooms linked like a suite
one or two for communications
a couple for research
people are at their posts
and its all quiet
but they are busy
this is a place under siege
zorn is the number two here
brilliant bloodless lapdog
hes coming through the suite
coming through quickly
heading toward the bosss little office at the back ted conklin
ivy league ollie north
everything tucked away
but theres tension in the air
work on the desk
cot in the corner
looking up what
abbott wants to talk
tell him were busy
abbott with coffee
conklin not lingering
storm clouds are gathering ted
it looks like rain and i dont have a thing to wear
i dont know what were talking about
were talking about marseille
were talking about nykwana wombosi
and im asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone
silence was this treadstone
youre asking me a direct question
i thought you were never going to do that
theyre putting together an agency oversight committee
theyre going to look through everyones budgets
treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger
beat what am i going to do about that
youd want to make that go away
youd want to remind them that treadstone is a training organization
that its all theoretical
youd want to sign off on that
and what if i couldnt do that
then id have to explain treadstone
and youd have to explain how you let me get this far
silence doesnt sound like much of a plan b does it
abbott staring well clean up the field
you clean up your budgets
morning in the financial district

some mildewed books piled along one wall
some shitty plastic chairs
castel working fast
closing the door
moving to the pile of books
taking the top book off
inside the box a timer
a small bomb
a booby trap
an led light stops flashing as castels hands code in his password and castel moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner
pulling away the top pile and a metal lock box
castle pulling it out
an empty tray on top and castel taking off his watch
taking off his rings
taking out his wallet
his spanish passport
emptying his pockets

shes downshifting shes accelerating pulling out to pass the truck on a blind turn as we apfel emerges from the bank
turns the corner into a quiet side street and up ahead here comes another guy in a suit
its manheim walking toward us deep into a cell phone conversation
barely noticing apfel as they get closer and as they pass manheim its completely out of the blue hes jabbing the cellphone down into apfels shoulder and apfel no clue
already clutching at the coronary exploding in his chest dead before his body hits the street and manheim still walking hes never broken stride and as he goes hes fiddling with the cellphone and insert the cellphone manheims hands working to retract a syringe into the device and manheim striding away
disappearing into zurich

these guys are french corsican mercs
not quite the a team
the guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named deauvage
too into it
two morgue attendants hanging back
the morgue boss whos clearly suffering this for a bribe moves to one of the freezer lockers
french okay monsieur kane
and he pulls open freezer
and thank god we cant see it because whatevers inside there is clearly horrible
the morgue boss barely takes a glance standing back as quickly as possible
deauvage lead bodyguard moves to clear a zone for his boss get the fuck out of my way pushing deauvage aside wombosi moves to the freezer box
as if it were nothing
hes seen hes made much much worse
and now he reaches down into the box hands on literally feeling around this dead awful corpse with his bare hands feeling around for something feeling and feeling and not
finding turning to deauvage its not him
deauvage looking pale as wombosi slams shut the freezer
quiet hard fury so whos crazy now
a mini motorcade driving towards neuilly
two security cars
a van full of kids and mothers
and one big mercedes stretch
wombosi alone in the back
its a weird spot
open all night
but euro style
a few alpen truckers chowing down
a local or two at the bar and bourne and marie at a back table
hes got the red bag open
all the passports the personal junk the money all the shit from the zurich bank box hes been showing it to her and hes got her attention now
and you have no idea not a clue what came before that
when you think of it before the ship before you wake up on the ship what do you see
its just not there
well this is great
she sits back im sick of myself and you have no idea who you are
i kept trying things i thought if i could find all the things i could do i could you could put it together which was okay for a while i
was okay with it
hesitating now but then theres all these other things all these other things i know how to do and this this stuff from the bank and
suddenly flat out i think something bad happened
what are you talking about
i dont know
sounds like you were in an accident or something
i was shot twice in the back
okay so youre a victim
there was a gun
who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports
lots of people have guns
americans love guns
i fought my way out of an embassy
i climbed down a fifty foot wall i went out the window and i was doing it i just did it
i knew how to do it
people do amazing things when theyre scared
why do i
i come in here instinctively first thing i do im looking for the exit im catching the sightlines i know i cant sit with my back to the door youre
you were shot
shes not listening
he leans in
flat out now
i can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front
i can tell you that the waitress is left handed and the guy at the counter weighs two hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself
i know that the best first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside
i know that at this altitude i can run flat out for half a mile before i lose my edge
i knew that you were my first best option out of zurich
how do i know all that
how can i know all that and not know who i am
how is that possible
long dead pause
god youre not kidding are you
bournes face a video image frozen on a computer screen its bourne looking at the camera bourne looking up at the camera in the consulate passport office and half a
dozen computer monitors and lots of shots of bourne twenty angles twenty different locations twenty candid perspectives of bourne and his mad scramble through the consulate conklin and research tech poring over these surveillance tapes downloaded from zurich and thats the best angle of the courtyard
thats the only angle
what do they have on the streets
they must have something
typing away conklin rubbing at the tension in his temples as zorn enters what
he knows about the embassy
hes coming down for a show and tell
thatll solve all our problems
hes hit paydirt sir
turning back whats that
its an angle of the street some sort of alleyway you can just
insert the monitor as the image enlarges to fill the screen
and theres bourne
and the little red car
who the hell is that
a drone barn
practically on the runway
one of those rooms
just a plain functional box
manheim laying on the bed
suit and tie
just laying there staring at the ceiling
who knows how long hes been like this
on the nightstand a gun
his e phone pager
his fresh credentials
and a photo of jason bourne
quick orientation picture a heavily walled palace just off the bois du boulogne
but once inside you could be back in brazzaville
its just a buffet of oddness
home to fifty children and nine wives
the decor blends money and nouveau riche materialism with a hard back home tribal esthetic
its a visual treat
not condescending or stupid but flat out strange and menacing
and the palace is dark and sleepy now but carry all that through this next series of quick shots just inside the door
bodyguard slouched before a bank of littered with toys
childrens crap everywhere
snoozing on a louis quatorze chair draped with african cloth
deauvage head bodyguard posted outside this imposing set of doors
hes trying to stay awake
reading a spy thriller
and there he is the emperor himself wombosi on his throne
except the room is dark and empty
and hes sitting there by himself
a king without a country
with a gun in his lap
drinking hard from a bottle of jack daniels
the red car parked along the road
bourne alone in the passenger seat
and then he wakes suddenly
freaked for a moment
instantly feeling for the red bag
there it is in his lap
he looks around and marie sitting away from the car
shes got a loaf of bread
smoking a butt
same clothes but her make ups been washed away
bourne steps out
i needed a break
where are we
were about an hour away
i cant believe i slept
you were tired
bread and soda for twenty thousand i like to throw in breakfast
he takes it so what do you dream about
i dream im asleep
i dream that im asleep and i cant wake up
he takes a hit from her smoke and coughs i dont think i smoke
shes watching him
you ever think maybe you have a family
i thought about it
i dont know
she looks away
was she hoping for another answer
i guess its like christmas every day for you huh
maries face a passport photo shes eighteen shes smiling really alive and fresh and conklin behind his desk
abbott staring grimly at the picture who is she
marie helene kreutz
shes twenty six
born outside munich
father was a welder
he died in
we dont have the mother
there might be a step sister were trying to track that down
apologetic its tough
shes a wanderer
she pops up on the grid here and there but
i mean the last time she paid an electric bill in europe was
no steady employer
shes got three arrests
two shoplifting cases one in spain one in germany
and she actually did three months in an italian detention center for credit card fraud
no political affiliations
shes a gypsy
if its a cover its a great one
im assuming were exploring that possibility
were exploring every possibility
tighter by the moment we are in pursuit
how much more do you want me to tell you
pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is
pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is
yes well i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem
im bringing in some people from upstairs
inside hes screaming
weve been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall
weve been sleeping down here
we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago and now
now that we finally have something to work with you want to bring planning personnel down here
real steam id rethink that
i want a second opinion
this is an operations desk
im not asking
the little red car cruising through town
bourne checking building numbers as they pass slow down
no dont stop
looking over thats it
is that it
an apartment building
elegant but cold
thats the address
staring back as they pass no
marie pulling up turning a corner watching him as she does
but hes pre occupied eyes scanning taking it all in where
pull in here
marie angles into an alleyway
cuts the engine
so this is it right
hes still scanning the street
i should go
i dont remember any of this
he turns back
shes staring at him
the money right
before she can say anything hes digging in the backpack
he pulls out another stack of hundreds
hands it over
she takes it
its not what she wanted but shes used to being disappointed
thanks for the ride
look i dont know whats up there
you got me pretty fucking curious
look you could come up
or you could wait if you want
i could go check it out
you could wait
hide the pain with you i mean youd probably just forget about me right
how could i forget about you
he smiles youre the only person i know
weve never seen it before
worth waiting for
bourne and marie standing at the directory
one per floor
there it is
bourne presses the buzzer
after a moment he presses again
i guess youre not home
bourne checking the door
how to pop it open
just about to get into it when from the shadows inside monsieur bourne
the concierge is sixty
plump and proper
opening the door mr
bourne there you are i was wondering i havent seen you here i am
the concierge looking at bourne like maybe shes never seen him look like this before
and shes looking at marie like heres the reason her tenant looks like such shit
he tries a smile i seem to have lost my key
the concierge nods
instant chilly disapproval
ive been ringing your bell
its good you were away
we had some trouble with the hot water
its been repaired
we could use a shower
they look like shit it was a long drive
the concierge steps aside and bourne and marie at the apartment threshold
he has a key now
and the door opens
no wife and kids
a huge rambling flat
large entry hallway
large rooms beyond that
its obviously expensive
no human history
bourne and marie exploring
struggling to get a feel for the place
this is like a real apartment
she likes it this is really yours
i guess so
marie taking it in fast
bourne seems paralyzed
trying to soak it all in
willing himself home
touching things as he passes
as if a texture a smell something will become familiar
hes deep into this as we go to marie in the doorway
checking it out
its so clean and simple
but its not the decor shes most interested in
marie opening an armoire
nothing but mens clothes
shes feeling better by the moment as we go to like a stage set
lots of props and no sign of food
bourne picking up a frying pan
this is my frying pan
and then this is my spoon
trying harder im jason bourne and this is my kitchen
marie still on the prowl
theres a desk
bourne with a folder in his hand
staring at the bookshelves
binders reference materials and hardbound volumes all of it about maritime law
all about boats
this is your office
from the doorway god you live like a monk
all this stuff its all about boats
looking up i think im in the shipping business
its starting to come back yeah
he sort of nods you mind if i take a bath
marie backs out
bourne alone again
standing there for a moment
dealing with it
and then he sits down in a chair
bourne sitting there
the room the desk its all so devoid of personality
and then something catches his eye and insert the desk top a faint silhouette through the dust and grime
outlines of where a computer used to sit
bourne reaching suddenly under the desk
pulling out a retractable computer keyboard tray
but its empty
now hes really confused and insert a phone answering machine bourne pressing the playback button and you have no messages
bourne leaving that for a moment about to anyway and then he turns back new idea pressing for the speaker phone and then hitting redial and the phone stars dialing
bonjour hotel marboeuf
bourne quick grabbing the receiver
taking it off speakerphone and yes oui uh
hotel marboeuf paris
how can i direct your call
switching to english thinking thats his problem how can i help you
im looking for mr

a long pause and then im afraid i have no one by that name registered sir
about to hang up un moment un moment sir
hang on i need you to check another name for me hang on un moment sil vous plait bourne grabbing the backpack tearing through it where is it
where is it
shit and money falling out and there it is from the safe deposit box that piece of card stock the one with no passport attached to it reading it kane

john michael kane
one moment sir
and then theres muzak holding music and water running in the tub
marie pulling off her boots
checking the temperature
bourne still on hold
and then a new voice suddenly bonjour
yes im here
you call about monsieur kane
john michael kane
is he there
you are a friend of his
i have some very bad news for you sir
im terrible sorry to have to tell you this but monsieur kane has passed away almost two weeks ago
bourne is rocked
but the manager its natural he interprets the silence as grief
there was an accident
on the motorway
apparently he was killed instantly
really im terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this
we actually we were unaware for several days that this had happened
when they came for his things it was made known for us you see
you know his brother
its very bad this
such a young man
do you his brother do you have a phone number
i think not
quick french to someone in the office there no im sorry
it was very sudden
he was here very briefly
bourne just hands up the phone
just like that
not even goodbye
standing there frozen
john michael kane is dead
and he had the passport
suddenly everythings changed
they shouldnt be here
this is bad
marie playing with her hair in the mirror
checking the water calling out to him she wasnt kidding about the water
bourne frozen there
he forces a smile
ill check the kitchen
moving out of the office maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs
bourne moving to the sink
but its an act
his eyes are everywhere
turning on the water
but ignoring it
what hes really doing is searching out a weapon
pulling a knife very quietly from behind the stove
feels pretty comfortable
hiding it down by his side
on the move again now yeah its cold in here too
calling to her as he goes lets give it another minute
bourne like weve ever seen him
like an animal
every sound every breeze everything carries information
taking it all in
real quick layout theres big windows along one wall that face out to the street below
the hallway to the bedroom and bath feeds into the living room from one side
there is a large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall
shes behind him whatre you
no no marie backing away completely freaked bourne standing there with the knife in his hand and no marie no
its not like that please jason omigod quiet quiet marie frightened confused paralyzed for a moment bourne glancing back a curtain fluttering behind him motioning for marie to get down
do it now down
marie hesitating and bourne whats he doing
hes unscrewing a lightbulb from a lamp beside him and marie about to say something he shakes her off bourne knife in one hand lightbulb in the other putting his
foot on a chair in front of him and what are you doing
bourne waving her to shut up crawl now back up get under the window go
marie he seems so sure its weird but shes doing it shes under that frosted window down below the sill looking back what the fuck is he doing now
bourne the lightbulb hes tossing it across the room over her head into that frosted window and as she ducks down as it shatters phft
silenced automatic weapons fire raking into the apartment and the frosted window peppered with holes and marie on the floor as the window shatters above her and castel hes in
hanging from an abseil rope but off guard firing blind strafing the apartment and bourne kicking that chair across the room and castel reacting instinct moving target the chair just
strafed to shit and bourne rolling away and castel hes coming in last pieces of window frame crashing away as he swings into the apartment and marie right below him shit raining down as he flies in and bourne throwing the knife and castel turning too late the knife catching him in the neck and bourne in motion attacking and castel knife impaled in his neck clawing for it with one hand trying to get off a shot and apartment wall phft
gunfire tearing wildly around the room and bourne full stop kicking the gun kicking it up rounds tearing across the ceiling and marie screaming now trying to crawl away and
castel no chance off balance bourne his open palm driving up into castels jaw the body wants to fall backward but bourne has the guys arm in his free hand jerking it like rope tearing it from its socket and the gun clattering free across the floor and bourne his knee like a piston hard into castels gut and then down his foot down into castels knee shattering it and castel is on the floor stunned wiped knife pouring blood from his neck arm hanging like a rag doll bone torn through his pant leg above the knee and omigod omigod whatre you doing

incoherent fear and confusion german and english and what is he

bourne ignoring her grabbing the guys backpack whatre you doing

and she keeps banging and marie is past the point of rationality and castel is bleeding and shaking and bourne is trying to think and its just impossible and suddenly
castel is moving
and fast its superhuman unbelievable just enough spring in his good leg and bourne bracing himself but castel isnt attacking
hes running away hes crossing the living room but theres nowhere to go absolutely nowhere except castel hurling himself into the glass and window shattering
castel in a cloud of broken glass sixty feet above the street falling and falling and
landing on the roof of a parked car and the apartment bourne in motion five things at once checking the window kicking the gun away grabbing the red bag grabbing
what he can no time to spare and still outside the door im calling the police mr

rock solid i can protect you
a crowd is gathered around castels body
rubberneckers and people pointing up to the broken window the concierge running out to the street and getting the news and the sound of sirens bleeding in from the distance
and the little red car pulling out of the alley
turning away from the scene
disappearing into the streets of paris throne room doors flying open wombosi exploding out into the hallway no
i say no
they go this far out a body in the grave another body
this isnt over these people are not finished nothing will make them finish until they have wombosi
the real wombosi until im the one in the box
six kids two wives three bodyguards all startled by this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia what are you doing
bearing down on bodyguard sleeping
to deauvage hes sleeping
this man is sleeping at his post
kicking the chair out from under him ive had men killed for this
but hes still moving you think these people
these people who come for me you think they sleep
they never sleep
they spend all the day all the night all time thinking about how to put wombosi in that box
hes just gonna keep going and were into deauvage on his feet racing to follow kids scattering out of the way the wives completely unfazed and there is no box
they dont have a box that can hold me
i know these people i know they never sleep
i know they never stop
they never stop until the knife is at their throat
suddenly distracted what is the window
this window is open
who leaves this open
before deauvage can possibly respond this is a war you fool
you think these people are like you
you think this is stupid people
these people see an open window they reach in with a big hand and grab your heart until you die
still rolling as and it wont just be me
they dont just want wombosi now
they want my babies they want my children
and i say no
grabbing deauvage you leave that window open again you better pray they kill me somethings caught his ear in the distance and now hes trying to get there everything changes
everyone is a soldier here now
this is a fortress now
are we clear with this
wombosi stops to look at deauvage
in the background we can hear a child crying by the pool this man is out there
kane is out there
and they pretend hes dead
that means hes coming back
wombosi moving quickly now and were still tracking taking him into forty kids going nuts in the water
one kid crying
wombosi like a shot picking the kid up drying his tears making a funny face getting a smile as bourne and marie stash the red bag in a locker
an electronics console
meters leds wave form analyzers audio spectrum filters all of this gear dancing and responding to every nuance of bournes voice over speakers were listening to a recording of the
call he made from the apartment to the hotel marbeouf paris okay
pause un moment un moment sir
hang on i need you to check another name for me hang on un moment sil vous plait a secret studio buried deep in the langley facility
equipment up the ass
five people in this darkened room an engineer working the board
conklin looking sour
zorn in the shadows
abbott sitting there waiting for analysis from mrs
shes late sixties
a long time spy shrink
a diamond hard seen it all intelligence
john michael kane
one moment sir
doyle nods to the engineer
shes heard enough
hes not lying
hes very highly stressed but hes not lying
hes aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos
this conversation the video from the consulate the body language vocal pattern its my sense hes really lost here
beat i think he snapped
is that a medical term
battle lines drawn
you want clinical terminology
its called conversation hysteria
to abbott now i dont know exactly how you train these people
im not sure i want to know
ill take a guess theres some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here
the idea dangling for a moment
lets assume thats true
you can only wind people so tight
even machines break down
this unit has an unblemished record of success
then i guess im in the wrong meeting
bourne and marie stashing the red car
abbott and conklin walk and talk
they want to get loud but they cant
too many people passing by that was two hours two hours to get a second opinion and nothing changes
hes out of control
its very clear what needs to happen
point blank i have work to do
what if he is working for someone else
what if he turned
where does he turn
what does he have to offer
hes got nothing
hes a killer
hes a piece of equipment for crissake
wheres he gonna turn
out of the way
cash and carry
no questions asked kind of flop
our establishing shot somehow includes the proprietor and his dog
hair dye washing down a rusted drain
its marie alone in this crappy little bathroom
jeans and bra
all of it soaking wet
a new hair color
there she is
her turn to stare at herself and wonder
and then she smells something
its a shitty little room
bourne sitting on the bed
and the smoke is coming from
his passport the jason bourne passport on fire
bourne holding it as it burns away
bournes face melting bubbling finally disappearing bourne letting go just before it burns his fingers and bourne sits back
and theres marie standing there
and shes holding out her passport he looks at her
he wont do it you know who you are
you know what thats worth
pause i cant live like this
i cant do anything until i know who i am
believe me you dont want what i have
he looks away
and then she touches him
bourne almost recoils
he doesnt know what to do
doesnt know how to react
marie in front of him now shes taking his hand and he hesitates looking at her is this happening
shes taking his hand moving it down her body staring at him both of them silent his hand her skin his mind racing he wants this wants it in every
way but its overwhelming when was the last time something like this happened
he cant remember he doesnt care hes pulling her toward him and theyre kissing and you know the rest
the professor arriving in paris
coming through the terminal as his pager goes off never even stopping as he reads and hotel marboeuf paris
this is the place that answered the phone when bourne hit redial in his apartment
this is the place that john michael kane was staying when he died
and so begins the investigation
now since the presence of danger ie wombosis guys and or treadstone is still up in the air and since this scene could either play very quickly or very long
and since were not exactly sure where we stand with page count this scene is not finished
the rules of the scene however seem to be thus bourne would have to be very nervous about being recognized
if he was kane and kane stayed here hes not the guy to do whatever social engineering needs doing
bourne sets the table and marie gets the goods
somehow theres a threat from treadstone or wombosi
its all results we see them execute a plan rather than work it up
marie is already in the hotel
in a hotel uniform
posing as a guest
in any case she looks very much different than weve ever seen her before
she gets close to the office
bourne calls the desk from a pay phone
asks for something
we see that some sort of improvised booby trap has been set inside the hotel to start a fire
in the confusion marie very bravely gets into the office
we do a quick cut outside to bourne waiting and walk and talk
bourne and marie leaving the hotel fast
hes on alert always on alert now making sure theyre not being watched
and shes excited and pumped she did it
shes got the hotel record in hand you stayed there five times in the past six months
but i didnt have time i could only get the bill from the last stay you were there for two days
some room service theres half a dozen phone calls here so thats someth cutting her off who paid the bill
its a company
dead phone lines hanging
carpet pulled up
completely stripped out
bourne and marie standing there staring
this cant be it
she turns around and whats he doing
bourne with a piece of paper and pencil or something anything resourceful and handy maybe its carpet lint maybe its breaking the glass on the door and holding it up
to the light or a rubbing anyway hes doing something ingenious with the glass door and as hes doing this were hearing british female destin navigational can i help you
hey how are you
im trying to reach richard
is he there
were watching the mpg logo emerge and seeing bourne and marie react as we hear im afraid theres no richard here
continuing into bourne on the pay phone
marie behind him at the bar
hes got a pad and paper
this is all business
well where are you
where am i calling
this is an answering service sir
the companys located in southampton but this is a tire dealership right

bourne making a note

paris office hours are from nine a

bourne hangs up
scribbles down the number
backing away and conklin and the research techs jamming on the console lets check that interpol window again im on it i want that red car the girl we gotta
get lucky here sir
conklin turns ive got a code here from nsa theyre not gonna give us keyhole satellite clearance unless we have sign off from upstairs
conklin turns and no
sitting there tensely we cant risk it
our last sighting was forty eight hours ago
even if they stayed in the car the grid is huge
please this is it
hes trained conditioned theyre built to disappear
you give him another day to run and we may never find him
this doesnt go upstairs
conklin left hanging
abbott clear on this one
bourne dressed for success
cleaned up good
catching his reflection in the elevators mirrored ceiling
nerves on edge
alliance security maritime division
glossy posters of yachts tankers and luxury sailboats
bourne standing there
sucking it up
god knows what hes walking into here and a secretary leading bourne through a suite of offices and into meet rawlins
hes a young jolly brit pink and overfed and quite shocked to see
hastily tidying up come right in
have a seat
bourne just trying to feel his way through this
really thrown i must admit when my assistant told me you were here i was really i was quite i was surprised
we thought you were gone for good
well i mean its a tough business isnt it
a long awkward beat
neither of them sure where to go
finally look our bid it was competitive but definitely at the high end of competitive when we didnt hear back from you we did some re analysis of the numbers
and honestly wed really like a chance to do a bit better
pitching now im assuming youre still in the market
its the same vessel
we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you
gorgeous boat hundred and seventy five foot pleasure cruiser
i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job as i said a bit more competitive
rawlins holding back until now
was it the break in
we also thought we hadnt heard from you weve had a bit of a publicity nightmare people have been talking
the meat our offices were broken into vandalism mostly shortly after we last spoke
i hadnt heard
let me get you a new copy of the proposal
thatd be great
and theres marie in the back working a payphone waving for him to sit shes onto something
pulls out the alliance security brochures and literature
flipping through it
hes getting closer
pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a list of references for huge yachts jobs theyve done in the past
i found it
standing there it took six calls
shes creeped out i found kane
i found the body
lets go already standing we got to get away from this phone
the two morgue attendants watching bourne put down a hundred dollar bill
marie standing a little off she will not be comfortable in the morgue
picking up the cash what was the name again
john michael kane
i want to see the body
our boss could come back
were not supposed to
bourne pulling out another hundred and its showtime
marie back by the door
bourne right on it
attendant pulling open the freezer and
attendant looking baffled
insert freezer its empty
from behind them what the hells going on here

the two attendants rushing to help their boss bourne grabbing marie and pulling her out the door moments after the morgue
bourne striding away
marie struggling to keep up
and bourne is different now zoning in hes close hes hardening what are you doing

marie just stops
bourne walking away
into paris night and abbott alone here
on the phone
looking up to see they found him
they found bourne
abbott jumps off the call
eyes never leaving zorn
you better come in
the professor a motorcycle screaming through traffic and video monitor theres bourne staring up and jesus fuck what is this
video monitor different angle more clandestine but same deal theres bourne just standing there and omigod
on the street
bathed in a streetlight
staring up at a security camera
total hero moment
i know youre watching
confusion to say the least wombosi pistol in hand moving as fast as he can through the clutter kids scattering as he follows deauvage racing for the security conklin zorn
abbott the techs everyone plugged into the tension here how long
minutes hes close the professor on the speeding cycle closing in fast and bourne standing there as the front gate opens
the big deep breath
hes walking in uglier by the second desperation madness he went inside
to abbott if we can get a clean shot inside the house
thats what theyre trained for just a surgical strike
what do you want to do
we dont know what were into
were in the shitter man
pick your poison
maybe hes in there to finish the job
maybe hes working for wombosi
maybe they want to go on tv together
every possibility sucks weve got to move
deauvage and bodyguard giving bourne a serious pat down
is he here
deauvage doesnt answer spinning bourne around theyre really going over him conklin on his feet abbott beet red this is getting loud you dont have the stones for this
you people come down here and wink and whisper and we send these guys out and get it done
and youre clear
and the guys upstairs get what they want
and the whole bunch of you are so stuffed on deniability its coming out of your ears
gauntlet well you know what
youre here now
what do you want to do
abbott just shaking his head no
and conklin snaps suddenly hes over the console theres the button and hes pressing it and the professor in position roof of the house next door hum hum hum its
the e phone pager hes just been activated and bourne being marched toward the throne room doors deauvage and bodyguard flanking him kids and wives staring as he passes the way youd look at a prisoner on the way to the gallows the big doors thrown open wide and wombosi on the throne
an imperial gesture please
bourne steps up to the plate
did you bring investment advice for me tonight
it was tax shelters wasnt it
swiss debenture swaps
i think investment advice from a dead man its a bad idea
beat how does it feel to be dead
its a lot more stressful than i thought
kids have started sneaking into the room deauvage is trying to scoot them out but no no let them in
let them in
to the kids come in on y va come in
to bourne i think everyone wants to see the dead man
bourne watching the kids they are all staring what do you do
on his feet now you get an appointment with me
you make sure its on the boat
you come visit me you pitch me this bullshit investment package
you drink my water eat my bread play with my children and what
two nights later you come back and you put this death slamming something down onto the throne you put this in my engine room
there is a bomb on the throne now
so this is a different kind of meeting
steam building maybe now we talk some truth okay
one dead man to another
bourne caught off guard as wombosi suddenly rips away his jacket so hard that he tears straight through to the shirt bournes back bare two bullet scars still raw you
calling to deauvage i told you my shot was better
he went in the water how did he live
no no no
and he means this this is a strong killer
this is a crazy strong killer
circling to make a killer that looks like you
he means this its bloody fucking amazing
bourne imploding this news the kids staring at him the bomb its all getting loud around him who do you think sent me
i know who sent you
i dont know why
this could get physical at any moment now i learned many many things from the cia
i learned the way they think
beat was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not
bourne distracted by the kids these faces its
you didnt set the bomb
bourne not sure about any of it was this a game or a fuck up
i dont know
get the kids out
he doesnt have to say it twice they know the drill theyre gone
and the door
deauvage closing the doors and as he does its a shootout
the professor is infinitely more talented at this than the bodyguards
bourne needs to get out of there without looking wimpy no children are harmed
as the professor rallies he will shoot wombosi he will find bournes jacket left on the floor in which later he will find a clue leading him to belleville and
last but hardly least he will take a parting shot at the bomb still sitting there on the throne
there will be a huge trailer worthy explosion
this might not want to be very long
there is an extensive action sequence just around the corner
so bourne escapes
physically hes just weary
emotionally hes fucked
all of that happens and we cut to conklin flipping out the professor is not responding code him again punch it in hes not responding the paging unit must be
damaged we just ran a remote diagnostic sir its not the unit abbott looks like he might puke
zorn watching his career burn to the ground around him
what are you doing
conklin grabbing shit like a madman im going to paris
no youre not
youre not going anywhere
im shutting this down
youre not doing shit
youre so scared you cant even think
you just blew up a house in paris
this program is over
call it off
i cant call it off
hes not responding
get out of my way
conklin splits and its really late
bourne enters the room
marie in the corner
not a word
his shirt is torn to shit
he scraped up blood here and there
he moves past her into his hands shaking as he tries to wash them
he bags it
bourne comes out
and theres a long silence until it doesnt matter who you were before
its who you want to be
thats all that matters
is he listening
we have this money
we have what we have
i had nothing before and now i dont know maybe i have more maybe its nothing but
he looks over i say we leave here
we leave this place
we go until we cant go anymore
you could do that
thats who i want to be
turns off the light
takes her hand
and they lay in bed
just laying there
the professor cooping somewhere
tending to his wounds
ignoring his pager
hes slipped off the grid
bourne and marie packing up to hit the road
marie dropping off the key
hope hangs in the air xxxxxx
xxxxxx bourne enters
hes got the black duffel
xxxxxx and now theyre headed for the door
something doesnt feel right for bourne and then he notices stop where you are
bourne turns back to the clerk
wheres the dog
my husbands out looking for him
he run away often
that old beast
miss his breakfast
not a chance
returning to cleaning its always something right
suddenly just like that everythings different get in the basement
to marie get everyone down in the basement
now marie doesnt need a second warning what the hellre you talking about
youre in danger
all of you
i have no time to explain
wait a minute im sorry
those words the way he said it shes grabbing her purse clearing out of the room
slamming the door behind her click its locked
no answer too busy reaching under the check in desk coming up with a shot gun an old one but nonetheless a gun who is it
whos out there
and now bourne is moving pulling open a drawer
a box of shells
filling his pockets
xxxxxx xxxxxx i wont let that happen
and he is moving down the small hallway
away from the front door towards the back door under the stairs
the hotel back door kicked open bourne coming out of the house coming hard and the small courtyard is empty but now the alarm is going off and bourne turns
back to marie races to grab her as ratatatat the front door windows are shredded and here comes the professor
xxxxxx xxxxxx and now they are running across this little courtyard
to a wall bourne is up on it reaching down for marie grabbing her swinging her over the wall as abm
the professor shoots
marie takes off running
bourne leans over the wall fires back twice ratatat the wall is shredded
bourne takes off running reloading on the fly
rounds a bend is chambering two rounds when he sees a woman is in her kitchen staring at him no time to explain he turns back the professor is just
vaulting over the wall
bourne fires twice bam
but the spray is too wide from this distance
windows are shattered to both sides of him but the professor stumbles but keeps going blood on his face now ratatat bourne has to move
reloading his almost useless gun
reaching marie facing a choice and they climb a wall flower pots explode around them but they make it now running in a labyrinth right then left through a small
leaping a wall landing on a steep roof sliding falling crashing to the ground in a small courtyard steep walls on all sides
but theres a large window and its open
and they step through and find themselves they close the window behind them catch their breath did we lose them
bourne shakes his head
tucks the gun under his coat
who is it
we have to keep moving
and now he is opening the door they step into startled kitchen workers stare as bourne and marie calmly walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door
of the empty restaurant
and then they open the door to the street and the first thing we notice is noise
the street is burgeoning with life
the second thing we notice are sirens
police cars approaching
bourne and marie head down the street blending in
up ahead two police cars snaking through traffic
bourne steers them off this crowded street
xxxxxx xxxxxx and bourne and marie are hurrying down this street when bam the professor comes out of a building across and down the street
no time to hide hes seen them hes bourne tackles marie to the ground behind a car
ratatat the professor is literally shredding it
and now bourne is moving what are you doing
and bourne is on the offensive
moving towards the professor who is ducking behind cars on the other side
they are shredding the street firing ruthlessly at each other and now the police are here blocking both ends of the street
guns are drawn bournes vulnerable on two flanks
the cops are yelling
and now the professor blasts the cops and now things have changed
three way firefight and bourne grabs marie and they dive into and the professor shreds the store as bourne attemps to fire back
shit flying everywhere in here hard to see and the professor is advancing on them cops are no match for his fire power
they move to the back kick open a door bourne and marie cross this small courtyard the professor is right on their heels
crash through a door and now they are in couple of asian women sewing in here
one man in charge and bourne and marie charging through the man about to say something but now the professor is on their tail and making god knows what in
here vats of something
small grouping of workers bourne shutting the door behind him its shredded with bullet holes
bourne and marie racing to the next door as bam the professor kicks the door open bourne about to fire but there is a woman right behind the professor
cant do it turns to run as ratatatat the professor fires as bourne and marie dive into and now chicken feathers are flying everywhere the glass at the front of
the door is shattering
bourne and marie make it through the gauntlet
and bourne and marie are running
and he is reaching into his pocket fishing around and just as he pulls out the car keys we recognize this as the street they parked their car on and
bourne unlocks the door pops maries open
and theres a cop yelling at them and bourne hits the gas they fly out of their parking space bam
the cop fires shattering their windshield and there up ahead the professor coming out about to fire bourne aims for him forces him to dive out of the way and
one quick move around a truck and they are free
bourne and marie looking back nervously so far all over the professor looking around
people staring at him covered in blood the cop racing up yelling not yelling for long because the professor is firing at him and now the professor is moving not
running just a swift walk and now hes past the truck and a motorcyclist comes flying down the street oblivious going way too fast for these streets and the professor swings his gun stock like a bat takes him out clean and smooth bike crashing to the ground and the professor grabs the bike and takes off shooting at two police cars just racing to the scene and we are into high speed car chase
and bourne better do some fancy driving because here comes the professor and hes a lot faster much better armed
marie looking back seeing the professor gain on them xxxxxx xxxxxx and the professor fires shreds the back off their car give me the gun and now shes got his
shotgun leaning out the window
wait till hes close
bourne swerves up on the sidewalk back onto the street slaloms through the traffic racing towards an intersection and cars coming the other way bourne just makes it through the
professor tries to squeeze through skidding and crack
the professor hits the front of a car sideways on his bike he is thrown clear through the intersection right into the windshield of an oncoming car and he gets
up grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike and now we see cops are mobilizing swarming into this area and bourne and marie pick up a few cops on their tail shed all of them the last car goes into an explosive flip the professor is now right behind them
and now we are into bourne marie and the professor leave a trail of totaled cars that the cops have to try and navigate through finally saying fuck it and
hitting a few cars themselves and now we are into maries car and the motorcycle can pass where the police cars cannot
bourne may be able to shed the cops but not the professor
and now one quick move and they are racing against traffic up the seine
past the louvre
cops pursuing on the other side of the river
bourne and the professor leaving behind a trail of carnage
and now the professor is pulling up along side them one lane over
both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and marie fires twice takes out a few windshields
the professor fires at the same time maries car door gone shes totally exposed but the professor his bike is spouting gas one of the pellets nailed his tank
xxxxxx no problem hes unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the barrel of his gun two seconds and the hole is patched and bourne and marie the side of
the car is completely gone the professor is gaining across the river dozens of police cars are racing alongside
many more can be seen on their side a road block ahead running out of options and bourne turns hard crashes over the sidewalk and flies down a side street
a police car pulls out behind them the professor cant stop skidding hard turning the bike sideways skidding out sliding across the ground and bammm
smashing into a glass phone booth which shatters
and hes up lifting up his bike and six police cars on their tail more joining
every street they look down has police cars racing in parallel
running out of options and in the background the professor is back in the game passing the police cars and up ahead the road is blocked
police road block cops with guns
gotta act quick and bourne turns hard left theres a metro staircase only way out and they bounce down the stairs
crash through the doors down below
the first police car no way hes following
slamming on his brakes
skidding to a halt skidding sideways gonna stop in time just at the edge of the steps and then the second police car isnt braking t bones the first car
sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it crashes to a halt at the bottom upside down
the professor hes turning heading for a different set of stairs
bourne and marie crashing through the turnstiles people diving out of their way and at the staircase the window of the police car is kicked out and two very angry
cops emerge pull their guns out head into the station
bourne and maries world just got a lot more dangerous and the professor is racing down the other staircase an up escalator people diving out of the way as bourne
and marie slalom through the station suddenly theres the professor parallel corridor metal barricades keep them separated
up ahead a horizon line bourne guns it a steep staircase and they fly down the steps landing on the professor lands on the other side both racing down the
platform professor tearing up the wall behind them and here comes a train on bourne and maries side travelling the opposite way temporary refuge
not for long theres no way out on this end of the platform
they skid to a halt just as the train doors open startled straphangers stare at bourne and marie as they stop onto the platform take off running
the professor has to turn his bike around
hes quick but it gives bourne and marie a two second head start
bourne and marie almost at the other end of the platform gunfire ripping up the windows behind them
gonna go for the steps but here come the angry cops remember them
the ones who took the ride down the steps theyre firing now and bourne and marie turn back the professor is firing and there is only one option bourne and
marie into the conductor booth
people diving off the train as bourne hits the yellow button and the train starts rolling doors still open they disappear into the protection of the tunnel walls then bourne
hits the button to close the doors and the professor watching the trains accelerate out of the station and now hes racing his bike down the platform opposite the motion of the train and here comes the end of the train and the professor throws his bike into a skidding and skids off the platform all in one move landing hard on the tracks but facing the right direction and now hes accelerating towards the train just as an oncoming train is racing into the station and he leaps onto the back of the train in the nick of time
his gun clatters to the tracks
the window is shattered and the professor lets himself in wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows
and bourne and marie finally getting a breather
bourne keeps looking back nothing the train is deserted
finally xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx and ahead daylight the train tracks go above ground and as the train hits daylight we see the professor directly behind bourne on the other
side of the glass and crash
the professor grabs bourne through the glass ramming his head into the metal as bourne grabs the knob swings the door open and crushes the professor crushes him again and
now he is free and bourne turns pulls up the shotgun and the professor kicks it out of his hands it clatters to the ground and now we have a beat the train car races across the bir hakeim bridge all of paris laid out behind them
bourne and the professor squaring off both looking at the gun realizing theres no chance for either one of them to get it and a brutal ruthless fight breaks out
bournes motivated the professors crazy makes it a pretty even match
looks like it could go on for a little while when suddenly bam
the professor drops to the ground behind him marie wields the shot gun
xxxxxx xxxxxx and bourne takes the gun from her standing there reloading both barrels raising the gun aiming it the professor sitting there
like a dummy
like a puppet thats been propped up
hes fucked his whole side ravaged with shot his arm shredded hand barely there blood flowing fast who else is coming
the professor staring up at the gun
eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos
i wont ask again

bourne lowering the weapon head swimming paris

and bourne looks paralyzed too
bourne doesnt answer cant because theres this sound this pulsing hum bourne reaching into the professors pocket and insert the e phone pager covered in blood hum hum hum bournes
hand wiping at the blood that covers the display bourne staring at it
very familiar to him
weve got to go
bourne and marie racing back through the cars away from the scene of the crime and the shattered train pulling into the station doors opening screams echoing through the station
from up the platform and bourne and marie getting off the last car and two minutes later
bourne and marie exhausted beat everything all at once take this

marie takes one last look
and shes running bourne hangs there a moment listening to her go and then he pulls out the e phone pager
and its pulsing like crazy
bourne flips open the shell
theres a keypad in there
like a missing organ
hes still there waiting
and his pager goes off and a safehouse conklin filling a burn bag racing everythings going conklin done with the dirty work out into the street as hes about to
leave he hears a sound a familiar sound hum hum hum he cross the street looks down to the quai below holy shit theres one of his e phone pagers he goes down picks it up and now what did you do to me
conklin wheels around

and with that bourne scrambles up a wall like its nothing conklin just left there on the quai in the dark bourne walking away faster and faster manheim a car
parked in the darkness sitting alone with his briefcase
theres his gun
bourne walking deeper into the darkness and manheim in the dark car loading the weapon calm steady methodical and bourne walking and manheim stepping out of the car closing the
door quietly deep in the shadows and bourne still coming the darkest part of the path just ahead and manheim raising the gun and its conklin
just climbing back up from the quai manheim the gun phftt phftt phftt conklin three holes head heart gut his body dropping like a stone beside his car
manheim walks over
point blank phftt that makes it four and abbott and zorn alone in the dark
as a red light begins pulsing on the console
that red light means conklins dead
after a moment zorn moves to the console and shuts the light off
bourne still walking
and hes just gonna keep on going as we marshall at the head of the table
a cadre of intel honchos
the treadstone project has actually already been terminated
it was designed primarily as a sort of advanced game program
abbott in the hot seat
zorn right there beside him
wed hoped it might build into a good training platform but quite honestly for a strictly theoretical exercise we thought it was far too expensive
the cost benefit ratio was just too high
its been all but decommissioned at this point
all right whats next
zorn handing abbott the next hundred pages
okay this is blackbriar
blackbriar is a joint dod communications program that we really feel has good traction to it
abbott is just gonna go on and on and on
gorgeous summer day
a scooter rental shack near the beach
marie coming out of the shack with two helmets
handing them to a happy couple waiting there on their scooters
the happy couple rides off
marie turns back and theres bourne
a new look

her turn to smile
