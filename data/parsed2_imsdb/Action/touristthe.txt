written by julian fellows based on anthony zimmer by jerome salle june crane down from a view of paris on a misty day
cool gray and beautiful
a taxi stops by the curb of a wide cobbled street
all around there is bustle and activity with cars and people hurrying about their business
the door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in christian louboutin high heels swing out
we follow the legs up the steps across the concourse through the station
men turn and stare
cara mason stunning shows no sign of noticing
she wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand a copy of the international herald tribune in the other
a young waiter wiping down the bar stops to watch cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart
an older waiter approaches her
they exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar
shes waiting for someone
probably waiting for me
the doors waiting for you if you dont get back to work
a messenger clad in leather wearing a motorcycle helmet enters the cafe and looks around
he consults a photograph
his eyes land on cara
he walks over and holds out a document sized envelope
cest vous mademoiselle
as the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents
there is a ticket for the orient express and a handwritten letter
she spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map
her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads
english accent they are following you cara
she looks up
takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her
they think youll lead them to me
but if you follow my instructions closely there is a way for us to get away
cara scans the rest of the letter
camera glides down to see the signature at the bottom love alexander
we barely have time to read this before caras perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter places it in a saucer and sets fire to it
the young waiter hurries over alarmed
je vous en prie cara is already gathering her things and walking away
as cara walks toward the platform
take the orient express to venice
en route select a man my approximate height and weight
her eyes scan the platform
have faith cara
ill be with you soon
men of various shapes and sizes are boarding the orient express
she pauses only long enough to assess and discard too old too young too thin too overweight
her gaze comes to rest on a well dressed french man
medium height medium build
examining his ticket
cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train
adjusts her hair and dress
satisfied with what she sees she turns and starts toward the well dressed french man like a cat stalking prey
the camera admiringly follows her silky approach
the french man hears the click of her heels and looks up
his mouth falls open
his wife arrives and shuts it for him
what are you doing vincent
our train car is over here
with a regretful backward glance at cara he allows himself to be dragged away
frustrated cara turns and casts about for another possibility
she spots a tousle haired man seated on a bench
all aboard the is departing
tousle hair gathers his bags to get on the train
encouraged cara moves to cut him off
as tousle hair stands up reveal
hes six foot seven
cara stops short irritated
the man behind her boarding the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesnt notice
bam he walks straight into her
frank taylor s amiable is a cheerful american tourist
open face completely lacking in guile
frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around cara and boards the train
cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt
frank is a man of average size average build
she peers over her glasses at him
and her expression slowly changes
she follows him onto the train
a good looking englishman loitering further down the platform reading the herald tribune
or rather not reading it
hes been watching cara
he lowers the paper and climbs onto the train through a different door
the gleaming orient express pulls out of the station and gets underway
the train is moving
the thick carpet the mellow wood of the inlaid panels the subtlety of the lalique mirrors and the softly lit lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury
frank looks vaguely out of place sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater
hes wrapped up in a dog eared paperback spy novel
so wrapped up that he barely notices cara sit down opposite him
she crosses her legs
he glances up
slowly nonchalantly she takes her coat off
then the headscarf tied around her neck
follow her sensual movements in tight close up
the effect is as if shes performing a tantalizing strip tease
frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled
she takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes
she goes to remove her mock turtleneck sweater
the zipper seems to give her trouble
without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and leans toward frank
i think im going to need your help
frank is barely able to respond
off his blank look its stuck
frank finally moves into action
he sets his book down and leans closer
awkwardly he reaches towards caras beautiful neck
he attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric
but the zipper resists
im afraid of hurting you
she slides forward on her seat to get even closer
dont be afraid
the train car sways slightly and throws frank off balance
he tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives with a tearing sound
frank freezes looking down at the zipper still in his fingers
caras eyes flash fury for a brief moment
it doesnt matter
maybe i should let you do this dont give up so quickly
reluctantly frank continues with the zipper
the tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper inch by inch
first her neck then her throat then her cleavage are gradually uncovered
the zipper keeps going downward
no sign of anything underneath
frank is practically sweating
finally he uncovers fabric
he finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat
cara slides it off her shoulders sensuous as ever
and settles back into her seat cat like
he stares at her for several moments at a loss for words
my name is frank
a white jacketed steward arrives
to frank will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening monsieur
were not actually the dining car would be lovely thank you
the steward nods and disappears
frank just stares
the orient express plows through the alps
push in on a window where we see frank and cara sitting at a romantic candlelit table eating dinner
frank is one of the only men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket
frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket then another and another
he takes one or two pills from each and swallows them methodically
she watches him
are you ill
she looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate
i dont like travelling
gently mocking so you decided to take a holiday on the orient express
im on my honeymoon
cara is annoyed at this revelation
should we ask the waiter to set another place
shes in pennsylvania
off her questioning look
youre sure you want to hear this
if youd like to tell me
two weeks ago she left me
for the owner of a pizza parlor
frank nods matter of fact
no travel insurance
no refund on the tickets
here i am
on my honeymoon
im sorry frank
i really loved that pizza too
bala pizza if youre ever in rosemont
i wouldnt touch it
im loyal to you
a waiter delivers their drinks
a cointreau for mademoiselle
and for monsieur
a miller light
the waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them
cara seems amused by franks obliviousness
what takes you to venice
she nods toward his well thumbed paperback
you read spy novels
im a mysterious woman on a train
you tell me what my story is
youd be a diplomatic attache or
a girl from east germany whose fathers been kidnapped by soviet agents
theyre blackmailing you into stealing
probably a microchip
theres usually a microchip involved
what awaits me
youll probably be shot at in less than two chapters
is there a man in my life
or a candidate for the job
he gazes at her with a glimmer of hope
shes insanely out of his league
but shes the one flirting with him
the magnificent prefecture de police on the ile de la cite
a convoy of black mercedes arrives
footsteps echo in the grand marble hallways
john ackerman moves down the hall with purpose
british interpol chief inspector
hes the kind of man who commands respect think tommy lee jones in the fugitive
melissa jones his american counterpart matches him step for step
were putting a lot resources into this investigation john
tell me youre going to get him this time
dry were going to get him this time ms
goyal ackermans deputy closes his cell phone
shes on the train
theyll be in venice in the morning
behind the ornate th century doors is a high tech amphitheater style briefing room
all glass and steel
suited bureaucrats and officers from all over europe listen to ackerman as he leads the meeting from the podium
our targets name is alexander pearce
british citizen born in london into an ordinary middle class family
the only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers
ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen behind him a fuzzy photo of a british schoolboy with a shy grin
which he used to hack into a computer and fix the test results his final year at school
jean luc french interpol liaison looks up skeptically
your mastermind couldnt pass his exams on his own
he didnt fix his test scores he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class
it made him very popular
a ripple of laughter through the group
severely what started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious
after a year in the training program at goldman sachs he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living
that in turn involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling money laundering
quinn is the swiss interpol liaison
he speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages
youve assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer mr
there is nothing common about alexander pearce
quiet simply he has turned money laundering into an art form
his greatest innovation the false lawsuit
he clicks through a series of flashy powerpoint slides illustrating pearces financial dealings
pearce sets up two companies one is a casino in arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the cayman islands
the cayman islands company files a lawsuit against the casino claiming copyright infringement or some other complaint
they succeed in winning the case and the casino pays the shell company an enormous settlement
understanding the money travels from america to the cayman islands
yes but now the money is legal
not quite legal
has been cheated out of the revenue
beat we calculate that mr
pearces tax bill currently stands at
jean luc leans toward his colleague
whispers in french that explains what the american harridan is doing here
jones gives him a glacial stare
jean luc reddens
apparently not every american fits the stereotype
pearce has some other debts as well
most of you will recognize ivan demidov
click a photo of a balding russian oligarch emerging from a limo
pearce laundered over a billion dollars for demidov
at some point pearce decided hed rather steal from demidov than help him steal
beat given demidovs ties to organized crime id say that was a mistake
clears her throat the u
government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the russian parliament our target is alexander pearce
ackerman smiles coolly at her
an interpol officer from germany raises his hand
pearce ever been in custody
ackerman looks down for a moment as if it pains him to answer
fog covers the skyline exposing only the slate rooftops of buildings that havent changed in centuries
we hear the sound of water gently lapping the shore
from out of the mist emerges
a guardacoste a patrol boat lights dimmed
it gently touches the beach
a carabinieri officer lowers a ramp
an interpol tactics team in kevlar and headgear pours out of the patrol boat
ackerman steps off pulling on a vest
he nods to goyal
they follow the team
angle on a specialist who kneels to open an electric panel
reveal a glass plate with a fingertip shape in the center
the specialist places his hand against the glass a red light beeps on its a bio metric lock
he turns to ackerman
this is gonna take a few minutes
ackerman betrays no impatience
he knows better than to rush the professionals
he simply nods
the specialist opens a tool box filled with sophisticated gear and gets to work
wrapping a towel around herself cara mason the girl from the train stares at herself in the bathroom mirror for a beat
so do we
she steps out into the lofty master bedroom suite
in the dressing room cara calls out to someone in the next room
ill be ready in fifteen minutes
cara sits on the bed drying her hair
on a night table beside her are keys a wallet and an expensive mans cara pauses shes heard something
she walks across the tiled floor to the balcony overlooking the elevator entrance
she freezes six tactics officers face her with guns drawn
ackerman steps up the stairs pistol in hand
he gestures at cara to be quiet and come towards him
cara stands stock still for a long instant
slams the oaken door of the master bedroom suite in ackermans face locking it
she calls out
ackerman shakes the doorknob cursing a tall commander calls for the battering ram which is rushed up the stairs
the tactics team cracks the door
ackerman charges into
cara stands frozen beside the mans effects on the night table
where is he
on the other side of the room ackerman sees an open window which the ocean breeze swings
rushing forward he sticks his head out the window
hanging outside the window is the rigging for a window washers platform a platform that seconds before was lowered to the sand below
in the distance a recently boarded water taxi pulls away from the dock and sails out into the lagoon
ackerman turns to face the study
on the desk is a cup of coffee with steam gently rising from its surface
a cigarette sits lit in an ashtray the smoke curling toward the ceiling
ackerman stares at the empty slowly revolving chair
he walks toward cara now in custody
he holds her defiant gaze for a moment
you have nothing to say
cara looks at him for a moment then lowers her eyes
get her out of my sight
the tall commander shepherds the handcuffed cara down the stairs and into the elevator
she wears alexanders watch
what does this alexander pearce look like
ackerman closes the file in front of him on the podium
he disappeared after his escape
hes had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then
drug lord amado carillo did the same thing in the s to successfully elude authorities
how do you know about it
pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time
he treated them so well that theyre virtually all completely loyal
none of them would cooperate
weve questioned the ones we could find and the only thing we learned is that pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the
so nobody knows what he looks like
forgive me for saying so mr
ackerman but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance
what makes you think you can catch him now
ackerman regards him with aplomb
his girlfriend was recently released from custody
hell come for her
well be waiting
what makes you so certain
ackerman clicks on a slide
caras face fills the screen behind him
a murmur runs through the room
every man stares
hell come for her
ackerman himself glances up at her face with a look of longing
hold on caras image for a moment before we
cara stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the station
the gleaming train stretches out behind her
franks eyes drift open
he glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped
he sits bolt upright
a conductors voice over the loudspeaker is saying something in italian
frank stumbles over himself to collect his things book sweater pills etc
frank struggles down the aisle bumping into fellow passengers and apologizing as he goes
all the while looking around for a sign of cara
frank steps off the train and glances about at the hive of activity
frank brushes past the good looking englishman from the paris station
finally he spots her
franks pov cara with her back turned
frank hurries over
i was afraid id missed you
i wanted to ask where youre staying in venice
im supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but i thought maybe without turning ive got a better idea
she holds out her valise for him
he takes it hesitantly
she peers at him over the rims of her sunglasses with a very slight smile
a beauty shot of the grand canal magnificent palaces and churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory
push in on a launch labelled danieli travelling fast over the water
cara shakes her head to let the wind ruffle her hair
camera continues past her to reveal frank clutching the railing beside her afraid to wake up
frank leads us through the distinctive revolving glass door into the low ceilinged entrance lobby
discover cara at the desk talking to the receptionist
you have a booking in the name of mason
thats my husband
she nods at frank
for a second the receptionist cannot keep the surprise out of his eyes
this glamorous superbly dressed creature is married to a dull american tourist in a t shirt
he recovers his composure and alters his manner at once
very good senora mason
welcome to the danieli
you are in the doges our premiere suite
pause is there anything special you require
have a copy of todays herald tribune sent up to the room please
my pleasure signora
he gives her a large gold key and nods to a porter to take the luggage
frank hurries to catch up with her
the receptionist he watches them go
in italian mother of god what a waste
together they follow the porter into the ravishing open central hall of the hotel with the great ornate staircase soaring up and up past gothic galleries and finely carved balustrades
frank and cara trail the porter across the marble floor
frank glances about dazed with delight and amazement
under a gilded and coffered ceiling portraits of the doges flank a vast hooded fireplace
the porter is showing them round the huge apartment opening and closing doors
the bedroom is through here
you have two bathrooms here and here
there is a small kitchen which
he glances at cara she doesnt look like a woman who spends a lot of time in the kitchen
you may not need
there are two televisions video dvd radio hi fi sound system
the porter throws open a pair of french windows
he lets the view speak for itself
they step forward
the whole of st
marks basin and the venetian lagoon are laid out below them
is everything satisfactory
then i will leave you
the porter looks expectantly to the husband for a tip
frank doesnt get it
an awkward beat
cara takes a few euros from her purse and tips him
the porter exits
frank stands on the balcony in a daze
he stares down at the molo and across st
marks basin to san georgio maggiore
cara joins him
you like it
frank opens his mouth to answer
whats not to like
id have been bored here on my own
theres more than enough room for two
i can see that
i didnt ask for an extra bed
frank looks at her for a beat barely able to breathe
are you all right with the sofa
if you like i can have them bring one up
his face falls
he tries to cover up his reaction
no no no
the sofas fine
perfect in fact
before he can say more the buzzer sounds
ill get it
he goes back inside to answer the door
cara remains alone on the balcony immobile as if holding her breath
frank walks across to the door
there is a small spyhole and he looks through it
the porter stands there with a trolley
frank opens the door
the porter wheels the trolley in and starts to carry the bags into the bedroom
cara relaxes again as she hears frank approach
he steps outside on the balcony
ive put my things in the other bathroom
she turns to face him
have you ever been to venice before
he shakes his head
then we need to go out
camera tracks with goyal as he weaves through a sprawling mess of personnel and equipment cell phones computers and cables from various national agencies
the united nations aspect of the task force gives it impressive scope but also results in a tower of babel effect
the calm eye of the storm is ackerman
shes checked into the danieli
shes not alone
to the room maintain surveillance but keep your distance
dont try to get clever remember that pearce is smarter than most of you put together
angle on quinn who quietly slips out of the room
a gulfstream g executive jet banks over the venetian coast and comes in for a landing
the man who steps off the plane is dressed in a hand tailored italian suit and shoes that cost more than some cars
hes flanked by two bodyguards
in the flesh
camera floats over the rooftops toward the penthouse of a ultra high end business hotel
demidov sips a glass of red wine
the view from his room rivals the one at the danieli but demidov pays no attention
hes busy scanning his emails on his blackberry
a thick necked bodyguard in the background goes to answer the door
a moment later
he ushers in quinn the swiss interpol agent
take a seat mr
can i offer you a glass of brunello
no thank you mr
demidov swirls his glass
you know id never admit this at home but vodka is for peasants
theres much we could learn from the italians
he smiles pleasantly at quinn then on a dime he turns back to business
tell me im not going to be disappointed
quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over
i dont think so
he flips it open and examines the contents
we glimpse a photo of cara and some text
to himself he always had good taste
demidov makes a gesture and a second bodyguard with a scar on his face gives quinn an envelope filled with cash
quinn tucks it away discreetly as if embarrassed by the directness of the pay off
if i may ask you a question
why do you care so much about alexander pearce
i mean youve come here yourself
as if it were personal
demidov looks at quinn thoughtfully
it may be difficult for you to understand mr
quinn you swiss are mercenary by nature
but for some of us there are things more important than money
i put my trust in alexander pearce
he betrayed that trust
quinn smiles tightly
hes ready to get out of there
and its bad business to let somebody make a fool of you
if pearce gets away with it what does that say about me
a clear bright winter day at the beach
devoid of tourists the famous stretch is a completely different venice from the one were used to seeing
sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea
cara and frank walk on a deserted patch of sand
the wind wraps her light sun dress around her body intermittently hugging her perfect curves
when youre not on a grand european tour what do you do in rosemont pennsylvania
im a teacher
high school math
what do you do
she glances at him slyly over her movie star shades
this is what i do frank
youre good at it
a sound of voices and laughter drift toward them
up ahead on the beach they see a group of italians in formal clothes
a woman wears a white bridal dress
im not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life
she takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with sidewalk tables
cara and frank are seated
a bottle of orvieto rests on the table
do you think its really over
maybe shell change her mind
she might give you a second chance
i suppose thats a possibility
hesitates thats what i tell my statistics class anyway life is a game of chance
endless possibilities and permutations
you just have to calculate the odds
you havent answered the question
quietly id like to think that love is a question of destiny not chance
cara looks at him curiously
for a moment there you just reminded me of somebody
she shakes her head and takes a sip of wine
he had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that hed completely avoided the truth
his entire life was wrapped up in deception
lost in thought he told so many lies i wouldnt believe him even if he finally did tell the truth
he doesnt sound like much of a friend
frank glances at her wrist
so why are you wearing his watch
she looks up at him
youre smarter than you look frank
she runs her fingertip over the face of the watch
then impulsively unclasps it and reaches for franks hand
and youre right
here take it
she puts it on franks wrist over his protests
no i cant
this thing must be worth a fortune i insist
youre doing me a favor
firm take it or ill toss it in the ocean
she means it
he closes the clasp
ill wear it until you regain your senses
he feels the heft of it on his wrist
admires it for a moment
it really is a beautiful watch
she settles back in her chair pleased with herself
he looks up and sees her smiling at him
it suits you
long shot of frank and cara framed by the sunset
a romantic dinner for two
they could easily be lovers or honeymooners
in the foreground reveal somebody watching them
the good looking englishman is there hovering
the key sounds in the lock and the door swings open
frank and cara tumble in together laughing a little tipsy
he glances at the sofa and that sobers him up reminding him where hes going to sleep
he watches cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off her shoes
she throws open the french doors to the balcony
frank bypasses the sofa bed and follows her outside
cara looks out across the lagoon
frank appears beside her
i could get used to this
a movement in the street down below catches her eye
she studies the ponte del vin intently seeing something
cara turns abruptly to frank and presses her body against his
hes taken by surprise but willingly responds to her advance wrapping his arms around her back
they exchange a long passionate kiss
reveal the lens of a palm sized video camera peering out from behind a vendors cart in the street below
frank his face slightly obscured kisses cara
we hear the whirring of the video camera
still kissing cara leads frank back into the hotel room
the silhouettes of cara and frank disappear into the hotel room as
cara closes the curtains
she pulls away from him
her composure changes the passion is gone
the expression on her face is matter of fact
you should leave venice tomorrow
softer its a city for lovers frank no place to recover from a failed engagement
she turns and walks toward her bedroom
frank stares after her in stunned disappointment
what did i do
she pauses at the door
her expression softens slightly
then she disappears into her bedroom
the door closes behind her and we hear the click of the lock
frank remains standing alone immobile
after several moments he sits on the sofa
there are two folded blankets and a pillow
from within caras bedroom we can hear her voice muffled but still audible
thats exactly what im doing but now i want him to go
he approaches the door straining to hear more but her words fade out
frank gets ready for bed
he takes off the watch cara gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye
its engraved with a name he stares at the name for a moment then unzips his travel bag
takes out his pills
pops a bunch
brushes his teeth
he pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if wondering how in the world he ended up here
its like hes staring into the face of stranger
he puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the sofa
the sound of the shower reaches frank in his sleep
he blinks his eyes
the morning is misty
he closes the balcony doors
caras bedroom door is ajar
frank struggles not to notice
he turns to his bed and begins folding sheets
then he hears the sound of water running in the shower
he glances over at the door ajar the sound of the shower
its too much
frank walks to the bedroom door
he pushes it open
the door to caras bathroom is open
the outline of her naked body is visible in the shower
she lifts her wet hair and soaps the back of her neck
she sees him
cara is so stunned she simply stands there
frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door
walking in he lifts cara against the glass clutching at her slithery body kissing her frantically
she kisses him back with ardor wrapping her dripping legs around his back
frank is sleeping
a smile on his face
a shadow passes over him as somebody walks past
a mans trouser leg is visible in the foreground moving slowly toward frank
frank wakes with a start to see
a waiter is setting up breakfast on a cart
frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before him
la signora ordered this for you when she left
he looks around the suite
he is alone
the waiter has finished
he hovers for a moment
finally frank takes the hint and gives the man a one euro tip
he takes it with disdain and leaves
frank throws off his blanket and sits up
frank strolls into the room barefoot in his boxers
the bed is unmade
cara has left a shirt over a chair
he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent
he notices a newspaper
a copy of the international herald tribune is open on her bedside table
he lifts it to see what cara had been reading
there is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen
the message is just a list of words the dots single out letters in a code
frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message tomorrow caffe pesaro frank studies this for a moment
laying the paper on the table frank walks to the door
frank reaches for the doorknob
he quietly slides the chain on
peers through the spyhole
spyhole pov two tough looking men in suits stand there most definitely not hotel staff
one has a scar on his face
frank is frozen
scarface takes out a silenced pistol and mutters something in russian to his partner
he produces a lock pick set and crouches out of frame
frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock
he looks around wildly
sees the key on the entryway table and reaches for it
the russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door
the chain stops it
a moment later a knife comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain
frank stares at the knife he has to act fast
frank throws his shoulder against the door
the knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut
frank jams his key into the lock and turns the bolt into place
theres angry confusion on the other side of the door
frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key breaking it off in the lock
frank scrambles out of the way
the sound of metal scraping in the lock
russian cursing can be heard just outside
a heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open
frank looks around desperately for an escape
the sitting room
theres nowhere to go
frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet
he scrambles outside as
bullets rip through the wood and metal blasting the lock assembly apart
the door bursts open
frank looks down and stares at the to the cobblestones of the ponte del vin below
guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee
three balconies over frank sees the rooftop of the modern wing of the hotel
the two toughs rapidly move through the room searching
the one place they havent checked
frank puts one bare foot on the stonework
he grimaces as he heaves himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his
he hangs desperately flailing feet over the street below
he gets a tentative hold
a pallid french woman drops her coffee and screams
the russians sprint out to the balcony
they spot frank
who shoves the pallid woman inside struggles past her breakfast table and prepares to leap again but slips on the spilled coffee
bullets shatter china around him
he cuts his foot on a broken plate
he grabs his bleeding foot
im a fucking tourist
another round of shots ring out
they dont seem to care
frank goes over the railing with another awkward heave
his pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto the pallid womans balcony
this time frank lands in the lap of a burly welshman
are ya bloody mad
the burly welshman punches frank in the stomach which drops him out of the way of
which explode into the welshmans shoulder
he cries out and falls down on top of frank
the russians stand on the pallid womans balcony and prepare to jump
as frank crawls out from under the wounded welshman and peers over the next balcony
which is at least twenty feet from the roof
he misjudged the distance
frank runs through the hotel room past the welshmans wife to the door
a shot behind him and pounding feet send him out into the corridor past a room service steward to an
which will not do but the stairs will and frank flies down the steps three at a time hearing his pursuers above him running harder than hes run in his
but hes slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons through the railing
p ching several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the metal stairwell
frank pants as he pushes out a side door
frank sprints along the edge of the canal dodging tourists and children vendors and locals
he spots a vendors three wheel bicycle and jumps on
as he pedals he realizes its too slow so he jumps and falls a painful spill he cuts his hand but clambers to his feet as the russians bear down
running up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the riva degli schiavoni
frank runs down the ridge of the roof
a silenced shot hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance
he bumping down the other side of the roof until as he topples over the edge he thrusts a hand at the gutter smashing his head against the wall
he drops onto the pavement along the edge of the small canal
he doubles back towards the lagoon
looking back he sees the men still in pursuit
he turns into the campo san zaccaria scattering the flapping and fluttering pigeons
the gondolieri and their passengers watch the half naked man run past and cheer
in italian run faster man
the russians force their way past the pedestrians
they have almost caught him when
ducking inside a leather shop frank heads straight for the back entrance and finds it
he stands on the cobblestones
blood streams from his forehead as well as his hand
he has to decide which way to go
the alley is long and narrow on either side
an awning above
clear sight lines
the back of the shop upends the grand canal
the russians burst out the back
there is no sign of frank
scarface looks at the canal
he walks to the edge of the water and sprays gun fire atop it
frank lies huddled on his back in the awning behind the leather shop barely able to control his frantic breathing
hes mere feet away from the men who are trying to kill him
he looks up and sees the scowling face of an italian woman peering out over her window box
frank raises a desperate finger to his lips
a prayer that she wont give him away
she looks at him disapprovingly
then disappears back inside
close on frank as he waits his heart pounding
seconds tick past
is he safe
a black cylinder like the barrel of a gun tears through the awning fabric inches from his franks head
he cries out
the awning rips and dumps him down hard onto the cobblestones below
frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots that belong to
a pair of carbinieri who stand over him
one of them holds a nightstick
they stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants lying at their feet
theyve seen stranger things
frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders
most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head
from down the hallway a cheery stubble faced police officer domenico s animated walks into the room where frank is waiting
domenico laughs talking on his cell phone as he enters
in italian you cant let them stay over man
you start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car
stop cuddling tomaso
suddenly noticing him hey what are you doing in here
the officers told me to wait here
ive been sitting here for over two hours
dominico glances over his shoulder
i think they forgot about you
frank sits back down heavily
domenico sits on the edge of a desk
what happened to you anyway
somebody tried to kill me
domenico picks up franks statement and glances at it
taylor wow you had quite a day
we got chasing we got shooting
domenico looks at mild mannered frank sitting there in his boxers
the story seems unlikely
you think im crazy but its all true
maybe you crazy and its true my friend
domenico looks at frank a little harder
decides this guy is not making all this up
okay so who are these guys
why they mad at you
i have absolutely no idea
they followed you from the danieli
they came to the room
they pretended to be room service
you dont scopata one of their girlfriends or something
i didnt scopata anybody
he consults a piece of paper
frank is quiet
domenico playfully points at him
i catch you right
irritated in america the cops catch the crooks not the victim
ha ha we do that sometimes here too
domenico considers for a moment
is no domestic then
how long you know cara mason
i met her yesterday
and you take her to the danieli
that must have been good meeting yes
i didnt take her
she took me
the infectious grin again lights up domenicos face
you lead an exciting life mr
domenico picks up the phone and dials a number
he talks in brisk italian listens again and replaces the receiver
signora mason was staying with her husband last night
you marry her mr
i think maybe signora mason might know why these guys behave badly
what do you think
i think thats possible
you got a phone number mobile
she didnt give me one
domenico looks him over
you need some clothes
ill be right back
he leaves frank alone again
frank stands and half heartedly follows him to the doorway
he spots something in the adjoining room a computer that has been left on
he wanders over and looks at the screen
an idea comes into franks head
he looks around
nobody is watching him
he glances at the inscription on the then quickly sits down
he does a search for wanted international criminals and types in the name an immediate hit in the data base
alexander pearces page fills the screen
the caption reads on interpols most wanted list
in place of a photograph there is just a black outline of a mans head
frank is about to scan for more information when he hears domenico returning
he quickly steps back into the room where he was left
domenico enters carrying a garish sweat suit
he hands it to frank
put these on
time to go
frank looks at the clothes
where are we going
im taking you to the hospital mr
a doctor should take a look at you
id really rather just go dont worry
i put you in padua away from venice
youll be safe
scribbles his number any worry you call me
i give you my home number
frank lies flat on his back
a nurse leans over him with a kindly expression
were just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head
she slides him slowly into the mouth of an mri scanning machine head first
it hums to life
domenico whistles as a hotel clerk escorts him to to the doges suite
in italian unfortunately weve already re let the room
nervous wed rather the guests didnt know about the incident
ill be discreet
the clerk knocks
the door is opened by ivan demidov
i beg your pardon signore but this is a police officer
he needs to briefly examine the room
demidov steps back holding the door open
demidov watches domenico who sniffs around
casually what happened officer
thats what im trying to find out signore
domenico gets down on his hands and knees and looks around
he spots something under the sofa and fishes it out with his penknife
a spent bullet casing
he puts it in a plastic bag pleased with himself
demidov catches his eye
he smiles at him
you are a good detective
i do my best
domenico stands and takes his leave
sorry for the inconvenience
enjoy your stay
as he and the clerk exit scarface steps out from the other room
off demidovs look he leaves the suite to follow
frank lies on the bed
there are clean bandages on his injuries
the television drones on the wall an italian reality show
a woman holds her hands over her eyes
the host taunts her in italian now remember i said you were in for a surprise
a big surprise
frank waits for the surprise
ackerman is tilted back with his eyes closed like he has a headache
jones enters with a file labelled frank taylor
what did we find on the american
hes a tourist
member of the teachers union
pays his taxes
has bad luck
he had a pair of russian hit men after him
are you still going to tell me demidov is clean
i never said he is clean
i just said he isnt our target
im just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel
under his breath just so long as they dont beat us to pearce when the real one arrives
he looks up at goyal
wheres the teacher now
the local police picked him up
then hes safely out of the way
frank sits up in his bed reading
the phone rings
intercut domenico in his terrace flat
he wears a t shirt and holds a glass of wine
loud italian pop music plays in the background
well its official mr
youre not mad
thats a relief
i went to the hotel
somebody shot at somebody
i found a shell casing
ill have it analyzed in the morning
frank glances around uncomfortably
id like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning
relax youre perfectly safe where you are
pause you have any visits from your signora mason
quiet i wish
never let them cuddle mr
one cuddle and it all turns to merda
if you need anything you have my number
frank hangs up shaking his head
in the restful silence he hears a distant bang
a door slam
nervous he gets up and goes to the door
frank looks right and left
the corridor is empty and silent lit by strip lights set on low
just as hes about to close the door again frank notices that there is a label stuck there with his name on it just above the room number
he struggles with the label for a few seconds tearing it off
he sticks the label on the door to an empty room opposite
frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face
stares at himself for several moments as he did in the bathroom at the danieli
hes lost in thought
he hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled along
some footsteps approach
there are voices speaking an unfamiliar language maybe russian
frank scrambles for his clothes
he fishes out domenicos phone number from a pocket and races to the phone
then freezes listening the footsteps move away slightly
there is the sound of a door opening
the door across the hall
the door is closed again
the footsteps move down the hall slowly fading away
frank punches in the policemans number and grips the receiver
a saucepot simmers on the stove
the phone rings
behind it is a window pierced by one circular bullet hole
the music still plays
as our gaze drifts downwards we see domenicos bare feet prone behind the kitchen island
the phone rings and rings
frank is struggling into his clothes
everything seems to stick and take forever
he opens the door a crack and looks down the ward
he moves along the passage slipping into doorways and out of the light
he finds the elevator and jabs at the button
the light shows it is approaching the floor
the doors open
frank is about to enter it when suddenly somebody steps out
an orderly exits and brushes past
frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in
frank presses the button for receptione et terre and waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to close
slowly the elevator descends
the doors open
a big man stands with his back to us blocking the exit
frank shrinks away with nowhere to hide
the man turns
hes a male nurse waiting to get into the lift
he stands aside to allow frank to leave
frank takes a step out
and sees scarface talking to the receptionist
hurriedly frank reverses back into the elevator
to the nurse wrong floor
then just before the doors close scarface turns
his eyes meet franks
he starts towards the elevator
but the doors shut first
the lift stops again
the doors open on the first tier of the subterranean car park
frank leaps off
limping and terrified frank jogs towards the ramp marked uscita in the far corner
an engine roar splits the silence
the lights blind frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him
he falls to his knees
the car skids to a stop
the door flies open
sitting behind the wheel calm and beautiful as ever is cara
what are you waiting for
he climbs into the car
she turns to him as she pulls out
did you miss me
he glances anxiously over her shoulder
you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me calm i know
cara drives toward the ramp
he looks at her
do you know why
its because i kissed you
she stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top of the ramp to open
it rises with a loud creaking to a black car with two men inside
one of them steps out and ducks under the gate as it rises up
while hes briefly silhouetted by the cars headlights we glimpse the outline of an automatic weapon
with remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets her car roll backwards gliding silently and perfectly into a parking spot
they watch the black car slowly descend the ramp
the russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully alongside
frank watches holding his breath
the sound of another engine cuts through the silence
a pair of headlights come up from the level below
close on the car
the male nurse from the elevator is driving up toward the exit ramp toward the exit where the russians are waiting
close on the gunman slipping back into the shadows and readying his gun to fire
frank sees what is about to happen
his face betrays his concern
he reaches for the door
cara presses the central door lock
franks door doesnt budge
he looks over at her
re the nurse that guy has nothing to do with this
neither do you
he looks her straight in the eye
if you want to play hero
she turns over the ignition
cara revs the car and pulls out fast cutting off the nurses car
he leans on the horn
at the top of the exit ramp the metal parking gate is slowly being lowered
she weaves around the black car deliberately heading for the gunman
he opens fire
bullets spray wildly ricocheting off the walls shattering windshields
frank covers his face as a side window pops showering him with glass
the gunman is forced to jump out of the way as cara scrapes the side of her car along the wall
the black car burns rubber as it u turns to follow her
she guns it up the ramp towards the closing door
theres not enough room
theres enough room
the fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering
the black car is closing in behind them
we wont make it
i thought americans were optimists
at the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his eyes
the gate clips the top of caras car with a tremendous clang
cara presses her foot all the way down on the accelerator
smoke pours from the tires
the black car rams them from behind
a russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of cara and franks heads
bullets shatter the back window
cara pushes franks head down
the sound of burning gears as the engine hits its limit
suddenly scraping paint caras car springs forward jetting out onto the street
the fence drops further and shudders to a halt
the black car is trapped
the russians can only watch as cara speeds away
the quiet hum of the autostrade is the only sound in the car
frank sits in a daze
he turns to her
do i look that much like alexander pearce
cara turns sharply
how do you know
frank holds up his wrist
i dont know
youre about his size
incredulous you dont know what your own boyfriend looks like
alexander crossed a very dangerous man
he changed his appearance in order to vanish
im taking you somewhere youll be safe
we should go to the police
because they did such a good job protecting you before
frank doesnt respond
frank looks at her
then relents leaning his head back against the support and closing his eyes
the car is parked along a muddy canal
beside it runs a small disconnected set of palazzos
cara shakes frank
he wont wake up
she pinches his nose closed
he startles awake
she smiles mischievously
he follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men sitting on stone steps
and i thought i wouldnt get to do any sight seeing
frank steps over a greenish puddle
here we are
she pauses before a run down palazzo
the narrow hall is dark and shabby
cara walks up the stairs to a door on the landing
she opens it with a key
it is completely dark inside
the two of them maneuver in the darkness
the sound of a hand bumping against a wall
finally somebody finds the light switch and cara holds a
taurus pistol in front of her
frank happens to be right in her line of sight
she quickly directs the gun away from him
frank leans over catching his breath
cara starts to giggle
frank starts to laugh too
the apartment appears as if it was leased stocked and then never set foot in again
brand new appliances that have never been used
frank walks over to a flat screen tv and curiously peels off the protective clear film
he looks up and sees cara has her head inside the oven
what are you doing
she pulls out a flashlight in her mouth
making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines
frank watches her walk over to the fuse boxes
frank pokes through the cupboards
stocked with fine olives tins of expensive smoked fish viands stewed fruit from orchards in france
he opens the icebox
inside is frozen meat and fish
he pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks it is labelled barracuda caught antigua
he goes barracuda fishing
cara has poured herself a glass of wine
he goes marlin fishing
you catch the barracudas by accident
frank looks at the steak
close on the fish now seasoned grilled and surrounded by whipped sweet potatoes beets and almonds
frank places a plate before cara who sits with her wine at pearces oak table
she looks appreciatively at her plate
and she left you for a cook
frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine
cara takes a bite
with these ingredients its not hard
frank savors a bite of his meal
you know something
food tastes better after youve been shot at
she clinks his glass
im glad i decided to come back for you frank taylor
they watch one another eat for several moments
can i ask you a question
she sets down her fork
whats it like
being a criminal
scoffs im not a criminal
you carry a gun you consort with people being chased by killers
i hate to break it to you but okay im a criminal
she takes a big gulp of wine
moves over to the sofa
i didnt mean for things to turn out like this
i always lived by a certain code
i broke it
she lapses into silence
frank comes and sits beside her
for alexander pearce
she doesnt answer
which is an answer
whats he like
hes the most interesting man ive ever known
when i first met him i wasnt expecting that
he took me by surprise
she shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if reliving a memory of sensual pleasure
if id been prepared i might not have loved him
but i wasnt
so i did
she frowns into her empty wine glass
frank slides a little closer
soft i dont regret it you know
he looks into her eyes
they are sitting very close on the sofa
the lights are low
the mood is romantic
frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a kiss cara stands abruptly
what are you doing
he looks up at her questioningly
you thought what
that i saw you on the train and my heart stopped
that all my life ive been waiting for a math teacher from the midwest to sweep me off my feet
frank doesnt respond
i picked you because of your height
do you understand
his humiliation complete he rises with as much dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the kitchen
cara looks after him
exasperated yet already sorry for being so blunt
she is about to say something when
her cell phone rings
a special ring
she answers right away
the englishman strolls the piazza san marco
follow him from behind as he speaks into his phone
have you been reading the newspaper
cara narrows her focus
she walks away from frank stealing away into the bedroom
her heart is beating
there was nothing there today
is it you
alexa no names
not on the phone
the wave patterns of the mans voice shimmer on a computer monitor
goyal and ackerman stand watching hanging on every word
from the speakers its been a busier weekend than i expected
a horn rimmed aide zeroes in on a map screen
the screen gives him a map of venice
then zooms into a map of the san marco district
cara holds one finger in her ear listening intently
theres a recipe in a tuscan cookbook there i need
would you look it up for me
do we really need another recipe
i want to make sure our guests are surprised
the englishman passes the lagoon to his left and enters an enormous courtyard the arco foscari
he looks down at his watch
youre a brave and loyal girl
im in awe of you
the computer map hones in on the piazza san marco
goyal is already out the door and ackerman grabs his kevlar vest and follows racing down the steps
cara folds her arms as she listens
thats because you leave everything up to me
she pouts only partially joking
im fine by the way in case you were concerned about me
playful my only concern is for those who cross you my love
at last the englishman arrives before the lower colonnade of the doges palace the seat of medieval venetian civic government
it is a wonder of gothic architecture with spires piercing the blue sky
he gazes up at it for a moment
you may not believe it but every step of this miserable game is taken in the hope of earning your trust and ever lasting regard
i mean that
the englishman is at the ponte del suspiri the bridge of sighs
caras expression softens
you have a talent for saying the right thing
to herself you always did
frank listens to the end of caras conversation his forehead creased with concern
the englishman closes his phone and disappears into the crowd
cara speaks urgently
wait the line is dead
a silent caravan of three black suvs a strange sight in venice pull up in perimeter around the bridge of sighs and skids to a stop
ackerman and the others leap out looking around
then ackerman sees it the englishmans cell phone sitting on the cobblestones
goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic bag
we should check for prints
maybe he forgot to wipe it down
i doubt it
ackerman looks around
holding her now unimportant phone in her hand cara draws herself up and walks into the frank lies asleep on the couch
cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the tuscan cookbook
thinking herself unobserved she opens it
a page has been turned down
a recipe for lamb
cara pulls out her red felt tipped pen
she finds a sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it
tapping her pen under letters on the page cara works out the code memorizes the contents of the message and closes the book
his eyes are open
establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the winter time
boats are pushed out into the canals
trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets
tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes waiting for the tourists to come
with an unfamiliar gentleness cara approaches frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder
i have to go
he opens his eyes and looks at her
dont go out
all you need is here
in four or five days everything will be resolved
it will all be over
ill give you the all clear and you can go back to your life
this will be a great adventure you can look back on
when will i see you again
she looks at him evenly one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds
good bye frank
she has started down the stairs when frank appears on the landing
he leans over the balustrade
is he worth it
get back inside
she has stopped mid flight
youre going to risk everything for him
would he do the same for you
she is quite straightforward in her response
it doesnt matter
i love him
he doesnt deserve it
she shakes her head
none of this is your business anymore
now get back inside frank
just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in the hall and an old man comes out
he looks up at cara
this is exactly what she did not want
but she controls her annoyance nods in greeting and continues towards the front door
to the neighbor mi dispiace signor
the old neighbor nods as cara walks out the door
he admires caras shapely form as she crosses the cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley
he glances back up at frank and whistles appreciatively
frank turns and goes back inside
ackerman sits in an office chair gently revolving
jones goyal and jean luc are there as well
why do women find these con men so appealing
jones is the only woman nearby
dont look at me
i married my personal trainer
sotto jean luc shes twenty six
jean luc cant tell if shes serious
how did pearce seduce that beautiful woman
was it his charm
ackerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso
maybe its because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires so then can she
he looks around to see if the others like this theory
she can become a child again
who wouldnt want that
there is a bitterness in ackermans tone that reveals he is personally hurt by this
goyals blackberry makes a beep
shes on the move
time to go
ackerman pushes himself wearily to his feet
by all means
lets follow the children
paging through the cookbook frank locates the page
he smiles in recognition at the familiar code pattern of red dots
he pulls out a pen
frank examines a sleek tiny electric razor that resembles a lollipop
turning it on he applies it
pleased he keeps shaving
getting out of the shower frank enjoys the soft frette towels
in the closets are dozens of flawless custom tailored suits
flipping through the rack like a discerning shopper frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy
elegant and simple
frank struggles to close alexander pearces pants around his lightly padded mid section
a little too tight
frank is irritated to discover hes not quite as trim as pearce
frank engages himself in a spontaneous program of calisthenics
he struggles through a batch of push ups then sit ups
frank flosses his teeth
then he backs up taking in his outfit
the lines of the suit highlight his frame
he likes what he sees
demidov is getting dressed
its an elaborate ritual carefully pressed pants ironed shirt starched collar etc
his two bodyguards stand nervously at attention watching him
when i was a young man times were very hard
when an opportunity presented itself you took it
he pats talcum powder on himself
the men remain stone faced
i was twelve years old when gregor asked me if i was ready for a mans job
he was the top chelovek in our housing block
so i said yes
he gave me a crowbar and told me to go bash in the skull of another boy who had stolen something from him
he points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table and snaps his fingers
scarface hands them to him
now it just so happened this boy was a friend of mine
i did not want to do this terrible thing
but when you come from the streets you have no choice
he carefully knots his tie in the mirror
i worked very hard for years to get past that life
so i would not have to do these terrible things
so i would have a choice
he turns and smiles at his thick necked bodyguard
he gestures toward the mans holstered pistol i have people like you to do these things for me
he holds out his hand thick neck hands him the pistol
except that you dont
suddenly demidov pistol whips the man across the face
blood explodes from thick necks nose
he falls down to one knee clutching his face in pain
scarface looks on in fear
demidov calms himself almost as quickly as he lost his temper
he drops the gun on the carpet and steps back in disgust
if you did your job properly i wouldnt have to get my hands dirty you piece of shit
he turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands
heels clicking on the cobblestones cara strides quickly along the palazzo vendramin en route to the cipriani
she checks her watch
then walks faster
she passes a smallish transporto via cargo supply boat floating in the lagoon beside the palazzo
cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant
from a second story suite of rooms the englishman peers through the curtains
he sees cara seat herself at a table between the pool and the lagoon
his eyes settle on the transporto
workers step on and off carrying fresh linens into the hotel
he leaves the window
there is a small cabin on the deck
inside the cabin ackerman goyal a videographer a signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics officer huddle
ackerman stares out the tinted window
ackermans pov he can just see cara sitting at the table
fanning herself with a newspaper cara discreetly evaluates the men in her sight lines
venetian civic leaders chatting by the bar tourists reading maps
over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of young lovers drunk in each others grasp in the pool
she turns away
squinting ackerman evaluates his placements
a waiter idling at his bussing station his eyes roaming the palazzo
a vaporetto captain who quietly turns away requests for a ride into st
marks square his finger to his ear
an older couple sitting a few seats away from cara
and an agente di polizia police patrolman loud and jovial joking with passersby while quietly checking his earpiece
he speaks into the air
from the speakers eh we do not know any further
pressing a button you know what we know
the video camera swivels to follow a man elegantly dressed with trim hair who swiftly approaches caras table
standing up ackerman holds his hand up
into the speaker hold
wait for my signal
cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant man approaching
the waiter walks quickly toward caras table
the elegant man is frank
ackerman stares at the monitor with franks face on it
hes quietly furious
what is that fool doing in the middle of my operation
cara stares slack jawed at frank
he has given himself a complete make over
pearces suit fits him well
he looks terrific
cara notices before quickly recovering her composure
time for alexander and me to meet face to face
quietly i dont know what youre talking about
please go id like to have a quiet coffee
frank sits at the table with cara and eats a cashew
ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker
frustrated move off
the undercover waiter quickly moves away from caras table
ackerman stares at the monitor which captures caras angry expression
talking to the screen get rid of him
defiantly frank pulls his chair in closer to cara
he signals to a different thin waiter
to the waiter caffe per favore
frank turns back to cara who calls out cameriere
no caffe for signor
contradicting her with milk
she stares at him
do you want to be dead
not particularly but im tired of being afraid
ive been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and ive decided im finished
frank pulls out a gitane cigarette
he lights it smoking while he talks
when i first saw the name i got scared alexander pearce
he even sounds like some super cool master criminal with russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend
he probably works out
he might own a pizza shop on the side for all i know
frank frowns at the cigarette
these are disgusting
goyal is seated at the communication station
on the monitor frank is settled in opposite cara
hes not going anywhere
ackerman peers directly out the window as if hes going to see something different
put lipetti in
tell him to play it like hes dealing with a rowdy guest escort him out
cara looks all around
no sign of any suitor approaching
close on the hands of the thin waiter who sprinkles pepper carefully presumably onto a dish
he then platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder
frank you have no idea what youre sticking your nose into
but im doing it anyway
alexander pearce nearly got me killed
it was his idea right
he told you to pick out some random sap on the train to take a bullet for him didnt he
frank works himself up drawing courage from his anger
well im not playing the role anymore
im going to confront him
hes supposed to meet you here isnt he
im going to tell him exactly what i think of him
another macho idiot
to the waiter conto per favore
frank leans in
whats the lure cara
obviously not his character
is it the money
whats any of that worth if youre getting shot at and you could go to jail
im leaving frank
hes smooth right
he probably has mistresses in every european city too
its really a shame youve scared him off she tosses some euros on the table
the two of you make a nice couple
the thin waiter arrives with a platter
he sets it down in front of cara
the undercover waiter now moves toward the table with a grim expression
the thin waiter removes the platter
cara looks down
spelled out in salt and pepper on the plate is the following cara no sooner reads it than the thin waiter who we now see is the englishman
blows on the platter scattering the salt and pepper granules to the wind
what the hell
as frank looks up
the englishman has already turned away but the undercover waiter is moving quickly toward caras table
the undercover waiter picks up speed changing course slightly
we see hes after the englishman who is about to enter the restaurant kitchen
then frank steps in front of the undercover waiter mistaking him for pearce
is this him
ackerman slaps the cabin table
the undercover waiter tries to move past frank
you hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you
not much of a tough guy are you
frank shoves him back
where i come from we dont treat women like that
frank grabs the undercover waiters collar with unaccustomed strength
cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant
she walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward the palazzo vendramin
in the midst of his scuffle frank looks around and realizes shes gone
the undercover waiters earpiece falls out in the melee
frank sees it and hesitates
maybe this guy isnt pearce
getting up from his seat in the cabin ackerman gestures for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock
on the monitor frank looks around and sees cara fifty feet away
walking with purpose
that goddamn fool
ackerman rubs his face and squats down frustrated beyond measure
what do we do with him
throw him in the lagoon
frank brushes past tables hits the street and runs down the palazzo toward cara
cara says nothing
she just shoots frank an angry glance and climbs onto a vaporetto water taxi
frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away
suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him
two of ackermans men are right there
they pin his arms forcefully
you can come with us now
frank looks at the two big men on either side of him
then at cara disappearing over the water
the fight drains out of him and he doesnt resist
frank sits alone in the sparsely furnished windowless room
a table two chairs
a large mirror on the wall
frank straightens his slightly disheveled suit as if hes been dumped here without ceremony
he glances in the mirror periodically suspicious
the door opens and ackerman enters
he pulls up one of the chairs and gestures for frank to do the same
he looks frank up and down
its a good fit
ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his interpol credentials
tosses them on the table for frank to see
better than the alternative i suppose
frank remains defiant
he jerks his head toward the mirror confidently
whos watching from behind there
ackerman looks over at the mirror taken off guard by the question
he stands and goes to the mirror lifts it off its hooks and sets it on the floor
nothing but plain wall underneath
ackerman sits back down
frank is a little bit chastened
you have a vivid imagination
i havent needed it lately
youre in for a disappointment
im not alexander pearce
i know that
frank looks up
since the beginning
frank stares at him blankly
i want to show you something frank
ackerman leads frank through the maze of desks and police
various members of the task force follow their progress
jean luc jones etc
they arrive at a central intel area where goyal sits in front of several computer monitors
he looks up as ackerman and frank arrive
to goyal pull up the cid academy graduating class for
goyal raises an eyebrow but does as hes told
a few moments later a photo of police recruits in uniform comes up on screen
take a good look
frank peers at the screen
he spots the instructor ackerman seven years younger
take a look at the second row
insert close up on the screen
frank examines the second row
one of the young women is
her hair is pulled back
she looks more the determined police cadet than the sexy siren
but its definitely her
he is dumbfounded
weve been watching you this entire time
dawning you saw those men try to kill me and you didnt intervene
im trying to apprehend a major criminal
im not a babysitter
frank grows angry
i want to speak with somebody at the american embassy
im going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an american citizen
lets see what my government has to say about that
jones clears her throat from a chair across the room
were aware of the situation mr
but we take a long view of these things
fortunately you are unhurt
frank is incredulous
then ill go to the press
ill tell the entire story to the new york times
i dont think youll do that
because i dont think you want to see caras entire career destroyed
frank falls silent
ackerman puts an arm around his shoulder and leads him away from the others
frank stands on a balcony overlooking a waterway
ackerman emerges with two cups of espresso
hands one to frank
women like cara dont come along very often
in my case they dont come along at all
shes the worst combination stunning looks and a brilliant mind
if shes so smart how did she get caught up with pearce
it started out as a straightforward placement
cara younger poses as an art student sketching a sculpture in the anticollegio
we ran her deep cover to build a case against pearce
he hired her as an assistant
she turns her face and smiles at an unseen man
the wind blows in caras hair
she sits on the top deck
a mans hand passes her a drink as he walks by
she smiles at him again we do not see his face
then she began missing drops
omitting important details
ackerman turns to frank
she was no longer with us
she was with him
ackerman finishes his espresso
she explains it now as the confusion of her new life outside the academy
that i misread her capacity for this kind of work
then why are you still using her
shes all i have mr
you think shell turn him in this time
i dont know
goyal walks up behind ackerman waiting patiently for a moment to interrupt him
i do know however that you are very smitten with her
frank looks back at him evenly
its not just me is it
ackerman acknowledges the point with the barest of nods
goyal signals that ackerman has a phone call
the principal apartment of a venetian palazzo looking out over the grand canal
cara holds her cell phone to her ear as she walks
where have you been
ackerman on the phone at his office
have you got him
you mean the idiot who ruined our operation
have you got him
ackerman glances out the window at frank
cara is relieved
its your own fault
we never should have endangered a civilian
you should have put an agent into place
there was no time
besides pearce is too smart for that he would have spotted the agent a mile away
he didnt spot me
ackerman smiles bitterly
apparently he didnt have to
cara doesnt answer
ackerman regrets the jibe
he steps into a hallway where its quiet
im sorry cara
that was uncalled for
on her face as she listens to him
im on edge because of our failure today
if only the american hadnt messed everything up
i felt sure pearce would show up today
what makes you think he didnt
ackermans face lights up
ackerman strides into the room calling for attention
okay everybody listen up
jones quinn jean luc and the rest of the team assemble
goyal has frank with him dragging him around like a lost puppy dog
we have a location and time for the next meet
we have to move fast pearces own villa
why would he risk going back there
he must know wed be watching
perhaps hes nostalgic
i doubt that
maybe theres something of value still there
he left in a hurry after all
call in a search team
we searched the place after the raid last year
if theres anything hidden there only pearce knows where it is
he picks up his coat
we need to get agents in place all around the villa
frank speaks up unexpectedly
if youre all around his house will he show up
a dozen heads turn to look at him
if i needed your advice mr
taylor id ask
frank shrinks down in his chair
ackerman turns back to the rest of the room
establish a wide perimeter
well keep our distance and wire the entire villa for video surveillance
the meeting breaks up
everybody jumps into action
on quinn as he slips out a side door
a standard hotel room no lavish suite this time
cara stands in front of the mirror
her shirt is unbuttoned as she works to attach a tiny microphone to her bra
the tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over
a knock on her hotel room door
frank enters the room
sees her half dressed im sorry
come over here
i need your help
in an echo of their first meeting on the train but without the false flirtation she turns to him and hands him a piece of tape
their eyes meet
a flicker of a smile passes between them
franks fingers are perfectly steady this time as he helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt
ackerman told me everything
she takes a deep breath
im sorry frank
theres no apology necessary
he steps back from her
she smooths her blouse
turns to him
re the wire how do i look
like the most beautiful woman on earth
the complete honesty and directness of his compliment takes her by surprise
shes strangely moved by it
she brushes her hand affectionately over his cheek
when will you go home
ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the danieli show up
im the only one who can identify them
something occurs to frank
did you tell him to keep an eye on me
busted i told him to make sure you were safe until this was over
a little pleased at her concern
you shouldnt worry about me
what about you
what about me
what are you going to do
she takes a beat then puts her game face on
a light mist
the sound of water lapping against the shore
the scene is familiar
almost identical to the night of the raid just over a year ago
then a wind picks up and blows the mist clear
reveal an undercover policeman with an earpiece walking a dog a block away
on a rooftop three blocks away a sniper with a scope
inside an apartment a female agent with binoculars scans the empty street below
on the corner two blocks down is a village church
ackerman and his team have set up a make shift surveillance outpost here
the high tech equipment looks incongruous with the thousand year old stone walls and worn oak pews
a bank of monitors reveals various views of the inside and outside of alexanders villa
frank hovers in the background behind ackerman
he notices ackerman has a copy of the international herald tribune
you all read the same newspaper
its a good paper
and sold throughout the world
makes the classified ads especially useful
ackerman sits down next to frank as if he were an old pal instead of a quasi captive
since the internet came about hardly anybody uses old school methods like that to communicate anymore
except alexander pearce
no lines to tap
no signals to intercept
admiringly hes a very clever man your double
i look forward to meeting him
so do i
a patrol boat circles in the canal behind the villa
one of ackermans italian agents is at the wheel
he sees a flat bottomed black boat motoring toward him
a light from the boat shines in his eyes
in italian youll have to turn around sir
theres been a chemical spill in this area fwwwap
a silenced bullet strikes him in the forehead
the agent topples into the water with a gentle splash
the black boat steers around the rudderless patrol boat and heads toward the villa
binocular pov a lone female figure walks down the cobblestone streets toward the villa
shes approaching the destination now
the black boat slips underneath some moorings
a gloved hand tosses a grappling hook up to a beam ten feet overhead
the boat is tied off
silently a masked figure begins to climb from the boat up into the bottom floor of the villa in the semi darkness
pearces entry hall
cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside
track from screen to screen as we follow cara moving through the deserted rooms
everything is cold and lifeless
like a palace that has been turned into a museum
while everyone is focused on the monitors showing caras progress frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side
it shows the lower floor of the house
points whos that
they all turn to look
a male figure his face masked approaches the lens of the surveillance camera
the feed shuts off
ackerman barks at a technician
get it back on line
the surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons etc
was that pearce
how did he know there would be a camera
another monitor goes dark
hes taking out the entire surveillance system stop him
hes cutting the feed at the source
frank looks anxiously at cara on the monitor climbing the stairs
she disappears from view as well
everybody starts talking
how can one man move through the house that fast
overlapping what should we do
they quiet down
ackerman turns to the tech
do we still have audio
the tech nods
turn it up
everybody in the church stands stock still
staring at the dark monitors
caras footsteps click up the stairs and then slow
they move tentatively across the floor
we hear a thump
a door or a heavy footstep
caras breathing gets louder
theres somebody else in the building
click clack click
she takes a few steps
on frank concerned
on ackerman calm
cara stands in the center of the large room
she catches sight of her reflection in the large floor to ceiling window
theres a movement in the doorway behind her
she spins around to face
he and his two men have removed their masks
sorry to disappoint you my dear
he steps toward her
everybody strains to hear what is happening
whispers who is that
how are you this evening
a tremor in her voice fine thank you
the accent is russ shh
quietly its ivan demidov
jones looks at him
uncertainly not possible
cara takes a step back toward the window
youre waiting for someone ms
cara doesnt reply
you havent seen alexander pearce in a long time yes
im sure it will be a touching reunion
if you dont mind well keep you company while you wait
anxious what are we going to do
were going to wait for alexander pearce
just like them
snipers pov cara has maneuvered close enough to the window that she is visible
as they approach demidov and his two men come into range as well
into his radio mic shes brought them to the window
everybody is listening
there are three of them
on franks face he looks around at the cops desperately hoping somebody will do something
they all look to ackerman
demidov circles cara dangerously close
not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting
he loses track of time easily
i have a hard time believing that
pause perhaps hes already here somewhere
even watching us
what do you think
a long silence
the tension grows
then we hear
everyone in the room flinches
i have a feeling he is around here somewhere
and if he cares about you
if he wants to see your lovely face again
he should show up before its too late
another slap more vicious than the first
this time cara cries out in pain
goyal turns to ackerman
hes here somewhere
jean luc looks to his colleagues jones quinn
then turns to ackerman
every one of them is about to burst
we have to do something we have to wait
yes but harsh shes my agent
shes my responsibility
a muffled thud
cara groans and we hear her body hit the floor
that wasnt a slap
every cop in the room is clenching his weapon
desperate for the order to move
to jump in and stop this
they are all looking to ackerman to give the order
as the silence wears on even jones starts to waver
she speaks quietly to ackerman
what if he doesnt come
ackerman doesnt respond
the lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before
suddenly goyal notices
frank runs for all hes worth
panting for breath
frank bursts through the front door
races to the steps without hesitating
cara lies on her side at demidovs feet
blood trickles from the side of her mouth
her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half askew
then they suddenly come into focus as she sees
a figure walks into the room
he stand motionless in the doorway surprisingly calm
leans down to cara good news
he loves you
demidovs men take frank by either arm and roughly drag him forward
cara lifts her head with an effort
thats not alexander pearce
demidov ignores her and walks up to frank
you know mr
pearce i thought i was finished with this sort of thing
but in your case ive been forced to make an exception
he holds out his hand and one of his thugs gives him a pistol and a silencer
he is not alexander pearce
demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel
the thugs push frank to his knees
but hes barely paying attention to them
his eyes are locked on cara
she meets his gaze
for a moment its as if nothing else in the world exists but the two of them
he may only be a hapless tourist but he loves her
hes the one here willing to give up his life to save hers
im so sorry
nothing to be sorry for
demidov finishes attaching the silencer
he points the gun at the back of franks head
good bye mr
at this moment cara fills her lungs and screams ackerman
she bends her head toward her cleavage yelling into the tiny microphone
demidov is taken off guard
her scream echoes through the arched church
ackerman gives the order
snipers pov demidov and his gun wielding henchmen standing over frank and cara
the huge plate glass window shatters as the high powered bullet slams through it
everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass
scarface is blown off his feet
his body hits the ground next to frank
his gun skitters across the floor
demidov looks from the window to cara with cold fury in his eyes shes the one who has called in the artillery
he raises his pistol toward her point blank
the gunshot takes him by surprise
he turns to see
frank holds scarfaces smoking pistol in his hand
demidov just has time to process the fact that frank is the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes and he topples
demidovs other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly and makes a run for it
glass flies everywhere
frank throws his body over cara to protect her
a short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other plate glass windows explode
wood splinters fill the air as furniture is torn apart
one of the snipers bullets finds its target and the bodyguard goes down
frank remains on top of cara shielding her until long after everything has fallen silent
ackerman and his team approach guns drawn
undercover agents converge as well closing the perimeter
frank and cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a sea of broken glass
just getting over the shock of being alive
are you all right
she looks at him for a long moment then breaks out into a smile
i did well to choose you on the train
franks turn to smile
he looks around the room at the carnage
you didnt get to arrest alexander pearce
he never showed up
frank slides closer to her
gently carefully he slips his hands into caras cleavage
surprised cara starts to pull back but he puts a finger to her lips
looks at him questioningly
but she doesnt protest as his fingers move toward her bra
and grasp the tiny microphone
with a sharp tug he rips it free
he tosses it across the room
then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear a british accent youre wrong
she straightens up
her heart skips a beat
she covers her mouth
her eyes mist over with tears
she runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement
like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face
her mind reels
then their lips meet
like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert
finally she pulls away and looks at him
you said id told so many lies you wouldnt believe me even if i did tell the truth
this was the only way to convince you
pause the truth is that i love you
all that matters is that you believe me
she stares into his eyes for a beat
finally looking at her without a trace of deception
they hear voices on the stairs below
frank holds up a finger to her wait
frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built in bookshelf
it swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor
frank removes the fitted floor boards
there is a sophisticated bio metric lock just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie
frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open
track with ackerman up the stairs
he leads the team into the penthouse
he looks around at the mess as the agents fan out
cara leans on franks arm as she heads for the exit
i want the paramedics to make sure youre all right she blows right past him
ackerman calls out after her
turns to face him
ackerman looks down for a moment ashamed
well talk about this later
no we wont
theres nothing to talk about
i dont work for you anymore
she walks past him
for a moment ackerman and frank look at one another
youre free to go
he looks at frank with a measure of begrudging respect
it seems i underestimated you
american accent it seems you did mr
with that frank steps out of the room
ackermans attention is distracted by sir
take a look at this
goyal has found the safe
ackerman comes over and looks
insert close up the only thing in the safe is a single goyal signals to one of the techs
he opens a laptop on the desk and they plug in the flash drive to check the contents
while they are doing this ackerman bends to inspect the he was here
jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen
unless im mistaken
he left the money behind
a mistake perhaps
how much is there
goyal scans down to a total
looks like million
thats no mistake
walks over thats his tax bill
she holds out her hand to the tech who has just removed the flash drive
ill take that
she slips it into her pocket then turns to ackerman
ackerman has moved away
hes staring down at the ground from behind he looks like a man defeated
with the funds recovered i dont think theres going to be any appetite from our side to continue this investigation
ackermans shoulders are slumped staring at demidovs dead body on the ground
jones puts a hand on his back consoling him
im sorry you didnt get your man
then ackerman turns
a big smile on his face
oh but i did get my man ms
she realizes he was after demidov all along
ackerman nods to goyal a twinkle in his eye
goyal you may place mr
quinn under arrest now
quinn is taken completely off guard
before he can move goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs
to quinn what
you thought i didnt know
you were unwittingly quite helpful without you mr
demidov might have escaped justice
he turns to jones with a smile
after all demidov wasnt a target of this investigation was he
ackerman walks over to the window as quinn is led away
ackermans pov cara and frank walk toward the canal in the street below
a water taxi approaches
theres something i dont understand
how did pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing
and where did he go
ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back
for the briefest of moments frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect
frank gives him a little smile
cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat
close on ackerman his eyes narrow
for a moment he doesnt move
then in spite of himself a small smile creeps over his face too
because pearce was cleverer than all of us
cara and frank step on board
the driver starts the engine
he turns to reveal
that he is the englishman weve seen throughout the movie
he and frank look at one another for a moment
million dollars worth of surgery and thats the face you chose
english accent its good to see you too
they embrace warmly
cara is in disbelief realizing just how completely frank alexander has planned things out
she casts one last glance backwards
you really think theyll just give up
the americans have their money
i left it all for them
what about demidovs money
smiles you have to save something for your pension
the englishman opens the door to the cabin for them
a bottle of crystal champagne and two glasses are set out for them
frank leads cara in and offers her a glass
instead she slips into his arms and presses against him
they begin to kiss
camera stays discreetly behind as they pull away from us the water taxi swinging out into the grand canal
as it recedes from view the vaporettos tail lamps shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of venice
a city for lovers
