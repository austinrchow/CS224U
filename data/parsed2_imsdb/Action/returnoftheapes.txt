return of the apes terry hayes unproduced by terry hayes first draft no atmosphere no life nothing
just a web of lights a billion stars hang in a velvet void
the only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind
the light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet
we see ragged continents and oceans wreathed in cloud
this is earth rise
our world spins slowly in space a thing of beauty of awesome majesty
in all this nothingness life
we push in on the planet in to the americas
the wind grows louder a broken down pick up bumps into a god forsaken villagea cluster of adobe houses blinding flurries of dust and sand
the pick up stops in front of a crumbling church
a man in his s gets out carrying a medical bag
this is the doctor
shes very young a south american indian lying on a bed in a corner of one of the houses
she is in the final throes of childbirth a sheet draped over her loins
the doctor works between her legs encouraging her in spanish
the local priest not long out of the seminary crouches at her side counting off the beads of a rosary
he looks like he is about to pass out
he lifts the child from her loins but it makes no sound
we dont see the baby just the shock on the doctors face
the mother struggles up to see her child
the doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it
he thrusts the bundle into the priests hands
in spanish dead the child is dead
we hold on the mothers anguished face
dissolve to off the roof of a tall hospital building
as it rises up into the night we see a red cross painted on its side
its an air ambulance
the chopper turns away
the manhattan skyline every skyscraper a blaze of lights opens up behind it
the chopper swoops over the brooklyn bridge and into the night
winters coming on every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold
the helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately tended lawn
surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great university
two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a stainless steel casket onto a gurney
they wheel it fast towards one of the buildings
as they go through the front doors we hold on a sign etched into the stone slide a long cylindrical key into the stainless steel casket
we pull back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed uncontaminated room
a group of people in lab coats scientists and researchers stare through the glass walls
a young technician working at a console keyboards in a series of commands
the top of the steel casket swings open
clouds of white gas stream out whatevers inside has been nitrogen cooled
the gas clears
lying inside is the body of a newborn child except that the baby has the skin the face and the features of a man of eighty
the scientists and the researchers react shocked
one of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby
in its fingers it holds a long steel scalpel
this is the highest tech autopsy youve ever seen
the scalpel drives down about to open the chest cavity but not from the babys chest its in glass vials exploding as white hot flames consume them
a plastic gloved lab assistant silhouetted against the flames is emptying hospital waste into a furnace
he slams the door shut
he turns we see his face
hes in his os handsome in a rough hewn way a strong jaw and a muscular body
theres a cool intelligence in his eyes but a two day beard and a worn out uniform make him look like a man who between youth and middle age lost
and so he has
his name is will he takes a steel trolley wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of sight
features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy
shes in her s attractive long hair left loose on her shoulders an air of authority about her
her name is billie rae diamond
she is a professor of biology
we tilt down from the screen
it hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory overhead lights rows and rows of wire animal cages
moving down death row feeding the lab animals is will robinson
the exact cause of death is still unknown
what is certain were dealing with something weve never seen before
every organ in the body is affected
superimposed over diamonds face is a three dimensional computer generated graphic of the babys body
will forgets about what hes doing
he walks towards the screen
we push in on it
screeds of new data appear vascular system
atrophied neurological function
senile dementia we hold on wills eyes he stares at it
billy rae diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing
about forty scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly lit lecture hall
diamond is even more impressive in person she is tall and gracious but you dont become a professor at harvard at her age without having an iron will and a
she speaks with great authority the baby in question michael james flanagan she points at the computer generated graphic on a huge screen was born at new york hospital yesterday
but the center for disease control in atlanta has received similar reports from a village in bolivia two cities in australia seven countries in europe a cluster of cases in
namibia and mexico
forty two cases in all
as she speaks pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations
they dot their way across the entire globe
dr diamond turns to face her audience like michael flanagan they were full term babies
two hundred and seventy eight days since conception and yet by all reasonable medical standards they have completed their entire life cycle
they have gone from conception to death not in three score years and ten but in slightly less than nine months
michael flanagan died of old age
silence as diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it
on a balcony high above another man is taking notes
he sits alone almost hidden in shadow
its will robinson
will crouches in front of a row of self storage units on the edge of town
its night the place is deserted
he slips a rusted key into a padlock
snapl the key breaks
he grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it
he slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers
the padlock springs open
weave a web in a corner of the storage unit
a work light hangs from the ceiling
will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago
he puts together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks
on tape i would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor
we push in on wills face as he listens to himself
have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues
im privileged to also call them my friends a shadow of pain crosses his face
he shuts off the tape and sits motionless
homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a coming storm
across the road the first drops of rain splatter against the white house
a string of government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in front of the west portico
from inside we hear a mans voice well spoken authoritative theres no mistake youre sure
diamond sits in the presidents study book lined walls a fire in the hearth
a group of men sit on the sofasthe surgeon general the chief of staff the national security advisor the secretaw of health
a table is littered with graphs end files
weve got five thousand cases now mr president
thats in three weeks
the number is doubling every hundred and sixty eight hours
the president stands near a window half in shadow the firelight playing across his face
hes in his s but the strain of office makes him look older
thats a geometric progression sir
in three months thereil be over seven million cases
after that we hit the wall she pushes a thick bound volume across the table
according to this there wont be a live birth on the planet
the president looks at her for a moment
then he reaches down and picks up the bound volume
its hundreds of pages of numbers and projections
these are just computer projections species dont disappear that fast
tell that to the dinosaurs sir
he looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them
what date when exactly do we hit this wall
six months and twenty one days
the president keeps looking out the window
cant somebody tell me what exactly are we dealing with
is it a virus or what
we dont know sir
the president turns to the chief of staff
whatever they need bob anything
harry truman put together the manhattan project you understand
the chief of staff nods his head yes
softly a world without children its inconceivable
and what about the rest of us what do we do
just sit and watch our species die
will the last person to leave the planet turn out the lights
finally a young woman the white house press secretary speaks
were going to have to manage the public
right now the truth may be inoperative of course were going to have to manage itl were going to have to manage a whole lot of things
but cant we take at least one moment to be human
he looks around the room
we hold on their somber faces
through the window the neon sign of a gas station
this is wills place he lives alone a bed in the corner run down furniture dishes in the sink
the kitchen table has been turned into a desk will sits at an old computer surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks
he stares at the screen the notes and equations are blurred
hes been at this so long he can barely focus
he rubs his hand across his eyes
a small mewing sound
will turns to an alcove in the corner a cat lies in a basket panting
will goes to her
shes giving birth the first of her new born kittens lies next to her
will strokes the mothers head looking at the miracle of new life
he puts his fingers in a water bowl about to moisten the mothers mouth
then he stops
he looks again at the kitten theres two of them now
a beat as he just stares softly jesus christ
through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower
whoever she is shes got a great figure
the sound of a doorbell
the shower door opens diamond sticks her head out
she looks at a clock its almost midnight
a video screen monitors the front door
on it we see will his hair tousled an old overcoat buttoned to the neck a battered briefcase under his arm
diamond a towel around her shoulders hair dripping picks up the phone
who is it
i think you have the wrong house
i work at the department
he turns and looks straight into the camera
instinctively diamond covers her breasts
she looks at him recognition dawns
will and diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse wooden floors and beautiful rugs
diamond doesnt wear any make up just jeans and an oversized shirt
she looks even more beautiful
it does nothing to ease wills nerves
hes got his briefcase open in front of him speaking from sheaves of notes and papers
interrupting hold on how do you know about the case load
the governments trying to manage this theyve withheld that information
the internet doctor
its a highway you can ride it anywhere you want
i got into the center for disease control
i had a look at their raw data
do you know what youre doing
this is the white house were talking about
heated no its a disease and it doesnt come any worse than this thats what were talking about
ive listened at the lab i think i know where youre looking
bacterias mostly but theres a strong push into the retro viruses
youre wrong doctor
really and i thought i was arrogant
but then im just a professor
no virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex
i can think of one
sure it can start in pockets but it never stays there
this thing does
it only affects women of child bearing age
what its so smart it can recognize motherhood
i dont think so
no this is into the very heart of what we are
this is genetic
this is part of the dna
a hundred thousand genes make up human dna that really narrows it down
as a matter of fact it does
theres only one part of the dna thats passed exclusively through women
thirty seven genes the oldest part of the human organism realizing the mitochondrial dna
over the years theres been speculation not all of it crazy either that somehow it triggers aging he slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from scientific journals across the table
she doesnt pay them any attention shes thinking
you realize what youre saying dont you
a bacteria i think wed get it for sure
a virus youd have to say weve got a chance
but say youre right
the mitochondrial dna thats so far out on the frontier we can barely see it
like i said it doesnt get any worse than this
she keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table
are you okay
youre pregnant arent you
do you want a drink coffee a sandwich or something
no im fine thanks
watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered briefcase
its late at night
will clutches his briefcase under his arm heading home
a bitter wind blows out of the north
he looks a lonely and forlorn figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the streetlights
its just an idea bob
all were doing is taking it for a walk around the block
a man in his s distinguished diplomatic intercedes
there was a lot of work done on it in the os
i cant recall the details but someone had the idea that mitochondriel dna was like a genetic memory
if you could unlock it you could physically travel back down it
through evolution like a time machine
wowl those s man
im really sorry i missed them
everyone diamond included laughs
they hang on the wall of a tiny room not an office just a hole in the wall will has turned into his own
he sits at a table making notes
a knock diamond enters
i thought youd like to know were looking at mitochondrial dna thanks for telling me
is that you
she points at a man in his s standing on the deck in one of the photos will nods
is that where you went to school
will hesitates we sense that he doesnt really want to answer
then i did some post graduate work
i never really finished
something in the way will says it some sense of loss makes diamond pause
she recovers and looks in her wallet
she pulls out a photograph and hands it to will
it shows a small sailing boatgaff rigged and a varnished hull
its a kestrel i havent seen one of those in years
shes a beautiful boati my grandfather left it to me
i dont sail it much any more its too hard to find a foretd hand
what about your husband doesnt he sail
i dont know i havent met him yet
i wanted a baby but im thirty four years old
sooner or later you realize that somewhere along the way youve missed the man youve been waiting for
what did you do ask a friend
i thought of it
i went to a clinic
not exactly romantic but it worked
pauses good idea bad timing
how many people have you put on the mdna
thats all i can spare
its just a theory one of dozens of theories
will looks away in disgust
what is it with you its not just science is it
why are you so passionate about this
i know im right
its a mutation
a hundred thousand years its probably been lying there shifting weaving into the mdna
you either go back and change evolution or you engineer it out
seven peopleyou might as well shoot peas at a dam
you havent answered my question why so passionate
the questions not relevant
the only thing im interested in is the science
he turns back to his work
we hear the door close as diamond leaves
white space age is being erected on the lawn
workmen are unloading the nasa trucks
we pull back through a high window of the biology building
a woman stands there looking out
her name is kris mcquade
this is her office you want to tell me whats going on
she turns and looks at diamond sitting on the other side of the desk dont ask kris id have to lie and i dont want to do that to my
best friend the rumor is youve done something really big
they say the defense department is taking it over
diamond just sits there staring straight ahead
finally okay okay im sorry i asked
so what about this guy whats he done
he hasnt done anything im just interested
ten thousand employment records ive got on file and you want to know about a lab assisant
the smartest assistant ive ever known
what he can mop and fart at the same time
she picks up pages from a computer printer including a copy of wills photo i
hes handsome at least ill say a thought strikes her jesus youre not interested in him like that are you
no but hes the most unbelievable smelling man
youre pregnant obviously your hormones have gone crazy
what exactly does he smell like
searching for the right word wholesome
of course he does thats the lysol
diamond laughs but mcquade barely notices it
shes leafing through wius file thats strange theres supposed to be a background sheet
family school all that shit
it must have gotten lost
before diamond can say anything a young man enters
hes mcquadas assistant
your secretarys on the line dr diamond
theres a call for you
tell her to take a message
its the new york times
what do they want
i think washingtons news management just went south
scores of television news vans are parked outsidedutch japanese and french reporters are doing stand ups live to air
we hear peter jennings of were standing by to go live to washington as events continue to unfold on this remarkable day
i dont think theres a person anywhere whos not sitting by a radio or television now
im told the president is on his way to the press room is totally empty just a young man on rollerblades
he skates effortlessly down the deserted avenue past tiffanys and the trump tower all silent now
my fellow americans
the rollerblader passes the cathedral of st john
the front doors are open
someone is playing the organ mozarts requiem
the rollerblader fades into the night
a sharp faced caretaker scruffy clothes and a limp escorts will into a vaulted basement
all we can see are silhouettestowers of crates racks of equipment
this used to be the basement of the psychology department
we just sort of stacked everything around em he flicks a switch the storage room floods with light
he points at two long iron cylinders like small submarines rigged up to a series of valves and pipes
they used em for experiments in sensory degradation deprivation sensory deprivation
yeah well whatever
now i know what a mole feels like lightly it feels like a fucking coffin thats what it feels like
other voices laugh
theyre all young and like the young they think theyll never die
hey fella what are you doing
ill be coming back ill need a key
the caretaker shrugs sure
will climbs out of the tank
one other thing dont tell anyone huh
who would i tell
they treat me like shit worse than shit
all work no appreciation
the phantom of harvard
someone should write a fucking musical about me
desk lamps glowing in an office
diamond and a team of researchers are working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers
heres another one mitochondrial dnaa map to the past
whos it by
same guy doctor robert plant
jesus what did this guy do write the book on it
who is he
its a scientific directory
the researcher flicks the pages and stops at plant
wow i thought your career was impressive
diamond looks up from her reading
degrees in medicine and microbiology
a phd at a member of the academy of sciences published twenty times by
where did he go as an undergraduate
on a scholarship
its late at night
the scientists and their staff are working around the clock
will wheels a trolley laden with bottles vials and catheters down a crowded corridor
diamond pushes through the people behind trying to catch up to him
scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them
will keeps walking heading for an elevator
diamond skirts around a knot of people
will hesitates one split second then keeps going
the elevator doors slide open
will steps in turns and hits a button
he watches diamond pushing towards him
for a moment their eyes meet
she comes closer
the doors slide shut
she sits behind her desk listening to the chief of campus security
the equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs
it includes a range of genetic material hands her an inventory weve checked all the buildings your team is using hes not in any of them
what about hie house
he asked his landlady to look after his cat
she hasnt seen him for three days
theres a make shift bed and a hot plate with a battered saucepan
next to it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials
will is sitting in front of three computers running in parallel data and equations reel across them
the caretaker comes out of the shadows carrying two mugs of thick coffee
he puts one down next to will you wanna tell me what exactly youre doing
looking for a date
the caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the screen whats wrong with a calendar
these are chemical sequences they represent human genes
by following a trail of mutations i can date them
im trying to find out when a major change occurred in something called the mitochondrial dna
the mitochondrial dna
well that makes sense
but will barely hears it
suddenly hes leaning forward keyboarding in complex commands
the caretaker watches him youve found it
he has illustrations of two long chain molecules on the screen
he moves them together
aa they overlap we see theyre not identical the tail of one kicks upwarda
will starel at it softly yeah ive found it
so whats the date
will presses a key
faster than the eye can follow the first long chain molecule starts to shift and mutate
finally it resolves itself into the second molecule
will looks at a graph on the side of the screen the best computer science can do
one hundred and two thousand years ago
sort of what i figured give or take a day or two
diamond is poring through scientific articles written by will
she flicks a page theres a photo of will years younger surrounded by three colleagues
hes got his arm around one of them an attractive young woman
diamond lifts the photo looking at it more closely
she starts to read the caption
we push in on it and hold on the words
swooping and soaring through a weird landscape of towering cliffs tumbling streams and primordial forest
theres something unreal about it we pull back to reveal theyre computer generated images playing on the screens in the basement
the caretaker has pulled up a chair
he and will are watching the images generated by a cd rom
this is someones version of the prehistoric world
im interested in the geography the atmosphere that sort of stuff
where are we
africa thats where mankind started
will keeps looking at the strange images
the caretaker gets to his feet ill see you in the morning
the caretaker limps towards the door
will looks up thank you for helping me i mean
it sounds like youre leaving or something
i just wanted to say it thats all
the caretaker keeps looking at him what exactly are you doing
youre a bit old to try and make your mark arent you
anyway nobody listens to people like us
fate can be kind sometimes a man gets a second chance
do you know what its like to be ridiculed to have your ideas thrown back in your face
and that was the easy part
i guess thats what im doing i want to prove that i was right
youre lying to me
what do you mean
you are going somewhere
i dont know where it is
im not even sure i can imagine it
good luck though
i hope you find whatever it is youre looking for
no point in getting you breakfast huh
will shakes his head no
they smile at each other
the caretaker turns and goes
diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk
her secretary stands in the doorway ive got eleanor wilkins on the phone
she runs the archives at berkeley
into phone ms wilkins
we push in tight on diamonds face as she listens
anxiety and alarm register on it
the security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the campus
researchers and scientists have gathered in the office rumors are flying
everyone turns diamond stands in the doorway to her office
she looks at demaupassant
you were right luc
that work you remembered from berkeley he was the one that did it
he said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail
within every one of us is the history of our race
its imprinted on our genes like a map
anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back down it
through the womb
through time and space she looks at them all thats what hes doing
hes going back
hes going to try and change evolution
is that possible
he was the best of his generation
he thinks so
hes got the genetic material for the key
all he needs are flotation tanks
the valves are open warm water is pouring into the tanks
will sits next to the rack of medical equipment beads of sweat on his forehead
he slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter
he opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials
a cocktail of fluid minutely measured doses flows down the clear plastic towards his arm
the fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it
diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs
ahead a pair of swing doors a theorys one thing do you really think hell try it
hes spent fifteen years as a lab assistant
he lives in a two room walk up with a cat
no family no friends
whats theres left for him here
of course hell do it
they push through the doors into another corridor
will climbs up the side of the flotation tank
suddenly he stops a tremor a rippling wave passes from his feet to his head
its his muscles contracting
it wracks him with pain
he gasps at the intensity of it
the steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get in
will looks up the door twists and moves
his vision is starting to distort
he grabs the access hatch and swings through splashl he drops into the water
he closes the hatch
the steel door flies open
the security officer lowers a sledge hammer
diamond steps in end throws a light switch
will floats on his back the only sound is the rapid thump of his heartbeat
the water sloshes back and forth his muscles are going into spasms
we push along his body up to his face
his eyes roll back into his headl all we see are the whites of them
they shatter into a web of capillaries red mist swirls in front of him
it resolves itself into a web of interwoven tendrils the double helix of the dna molecule
will starts to travel through it will is morphing shedding cells were losing him in the warm dark fluid of the tank
its like the womb
his body seems to be disintegrating dissolving into it
water flows through the sockets where his eyes once were
his hollow mouth opens
from far away we hear him scream a primal scream
not a sound escapes
the security officer is about to try and open the hatch
the security officer turns diamond is holding the catheter in her hand
if we open the hatch i think well kill him
its too late its his journey hes going to have to take it
wills body is like a shadow almost one with the water growing less distinct by the moment
what is left of his face a strange shifting shape floats towards us
it melts completely into the water he spirals down a tunnel into a whirlpool of white light
as he hits it shatters into a million fragments of light
it looks like a comet wheeling through the heavens
a cosmic wind blows it forward
will is traveling through space and time diamond and the others are gathered around the computers
bob is working the keyboard
diamond is looking
through the piles of papers notes and star charts
everythings here he kept a record of every step
he can even tell the date forty hours after he arrives theres a solar eclipse
billie theres a note for you
diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen
she reads what is written i wont be here but if i solve this thing make sure you tell them billie
tell them it was robert plant doctor robert plant of uc berkeley
blaze through the heavens
they draw together changing and reconstituting into a shape we recognize the interwoven strands of dna molecules
the strands connect
a blast of light
its the rays of streaming into a cave
will lies in the fetal position bleeding from his nose and ears
the light grows stronger its dawn
will drags himself up and stumbles towards the entrance
we tilt up from him
he doesnt see it but we do prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock
will steps out of the cave
sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new plains and jungle and primordial forest
rising above it is a snow capped mountain that looks like kilamlnjlro
a ragged gash runs across the earth a rift valley
will stares at it
he raises his face to the sun
he did it
the first steps over and he did itl he looks down rising out of the valley is a tiny pillar of smoke
in the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp fire
will moves cautiously towards it
he stops several bodies terribly mangled lie on the ground
will turns one of them over hes got matted hair a heavy brow and a short muscular body
as primitive as he is theres no doubt of his species
he is a man
a paleolithic man
this was a hunting party scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of dead animals lie nearby
for a moment will thinks the hunters must have been torn apart by wild animals
then he looks up into the trees more bodies of the hunters
but no animal did this they hang from iron chains left there as some sort of trophy
or a warning
will is following a tiny trail through the forest
hes taken what is useful from the bodies of the hunters an otter skin water bag two short handled spears and a bed roll made from an animal pelt
he moves on deeper into the shadows of the forest
will splashes through the crystal water
he looks upstream a small lake
a flock of strange birds like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of pink and gold
he steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of over arching trees
we hold on his feet whip
he triggers something
a net of woven vines engulfs him
he drops the spears and bedroll
suddenly hes soaring through the air
he jerks to a halt hes a netted animal hanging high in the trees
the faces of two paleolithic men crouched on boughs stare at him
cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge
smoke curls up from fires
scores of stone age people man women and children turn and look
will roped and bound is being hauled into the encampment
the primitive people nervous but intrigued circle around him
they are dressed in skins and fur
talismans hang from their necks
the warriors carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads
it makes them look even more savage
will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit
a pile of ivory tusks lie nearby
the two captors jerk on the leash it stops will in front of a cave
hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and head of their totema saber toothed tiger
this is the tribe of the tiger
a man emerges from under its outstretched paws
hes in his late s proud and strong
his name is kip kena he is their leader
he and will look at one another
kip uses his hands to sign to will in the formal language of his race
will stares at him he has no idea what it means
kip tries a new tack he speaks
the sounds are rough and guttural but understandable kip where is your tribe
will pauses searching for an answer where do you start
he gives up
i dont have a tribe
a rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe
no man can live without a tribe
how would he hunt the mighty animals
who would keep his fire burning
i come from far away
im a traveler
what is traveler
is that a tribe
again wills at a loss
something catches kips eye
he reaches forward and rips the water bag out from under wills coat
the tribe reacts you carry things taken from our hunters
he turns away
will throws himself at him whackl a blow to the back of wills neck knocks him to his knees
he looks up two warriors have their spears raised about to plunge them into his chest
a sound like thunder its hooves
the warriors turn
will follows their gaze half an army mounted on horseback surges into the gorge they are heavily armed dressed in armor but its not their weaponry that astonishes will
these are apes
the tribes people scream in terror
they turn and run
the two warriors forget about will
he dives for cover in a pile of rocks
as he tears himself free of the ropes that bind him he looks out the apes charge in to the camp
at their head is a huge gorillarippling muscles and intelligent eyes deep set and yellow like pissholes in the snow
he wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver
his name is drak
he is the lord of the high rivers supreme commander of the ape army
on either side ride his elite praetorian guard
woo woo woo
kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head
its a bull roarer
the warriors of the tribe know its meaning they rally to kips side
armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between the apes and their panic driven people trying to buy them time to get into the cave
the sound of arrows
the apes carry triple barreled iron crossbows
short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down
dust and smoke swirls across the camp
kip and his men fighting all the way retreat towards the cave
a babys cry
will turns a toddler sits at a hearth left behind in the confusion
will half rises to his feet about to go for him
too late theres a blur of movement irt the trees
a tribe boy too young to be a warrior has come back for the child
out of the dust and smoke drak
foam flies from his horses mouth
hes seen the boy and the child
he locks what looks like a gatling gun tight under his huge bicep
will screams a warning
the boy turns he sees drak as he fires
a hail of iron darts twenty or more cut him and the child down
rage flashes in wills eyes
he scrambles over a boulder and rips a crossbow from a dead apes hand
he slides bolts into the barrels and grabs a lever with both hands you need the strength of an ape to cock it
a sound behind him little more than a whisper
he swings its an arrow
whackl it rips into his shoulder hurling him to the ground
ape infantry foot soldiers are coming into the gorge behind him
in their midst are three huge steam driven machines like iron erector sets
one is the claw one is the balls and the other is the flame
kip and his warriors have seen them too
they scramble into the cave
men and women are inside swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from tree trunks
other warriors caught outside run for the closing gap
on their heels is will still clutching the crossbow blood streaming from his wound
the doors are closing
will dives through the gap almost crushed slam
the doors fly shut
a huge cross beam drops into place
will sprawled in the dust looks up chaos
by torchlight the medicine man is tending the wounded children are screaming women and old people are clambering up a series of ledges
high above is a tiny slash of daylightanother entrance
from deep in the cave will hears the roar of some animal but he doesnt have time to think about it
the great wooden doors shudder from some mighty blow
the three machines are in place
the first of them has two huge stone balls suspended by chains from an overhead jib
an ape sits right on top operating it
the balls dance and swing wildly smash
they hit the door opening a hole
daylight streams in
kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high around the walls ready to attack when the apes pour in
a pair of huge iron jaws appear in the hole
this is the second of the apes machines the claw
another roar from the animal
will watches the claw reach in and grab the massive crossbeam
it snaps it like a twig
will gets to his feet and runs
he sees kip signal is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the cave turning it into a cage
he opens it
the stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open
the first of the ape cavalry charges in
a roar from the unseen animal
the apes horses catch the scent of it
they whinny in terror
will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage
the tribes totem is a living thing the saber toothed tiger ia three times the size of its bengal cousin a head the size of an ox and two ten
inch teeth curved down either side of its jaw
the horses are bucking and rearing
the tiger leaps towards the door heading for freedom
a dismounted ape raises his weapon
the tiger doesnt even break stride
one lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and flesh of the apes chest
will can smell the animals breath as it flies past
an ape officer still on his horse turns another swipe from the
tigers paw rips out his throat
kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry half of them dismounted all of them in disarray
the tiger runs soars through the doorway drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into the forest
kips men are fighting as they retreat heading towards the opening at the roof of the cave
will clutching his wounded shoulder makes his own way up the wall
beneath him drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines a long iron tube in a rolling superstructure
feeding it are a series of oil filled bladders
one of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole
a tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube
its a flame thrower the fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave
the flame engulfs two warriors
skin blazing they plummet to the ground
the flame thrower fires again scorching the rock wall filling the cave wit a pall of smoke
it hits the tiny patch of daylight cutting off escape
will trapped runs along a ledge over a pile of rocks and jumps
into mid air
he lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels into its flanks
the apes and the surviving warriors turn
for a moment they just stare nobodys ever seen a human ride a horse before
will flies towards the entrance
he sees kip on a ledge just above battling three huge apes
kip sees will galloping towards him
one of the apes raises a double bladed sword
kip jumps sprawling across the horses neck grabbing on to its flowing mane
drak stares at will hes never seen anything like him
he wheels his horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit
wills horse bursts out of the cave past the claw and under the balls
the apes turn and look astonished
they scramble for their horses
drak charges through
will hurtles towards the trees
kip hanging on for life looks behind drak raises his gatling gun and aims
kip wrenches wills head down zing
the arrows skim past
drak cant outpace them and he cant re load at the gallop either
they charge out of the camp into drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge ape stands on the back of the charging horse
he jumps his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough
he swings himself up into the tree he is an ape after all
he throws himself from branch to bough traveling at incredible speed
will glances back he sees draks riderless horse
his eyes dart in confusion where is he
we crane up hes in the trees above
drak jumps wham
hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into wills shoulder lifting him out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground
kip hauls down on the horses bridle wheeling the stallion around
will looks up from the dust drak towers above him
will sees kip coming back run
a volley of arrows whiz past kip other apes are galloping through the trees
kip grabs the bridle and kicks the horse spins and gallops away
massive armor clad paw grabs wills head
he looks straight into draks face
the ape reaches out and rips a claw down wills cheek
will tries to stifle the scream
drak touches the wound and tastes the blood so its human after ell
he spits the blood out in revulsion
will stares into the piu holes in his face
never has he seen eyes so cold
will tries to rise to hie feet
his wounded shoulder has weakened him he staggers
draks clenched fist clad in chain mail drives straight et wills jaw
smashl fade to black
its wills point of view he s lying on his back in a horse drawn cart
hes very weak his shirt drenched in blood
he rolls over and the image rights itself
he drags himself on to all fours but he cant get any further his legs are chained
fevered disoriented where the fuck am i
will looks up a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon
smiling the end of the road
will confused panicky grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to his knees
he looks past an escort of ape cavalry they are traveling down an avenue of idols towering statues of apes sculpted out of stone old as ages past
fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red flickering glow
will turns away
behind him he sees humans rows of them dead hanging upsidl down from long poles like trophies
everything comes flooding back he slumps against the side of the cart eyes barely focused
blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool between his legs
he doesnt even notice it
spans a roaring river
drak and his convoy clatter across it
we crane up laid out before is a city
terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged ravine
opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of stone
apes are everywhere hammering stones to enlarge a house chattering in the trees swinging hand over hand along horizontal ladders crossing from one side of the ravine to the other
will has roused himself
he stares at the city through feverish eyes to him it appears to float
buildings swim in and out of focus
his shoulders shake he starts to laugh an edge of hysteria to it
ive destroyed my mind
or maybe im dead and this is gods last joke hell is ruled by apes
whhish the end of a whip sails through the air
it hits wills back doubling him over
run across the surface of a beautiful pool
a black shape glides along underwater
the head breaks the surface its an old gorilla the fur on his face gray and balding
this is nazgul
he is the ghan the president of the council of elders
he walks out of the water
other old apes all male their days of warring and building over lie around the pool
several of them draped only in rough loin cloths groom each other picking nits out of their fur
the sound of a gong
nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the pool
he looks straight down the ravine at the far end drak and his troop come into view
the raiders are home
lazily good hunting
nazgul squints against the sun
he sees the poles carrying the dead humans
by the look of it
proudly not as good as when we rode the high ridges ill warrant
times are different now
back then a could go out and come back with a brace of animals
theyre far scarcer now not scarce enough i say
theres a murmur of agreement from the other apes
is wreathed in woven leaves
lying in it is the dead body of a young ape
the boat drifts down an underground stream
all around it rise the stone walls of a huge cavern
torches light up the gloom this place is a temple
a group of apes mourners walk along a path keeping pace with the funeral boat
they make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats a dirge for the dead
at the head of the procession swinging a smoking censer is an ape wearing a lion skin cloak
his face is scarred and twisted he has one cruel eye the other is just an empty socket
beneath the cloak one arm and a leg are withered
the whole effect rather than diminishing his power enhances it
his name is ma gog
he is high priest of the apes defender of the faith keeper of the book of the lore
the funeral boat gathers speed in the current
it thrusts towards sunlight pouring through an arch
the mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock
we pull back to reveal where they stand a huge crouching ape has been carved out of the face of a cliff its bowed front legs form the archway the
entrance to the temple of the ape
intoning in the beginning was the word and the word was the book of the lore
it says god created the ape in his own image
alone among his creatures the ape has a soul
one crosses the river now but death is only a door
he will dwell in the house of the lord forever
amen the mourners beat their chests with their fists
they repeat the word amen
for a moment the clouds of mist clear
now we see where the boat is headed half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop
these are the falls of no return
the boat races forward over the waterfall it goes
the sound of cheering voices very faint drifts towards them
ma gog turns and looks up the river towards the city looking down on drak and his troops
the convoy passes along a road cut into the side of the ridge
apes have come out of the houses and buildings to greet them
will lies in the back of the cart unconscious
faces of apes stare in at him theyve never seen anything like it
a young ape a little boy stands with his grandfather
what is it
sort of human
but look at the eyes pa theyre the color of the sea
wheres it from
i dont know a traveler maybe
nobody knows what lies beyond the tower of the moon
no its not its a mutant
put it in the zoo
a female ape pushes them aside
shes heavy set bright eyes an air of authority about her
over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a series of steel instruments dangling from it
her name is zora she is a doctor
she and her assistant a young male swing themselves on to the cart
kneeling beside him zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of wills crotch
whatever it is its male
she rips open wills shirt his chest is covered in blood from the gaping wound
the assistant hands her a steel instrument
she slides it towards the wound
we hold on wills face a strangled cry but he doesnt regain consciousness
zore returns the bloodied probe to her assistant
she calls out drak
the leader of the ape warriors riding close by turns the animals bleeding to death my lord
drak rides up to the wagon
i didnt bring him all this way just to have him die
to the assistant ben guri get a vet
quicklyl uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife
this is the vet
will lies on a stone slab nearby its a sort of medical centersinks along the walls racks of equipment hoses to wash down the blood
the vet cuts the clothing away from wills wound
he turns to doctor zora were going to have to give him blood
hes a tribesman in his late s
despite his tattered furs and hollow cheeks he carries himself with dignity hes a proud man
his name is aragorn
on a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament like crescent moon
etched into it are strange markings and the totems of various tribes
the sound of a key in lock
aragorn turns the cell door is thrown back
three ape guards enter
two of them armed with spears drive aragorn into a corner
the third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole
he drops it over aragorns head
aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight
they drag him from the cell
their flanks drenched in sweat walk in a circle
they turn a huge wheel that controls a series of pulleys and winches
attached to the end of a heavy cable is a wooden platform a primitive elevator
it runs from a series of impressive house down the side of the ravine to the center of the city
standing on the platform are nazgul and several other elders
they look down on the central square
its crowded with apes soldiers are being greeted by their kin
hes strapped to a slab half naked in the medical center
theyve put a gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself he can barely move
will still unconscious lies on a table next to him
nazgul peers down at him
its human you say
doctor zora nods yes
its even uglier than the others
he pulls a covering aside and looks at wills naked legs
how can he hunt with legs like those theyre like twigs
maybe hes diseased
everybody shrugs who knows
the vet heats a steel needle over an open flame
the other end of the needle is attached to a length of animal intestine
it acts as a tube
the vet grabs wills forearm and slides the red hot needle into the vein
wills body jerks with the pain
nazgul and the others spring back
for a moment wills wrenched back to consciousness he sees a light filled room a bandage on his chest a bladder full of blood hanging above him
his puts it together the only way he knows he thinks hes in hospital groggy help me
ive got health insurance
his eyes close as he slips back into darkness
nazgul looks at doctor zora
what is health insurance
some sort of religion
the vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder
another length of tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to aragorns arm
its his blood
now we realize this is the ape version of a blood transfusion
do you think thisil work
you can never tell with animals
their bodies arent as sophisticated as an apes
sometimes their blood fights with each other
either way you know really quick they get up and walk around or theyre dead
the vet turns a little tap aragorns blood flows down the tube
it hits wills vein
an ape without knowledge is a fire without light
euripadape iii it stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge
this is the hall of learning
ma gog his lion skin cloak billowing behind him hurries up the steps
guards are collaring aragorn preparing to drag him out
the door into the room is thrown open
ma gog enters
nazgul and the others greet him but he barely acknowledges it show him to me
the vet grabs wills hair
he lifts up his head so that ma gog can see his face
the high priest takes a step back theres something about will that fills him with loathing
anger flashes in his one good eye
he stares at will
his voice is iow almost to himself all my life ive dreaded this day
turns to the others kill him
weve just spent an hour trying to save him kill him
he grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground
doctor zora takes his arm stopping him the animals unique my lord
at least we should look at his brain
maybe its possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him
imagine a tame human
man cant be tamed
alone among gods primates he kills for lust or greed
he will murder his own brother to possess his brothers land
the doctors only asking for a chance to experiment
the benefits would be enormous
a tame species of human could double food production at last we could dam the rivers
you dont know what youre dealing with
its just an animal ma gog
thats the trouble
a movement on the stone slab
they turn and look wills eyelids are fluttering
hes starting to come round
itl he turns to nazgul in the name of god summon the council of elders
wills eyes are open now
like through a glass darkly he sees the ape guards coming for him
he tries to struggle but hes very weak
they haul him off
set in a rock wall on one side a key hole
we tilt up the door to a narrow set of bars high above it
a face straining with effort rises up to peer through the bars
it is will looking like death but forcing himself to do it desperate to see where he is
the muscles across his shoulders ripple
his one good hand clutches the bars
he hangs by it supporting his weight staring out at a vaulted underground cavern
it looks like a cattle yard broken down and disused nowa series of long pens wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt
will cant support himself any longer he tumbles to the ground
he crawls across the floor and examines the door
it fits tight to the rock
theres no hope of picking the lock the key hole doesnt even come all the way through
suddenly he stops
nothing for a moment then he hears it again a scraping sound
he peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall
one of the blocks moves
will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell
aragorn squeezes through from the adjoining cell
he looks at will so you lived then
what did they do
they gave you blood
he holds up his bandaged forearm will realizes where it came from
i hope you had a medical
aragorn looks at him confused
from a distance the sound of horses whinnying
what is this place
it was a slaughterhouse
they use it for stables now
no s different kind of animal
will stares taken aback
aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners of the cell
in my fathers time the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here
young apes killed some during their manhood rites the others were made sport of in the corrals
at the end the bodies were thrown onto the belts and fed to the fire
aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves
from out of his cloak he takes two pieces of flint and strikes them
a spark starts the fire softly death is stuck to these walls stranger sounds not even s thousand winters can take away
sometimes of s night they speak to me i can hear the screams of my people
will looks at him
firelight plays across their faces
why havent they killed you
they keep me ss bait
my name is aragorn he lifts his hand to will palm outwards
its some form of greeting
will returns it
i am the ranger of the easterlings the leader of the seven tribes
they hope the warriors will come and try to free me
and will they
not if they fear my anger
i was taken in summer and now winters almost gone
even the apes grow tired soon theyll make me walk the paths of the dead
will looks at aragorns eyes theyre fearless
the ornament glints on his chest
will points at it what is it
its called the crescent of light its the talisman of my rank
mithral is how we name it
will reaches his hand towards it can i borrow it
aragorn recoils this is the most precious thing in the world to him
his hand closes around the insignia who are you
what brings you to the valley of the tribes
i meant you no harm
im looking for woman one of my own kind
do you know of people like me
will nods his head accepting it
slowly he reaches his hand out if you want to get out of hare
i need the talisman
the two men look at each other
a beat then aragorn reaches up and unfastens it
torches burn on the walls
they cast a glow across the temple the underground stream pools of water shelves of rock hewn out of the walls
several apes crouch on them praying to a golden idol of an ape
mist rises off of the pools
moving through it we see nazgul drak and e group of old apes
the council of elders is gathering
they pass through a narrow door oil lamps hidden in alcoves illuminate ma gog
he stands in front of an ancient book strange symbols like sanskrit run across its pages
this is the book of the lore
ma gog looks at the council of elders seated in front of himnazgul drak and five other huge apes all leaders in their time
how many scrolls are there in the book of the lore
nobody replies the question is so obvious it needs no answer
one hundred and seventy six you say every child knows that
softly but every child is wrong
there is one more scroll the last scroll sealed with seven seals handed down from high priest to high priest
he slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden catch
the top the book still resting on it tilts up revealing a secret compartment
it is lined with gold leaf
lying in it is a slim folio of pages it is called the scroll of revelation
the council of elders stare in awed silence
ma gog takes the pages out and unfastens the seals
he reads and it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages
a silence fell and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
like through a glass darkly i saw the future
the council of elders stare at him
he limps forward and stops in front of them
he recites from memory behold there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the horse is death
those that ride on him are beasts but like no beasts born before
their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea
they are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with fire
and let him that hath understanding know the number of these beasts
it is the number of man
he raises his eyes and looks straight at the councilors
today we saw that beast
mark those words my lords their limbs are weak but they are given power over the earth
now will you listen
and if we dont
then all hope will fail in this bitter winter
he lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment
nazgul looks from one to the other of the elders
nobody says a word but he can read their grim expressions
he turns to drek kill him
kill him with the sword and with fire
kill himl its a shining bright image slightly distorted
we pull back to reveal its a reflection
aragorns silver ornament has been polished to a brilliant luster
its fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking through the bars high above the iron door
the wooden bed has been smashed to pieces
both aragorn and will have used parts of their clothing to harness themselves so they can see through the bars
aragorn controls the pole with the mirror on the end of it
by looking into it will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door
he has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it
he turns the pole guiding the nail towards the keyhole
hes trying to pick the lock
do you understand time
what time is it
aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse seven hours since the rising of the sun
just after noon
shouldnt we wait until night
concentrating if im right its gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think
the nail is almost in the key hole
half an inch to go
it slides off
will curses and starts again beats down from a cloudleu sky
drak and two huge praetorian guards max and hannibal come through a huge stone portico
its another entrance to the temple one that opertl onto a central square
orak and the two guards hurry across it
towards the slaughterhouu
at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole
will barely breathing in case it breaks his concentration listens carefully
he moves the end of the pole
the nail turns
are thrown open
daylight spills into the slaughterhouse
drak max and hannibal enter
drak stops he listens to the horses whinnying and stomping their hooves somethings wrong
turns to max get the dogs
moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals trying to see whats wrong with the horses
behind him a movement in the shadows
the sound of something slicing through the air
he turns its the side of aragorns hand
it chops hard into the apes throat shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness
he crumples to the ground
aragorn and will strip him of his weapons
will starts to go but aragorn tears a strip off both their shirts
he ties the fabric around the apes ankles
what are you doing
watch theyre going to bring in the dogs
arent really dogs at all theyre a much earlier ancestor
we call them wolves
there are two of them on the end of heavy leather leashes
their handlers have them in wills cell rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses in front of their noses
the wolves take the scent
drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes
the wolves leap out of the cell
rises groggily to his feet clutching his injured throat
he takes a few steps forward grrrr
he turns the two wolves fly towards him
he tries to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak
he runs the fabric unseen by him trails from his ankles
the wolves pound after him
he glances over his shoulder
first one wolf then the other leaps
fangs and claws glistening they hit him in the back hurling him to the ground
he writhes on to his back
one wolf tears at his ankles the other goes for his throat
blood sprays as the artery breaks
will and aragorn are running plunging down in to darkness
arches and corridors open off of it
its like a labyrinth this doesnt seem like the way out
were not going out not yet
so what are we doing
softly were going killing
dont be stupid will jerks on aragorns arm starting to haul him back
aragorn throws off his hand you do what you like
but im the ranger of the easterlings i wont leave here until its done
from behind them the sounds of pursuit
he starts to run
together they disappear into the gloom ahead
will and aragorn glide past them
theyre taking it slowly very carefully
now we see why ahead of them is a set of steel doors
torches on either side illuminate a guard post but theres no sign of the sentry
will and aragorn move closer
they pass we hold on the narrow opening looking deep into the shadows
a big ape heavily armed stands there
he has his back to us his legs spread
a trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away hes taking a piss
a shadow flickers on the wall above him
he sees it the passage waymore shadows will and aragorn are move through the torchlight
the steel doors are straight ahead
the sentry slides out of the crevice hes behind will
silently back pressed again t the bars of a cell he creeps closer to will
he has a curved knife in one hand and a short handled spear in the other
he raises the spear a rustle of movement
will spins he sees the spear about to thrust
hes a dead man
it shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the sentrys throat half choking him
will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentrys jaw
the sentry crumples to the ground revealing the face of the prisoner
its not a man though its an ape
hes in his prime barrel chested and a fine head
his name is strider
he and will look at each other through the bars
two rules in life never play cards with anyone called doc and never whatever else you do turn your back on an ape
will stares at him
will smiles back thanks
ill remember that
he starts to search the sentry
what are you doing
looking for the keys
he saved our lives
hes an ape
will shrugs himself free of aragorns hand you go and kill as many apes as you like im setting this one free
aragorn looks at him
softly its not apes im going to kill
the heavy steel doors stand open
inside is a clean and gruesome room sinks and instruments along a wall a series of operating tables and a row of cages
behind the bars are six tribes people men women and a little boy
all of them carry surgical scars on their heads
its made two of them blind the others stare blankly into space
aragorn moves down the cages
several of them shuffle towards him but theres no recognition theyre like the walking dead
aragorn doesnt say a word
grim faced he loads the crossbow and starts to fire killing them
will and strider come through the doorway they see aragorn going from cage to cage
will steps forward going to stop him
striders hand grabs his shoulder restraining him
he knows what hes doing
will turns and looks at him questioning
the doctors operate on them up here
taps his head the tribes think that we steal their souls
he pauses softly maybe theyre right
aragorn reaches the last cage
a woman in her s stands in the middle of the cell looking at him
aragorn stares at her face
his lip trembles with emotion
she tilts her head on one side as if trying to work something out
tears fill aragorns eyes
she stumbles a step forward
the ranger closes his eyes
he pulls the trigger
a crossbow bolt slams into her chest and she falls
will leans against the doorway unwilling to watch staring down the passageway
he turns at a footfall aragorn rejoins them
his voice is hollow as if something has died within him its done
we can go now
he turns and leads them back down the passageway
theres five of them now hunting through the slaughter house in a pack
all around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and crannies
the horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves
will aragorn and strider are crouched in a corner of the corral smearing their bodies with horse manure
the fresher the better
cover everything thats the only way youll hide your scent
the wolves sniff the air coming closer
will staring through the rungs of the coral sees their gleaming eyes coming closer
he raises his crossbow getting ready
the wolves stop
they raise their heads and look the whole cavern is growing dark
a giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside world
the horses rear and buck
the apes are staring darkness is falling in the middle of the day
the wolves hackles rise in fear
aragorn and strider are cowering back what is it
he drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses
has fallen on the city
the apes are in confusion soldiers and workers are running children are screaming
a horse has thrown its rider and is bolting down the terraces
the darkness grows ever deeper
in the sky the face of the moon obliterates the sun its a full solar eclipse
two horses flying at a gallop charge through the doors of the slaughterhouse
will is on one aragorn clinging to his back
strider is on the other
they wheel across an open space through running apes and speed down a terrace
steps out on to a rock ledge
he holds a staff in one hand his cloak thrown back over his shoulder magnificent in the eerie light
he stares down at the chaos
drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side what is it
wild a sign the hand of man passes across the face of god
lookl he points to a terrace below will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to the iron bridge
drak and ma gog stare at them
darkness engulfs them
out of the blackness an image its a stained glass window in a huge cathedral
a priest is at the altar conducting mass for the repose of the dead
we pull back to reveal a tiny white coffin just big enough for a baby
next to it is another coffin
and another a row of them
and even now as sorrow has no end we find comfort in the words of the lord jesus christ
did he not say unto mark suffer the little children to come unto me for they are the kingdom of heaven
now and forever
the congregation sad eyed relatives and weeping parents fill the pews
pall bearers lift up the tiny coffins
the organ starts to play
a soloist a tenor steps to the side of the altar
he starts to sing the latin hymn penis angelicas
the haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral
they carry over to is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day
the clock tower above the biology building shows the time
even so the area bustles with activity
an illuminated chart dominates one wall just like the strategy map in the pentagons war room
every research center is identified next to it is its function and a list of personnel
we see princeton stanford texas a m los alamos
tentacles reach out to oxford the pasteur institute the university of beijing
below the chart are nitrogen cooled cray super computers
we track through teams of men and women processing data satellite dishes feeding a communications network a video conference taking place in a corner technicians routing and re routing phone
calls and faxes
we come to a glass wall
on the other side is diamond glass doors seal out the electronic hum
diamond staring through the glass looks exhausted
demaupassent sits on a couch
hes in his shirt sleeves dark rings under his eyes
next to him is bob the young neurologist
he wears jeans and a t shirt
on the front it says ill sleep when im dead
the coffee table is piled with files journal extracts and computer print outs
a video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a screen
diamond rubs her eyes trying to wipe away the fatigue
im sorry luc say that again
kindly my fault billie i rattle on too much
the result is weve fixed the time frame
he hits the projector the image of a fetus developing normally in the womb appears on the screen
demaupassant the fetus develops normally through the first trimester
then it happens about sixteen weeks and two days everything falls apart
the whole chemical structure goes out of control he flashes up another image a fetus that is already aging remarkably
demaupassant once it starts its irreversible
if were going to stop it weve got to intercede here he points at the slide of the normally developing fetus
taking over theres a trigger some major fucking switch gets turned
thats what ive been working on
its definitely in the mdna
theres a fragment of one chromosome im looking at he flicks a switch on the video projector
a slide of a human gene massively magnified popl on to the screen
its so different i call it the alien
how it got there exactly what it does i havent got the first idea
no fucking idea at all
diamond looks at his grim face
he seems totally defeated
quietly is it that bad
he stares at the floor
theres not even a hint of the former arrogance
someones dropped us in the middle of the louvre
were blind men and theyve told us to find the mona lisa
theres four miles of galleries end weve got five minutes to do it
thats how i feel and thats when rm optimistic
diamond turns to demaupassant
im sixty two years old
ive seen us go from dc s to landing on the moon
in my life ive won all the glittering prizes
ive always believed nothing was beyond the reach of man but ill tell you honestly this may never be unraveled
if it is it wont be in my lifetime
he looks at them
theres nothing anyone can say
he starts to gather up his papers so what do we do
i think its like gatsby so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
theres no other way ia there
they nod their hoods you have to try
demaupaasant and bob start to leave
he turns youre certain about the time i mean
nodding sixteen weeks
how far along are you
they look at one another
the old man speaks gently good night billie
perfectly formed floats in the amniotic fluid
its alive the large head sways the heart beats through the translucent ribs
diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs
she lies on a stainless steel table in a hi tach examination room
a complex array of equipment ultra sounds and scanners beams down on her exposed stomach
it projects a video image onto a screen
she is alone in the room manipulating the equipment herself
she stares up at the child growing in her womb
we see the genitalia
so youre a little boy
its funny i think i knew
she reaches up and gently touches the image of his face
weve got four weeks
the way i see it theres nothing to lose
i cant tell you whetil happen to us
its on the edge mister
the airs so thin out there we may not even be able to breathe
but what the hell its a chance
she takes her hand away and looks at his face
you want to try it
sure you do
youre my son
weve waited all our lives for each other
lie on a table in the basement
we track through them past computer print outs and dog eared journals
we recognize them these are wills detailed notes
to the table is the makeshift lab racks of bottles and syringes
in the dim light we see diamond
she removes the catheter from her vein turns and climbs up the flotation tank
water sloshes back and forth
diamond lowers herself in and floats there
for a moment she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the hatch
we hold on her face
softly so we beat on boats against the current
she reaches up and pulls the hatch shut
its one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the sky together
smoke drifts across them
we tilt down to ape city a column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the slaughterhouse
burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse
the rickety conveyor belt is working clattering away
several ape workers throw the bodies of the lab animals the dead tribes people on to the belt
the body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt
it dumps him into the furnace
the flames engulf him
the door hangs open
the space is lit by a dozen torches
drak is alone moving around the cell trying to work out how will escaped
he looks at the smashed bed the hole in the wall the torn clothing that made the harness
he swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock
no answers there
lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end
drak picks it up
he turns it over in his hand th
nking about it
one handed he catches hold of the bars above the door
effortlessly he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars
the nail touches the lock
to himself clever
you clever fucking animal
he turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him
urgent could i see you please
is a magnificent room stone columns and towering trees growing in huge pots
at one end is a rock shelf open to the gathering twilight
silhouetted against it commanding a view of the entire city is the council of elders
they sit around a table made from bone and tusks deep in discussion
nazgul looks up he sees drak approaching through the shadows
i was just saying maybe its a blessing
where theres one there must be others
if wed killed him we might never find them
but the animals not stupid he knows come day break well be tracking him
whos to say hell run for home
drak stops in front of them
no hes not stupid
but even dogs hunt in packs of seven
every animal needs its kind
and when we find them what then
what do you think
just like the tribes burn them out of their holes put them to the sword
i dont mind doing that i like it but its never enough is it
no matter how many we kill every year theyre still here
why will it be any different with the blue eyes
what we need is a final solution
nazgul and where do we find that
doctor zoras brought back patients from a place called kismatu
ive been talking to her about it several of the council are looking at each other perplexed
what is kismatu
its a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier
females and babies have been dying there
he turns to drak his eyes intense very interested
there are iron barn on i series of high windows but in the middle of the room is a jungle gym
underneath it are ape toys
five baby apes sit on cots
they must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end bodies are those of old old apeswizened and wrinkled frail with age
a double set of bars provide a sort of air lock
hanging on them is a sign quarantine
drak and the council of elders stare in at the children
doctor zora is with them shes nervous twisting her fingers
we dont know what causes it a virus probably
id hoped to complete our research before i came to you with my proposal
but given the circumstances its a brilliant idea
turns and smiles at her brilliant
paw the ground
theyre bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail
its night the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock
will and strider have made camp a hare roasts over the fire
aragorn sits well apart a silhouette in the moonlight staring out into the forest lost in his thoughts
will and strider look at him
hes their leader he can never take his eye from the mountain
he has to do what he thinks is right
hard by killing them
dont judge him will
i couldnt have done it
i wonder if you could
one of those women he just killed wes his daughter
he turns and stares at the silhouette
a long beat
quietly we call it a iobotomy
what other things have you people tried
he turns to face him
theres something about it something almost evasive
fuck you strider
he stares at will hes never seen him angry
dont know if its true
my sisters mate works in the lab
he says doctor zoras working on some disease will comes towards him what sort of disease
of the children i think ape children
how did they die strider
old in the belly is that how
some of them
you know this disease
will stares at him taking it in
softly so thats how it happened
fuck you people
they havent done it yet
it may not work
they will and it does
he turns end takes step towards the forest
he runs his fingers through his hair will god help us
thats funny thats exactly what an ape would say
he and strider stare at one another the ape and the man both struck by the sudden commonality
will walks slowly back to the fire
strider starts to strip the meat off a hare hes roasting over the flames
he offers it to will
he shakes his head hes not hungry anymore
he stares into the flames what about you strider why were you in the cell
i fought another ape
nothing very heroic im afraid i was drunk
he fell badly his head hit the branch of a tree going down
it broke his neck
he pauses were not like humans
an ape never kills one of his own
whats the punishment
at the ceremony of summer rites the high priest would curse me with death
i would have been left to die in the forest no journey over the waterfall no one to say the sacred words
without that no ape can walk in the next world
you saved my life will and im grateful
but theres nothing i can do about my soul
im a dead ape walking
strider stripe more meet off the hare
will picks up a saddle and blanket and starts to make himself bed
you knew didnt you
you knew the sun was going to swallow the moon
thats why you werent afraid
will pauses then he turns to him
yes i knew
ive come a long way strider its farther then i can explain
ive heard stories old apes tell them round the fire late at night of strange lands where the creatures can tell the future
is that where youre from
in a way
yeah its something like that
so what happens to it afl to the world weve built
tell me that
it passes away
strider stares at him through the firelight
history remembers though its passed on what we did i mean
no strider theres nothing not a trace left behind
strider thinks for a moment then he smiles gently
so its just vanity then what we believe that the works of the ape will last forever
yes its vanity
but not just of apes strider maybe of men too
he turns and settles down on his makeshift bed
strider the food forgotten stares out into the night
a million stars hang on a velvet sky
look down from them in the vast blackness of the forest one tiny lightthe flickering fire
battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables
dawn is breaking across the city
ma gog stands on a ridge his staff raised blessing the army as it rides out
at its head is drak
he clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down the avenue of idols
votive fires burn in front of every statue
arches across the end of a tiny gorge
dozens of streams cascade into pools spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds
aragorn leads will and strider along a hidden path a rock ledge that runs behind the waterfalls
the ledge widens into a large cave
sunlight streams through a veil of cascading water
aragorn looks around somethings worrying him
this is the rainbow tribes cave
they should be here
aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones feeling its warmth
they left at the rising of the sun
he moves deeper into the cave a maze of limestone caverns and passage ways
he stops at sleeping area weapons lie there food in baskets
softly why such hurry
suddenly he stops listening
he looks at strider you heard it
strider nods his head yes
will hasnt heard a thing
he listens hard nothing
i dont think so
strider moves silently to the side of the cave
he picks up a crossbow
is there another entrance
from the ridge above
he cocks the crossbow
aragorn has picks up a bow and spear
he moves towards a cavern signaling strider to take a passageway
will grabs a crossbow
strider tosses him a chain mail vest armor
they move off
eep in the cave
a sound pebbles falling off a ledge
then we see a flicker of light a torch is moving through a cavern
whoever holds it turns a corner and is lost in darkness
of arches and stalactites
will and strider split apart
will moves silently through the darkness into a cavern
through an archway he sees a shadow on the wall
he goes fast towards it the shadow comes round the boulder
we tilt down and now we see whos holding the torchdiamondl shes armed with a crossbow cocked end loaded
she turns a corner ten feet in front of her is strider
she stares at the massive apes back a bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder
her eyes widen with fear
she raises the crossbow strider hears it
he spins weapon rising turns into a passage midway between them
he sees diamond about to fire
he screams too late she pulls the trigger
will hurls himself forward in front of strider
the arrow blasts into his chest
he crashes to the ground
diamond stares down at him
his eyes open hes gasping for breath from the impact
he and diamond look at one another
strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of wills chain mail armor
diamonds shoulders sag with relief
indicates strider whos he
ill explain later
he struggles to his feet and looks at diamond what made you come
i thought the mdna was just a theory
one of dozens of theories isnt that what you said
we did a lot of work
i guess i was wrong
people have been wrong about a lot of things
stretches out below primordial forests and cascading streams
will and diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave
this is the rift valley in kenya he points at the towering snow capped peak
thats kilamanjaro ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know
think of it weve come back a hundred thousand years
everyone told me it couldnt be done but weve crossed the frontier now man has traveled through space and time
how long has science dreamed of that
how long have you
all my life
dream no more
youve done it
like you said in your note it was doctor robert plant of uc berkeley
will turns and looks out at the valley softly yeah i really have havent i
diamond watches him
theres a shout from inside the cave aragorn ive found it
newly drawn is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave
strider will and diamond watch aa aregorn looks at it by torchlight
i thought they would leave word for their hunters
kip kena has called a gathering of the seven tribes
two days travel at the eagles nest
he looks out through the mouth of the cave twilight is closing in
well stay hera tonight
be ready to leave at first light
burn in the circle of stones
aragorn and strider are sleeping next to it
will and diamond have been awake all night
they sit in the shadows near the entrance to the cave speaking quietly
an ape civilization
you said there was a city
what happened to it all
you know what weve found of aragorns whole race
seventeen bones thats all
anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes we call them skulls
bones last a lot longer than civilizations
i guess theres a lesson in that
listen billie the apes have discovered a disease
will crouches down in the dirt he scratches out a small chain of circles
its a molecule
its really rare and lucky for them its in an isolated area
theyre not stupid they understand its potential
they plan to give it to the tribes he draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow legged stick figure of a man
and maybe they do but it doesnt matter aragorns people arent us
already evolutions taken another track scratches a cross through the bow legged man
he draws the figure of an upright human
somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us the first man
you said it was in the mitochondrial dna it has to be a woman
she reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figures head
sooner or later the apes find her
she doesnt look like the tribes but the apes dont care shes human
so they give her the disease
shes different though it doesnt work or at least it doesnt seem to
it gets integrated into her
its passed on it mutates it weaves its way into the mdna
it lies there a bomb waiting to go off
and then one day after a hundred thousand years
the planets five billion years old
whats that to nature
a blink of the eye
will throws the stick down on the ground
thats the theory anyway
impressed a helluva theory doctor plant
theres not much time will
we have to find her before the apes and we have to do it within four weeks
weve got a theory thats all
we dont even know half the problems were dealing with
you cant put a deadline on science
what about people
isnt that what this is all about
im sorry i thought there were children dying
of course its about that too
but then you dont care muchabout people do you
no i guess i dont
not for a long time
ideas and knowledge are what matter
theyre the shining ideals
thats the only way we progress
progress to what
were both children of our age arent we
weve grown up to believe the more we know the more advanced we are
but what does that mean if weve forgotten the things of real value
you know the reason i came
its got nothing to do with science or knowledge
im going to have a child thats why im here
they look at one another
uke you said the womens out there somewhere
why ere we traveling with them
indicates aragore and strider we should cut ourselves loose
we wouldnt last a day
weve got to keep moving billie
the apes are like storm troopers
where are they now
i think strider has some sort of tribal intuition
he says he can hear their hoof beats in his head
the first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall
will and diamond turn at a sound behind them aragorn is getting up
winds through a beautiful valley
the two horses splash along the waters edge
strider and aragorn are mounted on one will and diamond on the other
they turn a curve aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into the forest
ape soldiers are swarming over the cave
a tracker uses torchlight to study footprints
he looks up at orak theres four of them my lord
the tracker points it a at of prints its woman
blue eyes has a mate
i look forward to meeting her
my lord hoof prints
drak turns the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of the cave
drak looks up high above he sees a slash of daylight
its another entrance
two heavily armed officers emerge from among the soldiers
with drak they run for the wall
they leap up the rock face their massive hands grabbing tiny ledges
other apes follow them
they scramble up the wall with amazing speed
soaring and hovering in the sky
we tilt down a tribesman dressed in skins edged with feathers is perched high on a jagged peak
hes a lookout
he tenses four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff
the lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle
it carries down to are built into the rocky crags opening into caves
they are connected by ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops
the inhabitants here live with their totem this is the nest of the tribe of the eagle
the platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes
people turn at the lookouts cry
a man pushes through listening its kip kena
kip follows the direction of the lookouts pointing finger
will and diamond lead the other two all on foot now along the path
its the traveler
with a woman
the lookout shields his eyes against the sun the visitors ere coming closer
the fool hes brought an ape with himl he reaches for a bow but kips hand falls on his arm stopping him
whos the other one though
he turns yelling down to the platforms its the ranger
the ranger is free
the tribes people burst into action running for the bridges scaling the ladders
it locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse
its a primitive drawbridge
aragorn steps on to it leading the others across
the tribes people are gathering eager to greet him
then they see strider
a ripple of fear and anger runs through them
the ape travels with me treat him as a friend
nobody argues with the ranger
he stops in front of kip
the young warrior starts to bow his head but aragorn stops him
he puts out his arms they embrace
will crosses the bridge
kip sees him
he grasps wills arm in greeting you carry part of my spirit with you i owe you my life
a series of caves connected by vaulted arches extend in to the mountain
theyre crowded with members of various tribes children are playing flint knappers are fashioning tools women ara cooking
a shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall
kip and will have found a quiet place amid the bustle
are the seven tribes here
all except the antelope
they hunt the plains far to the west they have the longest journey
will they come
who knows maybe the apes have found them
nobody has seen them for many summers gone
im searching for someone a young woman
she looks like us
he indicates diamond i thought she might live with the tribes
is she a relative was she born to your hearth
to all of our hearths
my race reveres her
we think of her as the first woman
our lives are nothing
nodding his head women are of the spirit we believe that
mother earth mates with the totems
only through woman can their children walk the world
have you seen her
perhaps some of the women have seen something
she looks like you you say
no offense traveler but the women say youre the ugliest man theyve ever seen
a woman that looks like you im sure they would have talked about it
they smile at one another
im sorry i cant help
a torch flares below
kip looks down into an adjoining cave
its empty except for a group of men all warriors filing in
these are the leaders of each of the tribes
they ring the walls of the small cave
by their light we see the skins the feathers and the symbols of each tribes totem the eagle the tiger the rainbow
beneath each one squats its leader
one place is empty the tribe of the antelope
will sits near the entrance
he watches aragorn dressed in ceremonial robes the crescent of light glistening at his neck rise to his feet
weve traveled without rest there are soldiers a day behind
the ape says its an army
and there are more coming from the north
five squadrons et least the runners say
its led by the old warrior nazgul
is that why you called the gathering
great things are moving ranger an old man battle scarred and gray leans forward
he is the leader of the rainbow
a stranger walks out of the west the moon hides the sun armies are on the march come the new moon nothing in middle earth will be the same
others nod their heads in agreement
we either fight or flee the tribes must decide
i know you kip you always were a fighter
what do the others say
warrior in a feathered cloak speaks it doesnt matter what we say the ranger has returned
well follow wherever he leads
aragorn looks at their faces
slowly he shakes his head ill walk the path mother earth has laid for me but ill walk it no more as ranger
the leaders stare at him
several start to object but he silences them with his hand a man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine
softly i took the life of my daughter and some of your kinfolk with it
i did my duty nothing more can be asked of i men
but now others must walk in my place
he walks forward unfastening the crescent of light
he stops in front of kip if i should have had a son i would have hoped for a man as fine as you
this is my last act as ranger of the easterlings he reaches out and slips the crescent of light around kips neck
take care of my fathers people
guide them well
he looks at the leaders you must decide what is best for the tribes
i was the one that had to strike the blow but it was the apes who killed my child
tomorrow i will go to fight them
what father could do any less
he turns away and walks towards the entrance
only will sees the tears in his eyes
they huddle together staring at the strange looking woman and the ape
strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave diamond lays down furs for sleeping
she looks up the leaders are coming out of the meeting
theyre going to war
they leave at dawn
theyll be slaughtered
they think if they leave the valley their totems wont follow
without them they say theyre dead anyway
we should go now
will looks at her
she meets his gaze
suddenly she realizes oh nol were not fighting someone elses war listen to me weve got four weeks willl four weeks to find her
shes not here so whet are we waiting for
the tribes people turn at the raised voices
will takes diamonds arm and guides her to a private corner listen billie
we know the future but if we beat the apes they cant harm the woman
beat the apes
and say we dont or say one of us gets captured
dont you understand
four weeksi yeah i understand but those things arent going to happen
we know things the apes cant even dream of
this is our world billie men won it with their minds
all we need is knowledge and science
weve got them both
we can win
what are we going to do dazzle them with calculus
this is an army will you said it yourself
storm trooperst look he bends and picks up s rock from the ground
he hands it to diamond taste it
thats saltpeter the natural form of potassium nitrate
the caves are littered with the stuff
youve smelt the air theres sulfur all around
if we burn timber thatil give us charcoal
youre s scientist you know what it means
sure she knows what it means
she stares at him
its strange isnt it
give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks about is weapons
were a frail species billea
its only weapons that have made us bigger than we are
its the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this
we can beat themi no more experiments no more problem
quietly i hope your right will
all over the eagles nest turning piles of timber into charcoal
the camp is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes people make their way up from the valley carrying piles of sulfur rock women and children sit in circles pounding the
saltpeter into dust
will moves among the tribal leaders watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls
strider sits apart watching not sure if the humans have lost their minds
he looks like a scarecrow except hes dressed in captured ape armor
rigged to a flying fox he speeds past a rock face
all of the tribes people are gathered on the side of a crevasse watching
the straw men flies closer towards a rocky outcrop
will touches a burning ember to the ground
we see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but we lose it among the rocks
a thin trail of smoke marks its passage
the tribes people watch nothing seems to be happening
suddenly just as the straw man reaches the outcrop ka boom
a huge explosion
fire and flying rock hit the straw men
the tribes people scream
terrified they turn and run
smoke and dust obscure the flying fox
will walks forward to examine his handiwork
tribes people peer out from their hiding places the smoke and dust clear
they see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope
several of the women start to cry in fear
will stands on the edge of the crevasse
he turns kip aragorn and the other leaders are approaching
they look at him with trepidation
you make fire from rocks of the earth what is this thing
kip turns to the others
they repeat the word as if that will unlock its mystery
weve still got work to do
he turns and goes
the tribes people emboldened by their leaders come closer
they draw back from will as he makes his way through them
he comes face to face with strider
the man and the ape look at one another
apes believe men are the devils children
maybe theyre right
what have you done will what have you unleashed on the world
the future thats all
i cant fight with you tomorrow will
to kill an ape in a brawl is one thing but i cant go to war against my people
kindly i never expected you to
again they look at one another
will turns and leaves
drak and his cavalry pennants flying gallop along the edge of a river
ranks of infantry followed by horse drawn supply wagons travel behind
the river swings around a point thick with trees
we crane up above the foliage a tributary flows clown the other side
marching through the shallows is another army of apes
at their head on a stallion is nazgul
the two squadrons converge at the end of the point
the foot soldiers meld together the praetorian guard splash ahead drak and nazgul ride side by side
ahead the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge
its a natural weir a jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the river
the praetorian guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir
the guard spur their horses forward forcing them through the fast running current crossing to the other side a shadow of movement
tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the forest almost invisible in skins and camouflage
will and kip stand motionless deep in shadow
they watch as the guard on their horses come thundering across the ford straight towards them
the infantry are close behind
will drops his hand whip along the ground out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks that form part of the ford
the guards horses shy away
the apes look down in puzzlement boom
booml sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water
apes are cut to pieces horses are hurled into the fast flowing water
on the far side oraks horse rears up
he drives his spurs into its flanks trying to control it
clouds of dust and smoke billow across the weir the wounded are screaming the ape cavalry wheel and turn in confusion
drak plunges forward chaos all around him
he pounds his chest with both fists and roars apes chargel the apes still on their horses hear his cry
they spur their mounts forward
the first of the cavalry reach boom
more explosions rip the river bank to pieces
batteries of cross bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames
the eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other touching flames to rope fuses
fire sizzles towards the crossbows each one loaded with a charge bam
bamf the scores of crossbows fire
the ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris
the hail of arrows cut them to pieces
drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses
he looks through the smoke into the forest
he sees will standing on a rock with kip like a general commanding his army
drak bellows with rage
he snaps the reins about to drive his horse onward
an arrow flies in from the flank
whackt it slams into draks chest armor splintering
he turns floats in the middle of the river
the leader of the rainbow tribe water streaming off of him kneels on the tangle of trees and branches reloading his bow
this is no jumble of logs its a firing platform theyve anchored therel dozen rainbow warriors hidden in the water clamber out of the river
they kneel next to their leader drlwing their bows drak watches es i flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes
right in front of him an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of the praetorian guard
drak turns to nazgul yelling the ones in the river take themi nazgul spurs his horse back across the weir
ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank
they hear the charges go off the hurl themselves down
another volley of arrows scythes through them the eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the batteries of crossbows
one of the warriors looks up terror on his face
drak followed by the remnants of his praetorian guard charge through the blue haze of gunsmoke straight towards them
one of the crossbow batteries fires
arrows hit his horses armor but drak doesnt falter
crouched iow in the saddle he spins the gatling gun like a gunslinger
he locks it under his arm
the eagle warriors start to break and run
the apes horses sound like thunder rolling closer
the eagle leader and several of his warriors stand their ground desperately working to reload
they spin the battery sighting straight at draks chest
arrows fly drak leaps out of the saddle
he catches hold of an overhanging bough
the arrows whiz underneath skimming his butt
he leaps again higher into the tree
the eagle leader looks up sunlight sparkles on the leaves
its dazzling smash
draks sword cleaves through one of the warriors
drak has dropped to the ground right behind them
the eagle leader turns too latel rat a tat tat
the gatling gun fires
arrows shred the eagle leaders feathered coat
he crumples to the ground like some fallen bird
the ape infantry pour across the ford charging over the bodies of their fallen comrades
riderless horses part of the ape cavalry charge wildly through the trees
we tilt up their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees
the branches are thick with apes firing cutting down groups of running tribesmen
will and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron barrel wedged in the rocks
one of the warriors tilts it up aiming it at the trees another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel
will touches an ember to a fuse
everyone dives for cover boom
the primitive cannon fires
the shrapnel hits the trees
shredded apes branches and leaves fall to the ground
will and the warriors reload
again they fire but the charge is too big
the whole cannon breaks free of the rocks
it flies like a missile and smashes into the trunk of a tree
its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders
aragorn and a group of warriors are fighting hand to hand being forced back by scores of ape infantry
aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape
the point plunges into the animals belly up and under his armor
blood spurts out from the joins in the metal
an ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow straight at aragorn
he fires wham
the crossbow bolt smashes into aragorns shoulder sending him reeling
one of the tribesmen turns its kip
he sees aragorn on his knees
kip wields a sword fighting his way towards aragorn
he takes one ape across the chest
whaml another ape in the neck
he grabs aragorn and starts to drag him out of the melee
the ape sharpshooter has kip in his sights
his finger reaches for the trigger
he starts to squeeze sswhishl the sound of an arrow
whackl it buries itself in the sharpshooters neck
he falls out of the tree will
he stands almost at the top of the gorge lowering a crossbow
he looks down at kips men the apes vastly superior in numbers are swarming forward driving the tribesmen back
on a ridge below him four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder
a flash of fire then ka bam
apes are rushing forward
they hear the explosion
several apes turn the huge boulder split into chunks flies towards them
the apes scatter
smashl the chunks knock apes aside like skittles
but theres more of them behind spilling in to the gorge over running it swirls past drak
he looks up he sees will on the ridge silhouetted against the sky
drak snarls deep in his throat
he wheels his horse and gallops hard towards a trail that winds up among the boulders
will moves fast along the top of the ridge
he stops looking down on the river
on the other side nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river
will shades hil ayes the water glistens with iridescent colors
he realizes its oil
the current carries it straight towards the platform in the river
the warriors of the rainbow tribe unaware are still aboard firing at the apes on the ford
will turns fait wa whip pan along the shoreline
he sees what he feared two apes below him with a fire burning
they slot flaming arrows into their crossbows will unslings his crossbow steadies himself and fires ks whack
the arrow rips through one apes neck
he pitches forward heed first into the fire
the other ape hurls himself aside diving for cover
will re loads
the side of the apes head is just visible behind a rock
if will makes this its going to be a helluva shot
his finger curls around the trigger right behind him the sound of hooves
will spins its drak charging towards him
he raises the gatling gun will aims at the big apes throat and fires
the arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed forearm
the gatling gun flies from his hand
theres no time for will to re load he turns and runs
drak charges down on him
he draws a harpoon out of its scabbard
will scrambles over a crest nothing but thin air
drak has him square in his sights
he draws back his arm about to hurl the harpoon
will throws himself forward will falls down down down
drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge
he looks over will plunges towards the river flowing fast below the ford
will cannonballs into the water and disappears
drak stares down trying to catch sight of him
a tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current
a pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it
wills head follows
gasping catching his breath he looks upstream the water pours over the weir
a flaming arrow arcs through the air
the ape on the shore has done his job erupts in flames as the arrow hits it
the whole surface of the river is suddenly transformed into a raging blaze
the rainbow leader and his men turn
they see a wall of flame racing towards them
several warriors dive into the water swimming for the shore whoosh
the flames engulf them
a wall of fire sweeps over the wooden platform
like macabre shadows we see the dancing shapes of the dying warriors
the current pulls will down the river
he looks back the molten fire spills over the weir
anguished screams are carried on the wind
a pillar of black oily smoke rises up high into the sky the platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women children and old folks
diamond and strider stand together
all of them stare down at the river valley
the pillar of smoke rises higher
diamond turns the woman is standing on the highest platform
diamond follows the direction of her outstretched arm
a group of warriors followed by their women folk and children are coming round the mountain path
their leader wears a golden fur and a head dress of aurochs horns
its the tribe of the antelope
a chorus of chattering voices
the new arrivals are surrounded by members of their sister tribes
the leader of the antelope stands in the center listening to a woman kips wife
whatever shes saying is lost in the hubbub
instantly the voices die
kips wife doesnt answer she walks forward and points to the pillar of smoke
the antelope leader turns to his warriors
we go now
stand on the platform watching several old men lower the drawbridge
it locks into place
the antelope warriors cross it and disappear down a narrow trail
the rest of the antelope tribe move towards the cave
diamond turns away then she stops
something has caught her eye
she stares at the crowd of women and children heading into the cave
what is it
diamond doesnt answer she tenses
in the milling crowd of brown bodies she sees it again a flash of gold
it s sunlight on blonde hair
holy god shes herel its not a woman its a child
she grabs a rope ladder ignores the rungs and slithers down it
helps her mother set up camp
she is about years old tawny haired taller and straighter backedthan any of her people
she looks like us
diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth
the young girl turns
for a moment she and diamond stare at one another separated by a hundred thousand years but so similar they can both see themselves in the other
whats your name
the girls mother stares amazed to see someone who looks like her child
her name is aiv
realizing of course
my people have a name like that eve is how we say it
the mother nods the sound seems to please her
diamond puts out her arms and indicates the young girl
the mother smiles giving her permission
diamond puts her arms around eve
softly ive come a long way to find you
eve looks at her wide eyed innocent
to keep you safe
she holds her tight
the mother catches diamonds eye
do you have children
diamond shakes her head no
the mother cant hide her disappointment
i was hoping you had a son
aivs a sweet girl
shes the child of my heart
but the way she looks nobody will want her as a mate
before diamond can answer theres a commotion outside the cave
she turns to look strider and tribes people are running out into the daylight
rise up from i mountain path
whatevers causing it is hidden from view by the peaks and crags
the tribal people gather on vantage points watching it come closer
strider cocks his head listening
a shadow of fear passes across his face
horses mean apesi panic sweeps through the tribes people
women grab their children young kids start screaming old men and boys scramble for weapons
diamond weaves through the flying mass of people
she swings up on to a platform beside strider
he points coming into view on the mountain path running and stumbling dragging their wounded are whats left of the antelope warriors
their women folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates
the warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge
nobody raised it when they left several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it
they haul on the ropes and pulleys
it starts to swing upwards here he comes drak
hes galloping hard at the head of his cavalry battle scarred and bloodied
he sees the drawbridge starting to lift
he doesnt pause he whips his horse into a thundering gallop
the bridge rises higher
draks horse leaps
it soars across the crevasse the giddylng drop stretches out below and lands on the lifting bridge
the men and boys stare in horror
orak charges down on them
they back away all except one boy not even in his teens who stands his ground
draks sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist
the other tribesmen run
the drawbridge falls back into place
the ape cavalry charge across it
an ape horseman flies across the platform
he leaps off the edge on to a lower platform
diamonds right in front of him
she throws herself aside grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto she looks across the broad area in front of the cave apes everywhere weapons flashing people screaming
a young boy tries to out run an ape warrior its gray beard
the young boy hasnt got a chance
gray beard lashes out at him with a stock whip
it curls around the boys ankle tripping him
the boy looks up he tries to shield his face
the horses hooves smash down diamond looks away unable to watch
she sees eve
the young girl is at the front of the cave spinning in panic
her mother runs towards her
the mother doesnt see gray beard galloping towards her
diamond screams a warning but its just one more crv in the commotion
gray beard raises a short handled lance and hurls it like a javelin
it hits the mother in the small of the back straight through the spine
she pitches forward dead
eve screams and runs towards her mother
diamond leaps off the rock ledge diamond runs faster than shes ever run sprinting to grab eva
drak wheels his horse he sees diamond
his lip curls back and he smiles one of the blue eyes
and a woman
he leaps his horse forward grab the female
gray beard is off his horse
diamond runs towards him
he raises a crossbow
drak charges down on her from behind
he holds the harpoon at his shoulder
he aims at her legs
diamond races on her only thought to save eve
itll never happen shes as good as deadgray beards in front aiming
draks right behind
he hurls the harpoon
strider swings through the air
he clings to one of the rope ladders its like tarzan except hes an ape
he grabs diamond by the scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way
draks harpoon skims past them
gray beard stares in amazement at the woman flying through the air
but thats not his big surprise with diamond out of the way the harpoon is flying straight at him
he screams as it rips into his throat
strider diamond clutched under his arm lands on a ledge high above the fight
diamond turns fast and looks back eve crouches over the body of her mother
the womans mouth is frozen in an anguished scream her dead eyes stare straight ahead
eva shakes her desperately hoping for some sign of life
eve starts to cry
a dark shadow falls across her
she looks up its drak
he reaches down and grabs her by the neck
he beats his chest with his fist and raises her up above his head like a trophy
diamond anguished tries to go to the little girl but strider holds her in an iron grip
he swings diamond off her feet and leaps for an overhanging branch of a tree
he jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from sight
floats at the shore of the river
it is what remains of the firing platform the bodies of several of the rainbow warriors still on board
smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest
the only sound is the whinnying of a horse it has a broken leg
again and again it tries to get to its feet
a solitary figure makes his way through the shadows
its will soaking wet from the river
he stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at the carnage all around him
so much for knowledge and science
this is where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand their bodies lie huddled together in a jumble
will stares at them anguish on his face
softly to himself i was so sure
he kneels and turns one of the bodies over
its kip speared through the chest
a shaft of sunlight hits the crescent of light
it glints on his lifeless throat
gently he closes kips glassy eyes
sound behind him
will hurls himself aside grabbing for a weapon
he looks up its the lookout battle stained and weary
their eyes meet quietly you said wed win
will just nods he knows
you gave us hope that was the cruelest thing
the lookout kneels and crosses kips hands across his chest
he reaches down and removes the crescent of light
he turns to will get the weapons you need
the apesil be coming back for their dead
will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies
rise into the sky the eagles nest is on fire
drak and his apes make their way along a narrow mountain trail theyve put the humans camp to the torch
with them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly many of them in tears
they carry long poles over which are slung their dead and dying
we crane up to high up the mountain side
standing underneath it hidden in shadow are diamond and strider
they look down on the mountain trail
diamond sees eve
the young girl stumbles along the road tied by a length of chain to draks saddle
shes bruised and bleeding her ankles shackled barely able to walk
diamond looks at her close to tears but theres nothing she can do
she watches the convoy wind along the trail
boomi the fire must have hit a store of gunpowder an explosion rips through the eagles nest blowing out the side of one of the peaks
diamond watches the dust climb into the sky
all her hopes seem to be going with it
will and the lookout are wading around a knob of land that protects one end of a tiny beach
will sees a fire burning on the sand a cave opening off the beach piles of stones like burial mounds
what is this place
its called the crossroads of the fallen king its where our forefathers are laid to rest
its sacred to us anyone whos still alive will make their way here
they wade closer to the beach
in the firelight they see groups of tribesmen survivors of the battle
women and children the lucky few who managed to flee the eagles nest are binding the warriors wounds
they look up everyone falls silent at the sight of will
as he comes closer he recognizes a woman sitting alone its kips wife
shes come from he goes towards her passing the other tribes people
nobody greets him
they just watch him pass
he stops in front of kips wife
her eyes are red from crying
rm sorry about your mate
she says nothing she just stares at him
will keeps going ive been to the eagles nest
i was looking for the woman i was with
we searched but
he pauses what happened was she captured
i threw myself off a platform
i dont know what happened to anyone
he gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire
we dont hear what he says but we know what he is asking
one after another they shake their heads no they know nothing of diamond
shimmers on the water
will sits on a rock that straggles into the water
his face is grim his heart heavy with grief
hes making something with his hands twisting and turning them but in the dim light we cant see what it is
a shaft of moonlight falls on a semi circle of rock slabs standing on their end its like stonehenge
the surviving tribes people are gathered in their shadow
its half a day since the battle
any that survived would be here by now we are all that remains of the seven tribes
the ranger himself died on the field
we must decide ourselves what to do
silence for a moment
they have spent too long following a leader for discussion to come easily
finally a wounded warrior speaks like you say kip is dead
maybe its a sign the rangers have left middle earth forever
perhaps its telling us to do the same
a young woman probably in her s shakes her head
leave the valley
this is where the eagles fly
this is their home
nobody can live without their totem we all know that
nobody can live with the apes eitherl if we stay here we die
but if we travel beyond the tower of the moon weve got a chance
who knows maybe our totems will follow us
theres a murmur of agreement
it grows louder tribes people nodding their heads
now we see what will has been making its a boat made out of twigs and leaves
a tiny hull and a gaff rigged mast
he leans forward and drops it in the water
he watches the current carry it away
farther and farther it bobs out into the river softly im sorry billie
i should have listened it wasnt our war
all you wanted was a baby
he cant go on
he watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land
the current carries the boat past a jagged boulder
an apes hand reaches out and picks it up
he lifts it up to look more closely
we see his face its strider
he turns the toy over in his hand looking at it quizzically
he hands it to diamond wading along behind him it looks like someone made it
its a boat its gaff rigged
realizing oh jesus
she plunges forward wading as fast as she can
will is walking up the beach
he stops listening
he hears it again his name
he turns and heads towards the river
he sees diamond coming round the headland splashing through the water
they look at one another then they both move forward arms stretching out
they wrap their arms around each other
softly i thought id lost you
i thought you were dead
they keep holding each other
how did you find this place
his father was a tracker
weve been following a trail for hours
will looks over her shoulder strider is wading towards them
he saved my life will
will goes to greet him
the man and the ape embrace
thank you my friend thank you
what did you expect
you would have done the same for me
as will puts a log on the fire
from inside the cave we hear the murmur of voices as the argument goes back and forth
both diamond and strider are wrapped in furs their clothes are laid out next to the fire drying
will speaks to diamond some times when we want something so bad we can take a thing and twist it in our head
youre sure about this billie
im pregnant will im not crazy
shes not like them shes a mutation
evolutions always trying to improve on itself
its turned out a child that can walk taller and run faster one whose brain pan holds a mind that can think laterally
ive seen her will
ive held her in my arms she was us
will looks at her
theres no doubt he believes her
you said she was with drak
on a chain
its two days march to the city
was she wounded can she make it
she can make it
a beat she looks at him will
before he can answer the old man and several others come down the beach its decided were leaving the valley forever
turns to strider your people have won the seven tribes of middle earth have been broken
long may their spirits haunt you he turns back to will you and your mate can travel with u but weve got misery enough to carry
our hearth is not home to ny ape
then its not home to us
the apes better than any man ive known
the old mans lip curls in a sneer
he shrugs and walks away
go with them
will everyone needs their own kind
will and diamond newer almost simultaneously no
of course we cant
to will the city will
will and strider turn nd look at her incredulous
we call it a city its more like a fortress billie
it cant be done
the three of you got out everyone thought that was impossible too
we were lucky
but thats the trouble with luck it runs out
i dont want to be back in the city when it does
what about eve what do we do just forget about her
maybe we cant stop the apes giving her the disease but theyll have to turn her loose
thats the only way she can infect others
so we lay a plan and we find her
then its our job to stop her having children
if we can do that it cant be passed on through the race
she shrugs thats the only thing i can think of
how long will that take less than twenty five days
diamond so what of my child
we have to face it youre going to lose it
she turns away trying to keep her emotions in check
will comes to her side we cant take our eye off the goal
if we solve this you can have other children
not if wa throw our lives away though
whose will whose children
she looks at him
he meets her gaze
guess thats your call
what sort of father would you make
you told me once the only thing that matters is knowledge
science and technology can only take you so far in the end its our humanity that maners
thats what makes us great
youre a wonderful scientist will but what sort of person are you
what would you do if it was your child
she looks straight into his eyes
finally he answers
softly i dont know how to do it not the humanity part thats easy compared to getting into the city
i just dont know
he picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground
it sits on a river
theres only one bridge heavily guarded
even if we could cross it all the ridges and roads are patrolled theres one place thats not
both diamond and will turn to him
he takes the stick down here its called funeral rock
it sits at the bottom of the temple
from there you can make your way into the city
even so you still have to cross the river
he draws an arrow across the water illustrating the problem
diamond is about to speak but she looks at will hes staring at the arrow an idea half formed is starting to form
maybe there is a way
across the river i mean
will turns to her youll love it theres barely any science to it at all
is that right were going
their eyes meet and hold
he smiles at her
travel fast along a high ridge
the sun a fiery disc rises right behind them
we recognize their physiques will in the lead then diamond and strider
as they cross the face of the sun we dissolve to on the buildings and terraces of the apes city
will and his two comrades are on a bluff looking down
the sound of music and laughter drifts towards them on the night air
suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out of a stone chimney
theyve started up the furnace
softly let the games begin
the apes kill their prisoners for sport
the furnace takes care of the bodies
diamond sickened by it turns to look at will
already hes heading off leading them down nrrow trail
much closer to the city
will and the others move fast along it deep in the shadows
the river thunders by below them separating them from the city
the only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge
ape guards patrol it
only diamond pauses to look et it
will and strider urge her forward
it disappears from view
flies through the air
tied to its shaft trailing out behind is a rope made from vines
will lowers a crossbow
he watches the arrow fly through the mist and spray races by just below and pours over the falls of no return
the arrow buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank
will and strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree
it stretches from one side of the river to the other
all it has to do is hold
will turns to diamond
he shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls you first
well be right behind
diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope
she looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind blown spray the roaring water rushes by the rope hangs like a thread
theres fear on her face you ready
it sure as shit aint kansas is it
diamond throws herself forward
her feet leave the platform
hand over hand she goes out across the river
will watchel for a moment then launches himself his hands wrap around the rope
strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps
the line bows under his weight
diamondl feet drop closer to the water
she looks down the mass of black water flecked with foam rushes past
will looks ahead diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray
shes dripping wet hauling herself forward the sound of the falls is deafening
right below her a huge swirling hole opens up
its a whirlpool
she starts to swing across it
joltl the arrow pulls part way out of the tree
the steel shaft shivers but it holds
everything seems okay
one of the strands of the vine breaks everything bucks and shudders
she looks down straight into the vortex of the whirlpool
her blood runs cold she freezes
she doesnt seem to hear
her eyes are wide with fear staring down down into the whirlpools bottomless well
she doesnt react
strider watches as will tries to catch up
the rope is swaying so much its agonizingly slow
diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness
the whirlpool seems to be swallowing everything even the moonlight billiai what about the baby
the word hits her
she pulls her eyes from the swirling death
she looks at will
move billiel nowl she understands
she starts to pull herself forward
will slumps with relief the arrow moves another inch out of the trunk
the rope fixed to its shaft is strained to breaking point
but still everything holds
one of the guards patrols the bridge
out of the corner of his eye flash of something
he looks towards the falls
the other guard joins him
they peer through the night at the spray rising from the falls
they see it again above the river a flash of light on metal
the keep watching
an eddy of wind clears the mist for a second
they see strider going hand over hand along the rope moonlight glinting on his crossbow
another strand of the rope breaks
we follow it as it unravels past diamond and will
before we get to strider it stops a section of the rope is so badly frayed it cant go any farther
its going to break any moment
a siren wails
theyve seen usl will looks up river to the bridge
through a hole in the mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling
a whole squadron runs to join them
diamond throws herself forward she makes the shorel will and strider give it everything theyve got
striders first hand passes the frayed section
hes following it with his second snap
the whole rope breaks
will closest to the shore plunges into the ripping current
but at leait hes clinging to the rope with both hands
striders in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of one paw
will turns and reaches for him
save yourselfl diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in
the weight of the men and the current make it impossible
all she can do is try and hold them
striders fingers are slipping free
will grabs him man and ape hand to paw
will holds him
well both die
let gol will shakes his head no
hanging on to the rope one handed the current tearing at his body he tries to haul strider in
an arrow flies past just missing them and plunges into the water
the apes on the bridge are firing
another minute well both be dead
do it willl will tries again to drag strider to the rope
another arrow flies through the mist and spray even closer
strider reaches out with his free hand
he starts to prize wills fingers loose if nothing else i made it to the falls no return
will realizes nothing is going to stop strider
the sacred words strider what are the words
in the beginning
in the beginning was the word and the word wes god
in wonder you know the words
youll walk in the next world strider
how do you know
ive seen the future havent i
strider smiles at him a smile of perfect peace
good bye will
take care of billie
he twists wills last finger free
he drops the swirling river carries him away
will is close to tears but he wont let himself cry
two more arrows sizzle past and the word was god
yea though i walk through the valley of death i will fear no evil
strider spins down the river through the spray and foam
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever
strider one arm raised plunges over the falls
we see whos been coordinating the firing
archers are kneeling on the bridge trying to sight a target through the foaming water and clouds of mist
drak never taking his eyes off of the river draws back the massive spring of his crossbow and reloads
diamond ia hauling on the rope pulling it in
will up to his neck in water tows himself along it
his feet find a footing he starts to scramble up the bank
diamond goes towards him just for a moment the mist clears
moments long enough
draks seen him
in one fluid movement he adjusts his aim and fires diamond is almost in wills arms
the arrow rips into wius back through his ribs
he pitches forward
he falls into her arms
the mist closes around them
the survivors of the seven tribes travel fast along a forest trail
all of them are burdened down with possessions weary from the road they are leaving the valley
kips wife and the old man are in the lead
they pass through the arch out into a clearing
in the middle of it is a fire shadows camped around it kips wife and the other survivors stop in fear
one of the shadows rises from the
bathed in moonlight almost ghost like he comes towards them
kips wife moves forward and embraces him we thought you were dead
hunted but not dead
a dozen of us were driven back in the battle he indicates his men
they are coming forward greeting the survivors
the young woman sees her mate she cries out
they hold each other
for three days a squadron of apes have tracked us
last night we ambushed them
were heading now for the eagles nest
softly there is no eagles nest
aragorn stares at her not wanting to believe it
were all thats left of the seven tribes
grief wells up inside aragorn
we hold on his face
all of the tribes people are gathered around it
there is no one else aragorn you are the ranger
shaking his head no
we must all follow the trail we think best
youve decided yours
for me ill go to the city of the apes and take what revenge i can
ill go alone but like the traveler i think death will be the only thing i find there
then it will find us too
warriors follow their ranger
thats always been the way of it in middle earth
but nothings the same now
think of the women folk
what will become of them
youre right theres so few of us now nothing is the same
you must allow the women to follow too
aragorn but women cant fight
kips wife women have never been allowed to fight
that doesnt mean they cant
all the women nod their assent
the men smile agreeing
everyone waits for aragorn to decide
a beat then he nods his head and smiles
the tribes people start to cheer
the lookout steps forward
from out of the folds of his fur he takes the crescent of light
all of the tribe stare at it
i found it on the battlefield
there were those who said the rangers had left middle earth forever i didnt know what to do with it
he hands it to aragorn
the whole tribe watches as the proud man once again ties the talisman of his rank around his neck
douse the fire
the seven tribes are going to war
the apes carrying torches search the river bank and surrounding cliffs
we push in on a pool of darkness behind them will and diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree
they have done their best to dress wills wound but hes obviously in a lot of pain you cant go on will not like this
what about the baby
ill keep going ill try and get eve
dont be ridiculous he starts to haul himself to his feet
his face twists in pain he has to stop
look at you you can barely walk
he puts out his hand needing i boost up
if i can just get up help me
diamond shakes her head no
they look at one another
dont do this to me pleasel youve done enough more than anyone else could
youre one of the finest men ive ever known but its over will
youre going to have to wait
now its my turn she grabs her weapons and starts to leave
will makes it to his feet billie
shes almost through the tangled roots
i made a mistake once i went on a journey with someone i loved
at the end i let her go into danger alone
where was that berkeley will
she turns and looks at him
he nods his head yes
i knew id found the chemical key
i was working with three young researchers
one of them was a woman called ali conoily
we were engaged
they were the ones that went into the tanks
i didnt know as much as i thought i did
they died in there
why didnt you go will
we all wanted to
it was a great adventure
wa drew lots for it
i should never have agreed but we were young and like the young we thought life would last forever
robert plant died too didnt he in a way
the experiment was unauthorized
there was an inquiry
they said the theory had no basis
ludicrous was a word they used
my career had gone up like a rocket
it came down like the stick
i couldnt find work anywhere will robinson that was your joke i guess
you were lost in space were you
yeah but i never realized itd be so appropriate
they sort of smile at one another
had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong so what though
it was just a mind game
but ive learnt a lot of things the most important is that sometimes you get a second chance
a second chance for a lot of things he looks straight at her
they hold each others eyes
and when you do you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go
ive got the heart billie
its my body thats failing me
neither one of them moves
give me your hand will
she helps him to his feet
its several hours before dawn
in the gloom whooshl kips wife rides a flying fox across a precipitous drop
she lands on the other side of a jagged ravine
the rest of the tribe all heavily armed are waiting there
they turn end run fading into the trees
juts out into the roaring river
will and diamond scramble out of the darkness and land on the rock
wills face is haggard with pain but he forces himself forward
hes loosening up
going faster as he moves they pass through the huge legs of the stone ape into the temple
torches flicker on the walls
from somewhere close by muffled we hear the sound of a crowd
a young ape barely in his teens stands in the middle of the room almost naked
his face is painted with strange ochre markings
a circle of ape warriors watch as ma gog lifts a slender blade
intoning words in some strange tongue he slices the blade across the teenagers forehead
the teenager winces but he doesnt cry out this is his manhood ceremony
the sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we dont see them
the prisoners from the eagles nest are crowded into the corrals
one of the gates is thrown open
three ape guards enter
they push the tribes people aside and grab a year old boy
his mother clings to him screaming
one of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the corral
like a small bullring in the center of the stables
now we see the crowd apes all males sit in the bleachers
they roar as a door is opened and the young tribe boy is pushed into the ring
he looks around the arena yelling screaming apes
terror on his face
an even louder roar goes up
the boy turns the teenage ape steps out of a tunnel the ochre markings on his face like war paint the blood barely dried on his forehead
he carries spears and a club
one of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the boy
the teenage ape moves in on him
he is a warrior now this is going to be his first kill
the boys mother is huddled down being comforted by other tribes people
a huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck
the sound carries over to drak is alone walking a high ridge
he stops looking down on the twinkling lights
the city is virtually deserted but drak doesnt move hes uneasy troubled by something he cant put a name to
the five baby apes sit on cots
they watch as doctor zora inserts a syringe into the smallest apes arm
the baby starts to cry
doctor zora comforts her as she draws out a cup of blood
she turns to her assistant ben guri is the girl animal ready
theyre doing it now
eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an operating table
he and another guard start to strap her down
the vet works at the bench heating a steel needle over a flame
its the same sort of catheter that was used on will one end of the needle attached to a long tube
a knock on the door
that must be zors with the blood
one of the guards goes and unbolts the door
he recoils its will
he fires the first bolt from a double barreled crossbow
it takes the guard in the chest
he and diamond dive into the room
eve starts hollering
the second guard is wheeling crossbow rising
he rifle butts diamond across the head
her weapon goes flying
the guard is aiming
will is on the floor tumbling
barely time to aim on his back firing overhead he shoots whack
the arrow hits the guard dead in the heed
the vet grabs the first guards fallen crossbow
he aims at will
diamond screams a warning but theres nothing will can do hes struggling to reload one handed because of his wounds
diamond unarmed scoops the red hot syringe off the bench
the vet reaches for the trigger
diamond leaps forward
she drives the syringe into his chest
the vet stands goggle eyed
diamond must have found his heart a torrent of blood pours down the clear tube
it spills on to the floor
the vet topples forward
will cuts throughthe straps that tie eve to the table
drak turns a corner of the building
he stops and touches the ground with his finger
he lifts it to his mouth and tastes it
he rises to his feet following trail of blood
is ripped from a bracket
he shines it down into a stone well
the flame splits the darkness
floating in the water at the bottom of the well is an ape guard dead an arrow through his throat
the tribe boy is sprawled in the dust bleeding badly from a rip across his ribs
his spear lies next to him a wooden shield raised across his head
the teenage ape rains blows down on it with a sword
the apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly
the shield splinters
the sword slices the boys arm kill
the boy stares up the teenage smiles and raises his sword
the alarm sounds
then officers are on their feet yelling orders
ape soldiers grab their weapons heading for the doors
the teenage ape looks around robbed of his moment
the boy sees his chance
he raises his spear and drives it deep into the apes groin
he staggers and falls on top of the boy
the apes pour out of the arena
the siren carries over to wills got eve slung over his shoulder
theyre stumbling down a corridor past other labs and research rooms
they burst through a sat of doors into at the back of the hall of learning
its deep in shadow
from behind they hear the sound of pounding feet
will looks around not sure which way to go
he glances across a terrace the doors to the stables fly open
the ape warriors charge out
can you ride
diamond nods her head yes
he thrusts eve into her hands go for the stables
head for the eagles nest
ill try to join you there
diamond hesitates she doesnt want to leave him
what are you going to do
now go billie
rops down the side of the ravine
standing on it are nazgul and about a dozen praetorian guards
nazgul looks down torches and fires in drums are lighting up the streets and terraces
ape soldiers are running everywhere searching
the flame thrower rolls along a street
the drivers canopy is hidden by flapping tarpaulins
in the chaos nobody pays it any attention
nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them
thats strange why does drak need the flame
suddenly he realizel
he turns screaming up at the apes controlling the mechanism
stopl take it backl dead guard is draped over the side of the machine blood dripping from his headwill is in the cabin working the controls
he sees the elevator slow in mid descent
he throws a lever forward
for a moment nothing
a huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel
two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes
nazgul is wheeling around in a panic
the flame hits them
the whole wooden structure catches fire
we see the apes through the flames struggling and writhing
the ropes burn through
the blazing structure plummets down smash
it hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes
ape soldiers standing nearby stare in shock
the smell of roasted ape fills the air
shes on the floor of the stables deep in shadow
shes scared looking ahead the first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors
we see an ape guard keys jangling from his waist on petrol
he hears something a rock falling a rustle of movement
raising his weapon he moves towards a pool of black shadow past a pile of rocks into an alcove
diamond rises out of the rocks behind him
he spins shes got her cross bow raised
point blank range
she nails him
are shackled in the corrals
they see diamond running out of the shadows towards them
she tossel them the keys arm yourselves
find will he needs youl she turns and goes
the prisoners start to unlock the chains
smiles as diamond races out of the shadows sweeps her up and keeps running
the teenage ape and the boy lie where they fell their spilt blood staining the dust
the boys mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son
she drags off the ape
her sons eyes are closed his arms lacerated his chest wounded and crusted with blood
she stares at him he doesnt move
she starts to sob
the boys eyes flicker open
they look at one another
the mothey gathers him into her arms
the sound of a horse
the mother turns fearful
she looks across the arena through a railing diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals
eves clutching the saddle in front of her hair flying her eyes sparkling with exhilaration
the stallion gallops faster
the prisoners unchaining the last of their comrades turn and look
its a magnificent sight
diamond is crouched iow over the flying horse
straight ahead a railed fence part of the corral
she leaps the horse over it
in front another hurdle
again she does it
the prisoners stare
diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables
the crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire
ape city is burning
the flame stands on a steep incline its back wedged against the wall of a terrace
whooshl fire shoots out of its barrel as will keeps a horde of ape soldiers at bay
the soldiers turn drak surrounded by the praetorian guard gallops straight towards them
hel not stopping for anything the soldiers scramble aside
will sees drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke
they look like the horsemen of the apocalypse
as will throws the lever we sea a primitive gauge above his head
its in the red whoosh
the tongue of flame shoots through the smoke
it touches the guards with a deadly kiss throwing them screaming from their horses
but drak blasts through will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke
he peers through it drak charges towards him
will hits the lever again
the flame erupts from the barrel
then it dies out of fuel
drak gallops forward
he raises weapon a shoulder mounted harpoon
he aims will throws himself aside
he smashes both hands down on a lever on the floor
a hiss of steam
the machine lurches forward drak tries to get a clear shot at will
the machine gathers speed down the incline coming straight towards drak
he veers his horse aside and wheels around
he charges alongside the cabin its empty will clings to the outside of the flame as it roars across the smoke filled square
hes out of sight of drak but not for long
the ape and his stallion loom into view behind the machine will scrambles back into the cabin apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square
drak is at full gallop veering from one side of the flame to the other
will clambers back and forth cat and mouse at full tilt
drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine
he stands up in the stirrups the harpoon clamped to his shoulder hes going on board
the flame flies out of the square and down a street
an ape throws himself into a doorway just in time drak steadies himself about to jump
suddenly his horse whinnies wildly
drak looks ahead holy shit
theyre heading straight for the front of a blazing house
drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins
will hurls himself back into the cabin arms shielding his head
the flame crashes through the front wall the barrel of the flame acts like a battering ram it blasts through the walls in a shower of burning timbers
it crashes through the kitchen and stops in a courtyard
will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground
a yell goes up apes are coming through the adjoining houses
will turns and heads down an alleyway
diamonds horse flies down a street a high terrace towers on one side a row of burning buildings on the other
the road turns right
she swings around it apes
a platoon of them right in front of her
she screams at eve hold on
she throws herself aside pulling on the reins
the horse spins in a u turn grazing past a burning building
diamond gallops back the way she came
the wall of a burning building in front of her collapses
blazing beams block the road
the horse shies away
diamond wheels him around the apes race into the road
she looks around desperately shes trapped
she grabs eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her shell be safer there
she spurs the horse forward and crouches iow in the saddle shes going to charge straight through the apes
they drop to one knee the firing position and raise their weapons
a dozen crossbowl aim straight at diamond
theres no way out she flies towards them
whizzl the sound of arrows
but its not the apes they go down like nine pins
diamond looks up aragorn has arrived
backlit by the rising sun the men and women of the tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes
nobody fires better than kips wife
diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the road
stands on a terrace his cloak blowing in the wind his one cruel eye blazing with anger
flanked by two ape warriors he looks down on the burning buildings
the freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables
ma gog sees will hes running along the rooftops leaping from one building to the next
ma gog points at him yelling at apes in the streets below kill him
in the name of god kill himl sswhish
the blade of a sword cleaves through frame
it cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist
ma gog spins its aragorn armed to the teeth behind them
the second warrior goes for him
aragorn has dropped the sword
he raises a crossbow and fires
the bolt shatters the apes armor and buries itself in his chest
ma gog swirls aside his cloak
in his good hand he holds a double edged sword
aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath ma gogs arcing blow
he lunges with a short handled spear for my people
it takes ma gog in the gut
his one eye bulges
aragorn rips the spear out and this for my daughterl he drives the spear into the high priests heart
the cruel eye flickers and dies
will has seen it all
he screams behind you
its drak on horseback thundering down on him
but the leader of the seven tribes knows no fear only the memory of his lost child
he raises his second spear and charges straight at drak
the huge ape levels the shoulder mounted harpoon
he pulls the trigger
the powerful spring on the barrel releases the harpoon trails a length of rope behind it wham
the harpoon smashes through aragorns chest
he dies as he falls
will stares in anguish
he turns away he sees diamond
shes at full gallop eve clinging to her back charging along a road several terraces below
shes got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom
will looks across at drak hes seen her too
for a moment the two of them stare at one another
wills face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he carries
draks lip curls in a sneer he knows hes going to win
he beats his chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace going for diamond
will runs as fast as his body will let him along the rooftop
an ape mother cowers in a corner her two children clutched to her the sounds of battle all around
she looks up in terror smash
wills feet blast through the roof
he lands on the floor crossbow raised but not st her
framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on horseback
will shoots him and runs for the horse
and eve fly down charred street
they head towards a large open square
smoke and dust swirl through the air
the freed prisoners are fighting ape infantry
drak races past the battle
the rope from the harpoon is tied around the saddle dragging aragorns body through the dust
he looks ahead diamond gallops across the square
drak whips his horse forward on a high terrace
flying around a corner will
his coat is billowing the horses mane streaming in the wind
he hits the straight away and gallops even faster
he looks down on the road below diamond is ahead but drak is gaining on her
will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock
eve clings tight to diamonds waist
the little girl looks back drak is thundering behind them pennants snapping in the wind armor glinting on the horses chest
its an awesome sight
drak has the reins in his teeth
hes using both hands to reload the harpoon
diamond sees the bridge dead ahead
heavily armed apes have barricaded it
she curses and yanks the bridle
the horse sweeps around an island in the center of the road a huge monument to some dead ape
she gallops back the way she came almost passing drak
he charges round the island
he looks down to the lower road diamond and drak are coming back towards him
he turns the horse around back into the tunnel
whooshl he flies out the other end into daylight
he looks over his shoulder hes in front of them but thirty feet too high
he digs his heels into the horses flanks over a iow wall they fly
god knows where it goes into a dead end cul de sac just above the roadway
apesi two of them are guarding the claw and the bells
will fires from the shoulder he drops the first ape
the second ape aims at him
will raises another crossbow
they fire almost simultaneously
will throws himself aside out of the saddle
the horse rears and bolts
will looks up from the dirt the ape has wills arrow embedded in his chest
he falls forward dead
will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below
diamond and eve clinging to the horse for dear life race towards him
will grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload
he cant it takes the strength of both arms to cock it diamonds horse is lathered in sweat almost blown
eve looks over her shoulder her eyes wide with fear drak is close behind gaining at every step
will leaps from the balls on to the claw
drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder
he sights down the barrel
eve sees the weapon lock on to their backs
she screams a warning et diamond billie
diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road
drak loses her in his sights
he follows her over the wagon
will is in the drivers seat
he throws a lever nothing happens
he tries another the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the road
aims the harpoon
hes got eve end diamond one behind the other in his sights
a bargain two for the price of onel will spins a small steering wheel
drak is close behind diamond
the harpoons massive spring is coiled
draks finger curls around the trigger about to fire
suddenly he screams dropping right in front coming straight towards him are the opening jaws of the claw
keep your hands off her you dirty ape
the jaws lock clean around draks waist plucking him off the saddle and lifting him up into the air
hes still got the harpoon
he sees will at the control
he swings the barrel round will hits a switch
wrong one nothing happens
draks got him in his sights
his finger finds the trigger will throws another switch
the jaws start to close
drak tries to pull the trigger he cant his body is twisting
the jaws are crushing him
he musters all of his strength and tries to fire
he and will look straight at one another
drsks finger starts to slide off the trigger apes stare up at their warrior lord clamped in the clew
he let out a blood curdling scream
the bottom half of his torso everything from the waist down falls towards the ground
maybe its just the wind but the legs still seem to be kicking
the apes reel beck in horror
with mighty battle cry the tribes people the prisoners end aregoml followers hurl themselves forward attacking
the apes break end start to run
diamond end eve have dismounted
diamond stumbles forward will is coming towards her
she holds out her arms and they embrace
neither one says a word they just hold each other tight
almost obscure the setting sun
will and diamond stand on the iron bridge watching the tribes people
theyve harnessed horses to ropes tied around the statues on the avenue of idols one after another the stone monoliths come crashing down
if nothing else we helped the tribes take back their valley
our valley too billia
she looks at him questioning
theres one thing i never told you i never worked out how to get back
she smiles at him
a small point
but give me some credit
im a scientist i knew that
in wonder but you came anyway
that was love
for the baby
she shakes her head
for the both of you
they stare into each others eyes
i only have one regret
well never know if we succeeded
of course we will
youre pregnant if the babys born alive well know it worked
the surf rolls in on a golden beach
at the waters edge a line of footprints
we follow them to find will on top of a rocky cliff
hes building something out of iron and rock and sand but we cant make out what it is
will he turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave
diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins
her belly is exposed heaw with the unborn child
eve crouches next to her trying to help
she nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts
from inside the cave we hear diamond scream
will kneels between diamonds legs
her face glistening with sweat is a mask of pain
she holdl eves hind tight and pushes
will half hidden by her upraised legs delivers the child
diamond raises herself up trying to see her child
neither she nor us can see its face
we push in on will
ha raises his hand and slaps the babys rump
ha raises his hand again suddenly the baby starts to cry
now we see the baby a perfect little boy
tears fill her eyes
she and will look at one another
he comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms
will and eve help diamond
she comes out of the cave still holding the baby
its magic hour they stand on a rock ledge looking at the ocean washed with color from the setting sun
we see what will was building
its sort of like a sculpture just the head and crown of the statue of liberty
she looks at him wondering why its to make sure we never forget where we came from
the baby starts to cry
will puts one arm each around diamond and eve
we pull back from them high up into the stars
the babys cry carries over
we see earth rise
in all this nothingness life
