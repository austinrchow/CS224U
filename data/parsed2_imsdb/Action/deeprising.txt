href b b deep rising deep rising formerly known as tentacle by steven sommers robert mark kamen extended revisions by robert mark kamen revised draft jan
st a flash of lightning rips the hollywood pictures logo away and we find ourselves in the middle of
the dark blue waters roil and boil and foam
an enormous japanese bathyscaphe free falls through the water
an autonomous fifteen man submersible
almost futuristic in its design
the nose cone is an amazing ultra high pressure plexi dome
lettering along the side tells us this is the shinkai
computer printed across the screen are the words the japanese captain watches a dld laser tracking system and barks one word questions to his japanese crew
the sailors work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers
the japanese science officers go over charts on the electronic position board a contiuously shifting graphic representation of the ocean contours below
behind them is an elaborate depth gauge with computerized graphics
read feet and dropping
the crew works at a fevered pitch
an alarm sounds as the depth gauge sounds feet
all eyes on the depth gauge
several science officers share excited looks
the excitement builds
even the captains weathered eyes widen
and then as the depth gauge hits feet below sea level the entire crew breaks into cheers whoops as it continues its descent it passes corroding metal drums leaking toxic
waste radioactive waste dumped in the depths away from prying eyes and populated areas
the vessel drops into the sulu basin
imagine the grand canyon under forty thousand feet of water
but the sulu basin is ten times the size of the grand canyon
down here ten thousand fathoms below the storm all is calm
the dual turbo props on the ear of the submersible kick on
the bathysaphe is now mobile
it glides down the side of an enormous rock face carefully avoiding massive sandstone pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below
the shinkai hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate
a robotic arm extends out from under the plexi dome
its hand is a high tech laser cutter
it approaches the plate steadies then fires a direct blue beam at the bedrock burns the rock into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern
another robotic arm reaches forward its claw rips out the cut rock from inside the pattern then takes the sample and sets it inside a hydro basket on the submersibles
a desolate barren spooky place
or so it would appear
the creepy foreboding musical score tells us otherwise
the shinkai enters a huge rock the captain and the science officers stare through the plexi dome and out into the freezing cobalt blue of the palawan trough
the music intensifies as they round each curve
then dead ahead is the end of the trough which is half blocked by a rock encrusted embankment
the music builds
the shinkai approaches the embankment
slowly starts to glide up the side
the captain and science officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness
they crest the embankment
and the plexi domed view fills with an unimaginable horror
as far as the eye can see the entire murky landscape is filled with whale bones
a valley of death
cluttered here and there carelessly flung about are the rusting hulks of several ships
seemingly ripped apart
clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts
the captain the science officers and the entire crew just stare frozen in place by the strange horror before them
the vessel cruises through the valley of death
everyone is nervously taking readings making calculations and adjusting equipment
gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking
several crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi dome
giant skeletons everywhere
the shinkai approaches an eerie looking rock formation
the robotic arm comes out
the laser cutter steadies aims then shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock
the captain and the science officers recoil as the inky stuff envelopes the plexi dome completely blotting out the view
the shinkai vanishes into a huge cloud of inky blood
we hold for a long ominous beat
and then like a slow motion earthquake large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift in the murky waters
whale bones topple and scatter
several feet under the ancient silt something is coming alive
everything outside the plexi dome is still black
everyone is staring at the position board which shows a large section of the ocean floor starting to move its contours incongruous with the rest of the graphic representation
the science officers look stunned
the captain barks commands
the crew leaps into high gear
then the captain reverses the trottle and petal to the metal he starts to back out
the inky blood swirls past the plexi dome
then suddenly and impossibly the submersible jerks to a halt
everybody goes ass over teacups
lots of yelling in japanese
the shinkai starts to rock and shake
something has a hold on it
more equipment shatters
men are thrown about
then it stops rocking
the sailors stop yelling
everything goes dead quiet
frightened eyes share terror filled looks
a sound is heard coming from the exterior of the ship like feet runing across the outside of the hull
the hull starts to moan and creak from an unseen pressure
and then the sub begins to be crushed like its a beer can
the metal hull torques on all sides
rivets pop and snap
water sprays and shoots
more sparks fly
the steel plating dimples crumbles and screams in agony
and then the shinkai implodes
a massive churning swirl of water metal and men
the saipan a tricked out jet foil built for speed not looks gunmetal blue lean and mean rips across the choppy water
the rolling stones streetfighting man pours out of the jet foil reverberating over the waves as the camera rushes right at the windsheild and into
stripped down low frills high tech
where john t
finnegan bathed in the last light of day all taut muscle and sinew all business with every one of his years etched on his rugged good looking face is harnessed
into the steering pylon wrestling with his steering sticks holding the bouncing jetfoil steady as he can hauling ass propelled it seems by the music blasting out of four state of the art speakers bolted to the metal walls
light from the laser imagers plays across finnegans face
the face of a man in his element on the edge in control
he barks commands into his radio headset
how we doing out there
through the windshield we see leila a muscular filipina clambering over the foredeck
shes dripping wet
tough as nails
she turns to finnegan and mouths something into her headset
finnegan flashes her his most charming smile
yes im very warm and dry in here thank you for your concern
his headset comes alive withe the sound of leila bitching in an unintelligible foreign tongue
i already pay you two bucks a day
he watches as leila fights the wind and seaspray and dogs tight a series of hatch latches across the foredeck
missed one darling
leila turns and gives him a jerking off sign with her hand
i love you too
the radar imager suddenly blinks and goes to black
finnegan taps on the screen
taps on the console
simultaneously two more imagers shut down
his mouth screws tight
crammed wall to wall with enough horsepower to fly a
pumped out of two thumping engines
the domain of a scruffy shifty eyed likeable little weasel of a mechanical genius
wearing a mechanics toolbelt slung sideways across the hips like a gunslinger singing the theme to gilligans island over the engines roar
way off key
his hands crammed deep in a tangle of wires
on the walls are a few pictures of a few major league engines
of a few major league pinups and a few of pantucci and finnegan
together in the u
in front of the saipan in shinier days
singing if not for the courage of the fearless crew he tugs at the wires
the minnow would be lost the minowwww would be lost
finnegans voice explodes through his headset
radio filtered unperturbed pantucci works at the wires
into radio can we use our indoor voice please
radio filtered im flying blind here god damn it
pantucci pulls two wires from the tangle
you trying to make me feel guilty
he begins to strip the wires with his teeth
finnegan peers out of the windscreen trying to see ahead of himself
guilty will be the least of what you feel when i run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands
get me well here
pantucci twists one wire around another
the console lights up
the screens come back on line
finnegan is pleased
now tell me again
pantucci works his wrench around an engine mount
and his nervous eyes around six men big bad men standing on the far side of the engines out in a narrow passage
a maori vivo
two aussies mason and mulligan
a samoan mamooli
a chinese chin
and an aborigine billy
tattooed armed to the teeth packed in kevlar body armor
who would as soon wring your neck as shake your hand
and a sixth man
the obvious leader
smoother than the rest but still showing the edge of a man risen from their ranks
he consults his watch with a growing concern
why we took this job
finnegan hits a button on his console
the stones are replaced by the first chords of layla
if i told you once
i told you a thousand times
rote i know
if the cash is there we dont care
nervous finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried
pantucci notices hanover impatiently looking at his watch again and nods for a mass of aussie mean and muscle named mason to follow him up a ladder
and some of its coming your way
he quickly pulls out a wrench slaps it over a bolt and tightens it down
the leak stops
he blows on the wrench like its a six shooter then spins it at the speed of light and holsters it into his toolbelt
as finnegan is watching the sea ahead swathed in the shrieking clapton guitar solos the hatch opens
hanover enters followed by mason who leaves the hatch door ajar
finnegans eyes remain fixed on the sea
his ears on the clapton
hanover and mason hold onto any available rail as the boat slams over the waves
you remember the first time we met finnegan
i think you were just starting out
smuggling gold off sumatra for those two chinese
what did we use to call them
fok yu and fok yu two
are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason
no it just struck me as odd
i dont see you for all these years and youve still got the same tape stuck in the box
you know what they say
the classics are eternal
hanover looks at the topo imager
holding onto the rail to keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea
so where are we
finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map
middle of nowhere
and where is our point of arrival
finnegan points to another spot on the map
middle of nowhere
and the answer to your question is yes
which question is that
the one you came up to ask
are we on schedule
to mason take note mr
this is why you hire a professional
attitude ive heard a lot of stories about you mate
all of them flattering im sure
but they musta been talking about another finnegan
because the one i heard about was as rough as they came
the one im looking at is well about as current as the music
dont mind him finnegan
balls of steel
splashing around in a sea of testosterone
i dont mind him
but i do think its time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup
and whos gonna make me
finnegan looks at mason
at the open hatchway just behind him
the finnegan you heard about
and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead
the force of acceleration tumbles hanover into the console
mason tumbles out the open hatchway down the stairs behind him
as he rises hanover regards finnegan for a moment
a smile flits across his face
thats why were sill around finnegan
you and me
nothing gets the feathers up
business is business
finnegans hand finds the console
he hits a button
the first strains of led zepplins whole lotta love comes roaring out of the speakers
and the classics are eternal
finnegan cranks the sound to the max pulls back on both steer sticks and holds on as the force of acceleration hammers him into the pylon
the saipan roars off into the setting sun hell bent for leather
zepplin screaming in its wake
sailing through the mild waters of the south china sea a luxury cruise liner
the fuji maru
top of the line
state of the art
and absolutely massive
no expense has been spared
gunfire shatters the serenity of the night
a group of tony british passengers is shooting skeet
being night the clay pigeons are glow in the dark
they explode over the watersports platform where two jet skis swing from harnesses and two speedboats are being hoisted up the side
rigged for a formal party
chinese lanterns sway in the breeze
a band plays
hundreds of wealthy passengers the men in tuxedos the women in drop dead gowns dripping with jewelry dance flirt gossip as an endless stream of waiters ply the floor with
champagne laden trays
close on the sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the foot of a woman stopping at the top of the deck
pan up a shimmering golden gown high slit on the sides to reveal a perfect set of legs a runway models body a cover girls face
and a thiefs sharp ferret eyes
a class act from top to bottom
a head turner for either sex and knows it
she holds an orchid in her hand
trillian scans the crowd looking for her prey
and finds him
the ships smug captain
jean baptiste delcroix
she fixes the orchid in her hair just so about to move
he said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together
it was our first date
trillian looks down to a petite old woman dressed impeccably delicate frail her beauty long faded except from her eyes
kindness becomes her like moonlight does the night
he said that it was the orchid i wore that made him fall in love with me
he sounds like a real gentleman
the best of the best he was
this cruise was supposed to be our th anniversary gift to each other
he died last spring
im so sorry
i was going to wear one
special for him
like a memory
the old woman looks at the orchid
and then at trillian
but without him here i dont know why i should
trillian takes the orchid from her hair and places it in the lapel of the womans jacket
because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together
the smile trillian bestows on the old woman is loving sincere
the moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute
ladies and gentlemen
angle on the deck where the band stops playing
everyone turns to nigel canton tall elegant every white hair perfectly in place impeccably turned out with the energy and enthusiasm of a man half his age
canton stands at the head of the pool in front of a wall sized aquarium flanked by his captain
all my life i had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas
tonight seeing all of you here
the crowd roars with laughter
i realize my dream has come true
i thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so
canton lifts his glass
to the fuji maru
good times forever
the crowd swells around canton
angle on the captain chatting up some passengers when a womans voice seductive beguiling turns his head to
french is it true what they say about a captain and his boat
the captains libido rises as he gazes into trillians come hither eyes
is what true madame
trillian takes one step closer until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captains
that the bigger the boat
the bigger the man
his breath catches
it is a theory i would be glad to put to the test
trillian draws even closer
if looks could cause a man to climax
french in school the sisters said testing was my specialty
driven to distraction the captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife
angle on trillian turning from the captain into the crowd
on her hand by the side of her dress
a mans wallet held surreptitiously
her fingers open the wallet extract a thin gold card with a black stripe
she discards the wallet keeps the card and disappears into the crowd
top of the line
state of the art
the crew is multinational
english is the common language but everyone has an accent
canton the picture of self satisfaction enters sipping champagne
you wanted to see me captain
the captain stands next to a bank of laser imaging systems
canton steps up
looks down at the thermal radar imager
multi colored laser images
we have a storm rising behind us
we may have to close the canopy i hope it doesnt ruin your party
self satisfied ruin my party
captain this ship was built to withstand a typhoon
i cant imagine theres anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party
a crowbar quietly pops the top off a wooden crate to reveal the lethal looking tip of a torpedo
pull back to pantucci in the storage hold surrounded by half a dozen crates his wily eyes popped wide with apprehension
he licks his lips nervously looks around and whispers into his headset
a hand falls on his shoulder spinning him around to a fist coming right into his face
the star spangled banner
as the jet foil rockets across the waves
leila stripped out of her soaking wet clothes down to her panties and bra stands wiping her dripping wet magnificently ripped body with a dry towel
leila puts her fingers in her ears
gum kwa she bam dok
its not noise
and then over the headset over the hendrix
followed by the unmistakable sound of fist hitting flesh
finnegan and leila trade a look
a massive fist plows into pantuccis stomach
he drops from the arms of mulligan a scar faced irishman with a buzz cut
as quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by the man who hit him vivo a merciless maori covered by tattoos topped off with venom
you know what my goal is
before i die i want to make love to a woman from every country on earth
you mean countries that are acknowledged by the un
or like made up countries too
what the hell does that mean
like mamoolis country
what you talkin
samoas a county
its a dot on a map
i dont give a shit they got women on samoa its on the list
billy youre in the batters box
hanover watches calmly as billy the aborigine cracks his fist against the side of pantuccis head knocking him out of vivos arms
at home we denosy the nosy
billy hoists pantucci
he draws his knife under pantuccis bloody nose
were not savage here mr
the chinese merc steps forward and whaps pantucci upside the head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick
pantucci hits the wall hard crumbling
chin lifts him
massive mason steps forward
ill take a go and the i vote we throw the little weasel overboard
i vote we slit his throat then throw him overboard
mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm back taking dead aim at pantuccis face
he never gets the punch off
his arm is caught from behind
he looks over his shoulder to finnegan
gripping his wrist
right in his face
this is not a democracy
you dont get a vote
mason enraged swings with his free hand
finnegan twists his arm sharply sending masons head into the steel wall knocking the big man senseless
the other mercenaries go to draw their weapons
before the guns are out of holsters finnegan swings a spear gun into hanovers face an inch from his eye
ill say it again for the hearing impaired
finnegan cocks the spear
hanover does not blink
with his free hand finnegan lifts pantucci to his unsteady feet the spear stays poised
finnegan backs out of the room
this isnt right finnegan
ive got a contract
hours on the clock
out and back
double for overtime
and no questions asked
who asked any
with a crowbar
you know the rules on a broken contract
i know it
but you want to get where you want to get and back
i need a chief engineer and unless you got a replacement id highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion
with that finnegan leads pantucci out of the hold slamming the door behind him
finnegan turns his gaze to pantucci
it makes the smaller man quiver
you put me in that position again ill throw you overboard myself
finnegan stalks off
pantucci swallows hard knowing he means it
a man strides down the hall of an executive passageway his face obscured in shadows
he has a canister in his hands
walks through a door marked the brain center for the whole ship
rows of computer mainframes laser guided imagers and d
no humans needed
and none are present
except one the man strides purposefully down a row of computers makes a left then a right
he knows exactly where hes going
he arrives at an ultra high tech console
three similar canisters are plugged into the console
the man unscrews the middle canister
screws his canister into its place
sets the timer to hours
pushes a button
the timer starts to count down
all lit up and looking beautiful
the wind is stronger
the party is wilder
the band louder
the people drunker
rain begins to fall
everybody moans and heads for cover
the decks huge hydralic canopy begins to close reviving the party spirit
a gold card with a black stripe slides into the security lock of a high tech vault
one after another the electronic locks unlock
trillian stands back as the massive vault door swings open
with a quick look over her shoulder she enters the vault
trillian consults a list looking for one very specific vault box
finding it she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure and picks the lock in nothing flat
flipping open the box trillian removes the only thing she came for
a dazzling diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg
with a twist she pops the stone from the setting holds it up to admire it in the light
it is an amazing stone
trillian grits her teeth and turns to
canton the captain and two burly chinese security men
what were you planning on doing with it
well you can still proceed with your plans then
escort the lady
the captain steps forward and removes the diamond ring from trillians hand
you are not a lady
he slaps her across the face
trillian flushes touches the drop of blood at her lip
and decks the captain with a vicious right cross
you are not a gentleman
a hatch door bursts open
trillian is thrown inside
the door slams shut
trillian looks around
lots of fruit and vegetables
trillian accepts the hopelessness of her situation
she takes an apple sits down and bites deeply running her options
the canister timer finishes counting down
it suddenly emits a high energy hum
intense electro static which builds into
a screeching guitar solo
the allman brothers band pulses out of the speakers
finnegan is prepping the wound over pantuccis eye for sutures
as he swabs it carefully leila is at the helm keeping the speeding bouncing boat on course
heres what i think
i think these mokes below are a hit squad
i saw these guy perform
you know that
they opened for the stones
he carefully threads the surgical needle
theres some bozo sitting on his yacht at those coordinates they gave us sipping his scotch and soda
totally unawares that we are about to deliver kgs of high power torpedo to light up his ass
thats whats down there in that hold and who knows what the hell else
the top of another wooden crate is popped revealing the answer to pantuccis question a chilling display of firepower
hand held gatling guns with laser sightings
the latest in death delivery systems
hanover and his men lift and load
slamming shells into chambers
these boys know their toys
hold still now
i was like three rows back
finnegan centers the needle over pantuccis wound
jagger was here
i was here
you dont give a shit about anything do you
sure i do
i give a shit that at hour we reach our point of destination
i give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do and minutes later we are turn around and gone
i give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed
thats all you give a shit about
and that my stitch job doesnt make you uglier than you already are
this wont hurt a bit
finnegan sinks the needle into the wound
pantuccis scream rises above the music
the fuji maru cruises through rain lashed waters
accompanied by a very scary musical score
then suddenly in the extreme foreground air bubbles angrily gurgle to the surface
then a wave explodes as if thrashed from below
then another wave explodes forty feet to the right
then another eighty feet to the left
and then almost seen huge black ominous things seem to be squirming beneath the water
heading for the fuji maru
rain pelts the canopy
we can hear the party inside
music laughs and cheers
the entire room seems to be fritzing out
the lights crackle on and off
the captain stands behind the bank of failing imaging systems growing edgier by the moment
the entire bridge electrical system is shutting down sir
switch over to auxiliary power and run a circuit check
officer is busy fiddling with the communications and imaging gear
distorted lights from the scrambled systems plays off their faces
were losing radar and sonar
communications systems are out sir
the captain is confounded on the edge of panic
canton hurries onto the bridge
what the hell is going on
communication systems have failed
i dont understand it
maybe its the storm
were impervious to weather
we have a main frame meltdown
well unmelt it
canton storms out
every piece of electrical equipment on the bridge starts to shut down
where the waves meet the hull a ballast hole excretes water
suddenly near the ballast hole a wave explodes thrashed from below
accompanied by the scary foreboding music again
trillian making the best of a bad situation is just putting the finishing touches on a wonderful salad culled from the stores
as she sits down spreading a makeshift napkin on her lap just so a violent sucking sound comes from above her
trillians eyes shoot upward
a vicious gurgling sound races through a large pipe along the ceiling
trillian leaps to her feet
a little spooked
an elegant woman sits on the toilet her gown hiked up inelegantly reading vogue
as she turns the page the same strange sound a violent sucking comes from inside the walls startling her
she looks around the room
cant see anything
shrugs it off
goes back to her magazine
turns another page
and then suddenly she shudders violently and gives a sharp cry
her eyes filled panic
she tries to stand but shes jerked back down
her arms flail wildly
scattering stuff off the counter
she tries to scream but it comes out more like a gurgle
below her in the toilet there is a hideous slurping sound
she manages a final desperate scream a high pitched wail
which nobody hears because
the band has kicked into another rock song
the drunken revelers whoop and holler dancing with reckless abandon ignoring the thunder and lightning
with a loud basso profundo clang the cruise liner jerks to a stop
everything goes crash
the music stops as the entire band falls into the pool
trillian goes ass over teacups rolling over just in time to see a wall of boxes crashing straight down on her
shes knocked out cold
one of the speedboats breaks free of its harness
topples over the side and drops down into the sea
everything goes quiet
panic is a heartbeat away
a flash of lightning lights up the top of the canopy
the passengers begin to mutter fearfully
from his perch canton fights down his own panic and addresses the crowd in calm reassuring tones
ladies and gentlemen
your attention please
ladies and gentlemen
the disquieted crowd turns to canton
this is the most technologically advanced sailing vessel on the water today
every problem has been anticipated
the captain has assured me that we will be up and running in no time
so enjoy yourselves
theres nothing to worry about
suddenly and quite violently a woman is sucked under the water thwup
others swimmers notice and freeze
the woman doesnt come back up
and then three more swimmers are violently jerked under
all the people in and around the pool see this and panic
swimming and running
a crack of thunder
the captain calls out remain calm
do you hear
the pool clears
everybody backs the hell away from it
the water in the pool bubbles and gurgles and then goes quiet
and then from somewhere deep within the bowels of the ship comes a loud eerie primordial yowl
we push in on canton his eyes slowly widen
his calm replaced by pure terror
off in the distance is the cruiseliner
we hold for a long silent eerie beat
and then the screaming begins
blasting through increasingly stormy seas
finnegan notices billy mulligan and vivo setting two catapult like devices on the front of the deck
leila see what theyre up to
finnegans eyes go up from the action on deck to the radar screen where a blip fast moving right toward the jet foil catches his attention
what the hell
a flash of lightning reveals the speedboat from the fuji maru hurtling at the hull
the speedboat slams into the saipan
angle on the mercs and leila slammed to the deck
a gash is ripped out of the bow
the new hole vomits flame
spewing it over the crates
hanover and the rest of his men are blown against the walls
pantucci dives as flying shrapnel peppers the two engines
instantly kills one engine
maims the other
a fire starts
red warning lights flash and blink
lighting up the console
the left steering stick dies in finnegans hand
talk to me
fire spews out of the engines
pantucci sprays a fire extinguisher frantically
where the shrapnel entered the hull water now spurts with every wave
smoke and water oil and fire
hercules is right behind her
we got a gusher in the hull
as the saipan comes to a halt finnegan loses play in his remaining stick
finnegan locks the sticks down and runs out
track with finnegan running through the smoke filled hold past hanover and the mercs who are pulling themselves off the floor right into the
where pantucci is beside himself in smoke and sputtering flame
what did you do to my kids
the man in the moon
whos driving this thing
finnegan notices something on the floor
he picks up a shard of the speedboat propeller
hanover steps into the room
finnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand
we ran into a speedboat
he shows the piece of speed boat to hanover
who stares at it
finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes
speedboat in the middle of the ocean
how soon can we get up and running
we got one engine dead and the other limping badly
i have a schedule
i spent two years building these things
screw your schedule
mason grabs pantucci by the throat lifting him off the ground
you little weasel
finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of masons knees buckling him to the floor
in the blink of an eye there is the barrel of a
pressed hard against his head hanover at the trigger end
we were talking about my schedule
youre going to have to get a new one
not an option
then you better start swimming
hanover cracks finnegan across the face with the barrel of the gun
finnegans head spins
he touches the corner of his mouth and comes away with blood and a look of murder in his eyes
hanover slams a round in the chamber
one more joke and your comedy career is over
now fix this
look at them
they need gears
were in the middle of the goddamn ocean
i think he knows that joey
so maybe he also know where the hell am i going to get the parts i need
mulligan comes running in
target in sight
everybody stands on deck as hanover scans the darkness through a pair of infrared binoculars
you know the drill gentlemen
the mercs scatter below deck
hanover hands the binoculars to finnegan
care to see what dreams are made of finnegan
finnegans pov through the binoculars
the fuji maru in the distance lit up beautiful
two grappling hooks fly from the barrels of the two catapults bolted to the deck landing on the deck of the fuji maru which looms above the saipan
vivo pulls on the lines until they go taut
finnegan pantucci and leila stand by watching as the mercs in full assault gear communication headsets in place get ready for action
mason swivels the big harpoon gun on the bow
he fires the harpoon
it shoots and slams into the rear deck of the fuji maru
tow line secure
secure the zone of operation
swift athletic the mercs leap onto the lines and scramble hand over hand toward the fuji marus deck
when i was a little bit of a pissant we lived down the road from where all the big cruise ships used to come into sydney harbor
the first mercs reach the fuji marus deck and toss life lines down to hanover
mum and me we used to sit by our front door and watch them
she used to say one day youre going to make your fortune in life on one of them
hanover hands one line to finnegan one to pantucci
the third he attaches around his waist
great woman your mother
and she could do a hell of a barbie to boot
youll find all the parts you need up there
finnegan and pantucci comply
i assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent
id say thats a pretty good assumption
nervous you know the crew could be armed
martinis and tanning oil
hanover hand signals to his men above
the lines go taut
finnegan pantucci and hanover are hoisted to the deck of the fuji maru
not a soul is about
the mercs are deployed in a close military defense pattern
everyone hits a button on their watches
by the numbers
engine room and machine shop are on the third sub deck
mulligan go with them
keep in touch
a thick black hose weaves its way across the flooded floor sucking water
leila up to her knees in water wearing a blast visor stripped down to her skivvies wields a welder against the gaping hole in the hull
as the boat dips in the waves water sloshes in
billy sits on the stairs trying to stay dry
he goes to light a cigarette
angry kwan bat
she points the acetalyne tank she works with
billy heads for the deck
leila looks after him in disgust
she ignites her torch is about to flick her visor down again when a loud gurgling a sucking sound stops her
she cuts the torch
looks around nervously
and then she spots the suction hose sucking away
she smiles to herself
flips the visor fires the torch and goes back to work
an alert mulligan leads finnegan and pantucci around a corner
vivo brings up the rear
youd think theyd set a deck watch
flash to the deck full of people partying carousing
the railing is lined with lifeboats suspended in their harnesses
flash back to mulligan finnegan pantucci and vivo staring at a completely deserted deck
the lifeboat harnesses swing in the breeze eerily empty
mulligan looks back to vivo
i thought the plan was wed evacuate them after we got through
maybe plans changed
plans dont change
maybe its the wrong ship
and then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the bowels of the ship
finnegan and pantucci trade a look
lets just keep going
nervous you aint giving the orders here
and again the yowl
lets keep going
hanover mason and chin set foot on the deserted pool deck
flash to the pool deck is jammed with people partying
the band playing
two kids toss a beach ball back and forth
the ball flies over one boys head
flash back to the ball falls into the empty pool
where the bands instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged crack
uneasy hanover and his men look around at the over turned chairs
the smashed aquarium
chin bends down and picks up a small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium
the squid wraps its tentacles around chins hand almost immediately
chin regards it with curiosity
focus on the task mr
and then the yowl freezes them
on hanovers face
his eyes flicker with uncertainty
and a tinge of fear
flash to a glass elevator descending through the spectacular atrium full of elegant well dressed people laughing chatting
flash back to mulligan vivo pantucci and finnegan standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture whirling to the elevator door opening
mulligan nerves ajangle and vivo swing their pulse rifles up hard as the door opens to reveal
and empty elevator
the door closes
the car starts to ascend in the eerie silence
the mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness
the door to the bridge is kicked open
mason and chin leap inside
guns out front
the overhead lights flicker on and off
the imager screens are all black
the steering wheel slowly rocks
as if an invisible captain is steering a ghost ship
suspicious and a bit nervous
what the hell is going on
mulligan leads finnegan pantucci vivo into the casino
the place looks like a mess
tables and chairs are upended
glasses and bottles are shattered everywhere
and theres blood on the floor
a bell rings loudly and the trolley car starts to move
next stop chinatown
everyone jumps freaked
mulligan and vivo spin around and open fire
start blowing the shit out of the trolley car
the guns sound like nothing weve ever heard
the gunfire echoes through the hull
suddenly with a loud splash a sixteen foot long lifeboat pops to the surface
then another life boat pops up
then three more off to the port side
then two more off to the starboard
its as if the sound of the gunfire is somehow releasing the boats from their watery graves
they start to drift away
bullets rake the trolleys metal sides
the windshield explodes
finnegan yells at mulligan and vivo guys
finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of mulligans gun to the ceiling
they stop firing
a little wigged out
their professional demeanor going by the boards
all goes quiet
they look at finnegan who is the picture of calm
get a grip
the trolley car reverses
the electronic voice is now cracked next stop fishermans wharf
mulligan whirls his gun poised
just then his headset crackles
radio filtered this is red one
finnegan leans in towards mulligans mike
into radio your boys just killed a trolley car red one
mulligan pulls the radio away
into radio we been down three decks theres nobody home
total spooky town
advise on how to proceed
hanover looks around at the empty bridge the blinking lights
stay to the schedule
stay to the plan
nothing has changed
but the look in hanovers slightly unnerved eyes tells a different story
trillian goggily crawls out from under a mound of boxes
her left eyes got a nice purple shiner
her elegant gown is ripped
a very strange sound coming from behind the wall
the sound slowly moves across the wall
then another wall starts to gurgle
trillian spins around
she forces herself not to panic
very cautiously taking small measured steps she reaches the handle to the freezer and tries to open it
the gurgling ripples above her
her mouth goes dry as her eyes follow the sound across the ceiling
her hand goes to her hair
she pulls her lock pick out and very slowly kneels down until she is eye level with the door lock
she begins to pick her way out her ears and eyes following the gurgling above
suddenly the sound stops
the silence makes trillians heart sound that much louder
she sidles close to the wall
cautious she taps on the wall
for a moment nothing
something slams against the wall from the other side in response
trillian falls back against the door her heart in her throat
a maze of pipes hoses gears engines and catwalks
things are hissing humming rumbling and clanking
a spooky place
mulligan and vivo looking more nervous by the moment lead the way
finnegan and pantucci follow
rattling nervous you know what im gonna do after this
im gonna get a normal life
like a house in the suburbs
maybe a couple of kids
some sort of business
be in the bowling league
go to the ball games
finnegan turns to pantucci his voice even calm almost kind
you dont think i can have a normal life
look at me
he forces pantucci to look him in the eyes
were gonna get what we gotta get
do what we gotta do
and get the hell outta here
pantucci draws his strength from finnegan
he forces himself to take a deep breath
suddenly overhead something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes so fast it shocks pantucci back into the wall
he and vivo spin their guns at the pipes
the red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal
the sooner we get outta here the better ill feel
mulligan and vivo move forward
finnegan turns to pantucci who has not moved from where he hit the wall
scared im stuck
pantucci tries to pull away from the wall
he is stuck
what are you trying to pull
finnegan takes pantucci by the front of his shirt ignoring mulligan
relax your arms
as finnegan pulls pantucci does as he is told
he slips away from the wall
the jacket doesnt
he reaches out to touch the wall
finnegan grabs his wrist grabs a flashlight from vivos utility belt and shines it on the wall
their pov the entire wall is covered in a strange yellow secreted gelatin
laid on in some sort of weird inhuman geometric pattern
like a spider web
leila has welded half the hole shut
a gush of water suddenly pours through the other half
leila cuts the torch
the ka chunk ka chunk of the pump is like a loud scary heartbeat
leila removes her blast visor
wipes her brow
a mangled corpse gushes in through the gaping hole
quickly backs away
actually its only half a corpse
the bottom half having been eaten away
its wearing a tuxedo
the corpses face is tightly constricted eyes wide open a grotesque death mask
leila shakes like a leaf waist deep in seawater
billy is staring out at all the lifeboats as they drift away
all he can hear is the loud ka chunk ka chunk of the pump
he talks into his headset into radio i dunno where they came from turned around and there they were
pause no no passengers
pause no shit ill keep my eyes open
leila trembles in the waist high water
the pumps heartbeat seems to have gotten louder
leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse
her eyes are transfixed staring at the abomination too scared to scream
her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass in front of it
the water swirls around her waist
shes almost past the gaping hole now
then something grabs her
and falls back towards the gaping hole but its only a twisted piece of metal off a strut
suddenly leilas whole body spasms
she screeches wildly in great pain
the shes ripped backward out through the gaping hole
water sloshes back in
knee deep in water an edgy mulligan watches finnegan as he disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary generator
his eyes keep shifting around
over in the far corner vivo is watching pantucci working over a metal lathe repairing the cylinder head
metal on metal
vivo sits up on a barrel trying to keep his feet out of the water
the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable
if the hulls impregnable why are my feet wet
why dont you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here
why dont you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here
cause grease monkey aint in my job description dick head
vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel
what i want to know is why the goddamn ocean is always cold
since im a kid i hate god damn cold water
then out of the corner of his eye vivo sees something move
he spins around
nothing but pipes and hoses
nervous what was that
someones back there
come out here
finnegan and pantucci stop working
all eyes are focused on the maze of pipes
things are hissing humming and rumbling
check it out
you hear me
still no response
will you check it the hell out
disgusted vivo puts his feet in the water gingerly
man this shit is cold
he walks toward the mass of hissing pipes
his pulse rifle rising
im gonna kick your ass for putting me through this
then he hears a strange slurping and sucking sound coming from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway
im not screwing around with you man
i hate the cold water
what is it man
vivo slowly goes in for a closer look gun out front heading down the little alleyway
he looks behind some pipes
the slurping gets louder
then he sees it
his eyes widen on shit
and thats the last thing he ever says
because just then from a dark area between the pipes something shoots out
mulligan finnegan and pantucci stare in horrified amazement as vivo is viciously yanked into the pipes
a moment later a wash of blood is flung across a wall
mulligan freaks out aims his rifle at the pipes
as mulligans attention diverts finnegan instinctively heads for vivos rifle lying on the floor
mulligan swings around
his rifle is armed
the laser dot fixes on finnegans forehead
touch it and youre dead asshole
finnegan freezes looking up at a very freaked out mulligan
dont shoot man dont shoot
what happened to vivo
what the hell happened to vivo
everybodys breathing hard
blood drips down the wall
trillian steps up to the vault looking around a bit nervous something is definitely not right here
she shrugs must be her imagination
from inside her low cut dress she pulls the captains gold security card
she is about to run it through the reader slot when
she spins to
hanover mason mamooli and chin
recovering im sorry
this area is for authorized personnel only
as the assistant to the purser im afraid ill have to ask you to vacate
mason and chin lift their pulse rifles
or maybe not
where is everybody
trillian is confused what do you mean
hanover steps forward right in her face
threatening i mean
where is everybody
hanover grabs trillian by the throat and slams her against the wall
he rams his gun against her forehead
you tell it straight or i pull the trigger
who are you
choking a passenger
where are the other passengers
mason grabs the card out of her hand
lets get what we came for and get the hell out of here
mason runs the card through the slot
the electronics kick in
hanovers headset comes alive with mulligan screaming
i cant hear you
mason jerks the vault door open
a fire axe swing down into his head whump
kills him instantly
eyes wide open
everybody freaks out
hanover lets go of trillian and stares into the vault directly at nigel canton
holding the axe
oh my god
i didnt mean to
behind canton the captain is on the floor in severe pain his clothes are ripped up revealing nasty looking red scars blistered and puffy all over his chest and arms
i thought it was one of them
chin jams his rifle to the middle of cantons forehead and cocks a round into the chamber
stand down soldier
but this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order
hanover grabs chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal yank
he slams chin against the wall
in the process he loses his headset
chin and hanover stare at each other their chests heaving
mason finally drops to the ground
all she wrote
i didnt mean to
i though it was one of them
one of who
the machinery is sputtering and sparking shorting steaming as the sea rises
mulligan in a panic has backed finnegan and pantucci into a corner
he screams over his headset
come in you son of a bitch
a sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes
mulligan spins back to finnegan and pantucci
fried shut up
you hear me
we gotta get outta here now
shut up man just shut the hell up
i gotta think
i gotta think
whats there to think about
that thing back there
there aint no thing here
theres you him and me
you him and
suddenly mulligans legs are suddenly jerked out from under him
he hits the floor hard
starts firing wildly
finnegan and pantucci hit the watery deck
bullets ricochet everywhere
mulligan is whipped across the floor
screaming in fear
his pulse rifle goes flying
hes slammed into a metal pylon then sucked into a dark void in the pipes
all in the blink of an eye
finnegan grabs mulligans pulse rifle
blasting the shit out of anything and everything that moves
grab the parts
pantucci grabs the knapsack cramming as many parts as he can into it as finnegan keeps firing into the steaming creaking sparking machinery
pantucci doesnt have to be told twice
he runs like hell with finnegan firing a final burst and following
everyone hears the massive gunfire
hanover looks around for the source of the sound
he finds it in his discarded headset
this is red one
come in red two
the gunfire stops replaced by an ominous horrifying sucking sound
panicked its them
weve got to get off
he runs out of the vault
the captain follows close behind
hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and louder
lets find them
what about the vault
its not going anywhere
hanover rushes out with chin right behind
only trillian remains breathing deeply scared
but not scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the first place
she goes right to the vault opens one of the boxes removes the giant diamond drops it down her decolletage pulls her high heels off and runs out
finnegan and pantucci run to the end of a long section of metal grating right below a staircase to catch their breath
everything has gone dead quiet except for the billowing and clanging of the engines
smoke and sparks obscure their vision
finnegan what the hell was that
i dont know
you got what we need
if i dont i aint going back to get it
you think were safe
both of them listen to the silence
and then at the far end of the grating one grate rises
finnegan and pantucci watch transfixed
then like a locomotive gathering speed the grates start rising and falling faster and faster clanking louder and louder headed right for the two of them
finnegan and pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they can
just as the grate they were standing on rises and falls
except for the steaming creaking machinery
and an ominous sucking sound
trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight elevator
looking over her shoulder she hits the button
the elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to hold a dozen people
trillian rushes in and hits the up button
she breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close
until the elevator starts going down
i want to go up
and starts pushing the up button frantically her heart pounding in her chest
there is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending
until something drops on the roof with a thump
the elevator comes to a bumps stop
trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator
and then the car starts to move again
please go up
trillian pounds on ever button on the console to no avail
the car continues its inexorable descent
finally in desperation she hits the emergency stop button
the elevator stops
the emergency siren whines
a long beat
something beats on the roof trying to break in
and again wham
the elevator shudders and continues its descent
trillian backs up against the wall staring at the ceiling scared
the elevator dings
startled trillian screams
the doors start to open
panicked trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal
a high heel
the doors open
something lunges in
trillian swings her high heel
right into pantuccis face
finnegan plows in right behind him
trillian tries to run out
finnegan grabs her
im not staying here
it aint any better out there
finnegan does not let go of her
lady im telling you
trillian buries her high heel into the back of finnegans hand breaking his grip
just then the doors to the elevator shut and the car starts to ascend
now look what you did
i saved your life is what i did
who asked you to
what the hells going on here
youre with that other bunch right
what other bunch
im not a thief
then who are you
im their ride
trillian hears music to her ears
you have a boat
her demeanor changes her voice goes to honey
trillian and finnegan turn to pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling
all look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling
followed by a sucking sound
its up there
finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling
the sucking sound stops
the elevator stops
the door opens
finnegan whirls his rifle rising
trillian lifts her high heel ready to strike
hanover chin and mamooli have their massive guns trained on the car
the captain and canton quiver behind them
there is a momentary stand off
where are my men
chin charges finnegan the butt of his rifle raised to smash finnegans skull
finnegan parries and drives chin into the rear wall of the elevator
mamooli jumps finnegan from behind wrapping his rifle against finnegans throat
pantucci jumps on mamoolis massive back ripping at his face
finnegan drops buries his elbow in mamoolis solar plexus spins and has his knife out of his boot and at mamoolis throat in a flash
angle on trillian
she had no idea
finnegan looks up into the barrel of hanovers gun
and a pair of eyes that will use it
finnegan does as he is told
now back up
again finnegan does as he is told
the captain and canton are only to happy to comply
as they slip in trillian tries to slip out
hanover swings his gun on her
where are you going
hanover hit the elevator button
the elevator starts to rise
now wheres mulligan
i told you
man theres something here
on the boat
shut up all of you
now heres what were doing
mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines chin and i are staying here to finish the job
did you clear this
all of a sudden the car is jerked to a halt as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable
and then the elevator jerks down again
everyone is thrown about like straw
everyone is shouting panicked
and then the jerking stops
and the sound of sucking surrounds the car
the cable starts twisting creaking sickeningly above their heads
its gonna snap the cable
trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically
god damn it
finnegan is at the doors pulling them with all his might
pantucci then mamooli then hanover and chin pull at the doors as trillian keeps hitting the buttons
the doors part a bit
the doors fly open to
a solid wall
until the doors slam shut
the cable snaps
and the car plummets
screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft
finnegans eyes go to the floor indicator
an automated voice rapidly calls out right along with it th floor
down down down it goes
faster and faster
but the elevator doesnt stop at the first floor
it keeps dropping
the floor its taking us to the bottom of the ship
the elevator starts to buckle
which is actually good because its getting jammed sideways in the shaft which slows it down
the it hits bottom with a resounding crash
the doors blow out into the darkened hallway
for a long moment nothing moves then finnegan tumbles out of the elevator
one after another the others exit into the dark lobby
where are we
the sublevel lobby
finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles
dont touch it
finnegan looks up to hanover standing a bit shakily his own rifle trained on finnegan
you shoot me and you got no ride home
and with that finnegan picks up the gun
a test of wills
finnegan wins and then turns to the captain
you the captain
how do we get out of here
we have to make it to the third deck
pantucci steps on something
he looks down his eyes widen
he starts dancing around trying not to step on whatever it is
trillian looks down and screams
everybody freaks finnegan grabs a flashlight from chins utility belt and sweeps the beam over the lobby
the entire floor of the lobby is littered with shattered human skeletons
picked clean and spit out
just like the earlier whale bones
then suddenly at the far end of the hallway one of the metal walls suddenly expands and flexes
and then the flexing suddenly comes racing down either side of the hallway accompanied by the most god awful primordial this way
everybody else right behind him
the flexing and screeching vanishes into the walls
rain pours down on the fuji maru and the saipan as they bob in the waves surrounded by endless choppy ocean waters
billy comes down the steps gun out front looking around
there is no reply
the only sound is the sucking of the pump
you want it that way
he enters the waist high water
when i find you you pay
billy heads deeper into the hold
damp dark and disgusting
a maze of pipes and gears lines the walls
finnegan slams the hatch shut
dogs it tight
everyones gathering themselves around the room trillian pantucci hanover mamooli chin the captain and canton
weve gotta call for help
yeah man no shit call in the marines
all the communication systems went down
so get them back up
i dont know how
hey i can fix any damn thing
wheres the comm
we should get off as soon as possible
but if we can at least send a message
i say we evacuate as soon as
to canton who are you
hes the owner
why dont you want a message sent
i just think that
because you know a message cant be sent
there is a moment of silence
youre the inside guy arent you
the guy who knocked out the communications
hanover sets masons pulse rifle down and claps his hands
canton flashes hanover a look
the captain is confused
trillian suddenly grabs canton spins him around and slams him against the hull
how the hell do we fix it
a tense moment as canton debates his situation then relents
all the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid
confused this was your lifes work
my dreams cost more than they would make
i miscalculated the market
there was no way i could recoup
unless you collected on the insurance
what are you people talking about
hes with them
he motions to the mercenaries
they rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom
he collects the insurance and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle
finnegan fixes hanover with a look of certainty
the captain blows
he leaps on canton
his hands find the older mans throat
all these people dead
because you screwed up on the math
finnegan pulls the captain off
its not going to help us
were going to die here
were going to die
finnegan holds the captain with both hands calming him
i was born in a city housing project in the bronx ok
its not in the cards that i die on a luxury cruise ship
now which way up
alarmed you hear that
unseen by anyone there is movement within the machinery
the walls start to come alive with dark shadowy impressions
hidden within the maze of machinery obscured by the bad lighting glistening abominations slither over pipes squirm through gears and undulate in and out of crevices and holes
the room is becoming a living throbbing pulsating horror
they are everywhere
all right be cool everybody nice and slow no sudden moves
everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch
then a loud gurgling is heard
everybody looks up at the ceiling
hidden within the girders and sticking to them a large translucent intestine like thing crosses the ceiling
inside it are strange disgusting biological workings
the gurgling suddenly gets dramatically louder
and then we see billy and leila being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine
and squirming wildly
everybody freaks out and hauls ass for the hatch
finnegan and hanover open fire
covering their asses
everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into this mechanical maze
the engine chambers are a labyrinth of pipe lined alleyways motorized chambers swaying catwalks and pillars of steel
the lighting is very poor very dark
hanover pantucci chin and mamooli open up
firing blindly and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in the darkness
the muzzle flashes and tracer fire light up the chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau
we catch more abstract glimpses of the translucent tentacle sacs strange feelers groping suckers slime and veins
finnegan rounds a corner and crouch runs down a narrow alley
white knuckling his rifle
he turns another corner and runs right into trillian
spins gun ready to fire at
jesus christ lady
scared what are those things
i dont know
finnegan looks around to the engine room a labyrinth of pipe lined alleyways motorized chambers swaying catwalks and pillars of steel
the lighting is very poor very dark
he takes off
where are you going
theres got to be a way to access out back there
he motions into the deep shadows
but what makes you think there arent more of hose
you want to come come
trillian weighs her options and takes off after finnegan
you dont have to be so touchy
look lady i know you people are used to getting your way
whats that supposed to mean
im not rich people
well you sure do a good imitation
thank you i work at it
finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk
he starts to climb
trillian hampered by her long slinky dress rips at the bottom making it maxi to mini in a flash and scoots after finnegan
i heard you say you grew up in the projects in the bronx
reaching the top of the ladder she clambers onto the catwalk next to finnegan who is deciding which way to go
she holds out her hand
finnegan ignores her hand
now that weve been properly introduced can we get the hell out of here
finnegan starts to walk down the catwalk
so this boat of yours
thats what you do
thats what i do
seen a lot of islands
quite a few
since im a kid i had this dream
i want to own my own tropical island
beaches warm ocean lots of food little clothes
population of one
with the emphasis on self and in selfish right
takes one to know one
a tentacle shoots out between finnegan and trillian
just missing them as it slams into a wall
finnegan falls onto the catwalk drops his rifle unarmed
trillian freaked stumbles back and lands on her butt
finnegan sits up against the walls turns and looks the tentacle slowly squirms across the wall like a big leach
trying to find its prey
finnegan is frozen in place
trillian sits up eyes widening in fear as she sees hideous little worm like feelers and suckers protrude up and down the tentacle
wriggling and writhing and feeling their way across the wall
getting closer and closer to finnegan
finnegans eyes go to his pulse rifle close to trillians feet
he motions for her to push it toward him
but frozen in fear she can only watch the slithering horror before her
tongue like the feelers lick their way across the oily wall
finnegan ducks as they squirm over his head
then he brushes against some dirt making a scraping sound
a feeler quickly drops down and touches finnegans arm
he leaps to his feet
so does trillian
she grabs the rifle turns and bolts off down the dark alley
finnegan tries to run but the feelers hold him tight
two more feelers slap onto his arm
the creature starts reeling him in
angle on trillian running
finnegans yell reaches her
she stops cold
looking back the way she came torn
angle on finnegan fighting for all he is worth being reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle
out of the darkness trillian suddenly comes running back
panting hard she aims the gun
spurred to action trillian jams the rifle barrel against the tentacle and pulls the trigger
trillian frantically fumbles around looking for the right lever on the complicated sophisticated weapon trying to find it
i dont know where it is
on the side
desperate unable to find it she does the next best thing
she swings her rifle like its a baseball bat
smacks the tentacle
ripping into its flesh
it squirts ink blood releases finnegan and recoils
finnegan drops to his knees
grabbing his arm in pain
the tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again
trillian grabs him and with all her strength jerks him to his feet and starts to drag him backward
the tentacle coils ready to strike
just before it does so finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm flips the safety and fires blasting the tentacle to pieces
lets get the hell out of here
finnegan staggers to his feet
he and trillian run off
trillian and finnegan come running around a corner and stop to catch their breath
annoyed the safety
he flicks the safety on and off
i didnt have to come back
yeah you did
you have a boat
boat or no boat
you woulda come back anyway
youre that kind of gal
what kind is that
the come back kind
how do you know that
takes one to know one
finnegans small smile makes trillian acutely uncomfortable
the captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web
but the more he struggles the more enmeshed he gets
he holds his hands out beseechingly to canton who stands looking at him in terror
but canton does not move
all of a sudden canton sees something deep in the web behind the captain which makes his blood freeze
what is it
canton takes a few steps back
the captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it is
there is a dark movement deep within the spider web
angle on finnegan and trillian racing across a catwalk
below them they can see canton backing away from the captain
grab his hands
canton looks up stunned as he sees finnegan and trillian rushing down from the catwalk
canton backs away from the captain as the captains struggle draws him further into the web
the captains eyes bulge horrified as he feels something inside the spider web grab him from behind
he struggles wildly
then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him
finnegan and trillian race across the floor as the captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web his face and body bady constricting paralyzed
his voice is choked off
hanover chin mamooli and pantucci burst out of another alleyway
finnegan and trillian reach the captain just as his face is sucked into the gelatinous web
they skid to a stop
everybody piles up
watching as the captains body is pulled deeper into the dark web
tentacles enveloping him
to canton where is the closest hatch
canton still pressed against the wall staring at the spot the captain disappeared talking to himself
i never meant for anyone to get hurt
it was supposed to be clean
hanover grabs canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo jacket
you hypocritical bastard
all you gave a shit about was the money
wheres the hatch
canton points down a darkened passageway
alright lets move out
you two on point
he looks at an uneasy mamooli and chin
which ways aft
he points in the opposite direction
who gives a shit about aft
thats where my boats moored
you trying to take over my show finnegan that what you trying to do
just trying to get to my boat
finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction that disappears in the dark
pantucci is right with him
trillian a step behind
yelling you stay away from that vault
you hear me
just before he steps into the darkness finnegan calls over his shoulder
they respond to sound
he disappears into the dark
canton looks at hanover for a long moment and then takes off after finnegan
the other two mercs look at hanover wavering
the sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around nervously
whispered he made sense
loud hes a bloody
and then conscious of his voice reverberating
whispered hes a bloody taxi driver
chin breaks for the catwalk hurrying after finnegan
hanover stands with a very antsy mamooli steaming
after a long moment he strides off after finnegan as well
in slow mo finnegan and the others creep down a darkened pipe lined passageway
guns out front
sight beams sweeping the path ahead
eyes wide open
sweat sliding down their faces
breath coming in short nervous bursts
hearts pounding out of chests
the ominous musical score adds to the tension
then the emergency lighting kicks on
a creepy looking reddish blue glow is cast throughout the ship
finnegan continues on
followed by the others
all sweating hard
eyes nervously shifting
fear thick in the air
looking down through a metal gate we see finnegan trillian and the others passing below
then suddenly in the dark foreground something wet wriggles across the gate
they come to a door
finnegan tries the handle
finnegan turns to canton and mimes for keys
canton shakes his head
he has none
whispered very good finnegan
trillian moves up to finnegan
she reaches into her hair and pulls out her trusty lockpick
as he watches somewhat mystified she inserts the pin tickles the lock a few times and depresses the handle
the door opens
finnegan looks at her curiously but with respect
they enter the rear ballast section where the walls are indeed far apart half of which is now a small pond
the only way out of this room is down some steps which vanish beneath the seawater or through a single violently twisted hatch door
finnegan tries to push the hatch
it will not give
mamooli and chin join him adding their considerable muscle to the task
the hatch holds tight
finnegan turns to canton who stands slumped against a railing
he does not look well at all
whats on the far side
i dont know
nerves its your damn ship
what the hell do you mean you dont know
finnegan touches pantuccis shoulder
joey what difference does it make
finnegan enters the water
if you hear one shot you know i made it
pantucci follows finnegan to the water
how do we know youre going to signal
how do we know youre not going to just take off
ill wait here
you go check it out
hanover does not move
contemptuous i didnt think so
finnegan wades into the water
just before he sinks beneath the surface
he looks back
with a smile finnegan dives under
pantucci right behind him
the others stand looking around nervous
finnegan swims down to the floor of the ballast
then into a passageway lined with black pipes
pantucci right behind him
strange noises reverberate through the murky waters
creaks and moans
both men are wide eyed as they swim
weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts
the things could come out of almost anywhere
bubbles drift up from the darkness below
the music is tense
very very tense
pantucci falls behind
he swims around a curve and right into a severed human arm
air bubbles blast out of his mouth as he screams
the fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him
he fights his way past and swims off in a panic
trillian stares down into the water
hanover keeps a sharp nervous eye back down the catwalk white knuckling his pulse rifle
chin and mamooli keep watch tight lipped
canton paces back and forth driven by anxiety
canton acts as if he does not hear
he keeps pacing
hanover chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into cantons arm
canton crumbles against the railing in pain
why dont you back off
you want some too
hanovers jaw clenches
he releases the safety on his rifle the click resounding ominously in the hollow room
how brave we are
trillians eyes fix on hanovers unwavering
a mexican standoff
everyone turn to
a giant ball of black wet oozing rubber undulates down the gangway
coming straight at them
a mass of glistening striated muscle
the three men open up with their pulse rifles
the creature gets ripped to shreds
red and blue ink blood splatters everywhere
but onward it comes
down the gangway
trillian grabs the pistol off chins utility belt and opens fire
canton jumps into the water and disappears
finnegan explodes to the surface
gasping for air
he reaches down and yanks a half drowned pantucci up next to him
they both look up to gunfire exploding in the distance
the creature keeps coming
the mercs keep firing
then without warning hanover drops his rifle and dives into the water disappearing beneath the surface
trillian is astounded
she throws down her pistol picks up the pulse rifle and slams on the trigger
the recoil of the rifle throws her into the water
when she surfaces she sees chin and mamooli firing as they retreat to the waters edge
still holding her rifle she dives
trillian swims down a violently shaking passageway
filled with fear
all around debris drops through the water
primordial sounds reverberate off the walls
lots of bubbling and gurgling then something lunges out
trillian opens up
the water fills with fire and bubbles
trillian looks around
the bubbles clear just in time for her to see chin mouth open eyes wide screaming in agony being ripped past her
she tries to fire her rifle
trillian watches as chin vanishes down the shaft in a cloud of bubbles
trillian bursts to the surface
finnegan yanks her up and out of the water
trillian can only nod and gasp for breath
canton and hanover catch their breath panting away waterlogged
hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in trillians hand
trillian points the barrel at him and hits the safety
grim finders keepers
mamooli bursts out of the water falling on the floor close to panic mode
this is not real
this is not bloody real
finnegan topples a large heavy metal broiler onto the open floor gate sealing the watery hole in the floor
there are two hatches in this room
the far hatch is closed
mamooli stands next to an open hatch
canton points to it
another sixty seventy yards
there are more elevators there
i aint goin up no more elevators
mamooli slams the hatch shut
eyes bugging out of his head
i say we stay right here
are you crazy
desperate theres plenty of food here
we can hold out
someonell rescue us
maybe they sent an sos
this son of a bitch to canton zapped the communications
mamooli stand down
we dont even know if his boat is still there
you saw billy
boat or no boat
finnegan steps forward
mamooli aims his rifle right at finnegans head
theyre wipin us out one at a time
i say we make a stand
somebody shoot this jerk
calm nobodys shooting nobody
come on just let us through the hatch
ill kill you
ill fucking kill you
ill do it
ill do it
im not playin around here
close on the hatch
as a black liquid starts to ooze through a tiny latch hole
no one sees it
i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle then he corked it sealing it tight and threw it to a baby octopus
the little sucker felt its way around that bottle and in less than two minutes got that cork off slid inside and ate that fish
what the hell are you talking about
im talking about us
were the fish
the liquid shadow oozes down and hits the floor starts to expand filling like a water balloon
its not a liquid
its a tentacle
veins feelers and suckers begin to form
these things are octopuses i dont know what these things are all i know is
the tentacle slowly rises up right behind mamooli
inches behind his head
finnegan and hanover see it
mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him about to strike
he opens fire emptying his clip into the tentacle
the tentacle retreats into the pipes
mamooli looks around
the room is empty
he runs out
mamooli rushes into the empty passageway looks left
down the hall another tentacle comes racing at him
mamooli panics drops his rifle
track with mamooli racing down the hallway looking over his shoulder in fear as the tentacle comes racing after him
almost on him
mamooli leaps through an open hatch and swings it shut in one swift motion
the tentacle slams into the glass portal
mamooli keeps his eye on the portal and backs up two steps
he lets out a long deep breath of relief turns
another tentacle envelops his face
dantes inferno steam smoke fire strange noises dark areas and lots of moving engine parts
finnegan leads followed by trillian hanover pantucci and canton
we can hear their hearts beating
finnegan heads for a open hatch
it suddenly slams shut
he instantly veers down another passageway
what the hell is going on
finnegan heads for another open hatchway
it also slams shut
theyre herding us
finnegan and company keep going
what are you talking about
as they round a corner the ceiling implodes right in front of them
pipes and other matter crash down
cutting them off
leaving only one route open
a slim passageway
youre saying they can think
im saying theyre calling the shots
finnegan heads toward the passageway
do we have to go there
the ceiling left above them begins to torque and splits
the answer is plain
everyone runs into the passage just as the ceiling comes down
finnegan leads them single file they quickly head into a shaking narrow void
fear has led to silence and unbearable tension
the walls on either side creak and moan with strange noises
finnegan quickly comes out of the creaking moaning gangway followed by the others
all the strange noises suddenly stop
everything gets quiet
everybody looks around
steam shoots out from multiple pipes
the air is thick with mist
whats the matter
maybe we lost them
or maybe were exactly where they want us to be
finnegan moves on
the others follow
guns out front
they round a huge metal pillar and come face to face with a soul wrenching nightmare
the creatures nest or stomach
across a small portion of the ships midsection is a huge gelatinous womb
imagine a massive thick wall of clear yellow jell o with hundreds of blue veins running through it
if it werent all so horrific it would be considered beautiful
inside the womb a dozen humans passengers float around in some kind of twisted embryonic state the living dead
they all seem to be breathing the gelatin
several tentacles wriggle through the stuff which divides and re forms in some sort of strange mitosis
finnegan and the others look at the passengers horrified
but even more horrifying is that the people can look back at them
many start to reach out seemingly in slow motion as their hands ooze through the thick gelatin
trillian looks sick trembles in fear
what is it
a meat locker
we cant just leave them here
canton looks like hes about to throw up he starts backing away heading for a side hatch
in the womb a tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young lady
the lady tries to back pedal away but because of the gelatin its like one of those nightmares where you can only move in slow motion
the feelers grip her naked thigh
she tries to scream but her face is already starting to constrict her whole body is being paralyzed
pantucci is so horrified hes about to cry
oh god please no
the tentacle sac gloms onto the ladys forehead
through the sac we can see her skin melting
the only thing she can move are her eyes which are bugging out in absolute horror as she is imbibed alive
our heroes are frozen in fear
until the ladys eyes liquefy
trillian burries her head in finnegans shoulder trying to shut out the horror
we cant do anything for them
he begins to lead her toward the hatch
when her eyes recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair
the old lady seems to see her too
her hands read out imploring
her mouth silently shapes the words help me
just as a tentacle comes creeping toward her
her rage rises
she hefts her rifle and starts blasting away
you wont get her
spitting flames and smoke
the bullets impact the gelatin
blasting it away
but the bullets only manage to go about twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop
gelatin explodes all over the place
tracer holes streak through the stuff
but all the bullets are sliding short
finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling where most of the tentacles are coming from
their long tails wiggle down from a massive clutter of pipes
a bas relief of horror
finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades off hanovers utility belt
bites the pins and spits them out
he chucks the grenades up into the strange writhing fresco safely clear of the passengers
pantucci and hanover throw themselves to the floor
finnegan pulls trillian down covering her
a loud creepy suction like sound is heard that strange pitter patter of little feet running across the hull
then the hull begins to moan and creak from an unseen pressure
all the movement stops
the remaining tentacles vanish into the machinery
pantucci and hanover look up from the floor covered in slime
finnegan and trillian also look up
and then look at each other face to face
dripping with slime
you should talk
then the machinery shuts down
the engines go dead
all sound cuts out
an expectant hush
somewhere water drips
we go extremely close on trillians eyes
the air is riddled with ominous expectation
and thats when the hull begins to torque
rivets pop and snap
at the far end of the ship part of the lower bow rips open
and a wall of water rushes in
finnegans eyes widen as he sees model shot the massive wave of water equipment and everything in front of it
they all hightail it for hatches
finnegan and trillian make it into one hatch
hanover and pantucci make it into another
water crashes and sprays behind them
massive air bubbles explode out from under the bow
red warning lights flash up and down every passageway
and a claxton rings in accelerating tones giving a frenetic urgency to all of the water blasts through a hatch and chases finnegan and trillian down a passageway
they jag left at an intersection water blasts through the hatch directly in front of them
were going to sink
weve got to get on deck
trillians now in the lead
they haul ass down a hallway
water roaring in from everywhere behind them
all of the watertight hatches begin to hydraulically close
trillian and finnegan jag into a hatch
its a small room
the hatch in front of them closes
water blasts in behind them
sweeps them off their feet
the room quickly starts to fill up
trillian pulls frantically at the hatch
hanover and pantucci quickly slog their way through knee high water
pantucci stumbles into the water frantically scrambles up
he looks back under the water inky forms hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him
pantucci yelps and splashes away
trillian and finnegan pull with all their might on a tiny portal
finnegan tries to insert the blade of his knife in the crack
so how do you get from the bronx to the south china sea
you quit high school lie about your age join the navy and next thing you know four years are up and you need a way to make a living
the knife blade slips into the crack
ill break the seal
he yanks the blade
the seal pops
the portal flies open
waist high in water trillian sticks her arm out tries to get her shoulder out but theres no chance in hell of that
she pulls her arm out
and a tentacle lunges in
just missing trillian
it splashes under the water
grabs finnegans ankle
pulls him under
finnegan sticks the barrel of his gun underwater and opens fire
the tentacle recoils
and rips itself back out the porthole
trillian slams the porthole shut and dogs it tight
the pantucci and hanover hauling ass
hanover pulls out his last two thermite grenades
pantucci panics and grabs for them
he knocks both of them out of hanovers hands
they disappear under the water
they quickly fumble around in the water trying to find them
a tentacle blasts around the corner
partially obscured by the wave in front of it
heading right for them
hanover finds the two grenades
gives one to pantucci
they rip the pins out and toss the grenades behind them
then haul ass faster
the tentacle right behind them
and then the grenades explode ba woom
the storm hammers the deck
canton staggers out onto the rain slicked deck just in time to see a hole being blown out the side of the fuji marus hull
bubbles continue to explode out from under the bow
oh my god its going to sink
then slowly canton gets a gleam in his eye now thrilled
its going to sink
finnegan and trillian are getting banged around the frothy water as it quickly rises
now only inches from the ceiling
theyre about to drown
finnegan keeps looking around trying to figure a way out
i was so goddamn close finnegan
so goddamn close to my island
i could almost taste the sand
finnegan shoves the pulse rifle to the ceiling
and blasts away until part of the ceiling falls out and into the water
theres just enough room between two metal beams to get out
the rising water shoves them up through the hole
side by side hanover and pantucci quickly slog their way through waist high water
they round a corner and look back inky forms slosh around the corner
heading right for them
they slog faster
theyre catchin up
theyre catchin up
we gotta slow em down
thatll slow them down
a black striated muscle roils out of the foamy water then quickly vanishes under it heading straight for them
feed em what
what are we gonna feed em
hanover takes his pistol and shoots pantucci in the leg blam
falls into the water
hanover runs on
pantucci doesnt even have time to deal with the pain
he starts scrambling through the water
underwater the inky forms race after him
only meters away
pantucci throws himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter
slams the door shut
the tentacle attacks the door
worming its way across the surface trying to find a way inside
pantucci is scared beyond his pain
pushing back as far as he can against the rear wall he sees the control button
he presses the up arrow
the dumbwaiter starts to move
the saipan is still bobbing behind the fuji maru
but the harpoon hook which holds the tow line and is embedded into the rear deck of the ship is starting to pry loose
it jerks and bucks against the metal wall
canton doesnt notice this as he slips and slides his way up to the railing
he sees the saipan and smiles
then he looks off at rising out of the ocean
about a mile away
canton starts to climb over the railing
and thats when the harpoon hook rips free
and impales cantons leg
tries to spin free
the hook hangs onto his leg for a long agonizing beat as canton continues to scream
then the hook rips free grabs the metal railing and starts tearing it off the deck
canton drops to the deck holding his leg and whimpering in pain
and then he sees it dangling from its harness down on the watersports platform
canton starts to crawl for it
moaning and bleeding
finnegan and trillian race up onto the pool deck
passing beneath a colorful neon sign which reads in the dark trillian trips
she falls to the slippery waterlogged deck and screams
clawing at her face
finnegan pulls her hands from her face
and the thing that attached itself there
a small squid from the shattered aquarium
tries to catch her breath
its not one of them
its from the aquarium
and then it dawns on finnegan
its not them
you know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship
a million little things like this
he holds up the squid
cant exert that kind of pressure
and the way it tracked us
a million little things dont carry portable phones to coordinate positions
whats chasing us
looking down on the fuji maru from high up in the air
beneath the entire ship is an enormous undulating black shadow
a massive monster from the deep
red warning lights flash
the claxton rings
off to one side of a wall behind the bar the dumbwaiter door opens and pantucci tumbles out looks around and then hears
pantucci limps around the bar down a row of one armed bandits
rounds a corner comes face to face with hanover
hanovers eyes are filled with terror and despair
his face is badly constricted
his body paralyzed
he clings to a black jack table as a tentacle sac drinks its way up his leg
its already to his hip
he grasps desperately for his pistol just beyond his reach on the floor
this guy aint gonna survive
pantucci yelps and quickly back away eyes wide totally tense
he looks around sees that theres only one tentacle and its completely occupied with devouring hanover
pantucci is wigged but manages to lock eyes with hanover
then he looks at the sac filled with regurgitated flesh
even you dont deserve this
pantucci picks up hanovers pistol
then slowly cautiously he creeps forward and sticks the gun into hanovers im sorry man
he turns and quickly limps off
hanovers eyes look down at the gun in his hand
then with all the strength he has left he slowly painfully turns the pistol so it points at his head
close on hanovers trembling finger
as it slowly squeezes the trigger
he want to kill himself
needs to hill himself
he squeezes harder
the trigger depresses
the gun is empty
hanovers mouth opens in a horrible silent scream
finnegan and trillian race out onto the rear deck just as the harpoon hook finishes tearing the railing off the ship
the hook the tow line and the entire railing drop over the side and fall out of sight
the two boats are now uncoupled
finnegan reels at the rain soaked sky
will somebody give me a break here
and thats when finnegan and trillian hear the sound of a hydraulic hoist
they look over the speedboat is being hydraulically lowered into the water
canton sits inside fiddling with the ignition
angle on trillian and finnegan racing down the spiral stairs leading to the watersports platform
the boat touches down into the water
id like to but i have an appointment with my insurance broker
he hits the hoist release button
the speedboat breaks free
canton hits the ignition
the boats engine roars
life takes the damndest turns doesnt it
he red lines the throttle
the speedboat hauls ass away from the cruiseliner
canton steers for the island
angle on trillian you son of a bitch
she grabs finnegans pulse rifle hefts it to her shoulder
he forces her to look in the distance
oh my god
oh my god
how do we do it
how do we get there
not like him
finnegan points to the water
and an inky pseudopod form racing after the speedboat underwater
its the engine
it can hear the engine
it goes for the loudest sound
the tentacle quickly picks up speed going faster and faster getting closer and closer stretching further and further
suddenly behind them a metallic thrashing sound is heard
they turn around and look the hook the tow line and the entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis
trying to tear free the saipan is still clinging by its fingernails to the fuji maru
finnegan races over to a winch and grabs the winch line
canton smiling brightly peers at the approaching island through the speedboats windscreen
so relieved he sings to himself from the operetta h
oh we sail the ocean blue and our mighty ships a beauty
we are strong men yes its true and responsive to our duty
the speedboat is grabbed from below practically exploding as it disintegrates into two pieces
canton is propelled through the windscreen and onto the hood
finnegan struggles to clip the winch line onto the tow line hanging precariously over the edge of the ship clip in one hand winch line in the other
the whole metal mess is bucking and twisting and screeching
his every joint is being ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the line before the entire rig tears away into the sea
with one last heroic effort of will and grit he snaps the clip in place just as it all breaks loose
one of the jet skis and the entire railing are ripped over the side and fall down into the ocean
finnegan is also yanked over the side but he manages to hold on by his fingers dangling precariously
the hook and the tow line drop then snap taught as the winch line holds them tight
trillian throws the start lever on the winch
the winch kicks on and starts reeling in the saipan
finnegan tries to crawl up on the deck exhausted
trillian reaches down and pulls him the rest of the way up
he half collapses on top of her
you know finnegan im starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner
despite the grimness of their position the closeness of their bodies is
a turn on
to both of them
and then a scream from the sea
they look in the direction of
canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat his face shredded by glass his leg mangled screaming as his panicked eyes watch a tentacle slowly squirm across the hood
toward him its hideous feelers writhe and arch
canton backs away from it as far as he can
another tentacle squirms up next to him
canton crawls away from that one
its feelers and suckers unsheathe dripping mucus
cantons eyes widen horrified
then another tentacle squirms up
canton crawls to the center of the hood
and another tentacle
canton has nowhere to go
the tentacles close in on him
all the tentacles rise over him about to descend
finnegan and trillian race for all they are worth clamber over the side of the fuji maru dropping to the deck of the saipan
finnegan and trillian slowly clamber through the hold waist deep in water on edge eyes wide watching for any sign of trouble
its quiet in here
maybe too quiet
the minute you start your engines
its going to kill us isnt it
they step up to one of the big crates
finnegan starts smashing it with the butt of his pulse rifle
the crate burst open
revealing the warhead of the torpedo
trillian is stunned
not unless we kill it first
finnegan smashes more of the crate it falls apart revealing the entire torpedo
he hands her his pulse rifle
anything moves you shoot
finnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile head
trillian looks around nervously
theres not much horsepower left in the engines but theres enough noise
once this babys set
ill rev it up
that slimy bastard will come for it like candy
if you blow up your boat how are we going to get to the island
theres one left up there
the plate comes loose
revealing a gaggle of wires and parts
lets see it was red wire cross compressor blue wire
or blue cross red
he starts to fiddle with the wires
suddenly theres a loud sloshing sound right behind them
more pulse rifles spill out
trillian spins ready to blast away with the pulse rifle to
just the man i wanted to see
on this puppy here you remember if its red to blue or blue to red
he refers to the wires
not even a joey im glad to see you
joey what happened to your leg
joey you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid
fast red cross over to blue double blue is that what it is
its got tentacles a feed sac
probably one central nervous processor somewhere
what the hell do i know is going on deep down in the ocean
theres all sorts of shit weve never seen
eighty foot clams
im just guessing
can you get me more juice out of hercules
for juice i gotta rebuild
thats not fast
how about noise
can you get noise
we dont need speed just noise right
can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here
to trillian you ever operate a jet ski
nervous you want me to go up there
not unless you can wire a missile or fix an engine
and what if i run into one of those things
finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate
dont forget the safety
she hits the safety slams a shell into chamber
dont take too long
im not planning on being on the menu tonight
razzing ive never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex
the two of you got a nice patter going
got a nice rapport
and you got minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening
finnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket
a red light starts to blink on the warhead
it is very dark
the rain is getting worse
the fuji maru moans and creaks
bubbles explode from beneath it
the saipan rocks against her hull
trillian clambers along the tilting railing heading for the watersports platform
her gorgeous eyes shift nervously
im going to be ok
im going to be ok
the ships metal hull screeches
the seawater bubbles and gurgles
from somewhere deep inside the ship we hear that loud primordial yowl again
trillian freezes her heart double beats
she looks around really scared
the missile is on a hoist being pushed forward by pantucci and finnegan toward a gaping hole in the port bow
you know what i think
i think our luck has just about run shit out
a little to the left
i think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next
line it up now nice and easy
the missile head is right in line with the hole in the bow
im telling you man we got to give the future some serious thought
i have been
and what have you come up with
how does an island sound to you
pantucci looks at finnegan quizically
this is news to him
the tip of the warhead creeps out through the hole
the body of the missile is just a hair too wide which is good because it jams itself nice and tight into the hole
trillian takes the tarp off the remaining jet ski
pushes the swivel arm that holds it out over the railing
the platform tilts
trillian loses her balance
almost goes over the side
just barely manages to catch herself
hangs there for a moment
something swishes in the water below her
trillians eyes scan the darkness scared sick
finnegan lashes the steering sticks as hard left as theyll go
the rudder locks tight
i gerry rigged the ignition
all you gotta do is start her up
it wont go fast but itll go loud
trillians scream tears through the night
finnegans eyes go to the fuji maru
he kicks open a box by the side of the console and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol handle in a holster
man dont go up there
start the engine
finnegan slams shells into the shotgun
second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump
all youre gonna do is get yourself killed
and for what
youre beautiful what youre jealous you know that joey
finnegan hefts a pulse rifle and runs out of the pilothouse
finnegan drops onto the deck from the tow line
pulse rifle leveled
adrenaline rushing through his veins
a man on a mission
the ship is in its final death throes
moaning and creaking
trillians scream pierces the night followed by several shots
finnegan takes off in its direction
ready to be jumped
the scary music builds
again shots fired
this time closer
finnegan throws caution to the winds and runs for all he is worth
trillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle wrapped around her legs
she struggles frantically trying to get a clear shot off
but her shot goes wild as she is pulled this way and that slammed against the walls on either side
she loses her rifle
finnegan enters the glass domed atrium
sloshes through the water
stops in the middle and looks around
sees a tentacle writhing up a glass wall of the atrium
finnegan hears trillian scream
he quickly plants his feet and fires from the hip
glass shatters everywhere
he arcs around
windows blow to pieces
finnegan lets out a low angry guttural yell
the tentacle shreds from the gunfire
the tentacle dragging trillian retracts
freed trillian gets up grabs her rifle and runs like hell
trillian runs in and is immediately hit by colorful swirling lights and a pulsating strobe
flashing red warning lights the sound of the claxton the spraying water and thick mist
disoriented trillian runs towards a dark exit door and into a geometric gelatinous spider web
finnegan is slamming another clip into his pulse rifle when he hears trillian yelling for help
he takes off running through a hatch
trillian struggles in the web but shes only getting herself more stuck
behind her deep in the web tentacles slowly start squirming their way towards her
trillian feels the gelatin start to move
she struggles wildly
finnegan enters the room
starts sloshing his way through the water
trillian sees him coming
trillian looks back
sees the tentacles coming out of the darkness of the web
twenty feet back and closing
finnegan runs up and grabs her
tries to pull her free
but shes stuck good
he looks behind her to the tentacles quickly closing in on her
now fifteen feet away
get me out of here
as she struggles finnegan pulls out his knife and starts to hack away at the sticky webbing
trillian tries to look behind her
trillian struggles with every last ounce of her strength
now ten feet away
finnegan hacks away with desperate urgency
now five feet
grab my hands
finnegan plunges his hands into the goo
trillian latches onto finnegans wrists he onto hers
finnegan strains pulling until every muscle in his body keens with the effort every vein pops to the surface
trillian pushes for all she is worth
with a last gargantuan effort finnegan yanks
trillian comes tearing out of the webbing
the remnants of her gown doesnt
in the nick of time
the tentacle rushes forward
finnegan jams his pulse rifle into the web and opens fire
blasting the entire clip into the goo
tearing the shit out of it
and thats when the whole room starts to quake
finnegan and trillian both look down at their feet as they hear the lower decks exploding upward one at a time bam
something is rising up through the ship
he grabs trillain and pulls her toward the exit
she scoops her fallen pulse rifle off the floor
he shoves her out the door and is about to follow when the door is slammed shut in his face
get to the jet ski
trillian stands there pulling on the door half naked
the door is bolted tight
she has not other options
she runs off
finnegan turns as the dance floor and the d
booth explode as something rises up from below them
his eyes widen
and there it is the huge horrible mutated mucus covered sucker faced head of the creature
a giant mutated protoplasm
jutting up from a breach in the floor
the trunk of the creature the part where all the tentacles come from is below the next deck
a slimy translucent membrane slowly rises revealing what appears to be some sort of organic liquid eye
it seems to stare right at finnegan who is transfixed by the sight
a tentacle slowly starts to move in on finnegan
finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris that blocks his shot
the eyeball type organism follows him
another tentacle starts to move
silently undulating through the water towards finnegan
the membrane over the eye moves
and another tentacle starts to close in for the kill
they are surrounding finnegan
finnegan comes around the shattered d
faces the creature full on
he cant miss
he gives it a wicked smile
get a good look
in slow motion finnegan lifts his pulse rifle
it drips water
he jams the gun butt into his hip
takes aim fires
but he only gets off one quick burst before a tentacle lashes out and grabs him
jerks him into the air
his pulse rifle goes flying
finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into the floor and the death that awaits him
he struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer closer
he is about to disappear down the hole of no return when his hand comes up with his knife
he slashes the tentacle in two scrambles up and heads for an open door
as he reaches the door a tentacle rises up in front of him
blocking his way
its maw opens wide
a terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death
about to devour him
as it strikes forward finnegan draws his shotgun and blasts the vile thing to smithereens
he bolts through the door several tentacles already after him
trillian sits up on the jet ski
she hears the gunfire
finnegan runs wildly down a passageway
he rounds a corner
a tentacle side swipes him
smashes him into a wall
finnegan drops the shotgun
hits the floor running
another tentacles checks him
sends him spiraling through a hatch
finnegan tumbles in
quickly rolls over and looks back a tentacle lashes in through the doorway
finnegan back pedals on his hands and feet stumbling over various sports equipment
the tentacle homes in on him
finnegan hurls himself backwards
throwing anything that comes to hand at the tentacle
a tackle box
but onward it comes
finnegan back pedals faster
over diving gear
fins and masks
the tentacle rises
about to strike
finnegan backs into the wall
he spots a speargun
the tentacle lunges
pins it to the wall
finnegan scrambles past the furiously writhing tentacle and runs out of the room
trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into the dark water
she frantically whispers to herself oh my god oh my god
suddenly twenty feet from the jet ski something swirls through the water
trillian aims her pulse rifle at it
something drops onto the ski behind her
she turns ghost white
i dont mean to drop in unannounced you ready
soon as i get over the heart attack
no engine goes on
he whistles again
still no response
removes his watch gives it to trillian
im not back
no matter what
you dont take orders very well do you
i dont take orders at all
this time make an exception
he grabs trillians pulse rifle and leaps up on the side of the saipan and scales up to the deck
trillian watches him and then looks at the watch
finnegan bursts in
then he spots something on the floor
he reaches down and picks it up
its pantuccis leather tool belt
its been ripped to shreds
finnegan stares at it
his grip tightening
tears rising in his eyes
his jaw clenching
then he flings the belt aside
filled with rage
time to die motherfucker
finnegan hits the ignition button
a desperate moment of dry cranking
and then the one remaining engine catches sputters and fires to life
trillian hears the saipans engine come to life
she hits the ignition on the jet ski
right next to her something drops from the deck of the saipan into the water
finnegan clambers up in front of her
his pulse rifle still in hand
wheres you friend
hes not coming
the saipan strains on its leashes
finnegan swings his rifle around
opens up on the tie lines
all the tie lines shred
the saipan starts to break free
he guns the ski
and it stalls
the jet ski stalls
goes dead in the water
nearby the water swirls violently
he hammers the starter button
the engine stutters
he tries again
more water swirls getting closer now
but the third times a charm
the jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship
just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water
finnegan fires at it blowing it to pieces
the last tie line snaps
the saipan lurches away from the fuji maru
the jammed steering sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle
finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski
pedal to the metal
looking straight ahead
trillian holds on for dead life
suddenly a wave explodes in front of the jet ski
finnegan cranks the handlebars
the jet ski slews sideways
the saipan starts to arc around
the warhead gleams in the moonlight
finnegan hauls ass away from the fuji maru
another wave explodes
a tentacle rears up
right in front of the jet ski
finnegan and trillian lean hard
the jet ski skids sideways across the water
trillian cant hold on
flips off the back
skips across the water
finnegan roars away
a tentacle hard on his ass
trillian pops to the surface
watches finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind
finnegan looks back at trillian
bobbing in the water
the he looks at the saipan
continuing its arc
its deadly payload racing for the fuji maru
finnegan cranks the handlebars
smashes through a wave and heads for trillian
trillian sees him and swims hard
the saipan roars straight at the fuji maru
the warhead perfectly positioned to strike its hull
only fifty meters away
now thirty five
finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski
slides up next to trillian
grabs her by her arm
rips her out of the water
throws her onto the back of the jet ski
just as a tentacles rises up lashing out
he guns it
smashes through the waves
the warhead splashes through the water
the jet ski hauls ass
faster and faster
a huge geyser of water explodes in front of the jet ski
a tentacle slaps down hard
finnegan cuts hard
the jet ski ramps through the geyser
they and the jet ski tumble and splash across the water
the twenty five meters away from hitting the fuji maru
no twenty meters away
finnegan pops to the surface
cant find trillian
he dives under the water
his pov tentacles converging on him from the murky depths
the retrieve feature thats on all jet skis forces it back around towards where finnegan and trillian fell off
finnegan burst to the surface
she looks nearly lifeless
the jet ski heads right at them
finnegan swims for it
as tentacles converge from all sides
the jet ski is suddenly sucked under the water
finnegan quickly reverses
backstrokes like mad
the warhead slices through the water
now only ten meters away from hitting the fuji maru
now nine meters away
finnegan paddles hard
sucking in as much water as he is air
a tentacle rises up out of the water
looms above finnegan and trillian
about to strike
theres nowhere to hide
finnegan paddles harder
the tentacle starts its downward lunge
and thats when the saipan rams the fuji maru
the warhead slams into its hull
the saipan evaporates
fire fills the night sky
the top deck of the fuji maru cartwheels across the waves
the tentacle above finnegan drops like lead
and just lies there
lifts the remains of the fuji maru out of the sea
sends shock waves across the water
blows finnegans hair back
he swims on
towards the island
the remains of the saipan and the fuji maru smolder and sink
bubbles explode to the surface
a couple dozen small fires dot the waves
water sizzles and steams
smoke drifts into the night sky
debris coats the water
finnegan and trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the beach of the island
they collapse next to each other
finnegan is exhausted
trillian coughs up seawater
they both turn and look out to sea and the rising sun
trillian reaches into her bra and pulls out the egg sized diamond
she holds it up
the sun refracts off it brilliantly
trillian looks at the diamond looks around at the picture perfect island the picture perfect sunset
and then she heaves it as far as she can into the sea
for the first time since they know each other there is nobody around
and when they look at each other something else comes to mind besides survival
finnegan moves towards trillian
trillian moves towards finnegan
their lips move closer closer
and then down by their feet something explodes out of the water
scares the shit out of them
the audience too
but its just pantucci
looking waterlogged and shell shocked
coughing up half the sea
finnegan and trillian help him to his feet
was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to
because its cool you know i can always take a walk or something down the beach
or i could go for a swim
although i gotta tell you
if i never get in the water again
you dont have to beg me ill stick around
and then they head the most gut wrenching spine tingling teeth shattering roar ever
like no sound or animal or thing weve ever hear beofre
coming from deep or maybe not
finnegan trillian and pantucci slowly turn and look inland
we begin to pull back as they all stand up
more strange we keep pulling back
revealing more of this creepy looking island
and leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach
we keep pulling back
revealing pieces of the smoldering ship
nearly the whole island is visible now
maybe the scariest looking place on earth
the thing roars again
