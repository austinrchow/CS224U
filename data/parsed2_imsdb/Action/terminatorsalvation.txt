start tight on marcus wright
hes an intense powerful man s s his head shaven
marcus stares into camera with a resigned expression
we hear the voice of a priest yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art beside me thy
rod and thy staff they comfort me
camera pulls back straight up
marcus lies in his cot staring at the ceiling
hes smoking a cigarette
this overhead angle reveals a priest with a bible in a folding chair beside him
a chess set stacks of books writing materials in the cell
two guards wait shackles in hand
marcus has no interest in scripture
he blows a cloud of smoke which drifts in the direction of the priest who blinks and shuts his bible
one of the guards unlocks the cell door for dr
shes in her s s brilliant attractive but thin and pale a scarf tied around her head
she carries a clipboard
the priest backs off to give her some privacy with marcus
marcus im doctor serena kogan im with project angel
you consented to donate your body to science
yeah im pretty much done with it
youve been chosen for our research
we just need a couple of signatures
marcus sits up she passes him the clipboard and pen he notes that her hands are shaking
you dont need to be scared
its nerve degeneration
marcus looks up from the form takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair
youre not the only one with a death sentence
marcus meets her eyes
she studies him a beat
serena contd what youre doing is important marcus
our work is still highly experimental
but you may be helping people in ways you cant begin to imagine
im a regular hero
with that sarcastic comment he signs his name we see the words project angel at the top of dense type on the form
serena takes the clipboard starts to rise
she touches his hand for a moment
no one lives forever
the guard sees serena out
low angle marcus chained ankles clank as the guards lead him down the corridor past prisoners in their cells some avert their eyes others give a nod or raise a
marcus this is your last opportunity to make a confession
marcus stares straight ahead taking deep steady breaths struggling not to succumb to fear
contd is there nothing you would say to officer martinez family
close buckles tighten
an alcohol swab on marcus forearm
a needle punctures his skin
what can i say
i was seventeen i was angry i was stupid
fingers turn the valve to release the lethal chemicals
close on marcus eyes looking up toward the deadly i
running into his arm
from this he looks toward his reflection in a one way mirror the dim shapes of witnesses beyond
im sorry about it
im sorry about everything
the whole goddamn world
as the lethal injection takes hold his pov moves to bright lights overhead losing focus and bleaching to white
from the white screen a face emerges backlit blurred its serena
shes in focus for just a moment leaning into camera then moves out of frame
cornstalks as far as the eye can see rustling in a summer breeze
figures are moving within the field
we only make them out in silhouette but all carry heavy rifles
a computer targeting screen the figures are highlighted in this tactical display as is an octagonal hatch into the ground beneath the corn
the figures in the corn look up we hear an aircraft approach with a jet whine fwoom
a massive concussion as a bunker busting missile bores into the earth at high velocity burrowing deep then a huge blast flame and dirt are thrown high in the air
many of the figures blown sky high
a flaming body hits the ground in fg face to camera
we now see it was a steel terminator its metal skull blown open and scorched its red eyes shattered
a warthogs stubby attack planes scream from the sky raking the remaining figures with cannon fire blasting them to bits
these aircraft no longer bear traditional u
insignia theyre painted in wild colors graffiti lettering says things like bot blaster kill for connor rage against the machines etc
motley military and civilian choppers land in the cornfield disgorging resistance soldiers
these are human troops in high tech helmets carrying slightly futuristic conventional the warthogs veer off laying napalm in the distance behind the soldiers
the troops run toward an opening which has been blown into the ground the remains of the octagonal hatch where the bunker buster hit
a surviving terminator rises from the singed corn fires its dropping a soldier
his comrades fire explosive bullets and blow the robot apart
the leader of this assault group waves his soldiers to enter the dark hatchway
collapsed ceilings flames a high tech installation in ruins red lighting distinctive of skynet environments
soldiers flick on helmet lamps and make their way carefully inside pretty deserted
they kick aside rubble to enter helmet beams play over banks of electronics and a dozen fixed industrial robots not remotely humanoid engaged in mysterious tasks mechanical arms at work
the soldiers rake the room with gunfire machinery collapses sparks from exploding circuitry
deeper into the complex a heavy door blows off its hinges
soldiers move from cover and through the blown door
tubes and fiber optic cables run into dozens of glass cylinders filled with translucent pink liquid
the soldiers make their way in alert but nothings moving in here
the team leader peers into a cylinder aims his headlamp at a small mass of tissue floating inside connected to a dense network of fiber optic cables
its a human brain
the team leader recoils but before he can say more the room shakes with a deafening roar
a huge escape ship rises straight up from an open hatchway
nearby troops crouch and fire after it
the ship pivots in mid air and roars off soldiers dodging the engine blast
the team leader speaks into his headset
the other soldiers inspect the many cylinders react in horror and shock
you will not believe the shit we found down here as he speaks camera finds a green led on the ceiling which suddenly flashes red and blinks rapidly wide an
immense subterranean blast causes a few hundred yards square to swell and then collapse
jets of flame smoke and dirt rise in the aftermath
a panicked pilot on the radio repeat that was not us
a ship escaped they musta blown the place themselves
jesus a lot of our guys were still down there
soldiers above ground help the wounded to evac choppers
in fg find the steel skull of the dead terminator
same angle the terminator now half sunk in mud
a field mouse has nested in its skull cavity seeking shelter from months have passed the season changed corn long dead a black stubble
a patch of mud stirs something below is moving
the mud roils seeming to assume a human shape
eyes open looking around in shock the naked figure is so drenched in mud we cant recognize it at first
the figure rises looks up at the sky and falling rain washes away mud from his face
its marcus wright
he opens his mouth makes a few guttural noises
camera pulls up from marcus agonized face
bare feet trudge through the dirt
marcus moves along a slight rise wrapped in torn and filthy rags mud caked on his body
reaching the edge of a rise he sees in the distance a decimated city buildings collapsed into rubble
the skeleton of a large dog lies on the ground partially covered by a dusting of snow
it still bears a rotting collar attached to a chain
move to a chain link fence partially collapsed a singed faded sign beware of dog
wider were in the low rent district of this city in ruins rubble random walls still stand
hulks of cars rusted windowless
its been over a decade since the bombs fell
marcus is the only thing alive here
he moves down this block picks up a handful of snow brings it to his lips
a collapsed newsstand
marcus walks past the racks picks up a magazine which crumbles in his hands
a human skeleton clothes in tatters is half buried behind the collapsed counter
theres a bulge in its shirt pocket
marcus gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a cellophane wrapped pack of cigarettes and a butane lighter
marcus sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton
he tears open the packet and puts a dried out stale cigarette to his lips tries the lighter a few times finally gets a flame
he lights the cig inhales deeply he waits for a rush feels nothing
he takes a few more drags increasingly disappointed then flicks the cigarette away
he rises looks toward a caved in storefront makes out a clothing stores tattered sign on the ground amidst broken glass sale
going out of business
everything must go
fallen racks clothes and shoes covered in years of dust and rubble
marcus grateful to be rid of the rags has pulled on jeans and sneakers using the cigarette lighter for illumination
he kicks away some fallen ceiling tiles from a rack of army jackets
he holds one up looks good
partially collapsed a downscale watering hole
broken stools booths a dead pinball machine
marcus dressed now again using the lighter to find his way sorts through the broken glass and rubble behind the bar comes up with hallelujah
he unscrews the cap raises the bottle to a skeleton on the floor nearby
marcus takes a long pull and chokes instantly dizzy
he sinks to the floor passing out
memory montage quick fragmentary impressionistic povs blurred altered
sfx of heartbeats a respirator
webs of tubes and fiber optics fills the frame
grids of laser light scan rapidly into camera
digital displays blink through murky liquid
serena moves into frame a look of concentration on her face as she peers through the liquid into camera
she starts to smile
tilt down to find marcus who plods on through the dead citys outskirts
he pauses near a collapsed bus kiosk
a smiling woman stares out at him from a faded advertisement
marcus studies the woman
shes nothing like serena but her expression recalls the beckoning vision
he runs his hand over the image of her face pulls away a chunk of cracked graffitied glass over the poster
then he carefully tears the poster to remove the womans face folds the paper slips it in a pocket and continues on
deserted car hulks about crumbling skeletons at the wheels
marcus moves down the center of the freeway on this moonlit night paying little attention to anything around him
were in mostly flat treeless plains
from the opposite direction figures approach moving through the darkness
marcus hurries excitedly toward them the first living creatures hes seen
yo over here
the figures pause turning toward him in unison
marcus contd damn its good to see you guys i felt like i was the last man on
he freezes in his tracks
these arent humans
theyre t s plastic skinned terminators armed with plasma rifles
they wear a motley collection of found clothing but their male humanoid faces are identical unnatural and motionless like masks
their eyes flicker red as they scan him
marcus contd oh god
marcus backs away runs
the t s stare after him but dont fire
angle through binocular mask marcus running for all hes worth heading toward the viewer
we hear a muttering voice hey mister where you goin in such a hurry
angle on a boy scrawny and filthy in his early to mid teens
he crouches on the supports of a freeway sign
he wears layers of tattered over sized clothing
he scrambles quickly down from the sign
at an off ramp marcus pace slows as he moves to get off the freeway when the boy emerges from behind some rubble holding a handgun in one hand a
lit oil lantern in the other
boy contd whoah whoah hang on there
got any food
marcus raises his hands shakes his head
the boy looks him over dubiously
boy contd you look like you been eating pretty good
the boy moves closer puts down the lantern frisks marcus with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other
you can see me you can touch me
this place is real
the boy makes a dubious face yanks a handful of paper scraps from marcus pocket
marcus contd i thought i was in hell
raises an eyebrow this sure aint heaven
those things with masks red eyes terminators t s
what is this stuff
the boy unfolds the paper scraps in the lantern light angle on paper scraps the womans face from the poster a fragment of a models photo from a magazine ad
a painting of a female face from a paperback cover
the boy looks puzzled intrigued by the pictures
but with sudden speed marcus grabs the boys gun hand and wrenches it hard it fires into the air
marcus gets control of the gun wraps one arm around the boys throat
if im not in hell where am i
the noise of a shotgun pumping close behind marcus marcus spins to face his attacker pressing the handgun into the boys cheek
hes face to face with a girl a couple of years younger than the boy training the shotgun at marcus head she looks ready to shoot
let him go
first put down the shotgun
the girl shakes her head angrily
she wears an aged beloved baseball cap with a star on it
do what he says
hell kill us both
i dont wanna kill anyone
do it star
put it down
she shakes her head slightly aiming carefully at marcus head just a few feet away a slight smile on her face
there was only one bullet in that gun
marcus hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly
boots it at the girl
burning oil spills across her leg she cries out and fumbles the shotgun
marcus tosses the boy at her the two of them sprawl on the ground the shotgun falling to one side marcus quickly snatches up the shotgun
using snow the boy helps the girl extinguish the flames from her clothing
marcus stands over the kids with a gun in each hand
he struggles to control anger speaks quietly
i dont like it when people point guns at me
it wasnt loaded
marcus quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun indeed both are empty
you took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun
studies them admiringly pretty stupid
he shoves the handgun in his belt puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper a few have caught fire and are incinerated
the boy and girl get to their feet stare at marcus
can i have my gun back
marcus shrugs gestures for her to pick it up
he still looks at the pictures in his hands
girl contd whered you get those
in the city
steps away from him the city
that place is red hot
a small smile seemed kinda dead to me
a spotlight appears in the distance a roving hunter killer moving in their direction
quickly automatically the kids dive for cover behind a wall of debris
marcus looks toward the light unaware of danger
the boy bolts from behind cover grabs marcus by the arm boy contd get down theyve seen the light
he drags marcus back behind the debris wall just in time as the h k nears the light finds the burning oil
it fires blue pulses which chew up the asphalt nearby then it moves on failing to pick out the humans
marcus is dumbfounded
that wasnt a helicopter
its an h k hunter killer
where the hell have you been
rads musta fried his brains
lets go kyle
the h k has vanished in the distance
the girl rises
the boy kyle shakes his head stays at marcus side
whats your name
after a beat marcus
indicates girl she doesnt remember her name re her cap so i call her star
star gives marcus a small reluctant wave
kyle contd gonna be light soon marcus better find cover
we spotted some buildings half a mile that way
kyle points but gets no response
he shrugs sets off with star in that direction
kyle calls over his shoulder kyle contd you can come if you want
hissing at him why
we dont need him
a shrug sotto i like him
marcus looks around at the desolate world and the two teens receding ahead of him
after a beat he follows
kyle star and marcus move along the roadside heading toward dark buildings a few hundred yards off near an overpass
what year is it
are you sure
two thousand eighteen
ive lost years
so who did it to us
the russians the chinese
there was a war right
who started it
kyle cocks his head at him
something fall on your head
the machines did it the computers they got smart
i was just a baby
whats the last thing you remember
a beat dying
a mexican fast food joint windows broken sign collapsed near a two story motel with a covered carport
the pavement is cracked the structures weathered abandoned for a decade
marcus kyle and star suddenly rise from a hiding spot by a dumpster in a parking area
kyle scans the fast food place with the binoculars while star studies a watch she carries
they drop down again
one aerostat patrols the area
its a surveillance drone the size of a softball shiny steel an inset camera lens with a red glow
it flies in a geometric pattern hovering every few seconds before continuing on
it vanishes around the corner of the fast food joint moving in the direction of the motel
star has been timing its moves
kyle and star dash for the fast food entrance marcus just behind
they round the doorway and drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a taco place remnants of mexican decor
through a dirty window they see the aerostat buzz past flying its pattern
it moves on without spotting them then takes off in a new direction
kyle and star set to searching the place something theyve done many times
they go through trash cans check behind the counters and in the kitchen
marcus gets up still looking out the windows
that flying grapefruit what was it
aerostat one of skynets eyes
they patrol places like this looking for survivors
shes come up with some unopened packets of condiments from a bag of trash
kyle trots over
any red ones
she nods excitedly hands him a packet
he tears it open sucks down the contents eagerly
kyle contd mm
star discards one packet sucks at another and immediately makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside
marcus picks up the packet looks at it
star and kyle pause in their eating stare at him
you can read
marcus shrugs modestly
so can i
off stars look well sort of
with obvious reluctance star holds a packet of mustard toward marcus
marcus gallantly waves it away
never heard anyone say that before
angle in mirror marcus stares at his own reflection in a cracked mirror
i look the same
star closes tattered curtains plops on the bare bed ready for sleep
the rooms a mess graffiti here and there trash scattered about theyre not the first squatters whove been here
the guns and stars watch lie on a dresser
kyle sits before the tv hes scratching stick figures onto the screen with a rusted pocketknife
one is clearly meant to be him the smaller one wearing a baseball cap is star
you ever watch television
was about all i ever had to look forward to in the joint
whats a joint
spent half my life there
i remember tv a little
it was great
kyle plops on the bed next to star whos already out
marcus studies them
she your sister
been together since we was little
bunch of us kids was at the day care center when the bombs fell
she and me are the only ones still around
disturbed gestures around so this is it
were gonna find the resistance fight for john connor against skynet
you oughta join us youre pretty cool
you dont know me
youre strong you can read
you didnt kill us
good enough for me
skynet runs the machines
so whos this john connor
i dont know
everybody talks about him
hes the one whos gonna save us
him and jesus
youre asking the wrong guy
closing his eyes so why were you in prison
a long beat i killed a cop
were cops like terminators
nah some of em were all right
my little brother max pretty wild kid not much older than you he stole a car just joy riding yknow showing off
marcus contd cop chased him right into our front yard pulled him outta the car
and started whaling on him kicking the shit out of him
no reason for it max was already in cuffs
i ran out of the house guy tried to pull his gun on me guess i just went off on him
dont even remember it really
they say i broke his neck
max must be dead too now
like everybody else
marcus notices now that kyle is asleep its as if hes lulled him with a bedtime story
marcus is oddly touched pulls a cover over both the kids
kyle starts half asleep you gonna be here when i wake up
stay away from the windows
so saying kyle falls back asleep
marcus sighs moves through the room quietly opens a drawer or two and finds afternoon light marcus sits on the floor by a room door shotgun leaned on the wall
at his side
he has the bible open in his lap head bowed over it
closer his eyes are closed hes asleep
the door opens behind him star peers out and looks relieved to see marcus is still with them
as she takes a step toward him he starts awake
marcus relaxes she sits down beside him
star contd whatcha reading
my grandma always tried to get me into it but it always put me to sleep
would you read something to me
marcus shrugs and nods flips to a random page squints at the text
of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
of the tribe of judah caleb the son jephunneh theres a book inside with pictures
shes already on her feet
close a phonebook minutes later
we hear marcus reading guaranteed lowest prices
open seven days
star sits at his side looking over his shoulder as he turns pages
she points to something whats that
its a flower
full of wonder so
all those numbers
you could call them and get like flowers or someone to come over and fix stuff or bring you food
nods touched guess people had it pretty good
what else we got
movers mufflers music music
you know pianos guitars
i dont remember music
approximating the tune i cant get no
off her blank look we are family
i got all my sisters with me
twinkle twinkle little star
stars face lights up she nods eagerly sings along how i wonder what you are
up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky
star is dizzy with emotion wipes an eye turning away
shakes her head somebody used to sing that to me
marcus puts the phonebook aside puts a hand on her arm and she leans into him for a hug tears forming in her eyes
star contd stay with us marcus
marcus looks down at her affected
aerostat pov a pixellated electronic image as it patrols the motel area in its geometric pattern
it zooms into the carport quickly scanning the abandoned vehicles among which is an aged open jeep wrangler its hood up parked beside a customized van
the cars are covered in dust the tires flat theyve been sitting here for a decade
objective angle the aerostat zips off on its rounds
after a moment the van door slides open
marcus moves quickly back to the jeep kyle and star behind him
star checks her watch while marcus goes back to work on the jeeps engine
hes found some tools already has removed and cleaned spark plugs dismantled the distributor
kyle meanwhile returns to inflating one of the tires with a if we get it to move will you teach me to make it go
its called driving
star wipes dirt off the side of the van revealing air brushed artwork beneath
what were these like
marcus looks up from his work to see a white unicorn in a field of flowers
not too many around in my time
the aerostat zips past the carport
as soon as its gone now
the jeep is suddenly pushed from the carport tires somewhat inflated
marcus is on one side of the rear kyle on the other star behind the wheel the seat moved all the way up
they get the vehicle to a slight slope it begins to roll on its own
pop the clutch
let your foot up
we see its been hot wired
star has her foot all the way down on the clutch now lets up the jeep bucks and sputters
as soon as it does music blares from the tape deck raucous heavy metal the aged cassette speeds and slows
marcus runs for the drivers side but the jeep is pulling ahead fast
star is staring at the speaker mesmerized at the sound of the music
when she looks out the windshield shes about to hit a wall squeals in terror marcus vaults in and pushes her aside squeezing behind the wheel hitting the brakes and
throwing the jeep into neutral
kyle hops in back as marcus adjusts the seat and floors it
the kids are exhilarated as marcus zooms out of there heading off road across the plains lights off music loud
marcus turns the music down
he looks up to see the aerostat right over their heads keeping pace with the vehicle red lights flashing
kyle rises in back swings at it with the shotgun butt the aerostat deftly dodges the blows
its gonna call a harvester were dead marcus slams on the brakes the aerostat stops a few feet ahead of them hovering in the air
marcus picks up an x shaped lug wrench from behind his seat rises taking aim and hurls the wrench with amazing speed and power it flies like a throwing star
and smashes the aerostat to bits in a shower of sparks and metal
the three of them stare breathlessly for a moment
marcus flexes his hand startled at his own strength
the jeep moves off road headlights off traveling by moonlight
it swerves and bucks from time to time
music plays from the tape deck something more melodic
angle in jeep kyle behind the wheel having the time of his life marcus supervising star enjoying the breeze and the unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle
youre doing fine
the song suddenly garbles turning to noise
marcus ejects the tape pulls it out its unspooled tangled in the stereos guts
the kids groan disappointedly
static from the radio now
but a faint voice audible beneath it
marcus contd ssh
marcus fiddles with the dial
he cant get the sound clear rolls through the dial
varying levels of static then a relatively clear voice proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel
a bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag and will detonate on impact
this recording has described booby traps and explosive devices
it will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid skynet jamming
star points toward the horizon
marcus looks up
stop the car
marcus contd other pedal other pedal
they screech to a halt
in the distance a red glow of flames far away
silhouetted against this strange flying vehicles and spindly spider like machines are just visible
do not give in to despair
as bleak as things seem i assure you humanity will triumph
high angle the jeep turns away from the conflagration moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness
radio voice contd the machines only win when we give up hope
this is john connor
high angle a crumbling service station with a rusting tanker on flat tires the cab long gone
move to find the jeep approaching off road
the jeep pulls to a stop marcus gets out from behind the wheel and moves to the tanker
star and kyle with his binocs scan the area for signs of skynet surveillance
we oughta find a place to hole up for the day
marcus pounds on the tanker a deep echo
kyle sniffs the air
you smell that
star sniffs the air herself eyes going wide
they both hop out of the jeep running toward the garage each carrying their unloaded guns
high angle from behind the rusting sign an aerostat appears aimed at the kids lights blinking
kyle and star slither under a partially open garage door
the space is dark smoke filled
strips of dried meat hang from the hydraulic lift
the two youths look amazed and delighted
kyle shoves the gun into his waistband moves to the closest strip and peels off a piece takes a tentative bite then gnaws ravenously
star leans the shotgun against the wall and follows suit
marcus lifts the garage door and enters dawn light streaming in behind him
what is this
mouth full who cares
marcus squints at something in the darkness
he takes a step forward then grabs stars arm
spit it out
now kyle reacts to what marcus saw gags and spits out meat
hes staring at a dried severed human hand resting on a grille in the sunken service pit where a charcoal fire smolders
star sees it too turns and retches just as three animal like cannibals emerge from the back of the garage two burly ugly unshaven men and a wild eyed unhealthy
looking woman with matted hair
well call them pig bull and cow
pig grabs the shotgun bull grabs kyle and yanks the handgun from his waistband
cow grabs star shoves her into the center of the garage beside kyle and bull
bull tosses the handgun to cow who keeps it trained on the kids sizing them up
not much meat on em
pig eyes marcus points the shotgun in his face
this ones fi i ine marcus raises two fingers like a peace sign then shoves them into the barrels of the shotgun
pig snorts and pulls oops
marcus yanks the gun away and tosses it aside head butts pig who staggers backward blood spraying from his nose
cow points the unloaded handgun at marcus click click
kyle and star get free of bull and dash for the exit theyre out of there in a flash
bull charges marcus who dodges him grabs the man and hurls him head first into the charcoal pit his body sizzles against the coals he screams and writhes
cow picks up an axe with two hands and swings it at marcus who grabs the handle with one hand and yanks it away
cow knows shes met her match turns and flees heading out the way kyle and star went
marcus advances on pig and bull brandishing the axe
pig squirms back across the floor wiping blood from his face
we didnt kill em
i swear to god they was dead already we wasnt gonna let em rot bull has scrambled out of the coal pit but is in too much pain to rise
go head take as much as you want were on the same side here
marcus looks ready to finish them off but reacts to cries from outside a loud mechanical rumble
a harvester a giant insect like terminator is outside the station
many times the size of a human being multiple arms and legs sprout from its thorax it has multiple camera eyes on long swiveling stalks it carries kyle and star
the kids struggle frantically caught in the harvesters jointed steel appendages
one unblinking eye scans kyle another star the harvester produces a needle from one of its arms injects the boy who instantly goes limp unconscious
it does the same to star
as cow emerges the harvester springs on her with startling speed
she screams as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air with the others injects her and begins moving toward a transport
this consists of container resembling a semi trailer or wheeled dumpster attached within a framework that features movable engine pods and a mysterious armature at the front
a steel lid in the top of the container opens hydraulically the harvester deposits the human captives inside and the lid slams shut
marcus has emerged from the garage still carrying the axe
he stays low hidden behind the tanker watching as pig and bull flee through a back entrance to the garage immediately attracting the attention of the harvester which sets off
marcus comes to a decision
he sprints into the open toward the transport and clambers up the side hitting the thing at full speed using an engine pod to boost himself higher
hes still short but swings the axe and hooks the axe head over the top of the container like a grappling hook
he pulls himself up and
crawls across the roof to the lid
theres a barred reinforced mesh panel here through which he can see about twenty human prisoners unconscious on the steel floor
among them are kyle and star
star moans opens her eyes briefly and sees marcus silhouette above her
her eyes flutter shut again
marcus struggles to raise the sealed lid but theres no purchase available just a smooth seam
suddenly the transport jerks
marcus nearly loses his footing as the transport starts rolling forward
he drops to his belly seeing that the transport is approaching the harvester which now carries pig and bull both unconscious
the lid opens and the harvester drops the two men inside but its camera eyes fail to register marcus who crouches behind the open lid
as the lid begins to close the harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the transport making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine
marcus thrusts the head of the axe under the closing lid in order to prevent it from sealing
the lid grinds against it but remains ajar
a moment later the engine pods rotate downward fire and the transport lifts off the ground
within moments the airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air
marcus moves to the edge looks down in astonishment at the fallow plains far below
looking to the side he sees a pair of hunter killers swooping in quickly to provide an escort for the slower moving transport
wind buffets marcus he hangs on for dear life
clinging to the top of the transport he slowly makes his way back toward the lid
as the transport banks he almost loses his grasp dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself
marcus reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his might
this thing is really heavy plus hes fighting the wind blast
marcus hears something behind him the harvester has spotted him and is now prying itself loose from the armature
also buffeted by the wind it starts to move gingerly down the length of the transport toward marcus
marcus must let the lid close
he snatches up the axe takes a couple of whacks at the thing denting the metal but doing no serious damage
the harvester knocks the weapon out of his hand marcus has no choice but to keep backing away
marcus is driven to the back of the transport
struggling for handholds he lowers himself out of sight down the framework along the side getting out of the wind
suddenly steel claws wrap around him from below yank him downward
the harvester has crawled around the side of the transport and under the bottom in order to grab him
the hideous machine now holds him in its clutches hundreds of feet in the air its camera eyes fixed on him
the harvester produces its needle its coming at his face but marcus frees one hand grabs the syringe managing to hold it back inches from his skin
his strength is weakening but as the harvester makes its final thrust he jerks the needle to one side and it bends against one of the harvesters own steel limbs
undaunted the creature crawls up the side of the transport marcus still in its clutches
it moves to the lid which opens
it lets go of marcus to drop him inside when marcus seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the harvesters back where he grabs a couple of eye
stalks trying to rip them from the harvesters thorax loose wires spark
the harvester twists and thrashes its like hes a rodeo rider
a limb wraps around him starting to crush him in a vise like grip when cannon fire rips through the towering harvester blowing its thorax to pieces barely missing marcus
a pair of a warthogs the same colorful ground attack aircraft we saw in the first battle roar past on either side of the transport
the crippled harvester topples off the side of the transport still clutching marcus and catches on an engine pod the creature and marcus both suspended in the air
the harvester roasts in the engine blast its cpu finally dies
marcus is suspended below the engine the steel limb releases him he has to cling to it now to keep from falling
the hunter killers peel out in pursuit of the two resistance planes
a dogfight ensues between the much larger more heavily armored h ks and the smaller more maneuverable warthogs
cannon fire catches an h k but has no effect
the h ks blue plasma pulses barely miss the planes which loop and bank
an air to air missile streaks from a warthog and blasts the engine of an h k
an explosion the thing starts flying erratically heading downward and crashing to earth in a glorious fireball
the planes are nearing a river bordered by sickly trees
on the far banks even from above we see ominous military fortifications concrete bunkers anti aircraft guns etc
marcus meanwhile is trying to climb up the dead harvester avoid the engine blast and find a handhold on the transport
the a that shot down the h k comes around for another pass at the transport but anti aircraft guns at the far side of the river let out a
volley of blue plasma fire
the bursts arc toward the a which swerves and climbs but plasma fire destroys a wing the a spins out of control
the other a breaks off its dogfight with its h k and speeds away from the river
marcus is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the transport he reaches out and the fried harvester suddenly dislodges from the engine pod taking marcus with it into freefall
with marcus plummeting downward toward earth a hundred feet below the transport continuing on its way above crossing the river
marcus pov the ground and treetops getting closer
at the last moment his continuing forward momentum takes him over the river and marcus and the dead harvester hit the water hard vanishing below the surface with enormous splashes
the surviving h k and the transport continue across the river into skynet territory vanishing in the distance
camera moves to find a parachute drifting earthward on the unfortified side of the river
hold on lapping water for a beat
then marcus breaks the surface staggering toward shore he drops to his knees in the shallows
wakes appear behind him
hearing the water stir marcus turns to see numerous dark shapes moving rapidly in on him from different directions flashes of metal visible beneath the surface
these are hydrobots aquatic terminators but we dont get a good look at them yet and marcus isnt sticking around
he scrambles for the riverbank and makes his way into the leafless trees
marcus moves past the trunks of bare trees pauses looks over the water in the direction the transport took
blair williams the helmeted pilot who ejected hangs from the tangled remains of her parachute caught in the trees about fifteen feet in the air above marcus
marcus moves closer
blair struggles to saw through her lines with a knife
blair contd who are you the lines suddenly snap blair falls from the tree
marcus reflexes are fast as ever hes beneath her in an instant and catches her
he holds her in his arms names marcus
you can put me down now marcus
he does so
blair pulls off her helmet her hair is short
shes in her s pretty petite but strong a no nonsense battle hardened member of the resistance
she pulls a compass from her flight suit consults it briefly as she orients herself
blair contd ive got an elt but i cant call for a rescue here
theres an outpost a few miles upriver not my favorite people in the world but its safe
blair is already moving marcus hesitates then points across the water
im heading that way
a short laugh the hot zone
no youre not
ive got to get to my friends what friends
couple of kids
they were in that flying dumpster the skynet transport
it was carrying people
off his nod christ we almost shot it down
thereve been rumors about a concentration camp but
she shakes her head gestures toward the river
blair contd you cant get across rivers fulla hydrobots hydrobots
they cant see but they have killer sonar
theyll attack anything that moves or makes a sound
even if you get past them youd be dead before you covered a hundred yards
if the terminators dont get you the fallout will heavy rads all the way to the gulf coast nothing can live there
marcus absorbs this starts walking with her
youre with the resistance
blair williams i fly for what used to be the air national guard
she puts a hand out listening
she signals for him to lay low behind a fallen tree
nearby a pair of t s on patrol rumble into view
they pause scanning the area chain guns at the ready
they start to move toward blair and marcus hiding place
blair quickly grabs a stone and staying down hurls it as far away as she can
the stone strikes a few branches the t s suddenly turn in that direction guns blazing the woods in the immediate vicinity are torn to pieces by the gunfire small
fires erupt from the incendiary bullets its definitely overkill
the t s roll over to inspect the damage out of view
blair whispers blair contd stupid bastards
she and marcus move away quickly away from the trees
when theyre a safe distance from the robots i dont know
this has gotta be some kind of like dream or hallucination
like what happens to people right before they die
blair slugs him hard in the arm
he doesnt flinch but he looks surprised
that snap you out of it
marcus shakes his head
they keep walking
blair contd well hell maybe you are dreaming
do us all a favor and wake up already
the moon over a scrubby forest trees just a few feet high
blair and marcus seem like giants as they move among them
theyve been talking a while blairs absorbing something
so let me get this straight marcus
there you are on death row they stick a needle in your arm
blair contd and the next thing you know youre here
off his nod since this aint the resurrection theres only one possibility
lets hear it
whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out
this angel project you signed up for there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell they musta froze your ass
what the hell for
drug tests medical experiments organ harvesting who knows
you said you had no family no friends why let a body like yours go to waste
shes looking him over as she says this it almost sounds flirtatious
marcus changes the subject
ive never seen trees like these
were in a mutation zone
i saw a two headed squirrel here once freaky
tasted like chicken
blair pauses checking a small geiger counter she carries it clicks a bit
blair contd levels are tolerable now but just
we cant spend the night here
they start moving again
marcus pauses listens what was that
i didnt hear anything now they both hear an eerie howl changing in pitch like a coyote on crack
more than one picks up the chorus
blair contd skindogs
she pulls a sidearm holds it at the ready as she starts running away from the direction of the noise
marcus keeps up at her side looking behind them
we dont get a good look at them but theres a pack of large beasts moving quickly through the undergrowth gaining on the fleeing humans
blair sees they wont outrun them
she spins fires in the direction of the approaching pack
suddenly its quiet the animals fan out forming a circle around blair and marcus
theyre surrounding us
quick shots of mutant eyes glowing in the dark enlarged teeth dark massive forms moving through the brush
and they dont scare easy
after a few tense beats from the foliage a skindog leaps at blair from behind its hideous the size of a great dane hairless with veiny wrinkled skin and long
before blair can react marcus leaps between her and the dog grabs the slavering creature by the throat
it snaps its elongated teeth at him but he manages to break its neck and hurl it toward two more skindogs moving in for an attack
blair fires a few shots at the encroaching pack we hear a few yelps marcus protects her effortlessly tosses a few more skindogs aside ignoring vicious bites and scratches
the other skindogs turn on dead and injured pack members begin tearing into them
theres an opening now the two humans make a run for it
blair catches her breath looking him over seriously impressed by his strength and calm
blair contd you saved my ass
marcus shrugs turns back to see the feeding frenzy
dog eat dog world
its darker now the moon is down
marcus and blair move gingerly she trips he catches her before she falls
blair sighs yawns sits against a tree
blair contd its not far but well never get across the mine field at night
might as well staf till morning
marcus nods sits a few feet away from her
blair contd cmere its cold
i dont bite
marcus slides toward her she nestles against him
whats that mean
its a resistance term
sit tight and fuck
soon theyre kissing passionately
but marcus pulls away rolls onto his back
blair contd you holding out for lipstick
or am i not your
im not gay
in prison i thought about puss women all the time
its not working
who knows all those years on ice
maybe its just gonna take some time
before youre completely thawed out
shes slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth
now she pulls out the scraps of paper with womens faces
she squints at these in the dark
blair contd what are these
sorta reminded me of her
marcus speaks carefully unsure how to articulate this
theres a woman the last woman i saw before
when i was under the dead time she kept coming to me
i think she mustve saved me
i cant compete with that
she closes her eyes settling against him her head against his chest
marcus stares up into the darkness
we just make out kyle and star among the other prisoners most of whom are awake now in the steel container
star still wears her baseball cap
the prisoners are jostled as the transport touches down
the transport has landed amongst numerous containers cranes and vehicles all is dimly lit enveloped in a vague reddish haze
the flying framework and armature detach from the transport and take off into the air again leaving the trailer like wheeled container
something resembling the cab of a semi truck backs into position latching onto attachment points on the container
a small panel slides open at the front of the transport and a half dozen processing aerostats buzz inside from the cab
these are larger than the spy drones with attached pincers that can encircle a persons arm
prisoners duck try to dodge these things
but they quickly buzz from captive to captive latching onto their arms we hear screams see flashes of light from the aerostats
kyle tries to bat away an aerostat but its pincers latch onto his forearm
a sizzling sound kyle cries out with the pain a flash of red light then the aerostat detaches and moves to its next victim
star gets the same treatment from a different aerostat
she moves to kyles side tears in her eyes sucking on her burned wrist to ease the pain
whats going to happen to us
i dont know
kyle looks grimly down at a fresh bar code seared into his arm
the cab and container now resembling a semi pulls out of the loading area
digitally controlled it needs no headlights as it rolls in the near darkness
overhead angle as the vehicle moves onto a cloverleaf access ramp leading to a high speed sunken highway a river of fast moving traffic heading in both directions unlit vehicles
moving close together at mph through the reddish gloom
close blair and marcuss feet trudge through low brush step over undergrowth
camera moves to find a strand of barbed wire emerging from the dirt a few feet away
marcus pauses almost having stepped on a watermelon
were in somebodys garden
blair stops walking alarmed a few feet away from him
theres supposed to be barbed wire along the edge
marcus looks around them points
a few yards away strings of barbed wire
camera moves to reveal its behind as well as ahead of them
theyve come through a gap where the wire had fallen
whatever you do dont move
can anybody hear me
to marcus were in the middle of the mine field
we hear babies crying from nearby fumbling in the dark muttered curses then a match lights a candle
barnes ish good looking and cocky yawns and sneers annoyed at being awakened
two women share his mattress
somebody feed those things
start up the generator barnes
morrison is bearded long haired bleary eyed a middle aged man in charge here
he sits up in bed also beside a couple of women
this place has become an underground crash pad communal living for about a dozen people morrison and barnes the only men four or five women and quite a few children
of varying age
barnes grunts yanks the blanket off his bedmates who cry out in protest
he wraps it around himself carries the candle as he steps around other sleeping figures makes his way toward a metal staircase winding downward
moments later we hear a gas engine start up lights flicker on
the place is pretty grimy and run down but it was once a military environment
theres a bank of tv monitors against one wall which come to life
a couple of the women move toward the adjacent nursery area to tend to the babies one of them lisa moves to the tv monitors
she squints at one
we got company
marcus and blair in the exact positions we last saw them looking exhausted
they cry out unheard
barnes pokes his head up from a concealed trapdoor thirty yards from blair and marcus who are hoarse from shouting
good to see you
off her glare whats the password
eat shit and die barnes
whos your friend
could you get us outta here please
kinda dumb ass wandering around in a mine field
you didnt maintain the perimeter
where are your sentries
its too early for that military crap
barnes consults a map turning it to orient himself
barnes contd ok if you keep walking straight youre gonna get blown all to hell
turn to your left and take oh
blair and marcus obey moving cautiously
barnes contd ok face me now
they do as told
barnes contd almost home
turn to your right and take another five steps
they slowly pace five steps
on the fifth one theres a click beneath marcus foot a horrified moment of eye contact between him and blair she dives to the ground away from him as boom
marcus is thrown through the air by the explosion marcus body lands a few feet from the trap door
frantic action the unconscious marcus is carried down a corridor from the open trap door by barnes morrison and a couple of women nancy and lisa
blair bleeding from shrapnel injuries assists
she yells at barnes you goddamn idiot
he was takin bigger steps
son of a bitch is heavy
marcus is deposited gingerly on a metal table in this crude medical area
numerous infants and toddlers about
jane a doctor moves toward marcus with scissors and other medical tools cuts away a tattered pants leg the shreds of his sneaker
she stops and stares palpates a blackened leg briefly
she looks up in alarm
he stepped on a claymore
this guy oughta be in a hundred pieces
she takes a scalpel pulls it across the charred heat deformed skin
it doesnt even leave an incision
what are you doing
does he have a prosthetic limb
i dont think so
jane opens marcus shrapnel torn shirt takes the scalpel and gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest
this is not skin
oh jesus oh god jane looks at morrison backing away from marcus
jane contd hes a terminator
memory montage quick shots altered impressionistic as before
sfx of static high pitched complex digital noise
a detached fleshless metal framework for a robotic hand is suspended by wires it flexes forming a fist
camera circles a muscular male torso without arms legs or head
metallic attachment points await these missing parts
the inside of marcus face a thin membrane of artificial skin with eye nose and mouth holes is lowered through an aqueous environment toward camera
through an eyehole we see serena face distorted by the liquid
she looks worried
we hear her muffled voice why isnt he conscious
somethings wrong he should be coming out of it by now
start tight on marcus as he opens his eyes a beam of bright sunlight in his face
camera pulls back and rotates to reveal that he is suspended upside down from a winch by a two inch thick steel cable
marcus thrashes trying to free himself then looks up and sees that the cables are strung through heavy steel bolts which have been drilled through his calves locking them together
his forearms have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion
from above the beam of sunlight shines through the narrow crack between an enormous pair of sliding steel panels
marcus twists his neck to look downward marcus pov a circular pit below the dark bottom invisible to him hes hanging near the top of an empty missile silo its
icbm launched years ago
at one edge of the silo pit near scaffolding and tool carts small children have gathered to stare
also there is barnes he leans back eyes closed in a folding chair with an rpg in his lap
one of the kids taps barnes leg and he jerks upright
he immediately trains his weapon on marcus clearly nervous now that the terminator is conscious
marcus stares at barnes deadpan for a beat
close on x rays of marcus torso and limbs clearly mechanical gears steel plating hydraulics etc
thermoplastic skin some larger hydraulics but mostly titanium microgears
this looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system function unclear at this point
valves and what looks like an access panel below the ribcage
wider jane holds up an x ray of his skull which shows almost nothing
jane contd eyes are polymer optics very lifelike
lead shielding all around the skull presumably to protect the cpu
mattresses have been piled to one side we now see framed cracked and yellowing posters of military equipment air force jets atlas rockets etc
these are interspersed with crude childrens drawings on the walls
blair sits at a battered dining table surrounded by angry outpost residents including jane and morrison
whatever he is hes on our side how can he be
he saved my life
winning your trust would aid his infiltration
at the communications area by the tvs lisa wears a headset speaking into a shortwave radio
she calls to the others regional doesnt know what to do
theyre gonna patch us through to command los angeles
nancy an overwrought older woman gets in blairs face pointing at the x rays
how could you bring this monster here
this is our home
our children what do you want from me i didnt know
a kid runs into the room
blair is first to reach the edge of the silo horrified at the sight of the dangling marcus
barnes keeps the rpg trained on him they shout over each other
get me the hell down from here
i told you to shut up
leave him alone
turning away from him marcus im so sorry
morrison and the others join them eyes fixed on marcus
it keeps talkin at me
god this thing gives me the creeps
why are you doing this
what is this place
were trying to over him dont say anything
its probably uplinked to skynet
morrison puts a hand on her arm
then its already too late
to marcus this used to be an icbm silo were just trying to stay alive here
your turn whered you come from
its in texas
or it was
it sounds completely human
it really could pass
didnt john connor say theyd start building things like this
not yet not for years
to marcus so youre programmed with false memories a human history what are you talking about
you can skip the act we know what you are
why are you even speaking to it
shes right lets just waste the damn thing itll kill us all if we give it a during the above other kids and adults in bg ad lib kill it
goddamn robot etc
increasing mob anger until im a man
his impassioned cry silences the onlookers
he speaks more quietly desperately marcus contd even if i never been treated like one
marcus contd year after year after year on death row i just wanted it to end
i cut my own wrists
but they nursed me back to health cause that wouldnt be fair they needed to kill me themselves
for chrissake you all want me dead so bad just do it
a scream do it
his cry echoes through the silo
the children cower behind the adults
blair is genuinely moved by his plight
barnes hefts the rpg looks toward morrison should i
morrison seems torn about to give the order lisa rushes in from the communications area breathless amazed by her own news regional got through to cla they want us to
rig a video feed
gesturing at marcus he wants to see him
they all seem astonished this has gone right to the top
marcus sits impatiently in a wooden chair facing a video camera and a microphone
barnes trains an rpg at his head while morrison finishes padlocking heavy chains to the bolts in marcus arms and legs these attach to a nearby steel post
blair stands nearby
lisa fumbles nervously with the transmitter plugging in wires
so this guy is what like king of the world or whats left of it
john connor founded the resistance
when the war began no one even knew who the enemy was connor taught us how to fight back
he saved humanity
yeah well humanitys never done all that much for me
why cant i see him
nobody sees him
skynet cant be allowed to discover his location even his appearance is kept secret
lisa makes a connection we hear connors voice the same one we heard on the car radio
hello standing by sir we can hear you sir working on a visual sir
marcus face pops to life on a video monitor
were in a spartan windowless space it feels like its underground
not what i expected
john connor leans into frame studies the screen
he wears a dark sweater nothing like a uniform
connor is ish now but looks older prematurely grey years of war have taken a toll
theres an ever present sadness in his eyes
marcus listens to the disembodied voice unimpressed
the others almost stand at attention
it does seem lifelike is the face able to mimic emotions
marcus rolls his eyes makes an angry face at the camera
this shit is ridiculous
what the hell do you want from me
i i need to know what you are
so do i
i dont know what i am what im doing here i dont know shit maybe i never did but im sick of it
just blow my head off or let me go
this isnt right
i cant be having a conversation with a terminator skynet isnt that sophisticated yet
were you sent here from the future
very confused what
skynets developing a time displacement field weve decrypted recent data transmissions
i know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades
to try and stop us from winning this war before it begins
marcus takes this in for a sober moment
youre out of your mind arent you
this earns outraged glares from the others but blair stifles a smile
barnes moves to strike him morrison stops him
ive seen enough
stand by for further instructions
the connection goes dead
densely marked maps on a conference table
connor is now flanked by a couple of senior advisors older military men along with kate brewster late s now his wife and visibly pregnant
shes poring over faxes of the x ray images
like connor all military personnel here favor casual dress at most pins or patches to indicate rank
hes not a cyborg no blood no human tissue over the endoskeleton
besides the first t s wont be manufactured until
maybe hes a one off an experiment
if there are more out there like him were in serious trouble
christ a terminator with attitude
where did they find him
east central texas near an area of heavy skynet concentration
the outpost where theyre holding him is reasonably secure but its not much more than a commune
i want him extracted
connor picks up the faxes disturbed by them
get him to our best people for disassembly find out what makes him tick
we need to get into that metal skull crack his cpu at all costs
the advisors nod pick up their papers and exit
as soon as theyre gone connor sits wearily in a chair tosses the x rays and papers onto the table his authoritative mask slipping
kate touches his arm
he leans his head against her pregnant belly
connor contd kate why did i become leader of the resistance
because people trust you
you give them faith no
because i knew i would be i was told
i know when and where the major battles are going to take place
i know im going to send my own father back through time to save my mother even though i havent met him yet
christ i even know the year im going to die
so how could i not know about this
he bangs his fist on the table atop the papers
marcus is marched down the corridor to the launch tube frankenstein like morrison holding the chains keeping a safe distance from him while barnes keeps the rpg trained at marcus
marcus shuffles awkwardly the bolts hampering his ankles
its reminiscent of his death walk at films opening
feels like i been here before
what are you gonna do to me
los angeles is sending a chopper seems youre some kind of vip
they reach the edge of the silo pit a long drop smooth walls a long metal ladder leading down into darkness
marcus pauses by the ladder holds up his bolted arms questioningly now what
at a look from morrison he and barnes body check marcus at once sending him flying over the edge marcus falls the thirty feet or so strikes the concrete floor
of the launch tube with a sickening thud the chains clattering down around him
marcus is stunned barely conscious as the ladder is pulled upward
its like the bottom of a well twenty feet in diameter sheer concrete walls the floor blackened from a rocket blast
angle up his captors look down at him for a moment then move out of view
camera moves past the prisoners a couple dozen total
an hispanic couple huddle against one wall whispering to each other in spanish
cow rocks in despair head in her hands bull and pig mutter to each other nearby
an older woman prays going through rosary beads
find star and kyle
shes watching as kyle uses his pocket knife to carve an image in the wall of the transport
he looks up
the back panel rolls upward
control robots reminiscent of the treaded t s but without the heavy weaponry flank a path from the rear of the transport towards bright light up a ramp a short
the prisoners instinctively move away from the robots moving to the front of the container
blue energy crackles across the floor
the prisoners cry out in pain at the electrified surface and dash toward the opening at the rear leaping out of the container
low angle as the prisoners run by we hold a moment on kyles graffiti its the stick figure images of kyle and star we saw before they both hold hands
with a larger stick figure who stands between them meant to be marcus
the container has stopped in a large subterranean space
there are numerous futuristic vehicles here hydrogen cars three wheeled atvs electric buses
control bots closest to the container start to close in on the huddling prisoners
a robot bumps into bull sending another jolt of electricity through his body like a cattle prod
everyone gets the picture starts hurrying down the line the robots closing around them
cow looks around nervously clearly freaking out
spotting a gap between the robots she bolts a robot swivels and cuts her down with an energy blast
she lies still smoke rising from her body
the other prisoners pick up the pace
hugging her whatever happens we stick together
the light emanates from frosted windows at the top of the ramp through which we make out the silhouettes of human figures
glass doors part ahead of the prisoners a stark white sterile environment beyond
the robots stop here
the prisoners disappear inside
and the doors close
barnes remains on guard duty with the rpg propped up on some cushions a lantern by his side its pretty late the generators shut down
hes reading an old yellowed comic book he has a small stack at his side
marcus voice echoes up from below startling him
want some motor oil
i need water
machines dont drink
please im shut up robot
barnes returns to his reading
he reacts to footsteps from the long corridor into the living area behind him
blair approaches with a flashlight her manner conciliatory
hows it going barnes
thought you might like a late night snack
she pulls a crumpled plastic package out of a pocket of her flight suit ancient hostess snack cakes
barnes eyes light up as he puts the rpg aside and grabs it
where in helld you get these
we got a stash back at the base
barnes tears open the package hungrily takes a bite
he grins but as he chews his expression darkens
you need something to wash it down
from another pocket she produces a plastic water bottle filled with a murky gray liquid
im on duty you know
so saying he takes the bottle unscrews the cap and takes a long pull
its powerful hootch he gasps for air passes her the bottle as she sits beside him
she doesnt drink
barnes contd twinkies and moonshine
you trying to seduce me again
you know i always liked you barnes
i just didnt want to join the harem
what can i say
its our duty to repopulate the planet
noble of you to make the sacrifice
he pulls her close to him for a kiss
after a moment she pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance
theres a large sliding steel door here
i prefer a little privacy
with some effort she pulls the door closed
barnes rises with a grin undoing his shirt coming close to her
hes already unsteady on his feet
youre so twentieth century
he puts his arms around her for a full body embrace barnes contd admit it im the best you ever had
his words are slurring
he slides to the floor slowly losing his grip
he rolls onto his back with a drugged out expression of bliss on his unconscious face
youre all talk
marcus leans against the wall in the dark rolls out of the way as the ladder drops
blair descends quickly the flashlight in her belt a battery blade saw in one hand
she sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side blair contd i used up the last of my valium for you
hold out your arms
he does she fires up the saw moves it carefully to the bolt joining his forearms
sparks fly from the buzzing blade as it digs into the metal its going to take some time
why are you doing this
i dont believe youre a terminator
so what am i
whatever you are i owe you one
once youre free ill lie down next to barnes theyll assume you escaped while we were passed out
you think theyll buy that
worth a shot
looking at him marcus command wants to take you apart cut open your head
one thing i know youre alive and youve got a right to live
the buzzing saw blade sound bridges to the whir of chopper blades
a spotlight shines over the low growth in the minefield as a blackhawk helicopter circles coming in for a landing
weapons racks are jury rigged beside the spotlight the chopper bristles with automated cannons missiles and napalm tanks
the spotlight picks out the concrete and steel cap of the the saw finishes cutting the bolt between marcus legs his arms are already free
the buzzing cuts out but now they hear the chopper landing directly overhead
theyre already here for you marcus slides the bolts out of his legs freeing himself from the chains
blair contd hide in the forest then aim west for open country im heading across the river
no human being can survive there
im not human remember
youre gonna try and save those kids
its the only thing i can think of that makes any sense
marcus for all you know theyre dead already for all i know theyre the reason im back from the dead
blair studies him a moment no changing his mind
but she admires him
she starts up the ladder marcus following
barnes is still passed out as blair and marcus ascend to the platform around the pit
they move to the sliding door blair starts to open it but sees a light and hears voices and footsteps at the far end slides it shut again
damn it were too late wheres that go
marcus points to a large ventilation fan behind steel grating eight feet above them on the far side of the pit
its not running but theres no way to get through it
should lead out but theres no way past the fan marcus is already picking up the rpg but he points it backwards has no idea how to shoot it blair
grins grabs the rpg from him then braces herself takes aim and fires kaboom
the explosion rips open the grate destroys the fan
morrison escorts a pair of powerful uniformed soldiers armed with high tech rifles with explosive shells they react to the explosion beyond the closed door and break into a run
the soldiers readying their weapons
marcus and blair have moved around the narrow walkway to the far end of the pit beneath the smoking hole
blair thinks of something pulls a small device from her flight suit the size of a pack of cigarettes holds it toward marcus
my elt emergency locator transmitter
if you find the camp activate it like this
it could really help the resistance
she indicates a button
marcus takes the device then grabs her kisses her hard on the mouth shes startled it felt very human
marcus grabs the sharp still smoking steel projecting from the hole and pulls himself upward as the door slides open and the soldiers open fire at marcus blair hits the
deck as explosive shells tear holes in the shrapnel hits marcus in the back hes thrown into the ventilation shaft marcus has a chunk of rebar lodged in his left shoulder but he doesnt even notice this yet
he picks himself up and moves quickly in the darkness crouching in this cramped tube
theres a turn up ahead he just makes it as an explosive shell rockets through the shaft behind him
the blast tears through the metal tube dirt pours in blocking the tunnel from his pursuers
near the edge of the clearing a low steel vent with a peaked cap
dents appear in it from within marcus finally punches his way out pulls himself up and rolls onto the dirt for a moment he seems safe laying low in the
then he registers the rebar in his shoulder
it goes right through him emerging from his chest
marcus is stunned
with some effort he yanks out the rebar and tosses it aside
torn metal of his steel endoskeleton is now exposed along with a glimpse of circuitry
marcus reels puts a hand over the hole in his chest where a heart should be he really isnt human
he doesnt have much time to deal with this as the chopper emerges from behind the treeline the spotlight picks him out and automatic fire erupts marcus runs a few
yards and throws himself to the ground as gunfire strafes around and ahead of him setting off several mines which send up clouds of dirt
marcus picks himself up and runs for the trees leaping over the barbed wire
more gunfire rips apart the trees around marcus as he sprints and weaves making his way toward the river
the spotlight picks him up and loses him again its tough for the chopper to get a clear shot at him here
marcus has reached the edge of the trees he can see the river just beyond
he starts to move for it when fwoom
the forest around him erupts into flame the chopper has laid napalm along the rivers edge
marcus reels from the intense heat bats out flames on his clothes but his skin remains undamaged
realizing he can keep on moving marcus dashes through the dense fire to the river where the sky is just starting to lighten
marcus splashes into the shallows extinguishing the flames
he fills his hands with water and sucks it down gratefully
angle on the water a glimmer of metal below the surface heading for the source of the splashing
suddenly the blackhawk chopper drops down directly in front of marcus hovering a few feet above the water the gunner pointing his weapon directly at marcus hes one of the
two soldiers we saw before
the blade wash swirls the water in a whirlpool and beats back the fire behind marcus
as the marcus dives below the surface bullets zinging through the murky water
underwater marcus is winged by a couple of shots his thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart with the gunner he pauses a moment squinting into the water for a glimpse of
marcus but failing to register that below the chopper right beneath him the water roils as if teeming with piranha
suddenly hydrobots erupt from the river with a hideous buzzing sound
hydrobots resemble segmented serpents eyeless but with razor sharp heads that drill into their victims they respond to sound and vibrations
about a dozen of these four foot long glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to attack the chopper
inside the chopper hydrobots pierce the aluminum floor and shoot into the cabin the pilot and the two soldiers cry out
the gunner tumbles out of the chopper and falls in the water
the pilot attempts to maintain control but the hydraulics are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin
the gunner surfaces trying frantically to swim to shore
but the hydrobots are upon him he shrieks and disappears beneath the bubbling surface which now boils with blood
in the chopper a whirring hydrobot penetrates the other soldiers leg
he screams and wrenches the thing back out tossing it from the chopper just before the pilot leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore where he collapses
but the remaining wounded soldier cant get out of the hip deep water before the hydrobots are upon him
suddenly hands burst from the water grabbing the soldier
a second later marcus surfaces slinging the man over his shoulder
he strides to shore as if rescuing the man from enemy fire hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist
marcus reaches the amazed pilot lays the wounded soldier down beside him then tears a whirring writhing hydrobot from the soldiers belly and whips its head against a rock it
sparks micro machine parts fly
the pilot and wounded soldier stare at him astonished
dont mention it
he tosses the dead robo snake aside then turns and moves back into the water quickly vanishing below the surface
underwater marcus moves steadily across the silty river bottom
he doesnt need air
hydrobots come at him he swats them away as if they were mosquitoes crushing in his hand those that linger too long
those which make contact with his artificial skin cant get far turn and swim off
marcus emerges the flames still visible on the other side of the river behind him
he doesnt look back as he moves into skynet turf
this side of the river isnt wooded everything has a concrete industrial feel
marcus is a mess both clothing and skin are shredded and charred
he nearly bumps into a skeletal steel terminator which emerges from behind a concrete wall
the terminator trains its plasma rifle on marcus scans him red eyes glowing
terminators pov red filter marcus form is targeted
read outs on the side the highlighted words non organic the terminator turns from marcus no longer interested moving off on its preprogrammed patrol
marcus moves up a sloping concrete embankment
at the top of the rise he sees spread out before him a hideous industrial sprawl open gas flames smoking factories rumbling vehicles h ks terminator troops on patrol
nothing green a grey haze hangs over the landscape
after a moment marcus shakes his head and gamely soldiers on moving along the edge of the elevated embankment
marcus moves past banks of anti aircraft guns and missile launchers interspersed with slowly rotating radar tracking dishes the first line of defense
from this fortress like wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond
marcus reacts to a cawing sound above looks up to see a crow perching on an overhead wire
a second later zap
a blue plasma pulse blasts the thing to smithereens a few black feathers drift down as a t same mask like face we saw earlier lowers its plasma weapon and
marcus stays out of the way of the terminator legions patrolling near the riverside
marcus heads inland past the ruins of a church walls with the remains of stained glass windows statues of saints
hearing rumbling noises marcus hurries out of the way as
a wall collapses pushed down by an automated skynet bulldozer
this gigantic self operated construction machine has a swivelling camera head instead of a cab
its giant treads roll over the stone statues crushing them to dust
marcus keeps moving into skynets turf
the demolition gives way to massive construction as the robots remake the human world in their own image
construction robots erect a low slung steel frame structure automated cranes and supply trucks about
these robots are oversized versions of the steel terminators we know but with multiple limbs bearing welding tools and treads instead of legs
marcus watches as beams are quickly welded into place by telescoping steel arms
marcus continues into the completed robot city
skynets architecture is featureless bland purely practical single story windowless concrete or steel structures with massive open doorways to accommodate their largest machines
a red glow emanates from the interiors the robots preferred lighting scheme
no sidewalks or signs just thick grids of power lines and pipes overhead
constant noise of buzzing power rattling machines etc
marcus steps inside one of these buildings this terminator assembly plant is an intricate multi leveled clockwork maze of moving conveyors and industrial robotics
electronics and hydraulics are robotically soldered in place
steel presses stamp out terminator parts torsos face partially completed parts are moved by conveyor to assembly stations where limbs and heads are joined to torsos elaborate operations carried out
by industrial robots like the ones in present day factories
synthetic skin is sprayed over a metal endoskeleton in precise amounts building up to create human features
this is a t
an industrial robot arm picks up a cpu from a dry ice container
the cpu features the distinctive linked rectangles familiar from the earlier films
the arm lifts this gingerly to a terminator skeleton and inserts it into the steel skull screwing a seal over the hole
the red eyes flicker to life and the armature releases the terminator which moves away under its own power
it removes a plasma weapon from a wall rack moving past the dumbfounded marcus
the terminator joins a dozen identical robots who ride on a treaded skynet tank with a plasma cannon and flamethrower
there are numerous tanks here awaiting deployment
rounding a corner on a straight narrow street marcus sees all the robots and small vehicles clearing into small niches built into the walls on either side as if clearing
a path for him
it takes him a moment to realize its not him theyre responding to a rumble builds
a convoy of gigantic skynet trucks a half dozen modified semis now driven by cpus bear down on marcus at extremely high speed
they carry construction supplies massive steel beams concrete pipes etc
and theres barely inches of clearance on either side
these things arent slowing down
theres nowhere for marcus to duck out of the way
he has no choice but to run as fast as he can the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly
marcus throws himself to the concrete in the middle of the street pressing his body flat as the lead truck passes over him the wheels missing him by inches
but he has only a moments respite
the next truck has a lower undercarriage a steel crossmember catches his back and drags marcus beneath the vehicle ripping off chunks of flesh
marcus cries out crawls ahead and clings to a forward portion of the undercarriage keeping himself just above the pavement
his left leg twisted and damaged still drags on the asphalt throwing up sparks
overhead angle on the truck camera pulls back straight above the moving vehicle amidst the convoy speeding down this sunken artery
camera keeps moving upward to reveal an aerial view of skynets city
seen from above the rectilinear structures criss crossing power lines and speeding vehicles strongly resemble a pulsing circuit board
john connor moves grimly down a narrow steel passageway footsteps echoing
he reaches the mp outside the door
i need to talk to the prisoner
the mp looks a little surprised but says nothing
he undoes the latch on the door and opens it for connor
a bare windowless space with only a cot a metal chair and a bedpan
blair looks up bleary eyed exhausted and scared
connor gestures for the mp to close the door behind him
im sorry about the way youve been treated but were forced to take every precaution
im john connor
blairs mighty impressed in spite of the circumstances
she leaps to her feet stands at attention and salutes
connor pulls up the chair close to blair who sits on the bed
his tone is careful controlled
connor contd ive gone over your record lieutenant
youre a good soldier flown a lot of missions
why in gods name would you help a terminator escape
sir he isnt a terminator
we know hes crossed into skynet territory why would he do that if he isnt hes trying to find his friends
a couple of kids
they were taken in a skynet transport probably to some kind of prison camp he said their names were star and kyle
connor blinks at this alert
blair picks up on his interest but doesnt understand it
with an r
how did you
connor is already on his feet banging on the door the mp unlatches it to let him out partway down the hallway connor encounters kate who walks with him takes
in his expression
what is it john
i always knew id have to find him someday
i just didnt know how
start close on kyles hand clutching stars tightly
we hear them singing faintly together twinkle twinkle little star
wider their heads feet and chests are clamped onto sliding trays a long row of these hold other prisoners as well
kyle and star must reach across a gap between the trays to hold hands
its the first time weve seen her hatless
the trays are all poised before panel covered semi circular openings built into the wall in a sterile hospital like environment
above each opening is a monitor screen
an ominous hum is building
in an adjacent operating theater visible through glass walls medical lasers mounted on robotic arms work on anesthetized patients we neednt see the grisly details
behind star and kyle the panels open the trays slowly slide into the openings
screams and sobs from other prisoners
oh no oh no
shh keep singing
kyle and star hold hands for as long as possible then release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the panels slide shut
immobilized in this small tubular chamber like an mri star closes her eyes as shes bathed in bright light laser grids projecting over her skull
the humming is louder
up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky
the same thing is happening to kyle
hes no longer singing
stop it stop it stop it
with marcus beneath the truck
hes moved to the edge of the chassis near a wheel moving slowly carefully
theres a bit more clearance at the sides of the sunken highway now but theyre still moving awfully fast
the wheel turns the vehicle suddenly slows to negotiate a turn braking downhill
marcus seizes this opportunity
another angle as marcus launches himself from below the vehicle rolling into the gap between the convoy and the concrete wall
the remaining vehicles rumble past as marcus presses himself against the wall
when theyre gone he gets to his feet limping down the highway on foot for a short distance dragging his damaged leg behind him
he hears another convoy approaching
just in time he finds a seam in the poured concrete its enough to give him purchase he struggles to climb up the eight feet of freeway wall
marcus makes it over the top trucks rumbling past below
this is desolate hilly country
angle down among the vehicles below is a container like the one that held kyle and star
we glimpse the anguished faces and reaching hands of captives within
marcus reacts moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks for a short distance until the vehicles shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight
in the distance is a complex of buildings clearly the destination
marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway heading for the complex
he reaches the edge of a plateau looks down his expression changing
this is the last thing he expected to see
camera moves to reveal a panoramic view of a gorgeous coastal community
the place is lush green with well maintained lovely homes in the distance a blue sea beyond
the complex of buildings stands a few miles away at the far end of the valley
marcus amazed limps down a gentle slope leading to this seeming paradise
marcus emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself looking at a groomed fairway
marcus hears a noise nearby a golf ball bouncing on the ground not far away
marcus turns in the direction it came from
an electric golf cart approaches driven by a handsome middle aged golfer jeremy who wears casual country club attire eating from a clear bag of trail mix
jeremy comes to a stop beside marcus
are you all right
marcus slowly shakes his head as jeremy climbs out of the cart looking him over carefully taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg
what the hell is this
you look like youve been hit by a truck among other things
look im trying to find some friends a couple of kids
they were taken here i saw some buildings jeremy eyes him a little surprised at his ignorance
the facility sure
hop in ill take you there
marcus hesitates a beat can he trust this guy
but jeremy simply seems eager to help as he guides him to the passenger seat then gets behind the wheel
with a smile jeremy contd this round was gonna blow my handicap anyway
he extends a hand
after a beat marcus reaches toward it marcus
jeremy clutches marcus hand tightly
marcus blinks jeremy cocks his head then lets go
i cant connect with you at all
your interface mustve been damaged
dont worry soon theyll have you as good as new
with that he hits the gas
jeremy drives the cart down the road past well kept homes with generous lawns its a beautiful upscale community at magic hour
bicyclists and futuristic cars pass jeremy waves to neighbors
marcus takes it all in with disbelief
i didnt think there was anything like this left
were very lucky
he holds the plastic bag out to marcus who obligingly takes a handful of trail mix pops it in his mouth
after a beat he spits it back out in his hand stares at it
this isnt food
well of course not
seems you got a little memory loss going on
marcus stares at him confused
jeremy is starting to realize just how out of it he is speaks as if to a child
jeremy contd its a foam resin
it can taste like anything you want it to but of course we dont really need to eat
our brains are powered by fuel cells remember
marcus just stares jeremy gestures at the world around them
jeremy contd were in a transitional phase
most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer food shelter sex
until we forget the old life
as he speaks he notices his bag is nearly empty
he casually lifts his sport shirt and clicks open a panel beneath his rib cage
we glimpse circuits fiber optics
jeremy contd eating well chewing its one of the hardest habits to break
but before long none of this will be necessary
we wont even need these bodies
from within he removes an identical bag filled with trail mix the stuff he just ate and replaces it with the empty bag
he clicks the panel shut again pops a nut in his mouth
marcus stares at this appalled then blinks and looks away
he reacts to the sound of piano music a difficult piece being played expertly passing a picture window he sees a pianist practicing
in front of this home a gardener and window washer are hard at work
theyre both t s with the eerie mask like faces
jeremy winces as if at a racial epithet
hes starting to regret giving marcus a lift his manner is careful as if hed picked up some homeless guy
we dont call them that here
marcus grabs jeremy who pulls back a bit alarmed
what are you
the same as you
a hybrid human and machine
thats what this community is for people like us
you should be grateful to have been chosen
what about the ones who werent
you mean like janet and the kids
for a moment jeremys expression darkens
then he shuts his eyes and his features relax
you lost them
jeremy nods and smiles looking at him once more
marcus contd why are you smiling
cause i feel good
the interface recognizes negative emotions rage grief despair and stimulates positive endorphins in response
thank god life would be pretty unbearable otherwise dont you think
theyve left the main street now driving down a wooded path leading to the facility
there are lawns fountains etc
marcus slams on the brakes then clutches jeremy by the throat the man looks more annoyed than frightened
tell me everything
how did you people get here
most of us worked at nasa or darpa
i was an engineer on project angel marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat squeezing harder
angel what is it
advanced nexus of genetic and electronic life forms
a n g e l
you can stop choking me its not like i need to breathe
marcus releases him but remains in his face
jeremy takes a moment to recover his composure
jeremy contd we replaced the bodys hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals controlling the micro tech chassis english
sighs slowly the goal was a superior support system for the human brain to go anywhere do anything explore deep space the bottom of the sea
i specialized in optics
he taps his own eye with an audible click not flinching
marcus takes a couple steps away looking at his own hands
jeremy points to nearby buildings a little peevish
jeremy contd the facility is just ahead
ill let them know youre coming
so saying hes back in the cart pulling away in a hurry
a moment later marcus moves off amongst the trees
nearing the complex marcus reacts to birdsong above
he looks up stops as he sees a tiny speaker concealed amongst the leaves
marcus moves to this tree touches it the bark feels unnatural
he raps it with his fist it sounds hollow made of fiberglas
he fingers a leaf tries to bend it plastic
he crouches studying the grass
after a moment he finds a seam in the pristine lawn
he starts to peel it up
beneath it is sandy dirt
marcus keeps peeling the plastic covering back
more dirt and bits of bone
as he continues to uncover the ground we see recognizable chunks of skulls legbones etc
by now hes rolled back a few square yards numb with horror
marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination trying to stay out of sight
on the monitors above the long row of chambers colorful d images of the prisoners brains are being constructed like pet scans
dense digital read outs below as data is analyzed
levels of seratonin endorphins etc
beside these are barcodes and small inset photos taken within the chamber the subjects looking frightened
in the operating theater the lasers are still now their grisly work done for the moment awaiting the next batch
an engineer a nice looking well built young man in loose black clothing moves down the row of chambers studying results
he speaks into a subtle head set
no insufficient neural capacity
eh this one shouldnt have even been brought here
as he speaks the barcodes on the monitors in question turn either red or green in response to his judgments
he reaches kyles chamber we see kyles anguished face on the monitor photograph
engineer contd looks good
kyle gets a green barcode the engineer is on to star he strokes his chin
may not be emotionally compatible
on stars monitor red barcode
the engineer kicks something on the floor bends down to pick it up stars baseball cap
he flings it expertly into a nearby trash receptacle
a series of low rise buildings attractively lit surrounded by lawn trees and water features
a human transport heads down a ramp into a parking structure a gate closes
find marcus watching this from behind some plastic foliage
he sets his jaw removes something from his pocket fiddles with it and places it carefully in the bushes
he moves on
nearing an entrance he hears a familiar voice from nearby
a backlit figure approaches as her face enters the light we see that its serena looking healthy beautiful
marcus stares at her coldly
serena contd marcus
it is you
youre alive you found us
welcome to paradise
its a graveyard
serena takes in his anger adopts a regretful tone
there was no choice the old civilization had to be eliminated
to make way for a new world
a world without death or suffering
serena puts her arms around him
he doesnt return the embrace but he doesnt resist her
serena contd you were the first
so saying she presses a small taser like device at the base of his skull zap
marcus spasms and goes limp in her arms
serena lets him down gently on the ground
serena contd we should never have left you behind
a pair of t s now approach from the shadows
they pick up marcus and carry him toward the building
camera moves to find hidden in the bushes where marcus placed it the elt the emergency beacon blaire gave him
activated now a single green light pulses
darkness then a knock and a door flies open
john connor sits up in bed
kate blinks beside him
sir im sorry to disturb you but you said you wanted to know immediately what is it
we found our terminator
connor and kate hastily dressed cross through the command center weve seen before and step through a hatchway into a massive control area for a huge submarine
sonar and radar stations a crew of naval personnel most do not wear uniforms
this sub is where connor has been the whole time
the aide leads connor to a gps tracking terminal where naval and air force officers hover
the signals coming from near what used to be galveston right on the coast
there cant be any prisoners there
the whole areas a nuclear wasteland only machines can survive the radiation levels for any length of time
mobilize a combined air and naval assault all available resources
were sending in a rescue team asap
the officers raise ad lib objections but sir
connor raises a hand to silence them and moves a few steps away beside kate
they speak in hushed tones all to find one teenage boy
john you really think this can work
im standing here i exist so it must have worked
we will find him
he turns back to the others holding their gaze
connor contd call it an act of faith
we see now that connors on board a nuclear attack sub with two more subs moving in tandem behind it
hold on the lead sub and move in on the stencilled name as it start on marcus damaged leg
it has been detached from his body halfway down the thigh
elaborate circuits are exposed as surgical machines perform repairs with lasers mechanical arms replacing damaged parts
nearby marcus opens his eyes coming to
hes clamped onto an elaborate mobile surgical table the stump exposed
his body and head are secured within its framework
more machines swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder
marcus twitches freaking out struggling in his bonds the detached leg twitches as well
calm down marcus
its all right
serena is on the other side of a glass panel operating computer controls
this is an automated surgical environment the work on marcus carried out by various machines and microtools busy hydraulic arms lasers etc
like fuck it is
im sick of being your guinea pig what are you doing to me now
you all work for skynet
skynet works for us
its only a program a tool a means to an end
the end of the world
its sole purpose is to protect humanity
marcus lets out a horrified bitter laugh
serena contd listen to me
skynet was designed to detect threats make projections and implement solutions
as soon as it came on line it factored in war disease environmental destruction and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years
the human race was doomed
unless we were transformed
the surgical table swivels bringing marcus into alignment with the repaired leg
in moments its reattached the plastic skin thermosealed at the joint
a brain in a box
skynet had access to the entire defense web including project angel
it determined hybrids were the only path to salvation
destroying the human race in order to save it
the laser tools and hydraulic arms now move on their ceiling racks coming close to marcus face
the table inverts exposing the back of his head
marcus contd what are you doing
when the resistance attacked our installation we were forced to self destruct
we would have taken you with us but we thought you were in a permanent coma
the lasers start cutting into the back of marcus head burning through the plastic skin
marcus lets out a cry of rage strains at his bonds
serena contd your interface was never installed
close as the hydraulic arm attaches to the back of marcus head and removes a section of steel skull
revealing the surface of a human brain gray matter enmeshed in wires and circuitry beneath a clear plastic casing in a bath of pale reddish liquid
tiny neural sparks fire
i dont want it
youre dead inside all of you
no sane person would choose to live in pain forever
soon youll understand
close as an elaborate electronic interface module is fixed at the base of marcus exposed brain
on marcus face his expression of agony vanishes his features become peaceful
marcus is dressed in fresh clothes his damage repaired and he seems more at ease than weve yet seen him
he walks beside serena who wears a small earpiece a high tech cellphone device
they smile as they pass other hybrids on the late shift
how are you feeling marcus
im not sure i know how to describe it
its called happiness
youve been angry all your life
you dont know what its like to feel
a part of something
she clasps his hand in both of hers
marcus closes his eyes a jolt of pleasure shooting through him
flying pov through banks of clouds rich colors in the sky glinting golden light rocket downward to a pristine coastline some place like hawaii plunge into the water rise and
come face to face with serena smiling
moving in for a kiss
camera irises open to white
serena releases marcus hands
he opens his eyes slowly reeling from the intense moment
camera reveals a subtle bulge at the base of his skull the implanted interface
we can share in it together
when i was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven
it always sounded so boring
were you bored just now
marcus shakes his head far from it
serena contd that sensation is always there for you whenever you desire
but most of us here are scientists
our greatest joy is using our minds to explore to discover
ill show you
she leads him up steps into one of the buildings
camera tracks past glass windows we glimpse artificial skin growing on a steel terminator skeleton
a prototype t perhaps with a strong resemblance to arnold
elsewhere engineers observe a shimmering column of liquid metal twisting and assuming different shapes within a sealed with marcus and serena moving past these observation areas
nanotechnology polymimetic metals
working with skynet were making amazing breakthroughs well beyond anything possible before judgment day
start on a glowing time sphere just a vague translucent blue ball right now dwarfed by the machinery which sustains it
the sphere is set into a dome shaped depression in the floor
theres a distinctive loud hum
a physicist here at a terminal
he nods toward serena and marcus as they enter
weve already freed ourselves from biological limits
soon well transcend the laws of physics
serena gestures at a large digital display of a hour clock the date
seconds flashing past
serena contd right now we can only go back a few days at most
a time machine
connor was right
sudden interest the resistance leader
you know him
ive just heard him speak
hes a dangerous man
he thinks hes a savior but all hes really fighting for is
they move to an exit marcus looking back over his shoulder at the glowing blue sphere
marcus and serena cross the attractive campus
in the world outside the survivors think skynet is the enemy out to destroy them
why dont you tell them about all this
not everyone can become like us marcus
we just dont have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids
some people i knew were picked up taken here
camera moves over tubes and fiber optic cables which run into multiple glass cylinders filled with translucent pink liquid
these contain human brains
there are hundreds of them hooked up in here
a boy and a girl in the last day or two
what is this place
part of the neural net human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence
the processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything skynet can manufacture
serena has moved to a computer terminal one of a few here
serena contd display recent arrivals for processing
images begin to appear on the screen small inset photos each with a barcode
they quickly fill the screen
marcus leans forward squinting
on screen dozens of faces photos taken inside the tubes mostly looking terrified
marcus shakes his head
serena contd next page
on screen a new set of faces appears one by one on the screen
this time star and kyle are among them next to each other
marcus touches the screen two fingers one on each of the kids faces
their images expand to fill the screen side by side kyle on the left
kyles image the date
the word in green processed
hell soon be part of the network youll be able to connect with him
move to stars image
and the word in red terminated
serena contd im sorry about the girl marcus
she didnt suffer
marcus takes this in his face shows pain
then serena grasps his hand in moments hes smiling
suddenly the building shakes the sound of a distant explosion
serena releases marcus listens in her earpiece
marcus contd what is it
i dont know i have to go
will you be all right
off his smile and nod of course you will
she touches him once more and moves off leaving him alone here
well hear other far off explosions from time to time during the following
marcus stares at his friends faces which slowly fade to black replaced by his own reflection
seeing his own face his smile vanishes
marcus is going through a terrible internal struggle the interface fighting his own natural emotions
he backs away from the machine looks around at the brains all the lives destroyed
hurrying past the wall of brains he moves a hand to the base of his skull
with an angry cry
his fingers dig into the plastic skin at the back of his marcus grits his teeth this is incredibly hard to do but he rips the interface module from his
skull connections spark we glimpse steel skull and the encased brain beneath
marcus hurls the device to the floor its elaborate circuitry shatters
he reels with momentary anguish at what hes just given up then he moves out of there with determination
fire and smoke in the distance vehicles moving fast amidst the destruction
it looks like the place is under attack
marcus moves purposefully across the campus suddenly headlights illuminate him
he dives out of the way as a futuristic atv roars past at high speed
its followed moments later by a massive skynet tank
marcus scrambles to his feet continues on his way
the physicist is slammed against a wall
he never loses his unperturbed expression as marcus manhandles him
the clock reads
i need to go back
the wormholing fluctuates right now its oscillating between three and six hours what do i do
just breach the sphere
but you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius
marcus tosses the man aside regards the glowing crackling time sphere it doesnt look too inviting
the door bursts open
skeletal terminators storm in wielding plasma rifles they mean business the physicist finally looks alarmed getting in front of marcus as he yells physicist contd no dont shoot in here
a terminator fires anyway blowing a huge hole through the center of the physicists chest and throwing him backward to the floor the man looks down and shakes his head
at the damage to his plastinated body
physicist contd idiots
a second terminator spins his weapon on marcus who leaps into the center of the sphere just as the robot fires and hits nearby machinery which explodes energy erupts around
marcus the crackling blue light of the time sphere surrounds him
we experience this from inside the sphere
marcus instinctively crouches in a fetal position
an instant later his clothing burns off his flesh
the high tech environment around him transforms into stay with marcus foliage appears around the sphere
the blue energy fades leaving him naked feet in the air marcus plunges to the ground and rolls
he looks up the plastic tree has been melted with the heat like a candle dripping down around him
marcus tries to get his bearings hes in the park area the facility not too far off
he moves in that direction
the gate to the garage opens an empty human transport emerges
find marcus concealed still unclothed
he dives under the gate as it rolls shut
marcus moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners were off loaded keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles
he starts at the sight of the control robots hooked to charging posts along one wall
marcus makes his way to the glass doors
using all his strength he manages to pry them open
the engineer as we saw him before consulting the monitors above the chambers
may not be emotionally compatible
the engineer picks up stars baseball cap and flings it into the trash
just then he hears shattering glass behind him
he spins marcus trains a ripped off robotic laser arm at him like a weapon
the arm trails heavy cables and circuits linking it to the operating theater we saw earlier
these also artfully conceal marcus nakedness
let them go
who are you
marcus takes a step closer
i said let them go
the engineer moves to a red alarm button on a communication panel mounted in the wall extending a hand marcus connects two wires to fire up the laser and a
red beam neatly severs the engineers hand at his wrist
the engineer studies the metal stump of his severed hand with a blank expression
you cant hurt me
the engineer smirks and whacks the alarm button with his other hand
an electronic klaxon sounds
now youre pissing me off
marcus fires off the laser again the engineer stares at him we see a flaming strip in the wall behind his head
he takes a step toward marcus and his head tumbles off bounces on the ground and rolls to marcus feet
theres no blood just laser severed electronic connections
marcus picks up the engineers head by the hair
the mans brain is unharmed
marcus contd howd that feel
the mans mouth twists and grimaces making electronic static from the fried voicebox
marcus is taken by surprise when the decapitated body lunges at him knocks the laser from his grasp
after a brief struggle marcus spins the engineers head to face his body
he grabs the interface at the base of his neck
marcus contd i pull this off and youll be in a world of pain
the engineers face suddenly shows fear his body freezes
marcus contd last chance
let them out
at a control terminal the one handed headless body taps keys and controls
marcus holds the engineers head so that he can see over his own shoulder
moments later the machine hum winds down
the monitors flash the word abort the panels begin to open
marcus addresses the head in his hand
marcus contd im gonna need your clothes
the headless body begins to unbutton its shirt
moments later close as kyles tray slides out of his chamber
the restraints retract automatically
he sits up looking toward star on the next tray
she hasnt moved her eyes closed
he climbs off his tray takes her in his arms
she starts awake
around them the dozen other prisoners are getting to their feet surprised at their sudden freedom
marcus approaches kyle buttoning his new shirt
the two kids hurry to him marcus hands star her baseball cap rescued from the trash
as she puts it on i knew youd come
the prisoners are already on the move frantically dashing out of the lab ahead of our heros
weve gotta get out of here
he leads the kids out the way he came passing
the engineer in underwear sitting in a corner cradling his head in his lap
his remaining hand strokes his interface his eyes closed in a blissful expression
the prisoners smash the glass doors off their hinges and charge past the control robots which are now coming to life
electric bursts drop a couple of slow moving escapees as they dash into the garage and make for any available vehicle
former prisoners hijack buses hydrogen cars
pure chaos it feels like a prison riot
marcus star and kyle weave amidst the robots and humans
kyle and star take cover behind a concrete post just as plasma bursts explode around them
skeletal terminators armed with plasma rifles are pouring in through the opening garage gate
a stolen bus heads for the exit knocking a couple of terminators aside and smashing through the rising gate clearing a path for others to follow
a skeletal terminator sets its sights on a moving hydrogen car which follows the bus terminator pov red filter highlighting bull the driver
the terminator shoots his rifle through the cars windshield it explodes close to kyle and star the building shakes
kyle and star flee the flames the terminators head swivels quickly taking them in
it starts to pursue but marcus gets in front of it
before it can fire marcus contd its ok im not human
the terminator pauses looks him over
terminator pov marcus is quickly scanned comes up non the terminator starts to move past marcus who leaps on it and wrenches the rifle from its grasp
as the robot spins on him he blows its head off then looks around frantically for the kids
a moment later kyle roars up at the controls of a futuristic atv star clinging to him
marcus contd you cant drive
no time to argue marcus leaps into the back beside star and kyle guns it out of there careening off walls and other vehicles hes still not much of a
marcus meanwhile picks off potential threats with the plasma rifle
kyle has to swerve to avoid the stolen bus which is now on its side in flames
it was taken out by an automated skynet tank one of three tanks here
theyre positioned to take out escaping vehicles
but the atv is a small maneuverable target swerving and speeding crazily
a tank fires and misses the blast taking out a chunk of wall
kyle whoops heading across the campus one tank pursues it moves surprisingly fast capable of flattening anything in its path
marcus fires at it but the plasma rifle blasts dont have much effect on the armor
the tank fires again but
kyle roars around a corner just in time
however in so doing he nearly runs over marcus from earlier on his way to the time sphere visible in the headlights for only an instant before he leaps kyle
focused on the pursuing tank didnt even see this
but star did
she looks wide eyed at marcus beside her
that looked like i know
play the chase as the tank pursues the atv through the facility
kyle takes his vehicle through a large fountain which the tank smashes to bits
kyle oversteers putting them up on two wheels then recovers narrowly avoiding plasma blasts which obliterate the facade of a building
skeletal terminators appear in their headlights weapons raised
marcus stands and fires over kyles head blowing them out of the way
near the park marcus points
marcus contd take that path
the tank is gaining on them kyle steers around a gazebo the tank smashes right through it turning it to splinters
kyle steers toward the woods dodging between the thick trees
too many obstacles for the tank here it screeches to a halt and lets off a jet of flame
the trees behind the atv all ignite turning to acrid pools of melting plastic
kyle barely stays ahead of the fire
the tank backs up and takes a new route around the woods
in the woods kyle strikes a glancing blow against a tree trunk and the atv topples on its side spilling its passengers
after a beat they rise shaken
marcus contd you two all right
why dont you drive
come on i was doing good
marcus rights the vehicle taking the wheel the kids climb in back
the atv comes rocketing down the main street marcus driving now
suddenly directly in front of them the tank appears moving swiftly around a corner gun turret swiveling at them
as it fires marcus swerves onto a lawn and crashes through a picture window
a handsome hybrid couple in pajamas in front of a big screen tv
they turn and react as the atv skitters through the room and down a hallway
the atv is followed a moment later by the tank which takes out the entire wall barrelling through the living room and burying the hybrids in rubble
marcus takes the atv up a flight of stairs
the tank keeps smashing through the house as its turret swivels upward and blasts away
upstairs the plasma blast comes through the floor just missing the atv as it rockets through a master bedroom toward a balcony
downstairs the tank tears through an upscale recreation room splintering a pool table smashing through pinball upstairs marcus takes the atv straight out onto the balcony through the railing and
into the air
downstairs the tank blasts through a kitchen and bathroom on its way out the other side of the house
the atv just clears an enormous swimming pool landing hard on the far deck and moving on fast
the tank smashes through the back wall and takes a nosedive into the pool out of commission
the rubble in the living room shifts and the hybrid couple extract themselves taking in their destroyed home with placid expressions
a moments breather
marcus slows the vehicle which wobbles and smokes from all its been through
he looks around
where are we going
he points toward the coast we see a marina in the distance a boat moored at a dock
marcus steers the atv down a slope toward the shoreline
marcus kyle and star leap off the atv and sprint for a motorboat
kyle carries the rifle now
as they near the boat marcus reacts to the sight of red eyes flickering in the darkness at the end of the dock the blue glow of a rifle charging
marcus leaps in front of kyle and star shielding them with his body
the plasma blast envelops him marcus is blown into the water
kyle and star are flattened by the force of the blast lie motionless on the dock
their plasma rifle lies a few feet away
the skeletal terminator who shot marcus moves swiftly down the dock its plasma rifle trained on the water now
it moves past kyle and star who remain motionless on the ground and goes to the edge of the dock blam
star snatches up their own plasma weapon and blasts the thing in the back knocking it into the water which is only a few feet deep here
as it rises she fires again taking the terminators head off
it goes under
the sky is beginning to lighten now as a moment later marcus emerges
as he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock kyle and star stare at him with astonishment
seeing their expressions he checks himself for damage theres metal exposed at his shoulder arm and hand his face partially torn away one eye missing
he tries to speak but can only manage an electronic croak
kyle and star back away from him
hes not real
marcus shakes his head starts to move toward them
star raises the rifle points it at him
dont come any closer
they hear a whistling sound from shore hit the deck as a missile blast takes out the boat and a large chunk of laying low they look up to see
a small army of tanks and terminators approaching
even a hunter killer moving in from the horizon swinging its spotlight in all directions
it looks like the last stand
marcus turns back to kyle and star
his voice is a distorted im sorry
star puts the rifle aside with an apologetic expression
she moves to marcus gingerly touches his exposed metal then hugs him tightly
kyle more stoical looks out to sea
his expression changes becomes almost hopeful as in the distance a huge black shape rises to the surface of the water just visible against the dawn horizon
missiles blast the h k
napalm erupts around the tanks and terminator army as a squad of a s scream in from over the land firing cannons launching air to ground missiles to take out
one a flies low overhead and wags its wings
blair at the controls helmeted with her face exposed lets out a victory whoop as she looks out her canopy at the huddled humans below
kyle points to the dark shape on the water now visible as a huge submarine with the rising sun behind it
high angle as zodiac boats reach land
haz mat suited soldiers leap out and run to our heroes at what remains of the dock others head inland to provide covering fire
marcus addresses a team leader whos taken aback at his frightening appearance and distorted voice there are more prisoners a complex about a mile in as marcus gives the man
a few more directions one haz mat figure standing a few feet off studies kyle and approaches
whats your name son
the figure pulls off a glove and unzips his mask extends a hand
its john connor
im glad you made it
kyle is amazed to be meeting the man face to face
he shakes hands wide eyed and speechless
its a strange moment for connor too for different reasons
connor turns away from his first meeting with his father to be a bit dizzy at the experience
he addresses marcus
connor contd seems i owe you an apology
marcus smiles as best he can given his ruined face
get in line
wider as connor replaces his mask moves to direct his troops
marcus kyle and star stay close together
near the engine room a couple dozen rescued prisoners are being treated by unarmed medical personnel others huddle under blankets with food and drink
kate is among those helping the former prisoners
kyle and star eat ravenously he finishes one mre and grabs up another
a few feet away marcus leans against a wall plasma rifle at his side
a doctor examines him warily prodding his injured face
does this hurt
i dont feel a thing
help somebody else
the doctor moves on as a couple of haz mat suited figures come down the ladder from the hatch face masks removed
among them is connor
kate moves to his side as more dazed humans come down
she speaks quietly eying kyle nearby
your dad he seems like a nice kid
connor cant deal with that at the moment speaks loudly
the last boatload is right behind me
skynets pouring in reinforcements we cant hold this place
and the people in the houses they wont leave theyre not people anymore
he trails off reacting to the sight of a familiar figure descending the ladder in a long coat head down
she looks up to make eye contact
marcus contd no
slo mo seeing marcus serena reaches into her coat
marcus moves at the same time to grab his plasma rifle serena leaps off the ladder aiming a small powerful plasma serena fires first blam
the plasma blast catches marcus in the shoulder and blows his gun arm clean off
his plasma rifle discharges blowing a hole in the side of the sub near the floor water gushes in like a firehose
leave slo mo
spun around by the force of the blast marcus lands on his back sparks and severed cables protruding from his damaged shoulder
an alarm klaxon sounds
prisoners and doctors scream and scramble for cover connor steps in front of kate to shield her they back away through the water blast connor firing at serena serena takes
numerous hits from the explosive bullets which take off pieces of her but she keeps coming fires again hitting connor in the lower abdomen
hes thrown backward kate cries out and throws herself on top of him
his gun has gone flying
serena turns her attention to marcus standing over him plasma weapon aimed point blank at his head
you were immortal
marcus manages a smile as he shakes his head
no one lives forever
multiple plasma blasts from behind riddle serenas torso the blue pulses burning right through her her head takes a hit the steel is ruptured
the plasma weapon flies out of her arms she collapses
tight on her face as she turns to see who got her theres no one there
but on the floor lies
marcus severed arm still holding his plasma rifle
the hand releases the weapon
serenas head tilts her eyes go blank shes dead
medical personnel are doing what they can to help connor blood at his lips kate and kyle at his side
this cant happen
the submarine los angeles moves toward camera as it slowly sinks deeper beneath the waters surface
we see a makeshift steel patch welded near the hatch
marcus waits outside the entrance to the sickbay
hes cleaned up a bit wears fresh clothes one sleeve pinned up
he seems weary wrung out his systems damaged
hell move stiffly through the following scene like a stroke victim
star sits beside him a hand on his arm
blair approaches from down the corridor
i need to head back to my unit
marcus nods keeps his head bowed
blair contd what about you
his voice is still weak
i have no idea
i should be dead
but youre alive
a half smile so to speak
weve been ordered not to talk about it the hybrids everything about that place is top secret
yeah simpler to keep it man versus machine
star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the back of marcus head where the interface was
what did it feel like
one of them
thoughtful beat better than anything
everything made sense
for the first time in my life i felt
it was heaven
how could you give that up
he turns to her exposing his mangled face one eye gone
i never really believed in heaven
blair takes this in fishes in a pocket
you need these more than i do
she holds out a pair of sunglasses
marcus a bit amused slips them on
the door opens nearby and an ashen faced kate emerges
he wants to see you
blair gives marcus a farewell hug
connor has a private medical area set aside
hes not looking good pale weak only semi conscious
s and monitors other life support equipment
kyle is with connor staring at a small polaroid photo in his hand
connor can barely speak above a whisper
her name was sarah
i dont remember my mother
kyle starts to hand the photo back connor waves it away
kyle is a bit puzzled but obediently keeps the snapshot
kate enters with marcus touches the boys shoulder
kyle could you give us a minute
kyle reluctantly leaves still looking at the photo with a nod to marcus on the way out
he joins star in the doorway they go off together
kate connor and marcus are alone now
throughout scene kate fights to maintain a steely control but shes clearly not far from tears
kate contd marcus
youre going to need to be rebuilt
your face your body your voice
off his shrug we have people who can do it
she pulls some medical diagrams out of a drawer lays them before marcus
he examines a scanned image of his face various elements highlighted
kate contd but you wont be the same
marcus moves to the next image it shows his features transformed into anothers something closer to john connors face with a jagged scar over part of his features
kate contd the scar will help hide the change
marcus lowers the papers absorbing this
youre asking me to become
gesturing at connor him
connor can barely speak above a whisper you must
we cant keep him alive much longer
shakes her head swallows very few people know what john actually looks like
only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth
only you know the enemy from the inside
you liberated a skynet camp
youre a hero
connor gestures for marcus to move closer he speaks with great effort i never knew how i was supposed to win this war
but i finally understand the idea of john connor is more important than the person
sinks back spent i can die
kate leans toward marcus whos lost in thought
we need you
marcus bows his head for a long beat as if seeking an answer from within
then he looks up again with resolve
he lifts his hand the skin tattered metal exposed at finger joints and moves to take connors trembling hand
slow motion mos a snowy mountainous environment
steel terminators go down in hails of bullets
we hear marcus vo his voice strong and assured yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
an army of human resistance fighters marches through the marcus v
contd i shall fear no evil
an h k goes down in flames smashes in the mountainside
the golden explosion silhouettes a single figure who stands on a promontory surveying the battle below
aides and soldiers surround him but he towers over them giving orders in complete control
move in slowly on him
contd i died and was reborn
i wear another mans face lead another mans life
yet only now do i have a reason for living
i once was lost but now im found
another blast illuminates his face for an instant scarred craggy a blend of marcus and connor but fierce determined and proud
perhaps shoot this with both actors
contd was blind but now i see
the light fades shadowing him in darkness again and we
