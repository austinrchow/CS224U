entrapment early by ronald bass ronald bass first draft screenplay december story by ronald bass and michael herzberg lake shore drive
four oclock in the morning
minimal traffic minimal life
as main titles begin we pan up the face of
up up forty floors sixty eighty very dark up here street sounds fading fast and as credits continue we can just make out
a dark figure
like a spider
inching its way up the steel surface of the th floor and we close to see
all in black nearly invisible with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face
two long oblong backpacks climb ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders tools at the belt
moving straight up the face of the skyscraper
how is it possible
closer still to see
the piton like bolts are electromagnetic clanking to the steel to support weight
a button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position
the thief is remarkably strong and agile scaling the wall with fluid precision until
a softly lit glass walled penthouse on the th floor
subtle spots which bathe paintings sculptures in a cavernous coldly decorated space
swiftly deftly the thief rigs a suction mounted harness to the steel casing above a massive window
pulleys metal caribiner clips yellow kevlar ropes
so superbly practiced the rigging is placed in seconds huge suction cups pressed to the surface of the glass
the thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging touches a button a motor whines the ropes tighten and the window
pops free hangs suspended by the kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight
the huge pane shudders in the wind and the thief slips
into the penthouse
nearby an alarm box softly beeps its second warning to the pulsing of a green light and the thief attaches a small computerized device which runs a series of possible
codes at dazzling speed on its display panel until
the right one stops
illuminated in red
the beeping the green light go off
the device is removed
back to the window air rushing in attach a similar suction mounted harness from the inside all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds press new suction cups to the inside
of the dangling window pane
a small remote control clicker
releases the outside suction cups
the windows weight now supported by the interior rigging
the outside equipment pulled into the apartment in a single tug
the whine of a motor and the pane pulls up the thief expertly popping it into place
no trace of entry
rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle the thief scans
the profusion of priceless art
the paintings run to otto dix franz marc marcel duchamp
one statue an obvious rodin
the soft lighting makes walls seem invisible everything with an infinity perspective in mind
an obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon
the thief has packed the rigging away taken out a large cylin drical tube bearing a label we cant read
knows the way quickly through the spectacular apartment past oils by early german expressionists russian futurists a rothko a kandinsky a francis bacon
the thief has no interest in these and as credits continue we enter
a powder room
a lime green poured concrete sink a copper plated commode and across from these
a single painting
unlike the others clearly an old master
a th century city on the water churches spires an ancient bridge
the thief wastes no time unceremoniously
cuts the painting from its frame with sure perfect strokes
rolls it quickly in acid free paper
opens the cylindrical tube pulling out
another canvas which we cannot see
deftly unrolls this fitting it carefully into the stolen paintings now empty frame
re hangs it
stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor
slips the rolled up stolen canvas into the empty tube
before we follow we shift angle to see the replacement canvas
a cheerful acrylic portrait
bozo the clown
with the thief now moving fast into a panelled library
there is a chute built into the wall a brass lid with the words u
the thief pops the labeled tube down the chute
onto a bookshelf reaches up to punch out an overhead grating and
disappears into the vent
reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place
halogen flashlight leading the way our thief shimmies down the narrow space arriving at
an open vertical air shaft blasting air straight up the floor height of the skyscraper with frightening force
calmly the thief clips on a different harness unzips a nylon cover from the backpack and simply
leaps down the air shaft startling the shit out of us as for an instant
the force of the updraft seems to hold the thief in place suspended above stories of nothingness
then suddenly the thief
drops sharply an exhilarating moment of absolute free fall until a cord is tugged and
a nylon parachute opens with a pop
we watch the thief drifting lazily down
a ride any kid would pay big money for
our original exterior view of the skyscrapers penthouse
reverse angle now to see in far distance
the dense forest of silhouetted office towers of downtown chicago against the night sky and we zoom toward them covering miles in three seconds to close on
the highest floor of the sears tower and through an unlit window to see
a silhouetted figure looking through it
view through the scopes lens
an amazingly close detail of the hancock tower penthouse
the scope now pans down the length of the tower to
the thief climbing onto a battered old lambretta
calm as you please
and as the scooter glides off
we hear our unseen voyeur walk away from our telescope
a door opens somewhere and as credits conclude it
a basement corridor
long bare dimly lit
were in the bowels of somewhere
a startling clank like a prison cell unlocking
a figure enters the corridor coming this way on the hurried side of brisk
hector cruz is tanned fit graying hair swept back in a pat riley do
he wears rileys armani too
maybe this guy coaches
heels echo until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering
no admittance for any reason
there is a dull silver rectangle below the words
he holds his hand up to it
dries his palm on his perfectly creased slacks
one more time
an unexpectedly vast semi circular room the entire inner circum ference made up of a single continuous wall screen separated into a seamless array of images
three dimensional rotating graphics of every room in the hancock tower penthouse schematics of electrical plumbing and ventila tion systems
see through rotating multicolored models of every piece of security equipment imaginable components flashing as performance simulations are run
rapid fire sequences of indiv idual human profiles complete with photos and bio blurbs
screens flickering with blizzards of data hurtling past at warp speed
the pentagon and cnn would kill for this room
the largest segment of screen twenty feet square runs a live feed from the crime scene
the living room of the penthouse crawling with slow moving cops and technicians doing their slow moving thing
surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens showing this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles
we see the library the mail chute
the powder room
cruz skips down three steps to floor level nine separate control stations each outfitted with super tech panels to process the avalanche of information
but today all stations are empty
you got it solved
and now we see her
from the rear
slouched at her station
looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair rumpled oversized workshirt vintage jeans
from the rear actually
not a kids voice
music and whiskey and sex and effortless confidence
even the voice turns us on
cruz glances at his watch what took you so long gin
i called this morn
because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone to stone
i was with someone all right
now we really see her
delicate bones and features slender body radiating the power of a natural heart stopping beauty
ginger baker is ethereal and feral at once
electric green eyes crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked with
this is work
he is not kidding
stainless steel beneath the dapper
they are a matched team
hector i hardly know the guy
why be impolite to strangers
and he smiles
maybe shes lying
he likes her
look at those assholes
he means the cops on live feed
if the vermeer were lying on that table theyd toss their doughnuts on it
yeh well they didnt insure it so they dont have to solve this
to them its a crime
to us its mil less re insurance which is
cruz grim only thirty percent gin
which is why youre on this
soft and straight
youre the best
i need you
he came in through the window
thats not possib
whats not possible is entry through the doors or the vents
that would have triggered instant alarm
the windows are wired too
only for trauma
they used smart glass where the sensors respond to violation of the panels integrity
he always does with her
i think he scaled the wall popped the frame
in one piece
she sounds awfully positive
then again she always does
then he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors
they were on second delay so the owner wouldnt trigger the alarm just be walking arou
the pane weighs pounds the buildings feet high
this particular guy is the best
the best there ever was
almost as if she knows who
cruz shakes his head
popping the frame would trigger the alarm
even at one tenth power it is dazzling light
she touches the panel before her
gin gently i wrote a program and ran it dumbo
the live feed is replaced by a red outlined rotating three dimensional diagram of the living room
the alarm box glows green
one window pane glows lavender
she touches the panel and the window shatters the alarm instantly emits a piercing screech
as he watches
this time the window slides away into thin air
a stick figure appears crawls through the opening and the alarm begins the slow beep we heard last night
cruz just stares
heres how i figured it out
live feed replaces the diagram
our camera zooms toward a vase of lilies by the window
all the flowers are tilted in one direction
over the lip of the vase away from the window
no one arranges flowers like that
it was the draft from the window
he turns to her
this particular guy
now she is beaming
and just above a whisper
delighted at his stupefied reaction
why not houdini
or pretty boy floyd
maybe jesus christ
because they couldnt do it
his slow smile
this fucking kid
hes been out of the business
for ten years maybe not
no one ever proved hell even arrested him for stealing anything but we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years
why not forty
because of the bozo switch
guys have been copying his pack rat signature for decades maybe the thief wanted it to look like macdougal
she doesnt even answer
just touches her panel and one of the data screens blows up to huge size
a list of his private collection
complete to three acquisitions last thursday
names scrolling up endlessly next to titles descriptions estimated retail and black market values
turner corot thomas coles dekooning klimt cezannes odilon redon braques mary cassatt
dont be a putz
this is his legitimate collection which he buys presentable for any search warrant surprise party
names keep rolling degas paul klee
what he rips off he fences
and the money feeds his portfolio of investments which are daring savvy and obscenely succesf
oh i get it
he has no interest in vermeers so that proves he stole one
by that logic he oughta be a suspect most of the time
she shakes her head sadly
you love to embarrass yourself
touches her panel
the big screen now shows a grainy videotape of
where our client bought the painting
we see the great room of an english country estate
perhaps a hundred attend
genteel to the max
ashcroft hall buckinghamshire four weeks ago
the tape pans five paintings on the block
we recognize our vermeer the city of delft the canal the bridge
the view pulls back to include the crowd and
one tiny section is circled
and blows up twenty feet
high so blurry as to be unrecognizable
then snaps to amazing resolution
the image of
murmur anyone we know
andrew macdougal perhaps as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall
etched with character and worldly experience lit by a twinkle behind the razor keen gaze
tall wide shoulders massive hands
this guy would be more fun to fuck than fight
by a lot
so he was there
staking it out
why bid when you can mark the buyer and jack it within the month
she leans way back in the molded chair
lifts her long legs up onto the console
they end in slender bare feet
the toes wriggle
at this moment he is winging on jal flight to narita ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the hotel akura which will include a mixed media collage oil by
georges braques on which he supposedly has his eye
but you know better
bet your ass
at vegas odds
touches the panel
the big screen now holds three faces three names
research reveals three known fences still at large who are believed to have brokered vermeers to black market buyers
sandrine palmer is hospitalized in malta with ovarian cancer
one face and name disappears
the other two
live in tokyo
a tiny dry adorable shrug
which says bingo
and you did all this since this morning
grinning small at each other
she cant help that hers is hot
she never can
cruz murmur plus
you were polite to a stranger
one of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore
best to defuse by pretending its a joke
gin soft and playful sounds like youre sorry youre already a friend
said as banter between pals
which doesnt make her wrong
auction in progress in the huge traditional lobby where bonsai trees paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek international big money crowd
everyone milling drinking schmoozing networking in a babble of languages as up on the raised platform
the auctioneer has a new piece on the block a th century temple scroll from the asuka period
it is exquisite and bidding seems to be big time from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead digital display which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously
as we pan the hall we see
all non asians either wearing headphones or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow to follow the rapid fire auctioneer
andrew macdougal stands alone in black tie
tall and rugged and polished and focused and well pretty gorgeous
he is bidding on the scroll indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger stabs of the auctioneer in our direction
womans voice o
subtitled japanese dont do it
pull back slightly to reveal gin who has stepped to his shoulder
she is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly
breathtaking would be an insult
macdougal doesnt turn doesnt seem to even hear her
just raises his program to up the bid
gin softly subtitled japanese youre already over value
and now he turns
straight to her eyes
this is not an admiring glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the northern hemisphere
it is a look that says in the most understated terms shut up or ill kill you
she shuts up
his glance goes to his obvious bidding rival a rather butch middle aged chinese woman in an embroidered version of a mao suit
she indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny yorkshire terrier whom she holds in her stubby hands
macdougal raises back
gin subtitled japanese will you stop being stubborn for one sec
because he has turned
with the eyes of a lion
being pulled from an antelope carcass
mac quietly subtitled japanese i have a question
rich scottish voice
impeccable japanese intonation
gin brightly subtitled japanese who the fuck am i
mac subtitled japanese that is of no interest
in spite of herself she looks a little hurt
gin subtitled japanese what then
mac subtitled japanese why
are we speaking
her eyes move across his formidable face
im showing off
his eyes scan the length of her gown
something of a habit
she is minus a comeback
you know the alleged value of this piece from some fucking computer which has no clue of the price i can turn the scroll around for in minutes a beat
no you cant
really sorry its sold
his great head whips around to see madame mao kissing her pooch flushed with victory
he stares for a long moment a veneer of philosophical almost masking his rage
when he turns back
are you a confederate of my adversaries
or are you just stupid
hold on her
feeling like both
mac among the guests awaiting their cars standing slightly apart
from behind him
a feminine throat clears
he closes his eyes for a beat
gin softly how about
if i try humility
and presents a business card to him with both hands japanese style
mac looks in her eyes
takes the card with both hands
gin actually gin romay
i was named after a card game
or a cheap cocktail
his brows raise
mac softly as in
ill have a gin romay please
with a twist
that laser unsmiling stare
she gets lost in it for a beat
youre supposed to be charming
im supposed to be selective
glances back to her card
art and antiquities acquisition advisor how alliterative
still no smile
and am i the antiquity
in mint condition
look ive studied you i know
made your first millions selling scrap metal
then gold mining concessions gems art and lately strategic metals for new technologies platinum zirconium titanium
the cat burglar stories
why would anyone
with so much to lose
take those kinds of risks
youd have to be
a held beat
his glance lifts beyond her shoulder
and walks off toward a sleek custom touring car just pulling up
she goes after him
i didnt know porsche made things like this
well they dont
tipping the valet
as a rule
shutting the door
through the open window she hands something from her bag
a plastic rectangle which opens into a slide viewer
she presses the light on
he looks at the slide
my seller is in shinjuku we can go there tonight
she leans closer
i can get it for three
he hands it back
looks in her eyes
no you cant
and takes off
her jaw drops slightly but in one fluid motion
shes hailed a cab
graceful timeless room designed by frank lloyd wright in the s
a place to drink to deal to dream
pan down the polished surface of the bartop til we come to
a tropical drink
cute little umbrella tilted back toward the room
rotate angle to see
inside the umbrella something small something mechanical
a womans hand adjusts the point of the umbrella ever so slightly and we pan up her arm to see
still in her gown
she is reading with half glasses and one of the bows curls around her ear which we close on to hear
gin adjusts the drink umbrella which is a directional mike and hears
only its not bloody football snap to macs table well across the room
drinking giant beers with a large really fat japanese guy in a costly if wrinkled suit
the hulk listens with stone attention to macs rant as if he actually gave a shit
its just that crap americans call football like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one
the guy nods seriously
maybe hes a sumo dude
why youd want to bring that foolishness to japan youre just pissing your investment down a bungee hole
sumo guy major accent you got cubano this trip
that he does
mac pulls out a leather cigar holder and passes it over
flat against one side is an envelope which sumo guy palms skillfully slipping it seamlessly into his pocket as he withdraws a small match box
takes out one long cigar lights up
seriously put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution something stable the big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward mac
opening the box mac sees one match and a small microchip fastened to the cardboard
slides the match box in his pocket
or industrial plastics
gin still engrossed in her reading
a figure leans down next to her
she startles slightly
so surprised to see
my favorite thing in life
she gives him the great smile
im staying here whats your excuse
and now he smiles
first time ever
a little chilling the way he does it
staying here as well
you are in room
gin half a beat one thirty eight
in one motion he flags the bartender
will you send a half bottle of chateau dyquem to room please
and some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with
he presses some currency into the barkeeps hand
actually i was just across the room dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting spitzweg
until i determined the painting was apparently stolen
goes against my grain
the dekooning in your slide the
million you can get for
can you get it for and a half
she looks in his eyes
and as if he believed her
my checkbook is in my safe
you wait here
his smile evaporates
he is gone before she can say
ill wait here
mac driving in silence
gin stealing glances at him
suddenly and smoothly he reaches down and picks up
thats my purse
he opens it
one eye on the road he begins to rummage
just want to see if im with the person you say you are
cant be too caref
she snatches the bag away from him he grabs it back the car swerves left and
crashes violently into a parked pure white bentley
metal buckles and tears both alarms go off a cacophony of horrific mac quietly oh dear
people come running but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly couple who were just returning to their precious bentley
their wails and anguish would be suitable if all their grandchildren had been crushed beneath macs wheels
mac and gin are out of the car
as he exits mac has palmed a small blade and in a quick unseen motion ripped a jagged tear in his left trouser leg
the old couple rush to mac shrieking their rage and grief in japanese gin is trying to calm them as bystanders gather but mac cuts through
mac subtitled japanese well go in there and call the police
and hobbles off toward the nearest building a block square story skyscraper bearing the name fujitsu
the couple the crowd all race after the limping mac
are you all right
no answer he looks dark enough to rain
into the public lobby of the huge industrial complex
two night guards come hurrying from their desk as the small mob pours in
mac in the lead a commanding presence tells the guards in a loud clear voice
mac subtitled japanese i have damaged the car of these kind people
please help them call the police
one guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone
mac pulls up his trouser leg and gin gasps to see a bloody gash
mac drops the trouser back over the wound
asks the remaining guard
mac subtitled japanese may i use a washroom please
the guard nods absently disoriented by the chaos
mac hands his billfold to gin
these are my papers passport car registration
if the police arri
youre going to need stitches let me get you to a hospital
soft words genuine concern
and his eyes flicker
as if somehow seeing her for the first time
a small spark but she feels it
really this can all wait
ill handle it
the look holds
his first real smile
it was worth waiting for
mac to a guard subtitled japanese might you have a first aid kit of some kind
we are inside an empty closed japanese style toilet stall
porcelain foot rests
the door bursts open and
mac enters fast with the first aid kit locking the door hitting the stopwatch on his wrist which begins counting at zero
he pulls up his trouser leg revealing the bloody gash and simply
rips the entire wound off the rubbery prosthetic wound dangles dripping its phony blood
mac pulls gauze strips from the kit soaks them in bogus gore expertly wraps his leg then flushes the prosthetic down the hole
he pulls off the fujitsu visitor badge clipped to his lapel and from a ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic which he presses to the face of the
badge fitting perfectly turning the badge into
an employee i
the name kawakubo m
the photo of a surly japanese male
quickly mac takes out the match box from the hotel bar and with a fine tweezers gently removes the microchip placing it inside the badge activating it with a soft
he reaches now
behind his back up under his tux jacket and rips free a tightly compressed pack of what seems white paper or cloth
he snaps it loose revealing it to be
a baggy clean suit not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to the floor
a white hood
with opaque tinted visor
mac in his clean suit and opaque visored hood at an elevator marked cleared personnel only in english and kanji japanese characters
he holds his badge to the scanner the door pings and slides open
mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an air lock with sign clean room class
holds his badge to the scanner the air lock door lights flash froin red to yellow to green
the prep room
recorded voices purr safety instructions in japanese while mac stands being bombarded by air shower chemical sprayer blinding uv light
the next air lock opens
a long assembly line where robot arms work on a stream of black silicon wafers which pass along a clear lexan conveyor belt
the wafers move through various airtight chambers exposing them to multi colored gasses cyan sodium yellow magenta etc
as part of the microchip manufacturing process
more than a dozen technicians in their hooded clean suits watch over every phase of the work attached to the walls by grounding wires and air hoses which create a
mac simply hooks himself up and saunters straight through the area toward the place where the conveyor belt with its newly processed disappears through the wall
nearby a hatch is built into the same wall and mac calmly clanks it open squeezing through into
a dimly lit maintenance bay
panels of switches wires fuses fans air cleaners
maximum claustrophobia as mac clangs the hatch shut behind him looking instantly to
an overhead hatch with letters in kanji and english danger argon gas
mac throws back his hood yanks out his mini oxygen pouch fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils and slips on thick round infrared goggles that make him
look like a refugee from monkeys
no time to lose
up through the overhead hatch closing it behind him as he enters
the conveyer tube a horizontal lexan cylinder three feet in diameter filled with billowing red gas
mac stretches out on his belly glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt with its precious cargo of microchips runs along just above his head in eerie red light
he begins to
shimmy crawl squirm along the length of the tube
gas too thick to see the end
he is agile as a commando hauling ass when suddenly
the floor beneath his tube falls away and he is crawling in space stories above tokyo as his tube spans the distance between manufacturing and shipping structures
he goes faster a black chamber
we can scarcely make out the endless rows of shelving the air purifying equipment the conveyor belt entering through its air lock as machinery folds each priceless microchip in foil
wrappers stacks them on shelves
through the gasket
mac tumbles into view swinging himself neatly down to the floor and in a single motion he is already flashing a neon green pen light along the shelves of microchips
we see now the wrappers are different colors with different kanji characters and mac is definitely looking for something special until
hes found it
a single row chips nothing special from here but mac
whips out something coiled snaps it to full length revealing a strip of shiny black satin cloth
three feet long little more than an inch wide
carefully mac lays the strip down directly over the row of microchips
and when he lifts it up again
the chips have adhered to the underside of the cloth
in one deft snap of his wrist he coils the cloth again like a yo yo
turns to leave and
tosses a small sack of something where the chips used to be
tims mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the clean room
no one sees no one cares
hooking up once again he ambles toward a door clearly marked exit only to employee lounge return only by the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall
he pretends to scan it
a stack of flyers
he takes one
past a changing area vending machines guys bullshitting
mac just strolling along reading his flyer as
touches his shoulder voice subtitled japanese excuse me
mac turns stares through his opaque visor at a well built security officer
dead straight eyes
officer subtitled japanese the company picnic
saturday or sunday
his eyes cut to the flyer mac is reading
mac hands it to him and without a trace of scottish accent
mac subtitled japanese better eat first
gin is up to her ears in grief
there are no less than five cops grilling her taking notes while the old couple has their second wind and are shrieking in top form
the bystander gallery has grown to maybe three dozen and theyre all getting their word in
as gin struggles to cope
she keeps looking at the clock
darting glances toward the corridor
she is freaking out
she cant stand it
hands macs billfold to one of the cops pushes her way through the mob and
takes off down the corridor a security guard in belated pursuit we go
with her down the hallway wheel around a corner flat out sprinting skids to a stop at the right doorway and bursts into
an empty washroom
from the stall just mac
and whatever became of a gentlemans privacy
the security guard barges in
my god more females
the guard starts railing at gin a mile a minute
she calmly takes a wad of bills from her purse
hands them to the guy
gin subtitled japanese stand outside
i was worried its been twenty
the leg is fine but i got sort of
lost my stomach once or twice
cut inside the stall
he is just re taping the folded clean suit and hood to the small of his back
im an old man
you probably noticed
he smiles at that much amused
slips on his jacket
you should see me without my teeth
unlocks the door
mustnt forget to zip up
thats not what he forgot
he pulls out the coiled black satin cloth strip snaps it free microchips snug to the underside
and fits it neatly
down his trouser leg
the perfect tuxedo stripe
out the door
to meet her gaze
odd place this
he goes to her
offers his arm
what do you suppose they make here
she takes it wrapping both hers through
microchips i think for computers
he opens the door
ushers her through
the best ones are here today
follows her out
they sit together in the rear of the taxi as it makes its way through late night traffic
she is looking around
this isnt the way to my sel
mac quietly ive changed my mind
looking straight ahead
she stares at his profile
mind telling me why
you cant get it for me at
well we can tr
you were setting me up
the correct price is
you conspire with the seller to start at
so ill be grateful when you bargain him down to three
close enough to fool some people
never looks at her
i know what everything is worth
she keeps staring
so where are we g
i am going to the airport
you are going on to the rest of your life
should be interesting
her turn to think
you forgot your lugg
the hotels deal with that
the things i need are always waiting at the next one
afterthought i dont carry
little twist on that
and youre off to
oh thats highly personal
he still stares straight ahead
the taxi pulls onto a freeway
toward narita airport
time running out
and in her dearest most vulnerable voice
i did so hope to impress you
she puts the fingertips of her left hand
on his chest
gin hopeful im still hoping
and he smiles
turns to her eyes
i am old enough to be your grandfather
she shakes her head
gin soft my father
leans her mouth in for the kill
gin whisper thats part of the rush
fits her mouth to his
the green eyes close as she tastes him
nothing predatory in this kiss
it is tender exquisite
a kiss of deep longing
of true love
his arms slip around her
and in less than five seconds
taxi driver o
racist accent still on fo airport
a small bottle
an ornate label
gin lifts it from the table studies the label
she wears only a mans oversized t shirt
our rotating angle reveals the empty bed tangled sheets
gin looks pretty rumpled herself
she lifts the bottle two glasses a plateful of chocolates and strawberries and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking
mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing overlooking downtown tokyo
he wears a thin japanese robe called a yukata and is wrapped in half of a huge down coverlet from the bed
the other half obviously waiting for
she curls down into the billowing coverlet just against his body
sets her things beside him
a reward for what
for not being old
it is a lovely smile
he studies it for a beat
not as old as i look
she traces her finger along his cheek
gin a whisper yeh
and kisses him
it takes awhile
she seems to enjoy it
with him its harder to tell
when she pulls back
he picks up a chocolate
tears it in half
offers her the larger piece
do i deserve a reward
he puts the chocolate into her mouth
with great tenderness he traces the line of her lower lip
as she swallows
its so hard to find good casual sex anymore
im probably out of practice
but he just looks at her
whats hard to find
is someone you truly want to be with
and leans closer
just above a whisper
even for awhile
he kisses her
beautiful and deep the way he does it
and when he pulls back she is staring at him
as if at a loss for something to say
its lucky we stopped by my room for the wine
because his gaze is unrelenting
as if not forgetting that shes changed the subject
otherwise wed never have found my bag was stolen
would that make it more stolen
his face looks kind now not formidable at all
maybe shes wondering if she actually likes him
they even got my prescriptions
something you need
there are all night chemists
he does look concerned
and therefore sweet
she kisses his nose
i take prilosec
for stomach acid
and an inhaler
she gets her old smile
the soft wicked tease
but since i didnt have to work all that hard tonight
he stares at her
cocks a finger like a gun right between her eyes
pantomimes pulling the trigger
gin softly ouch
i had that coming
she pivots and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest
he wraps strong arms around her
pulling her close
why would someone steal my luggage
every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there
something in the tone
wannabe dealers make excellent fences
in her eyes
and she cuddles back
as if enjoying the humor
he thought i had a stolen painting
in my bag
im joking of course
kisses the top of her head
the vermeer wouldnt fit
her eyes widen
just a little
why did you do something wrong
she turns all the way around
their faces are inches apart
each reading the others eyes
the most famous painting stolen this week
to kiss her nose
if you dont keep up on your craft
youll miss all the jokes
and lowers her gently onto her back
still staring in her eyes he winds her legs around him
her mouth parts but
he fills it with his own
view of the empty terrace the rumpled twisted coverlet
maybe they spent all night
hear the shower running full blast in a distant bathroom
pull back to see
gin hair wet wrapped in a plush hotel robe rapidly and expertly going through dresser night stand closet sofa cushions every goddam thing in the room
she comes to
the jacket rifles the pockets pats the lining
the pants now
the right leg has no stripe
touches the cloth
slightly sticky where the stripe should be
shower running full blast
but theres no one in it
a storage closet
mac crouching in the smallspace
we see the travel bag
the luggage tag virginia romay a darien connecticut address
the embossed initials vr
but there is something else in macs hand
a prescription bottle
and a name ginger baker
mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe
exits the closet
locks the door
mac ambling into the bedroom toweling his hair with one hand
holding his billfold in the other
gin is starting a room service breakfast
eggs sausage belgian waffles
the girl can eat
im so glad i didnt leave tokyo
she looks up
trademark dry grin
i love a guy who knows how to sweet talk
he stands over her
what he meant was
there was a call
while you were sleeping
an art dealer i know
he has a monet
minor but it is giverny
hell let me have it for
she stares at him
gin cautiously we can maybe beat that
mac pulling plastic from his billfold i agree
this is a bank debit card
it gives the bearer access to an account containing
i dislike round numbers
the card to her
as her eyes move over it
id like you to go down there and pick up the painting
if thats all right
without looking up
if im there hell haggle
you just hand him the debit card with that
and say take it or leave it
now her eyes come up
she says nothing
i thought you so wanted to make a good impression
thought i already did th
and along with making an excellent impression
you will also make percent of the purchase price
for two hours work
the look holds
he goes to the desk
lifts a cellular phone
tosses it to her
just give me a ring
stolen painting is it
of course not
and on his way out the door
if it was
i wouldnt pay more than three
gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of yokohamas bund
sleazy shops pachinko parlors hostess bars sidewalk noodle counters all built along a tall rickety pier nearly thirty feet above the pounding surf
the harbor is gigantic
every type and size of vessel imaginable
gin carries a long neoprene covered tube with watertight seals and a lightweight bright orange foam cover
she looks at her slip of paper
then across at the place
kendo souvenirs a schlock kickback parlor with a tourist bus parked out front
this cant be right
pulls out the cellular phone
you have reached the voice mail of amd investments
and yes you are at the right place
gin into phone pissed i like men with a sense of humor
this does not qualify
snaps the phone shut
checks the slip again
walks firmly across the street through the mobs of tourists and into
the place is huge ramshackle loaded with every piece of tourist crap imaginable
the only paintings on display are renderings of big cats on black velvet
she winds her way through to a counter at the back
one guy there
gin subtitled japanese may i please speak with mr
you doin it
the best we can say for the pudgy balding fellow in the hawaiian shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers is that he does not seem to be the guy who is
selling you a monet
even a minor one
i think theres some mista
you from mac
the guy coughs horribly
im from mac
lemme see card
four million six hundred thirteen thousand five hundred
he slaps his hand on the table
lay it down toots
lifts straight up from beneath the counter
a brown paper wrapped rectangle
not much larger than two feet square
she cant even believe shes here doing this
gestures to him
open it up
he obliges coughing grossly all the while
unwrapped the painting does look like a monet
she stares at it
now bring me the real one
he doesnt blink
this as real as it gets lady
and from within her pocket
the cellular rings
she takes it out
puts it to her ear
you got it
gin into phone is this an audition a joke or a rip off
im staring at an obvious forgery here
turn it over
this gives her pause
then cradling the phone against her shoulder she does as shes told
is there an envelope
taped to the back
in a ziploc bag
gin into phone uh huh
detach the bag
read whats in it
carefully unfolding several sheets of paper maps
gin reading into phone shikoku naru a freighter it says yokohama to jakarta
specs on some kind of machine diag
papers back in the envelope envelope back in the ziploc very quickly without seeming to hurry
her eyes are flickering questions but she does as shes told cradling the phone with her shoulder
now take the debit card from your purse slipping the ziploc into the purse as you do it shielding the move from everyone in the room but okati
and she does
more deftly than we could ever have imagined
like a pro
quietly give him the card
gin into phone mac the paintings a forg
even quieter this is a test
of whether youll still be alive four minutes from now
do you hear me
her face freezes
in a pleasant smile
gin into phone yes mac i do
hand him the card and tell him in japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone
tell him to take awhile as if hes on hold
she turns the sweet plastic smile to okati
hands him the card
gin subtitled japanese mac says pretend youre checking this by phone and take your ti
okati subtitled japanese like im on hold sure
and suddenly his eyes are keen and quick and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants
he takes the card stares at it comically picks up the phone
while hes checking look around the room casually as if searching for the cheesy handbags
she begins to
all the while laughing as if you are chatting with someone you actually like gin into phone im not that good
but she is
and she laughs as she strolls over to the cheesy handbags
as youre looking around do you notice any m
gin into phone three guys two together one alone
cheap suits not looking at me in a cop casual way
call out cheerily to okati in english wheres the toilet
gin into phone can i say little girls room
gin calls out cheerily okati absorbed by his make believe phone call points around the back
gin into phone as she saunters mac the painting isnt
youve got what we bought are you out of their sight
she turns the corner
restrooms at opposite ends
run into the mens toilet
i know you know how
a beat of uncertainty
she looks both ways
ominous are you running and she does
sprinting down the garbage strewn hallway throws open the mens room door bursting in on
a wispy old guy taking a leak through a hole in the floor
gin subtitled japanese the panicked little man startles
bolts out the door
hear now from the corridor footfalls pounding
she looks down through the piss hole
the surf roils thirty feet below
gin into phone its too small
the window twit
she hops over the disgusting hole boosts herself up to the small window footfalls racing closer hoists herself halfway through dropping the phone a scary feet to the surf below
as behind her the door
slams open and she flies out the window
with her in slo mo kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder bag and she
hits the ocean like a ton of bricks
comes up sputtering in the swirling water as from out of the shadows of the pilings
an engine roars to life the blur of a custom jetski mac reaching to scoop the startled girl out of the water and they
blast off as bullets rain helplessly after them
the agents shouting into their cellulars racing in frustration down the pier which rapidly vanishes behind us as
gin hangs onto mac for dear life
this baby is really hauling
he wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers
shouts back against the noise
admits shouting in his ear
he is heading into deep water a major shipping channel points to one side and she sees
a huge harbor patrol vessel fire up in near distance
the chase is on
they speed toward the wake of a luxury liner and as she realizes
they slam into the wake head on and are airborne for an amazing distance jolting back to the surface racing toward
two gigantic freighters which approach each other from opposite directions
the harbor patrol in hot pursuit blasting its horn
as we near the outbound freighter mac cuts his speed
now the harbor patrol is really gaining
cruising straight toward the part side of the outbound freighter as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side
as the harbor patrol is nearly on them mac veers suddenly around the stern of the outbound freighter the harbor patrol wheeling madly to pursue only to find we are
both careening straight at
the starboard side of the inbound freighter mac cuts his wheel in an adroit nearly right angle swerve and hears the screams as the harbor patrol
plows into the freighter
wasting no time he accelerates into maximum burn streaking toward the immensely crowded harbor and its thousand vessels
gin cant help but look back at the impressive crash site mouthing a silent wow
nearing the harbor mac cuts speed completely drifting between two huge ships and
vanishing from sight
the tiny jetski cruises in a quiet channel crowded with vessels of all sizes tugs fishing boats pleasure craft junks sampans all larger than we are
gin clings close to mac although it is no necessary
more like romantic
she is still flushed with the rush
i guess youre gonna explain all this huh
but he says nothing
pulls out a water tight duffle
hands it back to her without looking
dry clothes youll need them
in five minutes
she takes the bag confused
im supposed to change
here i wont look
gentlemans word of hon
there are a million sailors ive seen you naked
give the boys a thrill
he means it
you probably wont be dating any of them so what the hell
gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft
no one seems to be paying much attention
what the hell
she unzips the bag pulling out
gin astonished these
these are mine
he never looks around
found em in your room
perhaps the thief wasnt your size
she stares at the back of his head
he is stripping off his slickers
a neatly tailored suit beneath
we have a business appointment
in four minutes
she pulls her dress off over her head
she ignores some nearby whistles and shouts
begins drying herself with a fluffy towel from the bag
mac never turns time has come to tell you
im actually in
am i gonna like th
mac quietly im a thief
she can scarcely believe hes admitting this
and now that ive told you
ill have to kill you
he chuckles a scottish chuckle
cold and warm at once
she slips the dry dress over her head
you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life
training for wha
followed by the most exciting night of your life
after which you can walk away with million untraceable dollars
he means this
which will come in handy
things being what they are
from now on
you can valet park
she begins taking off her wet underwear underneath the dress
we suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty
and if i refuse
mac very quietly dont
i mean you wont really kill me im far too adorable
he looks around at her
as if deciding on that
last night at fujitsu i did some business
while you thought i was in the toilet
what could you possibly steal in min
thirty five super microchips
each worth one million dollars
staring dead at her eyes
you hate round num
i stole your suitcase when i left you at the bar
i have since sent it on to the states with three chips well hidden
are you following
since you arent there to claim it the bag will sit at customs
no smile at all
no entrapment is what cops do to robbers
we can feel her heart pounding from here
is what robbers do to schmucks
to kiss her mouth
mac softly even adorable ones
they have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic freighter
it is at water level the steps they use for their tender
he points up to the name
she nods slowly
pulls the ziploc bag from her purse
hands it over
he removes the sheets of paper
begins to peruse them
admit its a rush
the best day of your heretofore drab life
he glances up
accompanied by related foreplay
and gives him the smile
what a gal
he offers his hand
she rises hops lightly to the steps of the gangway in her bare feet
he pulls dry shoes from the duffle
and as she slips them on
he flips a switch and the jetski begins to fill with water mac stepping to the gangway beside her
the jetski rapidly sink out of sight
a thorough guy
mac and gin stand inside a gigantic cargo bay watching massive containers being loaded by crane from a dock through the gaping hatch
the chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel painted hospital green and macs eye moves over all of it seeming to inspect every plate every pan head rivet
british cheer hullo there
they turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very wide necktie skipping down the iron steps
bursting with a salesmans bonhomie he extends a plump hand
nickerson carlsby mr
this is my associate fiancee ms
the little man pauses
a tic in the well oiled smile
fiancee and assoc
gin cheery herself im a hyphenate
like that makes complete sense
fingers the gardenia in his lapel
well its a pleasure in this alien place to do business with a countryman
im a scot
its a different country
culturally and historically
carlsby looking around well
theyve brought you to quite the wrong place i see
mac looking around thank god
carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk which ends at a steel door
he presses his thumb to the i
panel and speaks into the voice box
carlsby confidential code voice in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
the door clangs open
they go through it as a gangway leads toward an open five foot thick vault door where two armed guards rise from their seats
carlsby ignores them as if they were furniture
thumps the door
five feet thick with hidden rein forcements no way to drill through
gin authoritative impressive
only the tip of our security iceberg
see these two brinks locks
the captain keeps one key
the other is continually forwarded to the chief of security at next port
there is no way to enter during voyage
i like this
carisby glances to mac
he is stone
the best armed guard rotated every six hours
a redundancy of course but we would rather be safe three times over than merely two
mac very quiet what if theres a fire
in the chamber
carlsby leads them through the open door into
the maximum security hold
the steel coated with sleek matte black all grip paint
tubby points up
the entire chamber is water proof fireproof airtight
if the ship sinks god forfend your cargo is secure for salvage
mac does not look convinced
and your cargo is
the bloody japs bought up half the premium clarets in the universe
you may have heard
im in charge of shipping some bottles most quite rare to a number of premium hotels in hong kong bangkok singapore phuket and penang
carlsby gets the romance of it all
all of which are destinations on your october voyage
five months from now
and turns to the man
with laser disapproving eyes
to be jostled
the man beams
gestures to a series of platforms each swaying at different heights in different directions
our delicate treasure platforms suspended on gimbals
your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas
then on arrival is plucked
pointing once more
by that forklift and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch
a huge circular hatch cut into the hull
macs eyes stare blankly at it
a long beat
he pronounces it all
and then turns once more
did we see
a bathing pool
oh yes sir
the shikoku maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas senger cabins
the finest cuisine
for valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy
thinks this over
carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly appointed hallway
a secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter
he opens a burnished door into
an elegant suite
cherrywood panels spacious windows with views of the harbor
the finest furnishings
it is breathtaking
but dearest in five months well be in cape town
mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been taped to the back of okatis monet
peruses them casually
that goes perhaps from
say sri lanka
and looks up
to a man dumbstruck
in three weeks
looking down on californias san joaquin valley from feet as air rushes past our open door
you seem depressed
pull back to see them both in jumping suits
hes checking her gear
shes eyeing the expansive grid of fields below
at your insistence im leaping to my death and i dont know why he clips a tether from his harness to hers
youre a greedy girl
im not jumping until you talk about this its been two days she folds her arms across her chest
he smiles at her tenderly
why are we going in three weeks if the wine is on a different route months lat
there is no wine
that just bought us a look at their security
she stares at him
i knew that
what we want is on the boat in three weeks
now can we jump
the machine in those diagrams
on the back of the painting
hes still smiling
what does it do make gold
were nearing the targ
why wont you trust me
how do i know who you are hmmn
stares in her eyes
for all i know your name isnt virginia romay
maybe youre a cop
she stares back
why would a cop do all th
mac softly entrapment remember
what cops do to robbers
gin just as softly oh
his smile is light affectionate
gently he backs her to the edge of the doorway
she throws her arms around his neck
holds him close
mac im afraid
vulnerable and touchingly real
his arms slide around her
mac a murmur smart girl
and jumps gin shrieking in his arms as we
follow them tumbling in free fall until he releases her and bot extend their arms and legs as if flying as if gliding face down her shriek continuing
he floats at the end of their tether a few feet above her
and at last
her screaming stops
we see the pure adrenaline rush
woods rolling hills a dirt path
mac stands by a sign at a crossroads names arrows stinson beach bolinas mt
tamalpais mill valley
there is a phone booth nearby
he holds a stopwatch looking down the path as
gin runs into view steady stride breathing hard sheened with sweat
approaching him she slows to a stop
hands on her knees catching her wind
he clicks the watch
and rather impressive
she sends a nasty smile thanks a bunch
but maybe she likes the compliment after all
rustic cabin in moonlight
ringed by woods
middle of nowhere which is where mac likes it
as we approach the lit window we hear two oddly matched sounds
and the hiss of a violent power tool
we move through the window into
two figures stand in the shower spray soaking their shorts and tank tops
gin is operating a sleek welder trying to perform micro surgery on a dartboard which mac waves in all directions at the end of a short pole
all right six and seven
she blinks the spray from her eyes and deftly sears the wire dividing those two numbers on the board
as mac keeps waving it she goes off line
gets it right
the wire peels away
three and four
close on gin operating a small steamshovel with a loading attachment on the front
it is mounted with two x s set close together protruding from the loader
she maneuvers the wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks
but as she positions to scoop one up her vehicle sways wildly and we pull back to see it is
dangling from a crane operated by mac
gin stays with it concentrates and on the next pass she glides her boards under a huge rock lifting it awkwardly
ignoring the bumpy ride she pivots and deposits her prize in place atop what has become
a wall of stones
what the hell are we building
he gives this some reflection
a chalet i think
or an outhouse
mac and gin paddle kayaks side by side
a full moon slams off the rolling surface of the sea
light chop enough to bob pretty strong once they stop paddling
his stopwatch glows
he says only
and she flips over submerging her head and torso and we go
with her underwater upside down in the kayak she struggles to free a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit
fumbling to break the seal on a slender tube which bursts sending a glow of yellow green light in all directions
she fits the flexible tube around her head like a headlamp pulling out
a small electric fan with side handgrips of black metal
buffeted by the current gin manages to flip a small switch on the housing of the fan and
with a supreme effort she tries to roll herself upright but
cant quite make it
blind panic now blowing bubbles flailing at the kayak which suddenly
rolls upright manipulated by mac
she sputters and tries to throw the tethered fan at him but it snaps back and slams her across the shoulder
she is furious
get your fucking equipment together man this is a professional operation
gin in a clearing arms at her sides a determined look
mac is somewhere just behind us
this time when you raise your arm
she nods got it
suddenly in the clearing before her a hostage silhouette target pops up the outline of a terrorist shielding himself with a hostage gins arm rising with a blur and
blamm blamm blamm
the paper terrorist is nailed in the head
two out of three
she lets out a thin stream of air
proud of herself but too cool to gloat
very very nice
had a tour with the mosad did you
she turns slowly
where does this fit in the game plan
his enigmatic yet fond smile
oh it doesnt
but one never knows
a quiet wink
you might need it with me
close on gin leaning back at a degree angle
she is sweating
this is hard
hear a slam thwock
pull back to reveal
she is climbing up the inside of the angled a frame ceiling using hand rods with powerful suction cups and similar suction devices on the balls of her feet
a human spider inching up the wall with everything shes got
she slams the next hand rod down and it
as she tumbles eighteen feet to
disappear in an ocean of styrofoam packing bubbles which explode in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator
she has totally vanished
mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits digging her body out with his bare hands
once more she comes up sputtering
this one i will not get
hes holding her in his arms
but you will youll get it all
you are actually
he kisses her
something in the way he looks at her
her return gaze is naked
it looks like love
take the rest of the evening off
and kisses her again
her eyes close
mac sits alone at a table sipping coffee reading barrons
a short wave radio is playing bbc world service
leaning against an open laptop is
he glances up at it
what he sees makes him reach into a duffle at his feet withdraw
a rectangular gun metal gray device
looks like a cross between a remote control clicker and a large cell phone
turns it on
the power display glows green
gin running alone
up the dirt path weve seen before
ahead the crossroads the sign
the lonely phone booth
mac tuning the device which is an advance design scanner
we hear overlapping conversations through bursts of static
told you its not a good time f
either personally ive never liked h
giants pitching once ag
late you want the chronicle or dont y
gin at the phone
inserts her credit card
catches her breath
mac hears a phone ringing over the scanner
punches record plugs the scanner into his laptop
this is oh four six one
hector cruz please on a secure line
macs laptop screen in printing
go ahead please
the line goes dead
so do macs eyes
click the scanner off
gin in her throaty playful voice
no way im telling you shit
baker this is an extremely dangerous g
right now youre more dangerous than he is
her voice is smiling
not her eyes
you want to explain th
if i tell you what this is and where this is youll send back up and those morons will blow my cover and ill be too dead to accept your
a longer beat
youre fucking him arent you
right to the wall
her eyes are stone cold
weve never seen her like this
she looks like mac
youre over your head baker
ill write to him in prison
shes pulling out a different piece of plastic
a drug store phone card
okay its your funeral
next time i see you i owe you a spanking
is that a promise
her cold eyes through his chuckle
while youre on secure do you want a transfer
im headed back to the hot tub
ill call again if im in the mood
and hangs up
collects her thoughts
inserts the phone card
dials from memory
she must be calling mars
a mans voice
in a strange sing song language
gin subtitled mandarin is it over
late night mostly youngsters strolling the unfathomable vastness of the square
at what seems an immeasurable distance the huge illuminated portrait of mao zedong hangs from the gate of heavenly peace
the scale of this place is unique in all the world
pan to a nearby parked
qiu of the peoples liberation army lounges at the wheel in full uniform
talks into his cellular
qiu subtitled mandarin its not over yet it hasnt even begun
he listens winces
we can hear gins voice yelling at him in mandarin dishing out a major piece of her mind
qiu subtitled mandarin after midnight when his meeting ends
he doesnt like her attitude
and theres plenty of it
qiu subtitled mandarin the mask will be ready
a phalanx of troops march past
the colonel turns his face to shadow
drops his voice
qiu subtitled mandarin you fucking bring the bones
the walled compound where the politburos elite work and live
from an open gateway
the minister of finance appears flanked by bodyguards in the drab green of prc police
they step onto the street and turn into a narrow hutong
down the alleyway comes a young man walking his bicycle through shadow
nearing us he raises his right hand and
shoots each bodyguard twice through the chest drops the bike lurches at the minister with something cylindrical and gleaming and
sprays the cowering officials face with something that makes him scream in pain the assassin running down the hutong for his life as a fallen guard
shoots him in the back and he goes sprawling skidding face down
qiu walks beside a jaunty ophthalmologist dr
hongwei who is turning on lights in the darkened office as they go
behind them two pla soldiers half carry the agonized minister
into an examination room
the minister gently set into an examining chair
the doctor tilts the face up shines a light into the ministers eyes which makes him groan
eye drops now which make the man yelp in pain
hongwei now moves the retinal scanner into position resting the ministers chin on the slot provided
turns it on
the machines panel flashes numbers in red lights
hongwei looks into the box from the reverse angle to view
a red laser scan moving across the pupil vertically then retracing its path horizontally left to right right to left up and down at speed
hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of the retina clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the graphic and enlarges the section times
looks like pixels
back to the scanner
touch a button and
a compact disc pops out of the disc drive
he places it in a box telling the minister
hongwei subtitled mandarin we send this to the lab for finer analysis
one piece of advice huh
the minister squints up painfully
hongwei subtitled mandarin no more red pepper in your eye
not for awhile
the doctor laughs
the minister seethes
but colonel qiu
has his mind
close on gins gloved hand holding something we can scarcely see as mist floats up between us
it is a carabiner with a nylon rope attached and she clips it to a thick wire
im freezing my tender parts
pull back to see her in climbing harness scaling a nearly vertical cable three feet in diameter
enveloped in fog which reveals then conceals
im relieved to hear you have some
pull way back to see him below her
the two of them climbing the golden gate bridge
they are near the top more than feet above the silvery black bay
a precarious dizzying sight
whats amazing is that only eleven workers died during construction of this thing
gin grim thanks for sharing
of course the others were saved by a safety net
gin keeps her focus on the small railed platform just above her
a gutsy gal
mac loving it now as for the suicides they always jump facing the city
avoids that tall fence about stories down see it there
shes at the platform
i never liked you
unclips one last time
this wont be easy
throws her rope over the railing and to her surprise mac braces himself with his legs
lifts her from the waist with strong hands boosting her easily to the platform
grateful she hates to confess it
one act of fucking human kindness
call it a lapse
and he swings lightly up beside her
the fog has rolled past
there are several million stars
she slows her breath
and how does this fit into the game pl
oh it doesnt
we came for the view
and from his contoured backpack he pulls a bottle of cristal
flutes wrapped in velvet
he pops the cork in one motion and it sails to its watery doom
she cant help but watch
one more motion to pour both glasses
hands one to her
to ginger baker
he clicks her glass
she stares straight in his eye
shows no surprise no fear
im partial to drummers
if they played with clapton and winwood
and takes a sip
cool as a goose
licks her lips
the prescription bottle
when you stole my suitcase
but hes not drinking
the wind has picked up
armand baker was my husband may to october he played alto sax i was years old
she takes another sip
he named me ginger
he likes drummers too
and you get sentimental for him
every time you order drugs
i have i
in that name
i use it for various things i dont want traced
when credit unions turn their computers my way
i could listen to you lie all night
she toasts him
gin softly same here fella
slowly he reaches to an inside pocket watching to see if she flinches
her eyes do flicker
he withdraws not a pistol but a handful of
do you like diamonds
nine diamonds so large so exquisite she has to keep her eyes from bugging
does the machine
gold is shit
its six thousand dollars a pound
worth your weight in gold
his eyes travel her body
that would put you at seven hundred thousand
would you pay it
and he leans
looks in her eyes
when the light hits you just right
id pay more
she liked that
maybe a lot
that we are stealing
god save japan
he toasts blessed japan to the east
takes a hit
a diamond reactor takes graphite runs it through a combination of lasers electron beams and scanning tunnel mg microscopes
he means this
she is transfixed
this one uses krypton fluorine laser with a new isotope of krypton
she looks down at the diamonds in his palm
his fist closes
the atoms are rearranged
and the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of
he turns his fist upside down
and lets go
she gasps as the brilliant stones fall toward the sea
watching watching long after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated
i hate it
when you make a point
close on two open passports
the names say banquo macduff and isadora duncan
the faces are mac and gin
all right then
pull back to see mac and gin dressed as tropical tourists
she hangs on his arm
we will keep your passports in our safe until jakarta
you are suite
and never been kissed
the steward doesnt get it
gin shrugs sorry
we had booked suite
is our tokugawa suite far superior trust me
a little wary
you luggage is in the room these are your keys the housekeeper will show you t
gin pouting oh
cant we stroll around the port
just a little
the steward checks his watch
id be on board in forty minutes
just to be safe
gin sweet smile better safe
mac and gin stroll down the gangway to the seedy dangerous looking wharf
at the bottom of the gangway
a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests
each stateroom has a peg which can be moved to aboard or ashore
mac moves the peg for
to the aboard position
and off they go
mac in his jump suit piloting the dehaviland dhc across the endless black of the indian ocean
for the moment he seems alone
he means a tiny grouping of lights
way down there against the darkness
he switches on the autopilot
goes back to
gin waiting in her jump suit sitting on a large pack of gear just beside the window of the jump door
next to her a pack that is even larger
no fear in her eyes tonight
are you dumping fuel
changed my mind
theres nothing on the instruments downrange
the longer she flies before she ditches the less chance they notice on the bridge
as she stands he begins to strap the huge pack onto her body
with her chute and the other gear attached the load makes us uneasy
you should lose the oxygen tank at feet
and how do i judge that
he points to an altimeter device on his wrist
it says feet
she cuts him a look
so i just ask you on the way down
or were you planning to e mail me
he pulls out an identical device
strapping it to her wrist
i hate a crybaby
he straps the even larger gear pack to himself
checks the path of the tiny lights far below
then looks in her eyes
mac simply you can do this
not merely reassurance
something connective between them
you are my partner
her eyes send back that personal bond and she nods
i can do this
he pulls on his oxygen mask goggles
she does the same
he opens the door air blasting in
one more look down below and he holds up ten fingers
counts them down nine
she moves to the edge
and on zero she
arches out into the starry void and we go
with her the incomparable rush of freefall straining to see him follow skillfully altering his position to gain on her coming close
she is looking between him and her altimeter as
his oxygen tank falls away and she cuts hers loose the air rushing past her she looks down
the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the freighter
back up to mac as he
pulls his chute it is black and square and jolts him to what seems like a full stop far above her and she yanks her cord but
it doesnt open
she is rocketing down looking back up to see mac make an exaggerated cutting sign across his body and she closes her eyes pulls her secondary chute which
pops open jarring her violently and she gasps with the shock
he is well above her now she isoff course frantically trying to manipulate her trajectory seeing him swooping closer the freighter looms in distance she looks down and suddenly
the sea is rushing at her she fights her braking mechanism shouting at herself
and slams into the water plunging down twisting disoriented cutting her chute loose struggling not to get tangled in a panic to break her light tube which
glows yellow green illuminating the freezing depths she fits it around her head fights now to pull out the small electric fan weve seen before kicking herself toward the surface
fighting against the weight of her gear pack she
flips the switch and the fan becomes a propeller which rockets her upward but she loses her hold on one handgrip tries desperately to hang on with one hand but
pulls free goes shooting off into the blackness without her one instant of terror in her eyes and
mac is there diving at her with his propeller she grasps his legs in a death grip and suddenly they are
at the surface gin gasping for air and he cuts his propeller cradles her body with one strong arm murmuring in her ear
its over its over
her eyes are wild
catch your breath quickly
hang on for the wake
she sees the freighter now a black mountain cutting the sea a huge wake pluming from its bow
she grabs his waist with all shes got
and he kicks the propeller to life they zoom off straight at the towering wake and burst through it racing to the freighters looming hull speeding alongside mac looking up
a series of metal rungs which begin twelve feet above the water line climbing the dizzying height to the freighters deck far above
mac has a kevlar rope with a grappling hook and as he reaches the rungs he
throws it high one of the pronged hooks catching on a rung twenty feet above them
and he lets go of the propeller pulling both of them laden with gear out of the water with sheer brute strength
planting his feet against the outward curve of the hull he climbs with all his strength hand over hand until he finally
grasps the bottom rung
he pulls them up until she can grab on
they hold tight to their rung for a beat
he attaches them both with metal carabiner clips
if i were you id watch the desserts
boy ill bet you were in shape before you got old
too long ago to remember
and pulls himself up to the second rung so that he is standing an the first
offers her his hand
i can take it from here thanks
they begin to climb up the rungs like a tilted backwards ladder re attaching their clips as they go
if youd packed my primary chute right i wouldnt ha
yes you would
youre a girl
they are nearly halfway to the top
looking across the curved hull to
a large circular hatch
thirty feet away
mac pulls from his pack
their suction cup gear
with practiced speed they fasten cups to the balls of their feet take hold of the hand rods with cups attached and mac takes the lead as they begin to
move laterally across the hulls surface toward the hatch
mac is amazingly agile at the arduous process scuttling sideways like a crab across the precariously tilted back hull
gin is deter mined but falls well behind intent on making every suction seal solid one
dark water races by beneath her
by the time she looks up at the hatch
he is gone
anytime youre ready
she looks up sharply
he is above the hatch attached to the hull by the balls of his feet hanging down like a bat
noting her astonishment
that it is
he has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack
its a battery operated air wrench and with a menacing whirr only partially masked by the ships wake he begins to swiftly pop all the rivets around the hatch
gin has pulled out the slender welding tool we saw in the shower and begins cutting through the metal seals around the hatchs rim
at thecrucial moment
you might want to move aside
which she barely does as the hatch door plummets past her to the sea
when she turns back mac is already through the opening and she follows their yellow green headlamps partially revealing
the maximum security hold
weve seen this with carlsby
the fork lift
the shadowy multitude of platforms on their gimbals all swaying in different directions with the plunging of the ship
gin just stands staring everywhere like shes broken into fort knox
the roar of the engines is louder here and he moves close to her to speak beneath it
may i trouble you for the torch
or would you rather just dance
slightly embarrassed at her lack of split second efficiency she tries to find the thing in her gear
after watching her fumble for a bit
i know i packed it
he just reaches in and pulls it out
a small lantern which he flicks on brilliantly illuminating the entire hold
scans the platforms
polnts to a crate wrapped in ply heavy duty plastic membrane
coal into diamonds
a wealth machine
how do you know thats it
mac as if stating the obvious its by by feet
and its the only thing worth waterproofing in case the ship sinks
gin softly you twit
im just finishing your sentence
cant you answer a question with out making me feel stupid
hes heading toward the swaying platforms
why would i bother
he is climbing onto a lower platform easily vaulting up to the magic crate
she follows but it isnt as easy as hes made it look
she has to scramble almost falling
hes already pulled from his gear
six rubber pouches
she hands him her welding tool and he begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate
the plunging ship has the platform really rocking
gin concerned they dont look like flotation bags
mac working fast shit
well then lets forget the whole thing
she stares at him
okay it was a dumb ques
his eyes come up
so fast that her breath stops
he looks plenty angry
lets get one thing straight
i dont work with partners much because basically i find most people to be idiots
you in contrast are first rate
he watches the effect of that play across her eyes
and if think so
maybe you should start thinking the same
now move your ass
and goes back to work
she pauses a beat
then pulls out two lengths of kevlar rope
begins securing their platform to the one above to minimize the amount of sway
as she struggles with this she sees him finish by welding a very small gray box to the top of the crate
when he glances up he sees her staring at the box
sends a scrambled signal by satellite
he touches the device
a light glows red
you could find a golf ball in the gobi desert
jumps down to the floor
where you g
mac walking away fork lift
thats my assignm
mac turning back unless youve got the keys someone has to hot wire it
finish up on the floaters
and heads off toward the fork lift
she looks at the rubber pouches
they seem finished to her
tugs at a couple
on pretty firmly
across the way we hear the fork lift turn its engine over
wont they hear it
over these engines
through five feet of steel
she hurriedly secures the last of her kevlar lines
hell if they do they dont have the second key to get in
he is driving up in the rickety fork lift
weaving around crates and equipment
thank god for redundant security
he hops lightly from the fork lift reaches up and she jumps down into his arms
quickly the switch places gin climbing into the idling fork lift as mac clambers up to unbolt the crates pallet with his air wrench
gin moves the fork lift into position
mac bracing his legs against neighboring cargo using all his strength to hold our crate steady
he is really straining
how many tries do i get
mac with effort one before i beat you senseless dump you over the side and donate your share to charity
she brings the fork up
the crate sways slightly
she lines up her prongs against the pallets receiving holes
you gotta work on that impatient streak
and slips them straight in
gin amazed how professional
she lifts the crate but the boat lurches and she nearly loses it off the fork
but she doesnt
swings her load around now
heading for the open hatchway the roiling sea racing by
picking up speed slightly
thing on the left is the brakes
mac laconic or the thing on the right
by now she is really rolling toward the wide open spaces
he pounces off the platform flying after the lift as it accelerates through the opening
jump for gods sa
tipping at the hatchway lip the crate sliding off the prongs our forklift tumbling out the hatch to the sea just as mac
snatches gin by her hair pulling her free of the falling forklift catching the rim of the hatchway with his free hand gin screaming in fright and pain blindly grabbing
his arm to be
jerked back to safety
clutching mac she watches the sea behind them
where the crate and the forklift disappeared
you did activate the floaters
her head whips around
i did say finish up on the floaters
surely you heard me
flashes before her eyes
as behind the ship
the crate bobs to the surface
we can see the tiny red light on the transponder from here
mac softly oh
guess i did it mself
she whips back and starts pounding at him with her fists
he is laughing so hard he takes a few good shots before he can grasp her wrists
she spits in his face
he strikes back by
kissing her hard
she struggles for a beat
and then she lets him
when they finish he reaches to unzip her jumping suit
all the way
pulls it down gently revealing
her evening gown
a wrinkle free material which slips down across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips
he is unzipping his outfit as well revealing formal wear of his own
he stuffs the suits into his gear pack removing only
her evening bag and shoes
then lifting both packs he
flings them into the black ocean
i wouldnt do that
so he turns
she looks really stunned
i saw our suction things
to where no suction things are lying
gin a mouse so i put em in my pack
his eyes widen
i put em there
to where they are
she tilts her head
gives him a great smile
is he enraged
his dry grin says not hardly
i like a quick study
you can never tell
expansive barely lit deck under a canopy of stars
a silver haired couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone he is humming to barely audible dance music from a distant lounge
she clings to his arm it is romantic
until they reach the railing where he turns and says something quietly in german
pulls her arm away from his
she sneers coldly calls him a name in german and he unloads on her a barrage of german language invective that would melt a tank
she absorbs the abuse without flinching turns toward the rail hawks and
spits over the side
strides away from him
he watches her go
spits over the side himself
and follows her
half a beat
macs head appears above the rail
just where they spit
not a mark on him
our old german couple are dancing wonderfully in each others arms inspiring
pan a dozen really old couples dancing to the three piece filipino ensemble until we come to
gin and mac spinning slowly flawlessly their eyes telling the surrounding geezers that they are very much in love
we close to hear their sweet murmurings
no matter how many stones we make the diamonds are just an appetizer
gin dreamily and the meal
hit by a ton of bricks
oh my g
sensible folks debeers
a world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle
somethings only priceless if its scarce
he whirls her in a tight spin
the geriatic germans can only watch and envy
these guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet just to keep them out of circulation
otherwise you could buy em at the five and dime
watch the old guy stuff they dont have dimestores anym
imagine the chaos we could cause
she is imagining
you said contract
were sort of bounty hunters
gin likes the ring of that
green eyes dance with delight
our machine is worth far more dead
glad to see youre both alive
they look over
the officious steward from this afternoon
now in black tie
when you missed cocktails
i thought of knocking on your door
mac turns gin so that she can send the boob a lazy smile
oh i wish you had
we love having strangers join us
maybe later mac turns her once more so that he faces the flummoxed steward across her bare shoulder
promise you an interesting time
or my names not banquo macduff
our couple moving down the softly lit hallway past the burnished doors of luxury suites
her arms wrapped around one of his their bodies close together
well i would ask what youre doing with the rest of your life
but thats your own bloody affair isnt it
anyway before you get too choked up on the farewell
i feel i owe you a confession
he glances down
time has come to tell you
im actually in
he thinks about this
mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to
the bowsprit a long narrow platform ringed by a flimsy rail it juts far out above a churning sea
the whipping of the wind makes it seem all the more precarious
it only looks dangerous
holds out his hand
you couldnt fall off
unless someone threw you over
gives her the smile
she puts her hand in his and they hop up to the platform
walk its length to the very end
he turns now leans casually against the fragile railing
they are inches apart
for a confession
gin looks down at the plume of wake leaping off the bow
you are actually
she looks up
to his eyes
im not an art dealer
of course not
youre a cop
and tilts his head
just to one side
an insurance investigator for webber assurance your boss is an idiot named hector cruz youve been there four years and ten months youre quite the rising star
gin evenly nope
his head tilts
just a little farther
mac very softly nope
im a thief mac
holds the look
for five years ive used the database of every client webber has to plan my jobs
museums banks jewelers rich people i have floor plans alarm codes passwords the works
his face absolutely neutral
ive made a fortune
its not enough
why wasnt it enough for you
he falls silent
the vermeer that was stolen from hancock tower
that was my job
i scaled the building with electromagnets and parachuted down an air vent
no smile at her lips
after mailing the painting
to where were going next actua
mac quietly we
she looks him up and down
you passed the audition
now he smiles
mac a murmur imagine my relief
i need a partner
for the biggest smartest job
the one you retire off of because nothing else could ever compare with the rush
is such a long time
this is a job that can only be done in one place in one split second in human history
if we miss that instant
and its worth
eight billion dollars
thats eight thousand million how much in shillings
youre not a real trusting guy
and i tried so hard to hide that
its two jobs
the first steals something priceless from the national palace museum in taipei
we dont keep that
we trade it in for our ticket to the show
one moment in time you s
eight days from now
the moment that hong kong is annexed by china
she has his interest
she can see that
dont be so hard on yourself
its your plan you should take at least thirty perc
he thinks this over
or you can swim to taipei
she is not impressed
what are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you cant do with four
hold the record
so much that he leans to kiss her with surprising tenderness
your share is
and one dollar
her hard stare
and then she smiles
still in his arms
i like what you left
in the hold
you didnt even see wha
a lump of coal
a pair of pliers
a note that said squeeze hard
this is the most taken with her that he has ever looked
she leans up and kisses him
ugly section of an ugly town
unmarked warehouses alleyways teeming with food stalls
hear a motorcycle approach and see
gin driving mac sits behind her
going real fast maybe shes showing off we follow them down a blind alley as she smoothly wheels them into
an open freight elevator
she climbs off he doesnt
as gin goes to work the controls mac sees a cat curled in the corner mewing softly
thats madame chiang kaishek shes my bud
an evil streak a mile wide
the elevator jolts to life
they clang upward
mac seems utterly relaxed
gin paces a little hugging herself
her features tense
mac gently tired
she blinks up
he is straddling the bike
smiling at her
i have a lot on my mind
you look beautiful doing it
he seems to mean that
and it seems to melt her a little
she sags against the wall closing her eyes as
they jolt to a stop
she pulls the heavy lever and the door slides noisily open to reveal
a gigantic loft
she flicks on a dim light but we see only part of the cavernous space
she strolls madame chiang trotting along behind
mac follows looking around then down to see
a pile of mail cables packages
the unopened mailing tube we saw in the hancock tower penthouse
he crouches lifts the tube in his hands
you wanna buy a vermeer
rather steal it
been there done that
he nods to himself
he rises to see her framed against the gaping starlit opening of a huge loading door
the twinkling island lies below
but here gin stares down at
an elaborate architectural model
fifteen feet across it features an imposing yellow pagoda roofed building built into the side of a model mountain
formal gardens fountains tiny kuomintang flags
stretching away from the building a large portion of the city with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed
as mac joins her
national palace museum taipei taiwan
repository of four thousand years of chinese culture
he bends to lift up the detachable roof
all the rooms are detailed within down to exhibit cases
works of gold bronze jade onyx pots and scrolls paintings and porcelains and lacquer work
every treasure the kuomintang could loot before the reds took over
beat ever rob the place
if memory serves
she takes him by the hand and leads him toward the gaping doorway walking straight toward it
you need to eat something or are you ready for sex
and just at the edge of it
mac torn the options seem so limited
they jump through the opening
our angle closes on the doorway to see out now sitting like a jewel against the hillside
the national palace museum looking exactly like the model
the town spread out beyond
just as in the model
and now we tilt sharply down to see
a loading platform suspended above the island only a few feet below our opening
like a balcony without a railing
mac and gin already sinking down onto a waiting futon
looks like hes made his pick
among limited options
close on the model museum in early light
propped against it the unrolled vermeer
pinned to the painting a note we cant read
in the b
hear what sounds like the rattling of a subway train which runs a short distance and stops
we tilt angle now to see
through the sunlit opening of the loading door
macs head appears peeking up over the lip
lost in another brief subway rumble
he lightly vaults up through the doorway
looks around no gin
goes to the model
lifts the note pinned to the vermeer
mac reads this lovely parting gift can be yours
if the price is right
not in his cultural database
he looks at the model to see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been lifted away revealing
an underground railway tunnel between the two
mac examines the tiny train the tracks the winding route
from the side walls well above the tracks huge ventilation pipes open onto the tunnel
starting at the museum end they are labeled vent and so on
there are five
the last one shortly before
where a cavernous opening is labeled barracks
tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing rifles in position to shoot at the oncoming train
and as mac studies this curiously
the nearby subway rattles the walls once more
sounds like its in the room somehow
saunters across the loft and we see for the first time the enormity of this space
suddenly the floor ends and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto
a spacious hangar outfitted with feet of railway track at the far end of which sits a full sited train car exactly like the one in the model
and just below us
gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal eighteen feet above the track
she holds a remote control device which she uses to rev the trains engine far down the line
she looks really tense
she startles slightly
shuts off the trains engine
as she looks up to him now the silence is noticeable
he crouches down only a foot or so above her
quite a parting gift
i would have settled for roses
its a joke
you know a joke
people who have a sense of humor make them
youre rich go buy an american have him fill you in on the culture
well that is a joke
he leans down
strokes her hair very gently
mac murmurs relax
its only eight billion dollars
she looks up into his eyes
but she cant smile
mac softly your vermeer
i like this view of delft better than the larger one
the sky is more emotionally rendered
staring in his eyes
and just as softly back
when a sky is that
he holds the look
very strong and very gentle
is it easier now
not pretending youre an innocent
not pretending you
effortlessly he hops down to join her
never losing eye contact
heres a tip from an old timer
never forget who you are
settles next to her
it gives you someone to be
when you stop pretending
she nods slowly
her eyes moving over his face
maybe more feelings going through her than she can sort out
mac still soft so
our train runs from the museum through an underground tunnel
to a mountain
because the museum displays relics at any given moment
but there are times that many stored in the mountain
which is why its guarded
by an army
she is unfastening the small pack at her feet
the train shuttles relics to and from storage
it looks exactly like that
so mac looks down the line
at the train car
ive been down the air ducts four times
the train always has two armed guards
always travels between and miles per hour
relics dont like to be jostled too much
mac all business now your model has five vents
we go down the first
back up the third if youre lucky
if not we have to get out by the fourth
mac simply then we will
she pulls from the pack four thick discs each about eight inches in diameter each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop
she starts to put two of them on
electromagnets incredibly powerful
this switch is on off
he gestures at the train the track the hangar
seems like overkill
for one simple jump
well its an eight billion dollar jump
you miss the train
youve missed the train
flicks on her remote
down the track the engine revs
weve got five days to grab the bones trade them for the scan and pull our billion out of hong kong
once midnight passes on july st
weve missed the train yeh
have i neglected to fill in the details
which i learned from the master
wish me luck
clicks the remote the train leap forward mph never seemed so fast
she has a split second to leap down the train sails beneath her gins feet graze the back end of the platform at the rear of the car she swipes
desperately with the magnets cant connect and is thrown into a roll along the side of the tracks
shes up on her knees watching the train slam into the massive blue pads at the end of the track
she is bruised shaken but most of all really worried and really pissed
mac quietly jump sooner
she pulls out the remote
be my fucking guest
the train rockets backward straight past where she kneels to brake at the start of the track once more
she nods up to mac who is strapping on his magnets
he crouches nods ready
and the train
blasts toward him he counts jumps and slams onto the roof of the train which plows into the heavy padding flinging him twenty feet like a rag doll to land
in a heap
he lies still
then blinks surprised hes alive
hears a rich whiskey laughter down the track
im too old for this shit
and as he pulls himself up
she is staring at him from her knees
know a dude named wiley coyote
with what can only be described as love
gin softly forget it
aerial view down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the museum the formal gardens the fountains the tree lined driveway
close now as a cab pulls up a couple emerges
she is first
chanel suit with an extremely short skirt revealing endless legs
she helps him from the taxi a white haired geezer who seems well past fumbling with his walking stick and making quick erratic bird like glances in every direction
she takes his arm for support
murmurs in his ear
isnt it easier now
gives him a full tongue kiss in the ear which has bystanders noticing
starts to help him up the stairs still whispering close
five years you wont need make up
in answer he grabs her ass and she yelps with delight attract ing attention all around
his turn to whisper as he massages her backside
i can do it with legs
gives the long legs a dubious twice over
id lose the underwear
mac leaning on her arm as they pass case after case
bronzes jades lacquer work
every object exquisite priceless
the oracle bones date back to the shang dynasty years ago
they are writings
carved into ox bones tortoise shells
she cuddles close to him
they approach a tour group the female guide speaking in four european languages
the oldest chinese writing any where the first proof of chinese civilization
what makes this one so valuable
he stops drowned out by the tour guide rhapsodizing over an urn
butts into her rap
mac subtitled italian except its chien lung mimicking sung period
the color is far too delicate
the woman gets real insulted
apparently hes right
mac subtitled german its all right you have a nice body
and walks on
confides to gin
when youre old you can do anything grabs her bottom once more altering her voice slightly on
there we are
a separate display room
a single steel pedestal
under the smart glass security case one single object
it is a fragile yellowed fragment of bone
the shoulder blade of an ox
covered with tiny script
last year ancient artifacts were discovered in the gulf of mexico
an olmec civilization years old
no tourists in the display room
a velvet rope is up
three guards mill at the entrance
this exhibit is off limits
amazingly markings on these olmec figures were identified as shang dynasty writing
a sign explains sorrowful to inform oracal bone close for travel this particular bone is price less because it is the one that establishes the link proves that american civilizations
descend from chinese ancestors
she is pulling out her coin purse as they stand by the rope
unzipping it slowly
exactly the kind of propaganda shit they eat up in beijing
the mainland would pay anything to get its paws on th
as her shaking elderly companion spasms knocking the purse out of her hand it clatters to the floor sending a hundred coins rolling in all directions
some under the rope
mac old guy voice and collapses to the hardwood floor in search of the coins howling as he bangs his knees
some bystanders hurry to help
and one of the guards
as mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue coins
the guard stops him with a firm hand pointing at the pidgen english sign
meanwhile calmly very slowly
gin crouches down to retrieve coins the short skirt riding recklessly high on her upper thighs
the two remaining guards hurry to help her
macs guard bystanders all transfixed by the marginal preservation of her modesty
noticing the eye lines all around she confides to the nearest guard
gin in mandarin helpful those are the coins
these are my legs
unnoticed mac is banging his wristwatch which seems to have broken
close on him now manipulating a glide point device on the side of the watch and we rack focus to see
inside the rope
as mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere he guides the coins slide slowly inexorably to
attach itself magnetically
to the steel pedestal
beneath the bones case
as it does macs watch beeps slightly as we close on it to see
data flickering across its face
mac old guy voice amanda
time for my pills
gin and mac at a long communal table ignored by taiwanese couples families businessmen chattering loudly all around them
gin looking down at her bowl shes barely touched her meal
no i dont think that way
mac is eating heartily happily
and i suppose you do
sure all the time
stuffs his mouth full
talking around it
shes studying him as he eats
since hes not looking at her gins eyes are thoughtful appraising
you could never see yourself
you know quitting the game
and he looks up
direct to her eyes
a dead straight heart stopping look
before the wonderful smile
this is so sudden
she cuts him a hard look
late afternoon the place has closed
four armed guards accompanied by a museum official push a large dolly across the hardwood floor heels clicking wheels rumbling softly into
the room weve seen
the dolly stops by the display case of the priceless oracle bone
the four guards position themselves around the triple paned bulletproof case
it will be a bitch to lift
the official has a key
he inserts this into the lock of the titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal
and as it clicks we
macs arm rising with noodle laden chopsticks the wristwatch beeping softly
he drops the chopsticks rising in one fluid motion as gin does the same throwing some bills on the table he leads her
out the door into the street step off the curb turn drop flat on his back slide down the gutter gin following a split second behind
a train car stands pulled up to a loading dock
two soldiers with assault rifles on the trains rear platform waiting
along one side of the tracks a gravel roadway
an open air jeep type military vehicle stands empty
one of our soldiers speaks into a walkie talkie watching a huge steel door at the entrance to the loading dock which
through it come the four armed museum guards surrounding the dolly which carries the bones massive bulletproof display case
the official is with them and hands paperwork to one of the waiting soldiers as the museum guards lift the case and carry it onto the train
an empty stretch of dimly lit track somewhere down the line
pan up way up to
the shadows of a huge air vent
must be vent because two figures are crouched there as close as lovers
even we can barely make them out until we close to hear the hushed
gin strapping on a backpack way we can use those in here
i thought i was in charge of this operat
youre in charge of ego and worrying
im in charge of keeping you alive
he is holding something dull gray and small
it looks like a trun cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt
these are plasma jet
all the force is directed forward instead of dissipating in a sphere like a grenade
he has four of these
gives her three
i dont need th
mac whispers shut up
he reaches out gently
you dont trust me you wont get through this
touches her face
try to adjust to that for three more days
stares in her eyes
youll never have to trust again
one more whisper
to look forward to
the museum guards are back on the landing with the official
our two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train car as
the train rumbles to life
ready to go
two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty pedestal which once supported the bones case
one tilts the top of the pedestal back supporting its weight as the other stoops to lift the base and
he sees the coin
oddly flat against the pedestals shaft
he kneels tries to lift the coin but the magnet holds it fast
he looks up to his companion
peels the coin free the other guard reaches for it the first guard yanks it away and it flies from his hand into the wall and drops
as the guards go to look the coins back has come away
an alarm shrieks at a deafening level
five museum guards burst through the doorway leap from the landing pile into the jeep and blast off down the gravel roadway after the departed train
a much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel facing back the opposite way
the alarm screams here too and massive steel doors clang open as soldiers with assault rifles swarm out onto the landing taking up sharpshooter positions weapons pointing back up the
mac and gin crouched in the vent high above the track gas masks dangle around their necks magnet paddles from their wrists various objects from their belt loops
the alarm echoes absolutely ear splitting
she leans to shout in his ear
above the siren we can now hear the train coming
the train louder closer the alarm blaring
i can do this
straight in her eyes
the train roars into view flashes beneath them as he grabs her wrist and
jumps hurtling down both striking the empty rear platform gin slipping off but he holds her fast swiping with his magnet which
clanks hard locks solid
he pulls her onto the platform she looks dazed clinging to him he tugs her gas mask into place slips on his own and
fits a magnetic device from his belt loop onto the door lock spins a dial on the device which pops the lack open mac bursting
through the door lobbing a gas grenade at the startled guards who try to whirl and fire through the fog of red smoke two wild shots above the rolling mac
and they are felled by the gas where they stand
gin races in falling on her butt as the car rocks along the track
points out the window
gin through mask scrambling to her feet mac wheeling toward the bone
gin through mask he throws a handful of coins at the glass case and purple uv beams arc from the glass to fry the coins in midair
mac pulls a dull rectangle the size of a cigar box from gins backpack as we smash cut to
the jeep blasting after the train at crazy speed the four non drivers with weapons at the ready
troops fill the platform and have spilled onto the tracks enough weapons to dust butch and sundance
mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized oscilloscope with countless knobs and a screen which displays wave patterns
the machine is emitting shrill whistling tones that cut through even the siren
gin through mask mac spins the dials and two overhead light bulbs blow
the glass case housing a fire ax shatters
the bones case is untouched
smash cut to
with the jeep bombing around a curve to see the train at last
we open fire accelerating after the train with everything weve got gravel flying like shrapnel and up ahead
the trains windows blow out the tunnel showered with glass fragments
mac juicing the box the deafening tone competing with the sirens the gunshots gin shrieking as she points through a blasted out window
gin through mask and the bones case explodes gin whirling away to protect her face as we smash cut to
the jeep now alongside the rear platform of the train
the driver fighting to hold it steady as
the guards begin to clamber over the side grasping for the platforms rails one goes down screaming onto the tracks but two make it then a third they burst
into the train to see
two groggy half conscious soldiers
discarded gas masks oscilloscope
and inside the shattered case
a chicken bone
the pack rat strikes again
mac and gin flattened to the side of the train above the window line held fast by their magnets
we are on the opposite side from the gravel path so the train screens us from the jeep
shouting above the din
up ahead an air vent looms we are hurtling toward it
mac and gin each free one hand reach into their backpacks for
twin grapnel guns which look like big mm pistols but with a blunt round end
as we streak toward the vent gin lifts her gun shoots at it a cable attached projectile exploding toward the target opening in mid flight to a three pronged hook
falls just short the hook tumbling to clang on the tracks as mac
fires his the projectile exploding the hook opening and
bites into the wall only four feet from the vent its cable stretching back to the gun in macs hand were almost there and mac slips the pistol
into gins free hand
their eyes meet
he sees her hesitate to abandon him
they flash past the vent mac releases her magnet gins freed hand grasping to join the other at the pistol as she
rockets up catapulted back toward the vent by the retractable cable as a rifle appears from a window beneath us taking aim at gin and mac
kicks it off line the shot booming the guard almost dropping the weapon then swinging it back up slamming the muzzle directly into macs groin as mac
grasps the barrel yanking it up slips the shot screaming past his head pulling the guard half out the window to kick his face sending him down to the tracks
as we careen around a curve seeing in distance now
the end of the line the massive barracks landing the phalanx of troops the fifth and final air vent midway between us
macs free hand pulls out
the lone plasma grenade he kept for himself and as we careen toward the troops mac heaves the grenade uptrack and it
explodes in a horrifying fireball which rips up the train tracks collapsing a section of tunnel wall onto the gravel path a choking cloud of yellow smoke filling the tunnel
obscuring everything our train rocketing
toward the flames nearly at the metal support beam which runs vertically up to the final air vent and as the train flashes past it mac
lunges out slamming both magnets onto the support beam the momentum flattening his body fully horizontal like a flag on a pole the train plunging on without him as guards
shoot blindly back from the windows the jeep plowing full tilt into the rubble of tunnel wall the train
derailing in a terrifying crush of twisted metal screams shouts the smoke and flame everywhere and we snap to
the soldiers pov from the landing scattering as the derailed train hurtles at them into them chaos until at last they see
above the clearing smoke near the tunnel ceiling
mac climbing deftly up the support beam magnets clanking hand over hand nearly at the vent and the shouting troops
open fire bullets chewing up the tunnel wall as we smash cut silence
cluttered dimly lit storage room
boxes of shoes reach to the ceiling gucci bruno magli the good stuff
a young salesman tailored attractive
he goes right to the shelf he needs
opens a box
takes it and two others
as his steps recede we pan up to
the mesh grating which soundlessly
gin drops lightly twelve feet to the floor
filthy from her adventure she quickly unzips her backpack to remove
a sleek halliburton case
the oracle bone undamaged in its cushioned setting
steps returning she is
out of her jumpsuit in a heartbeat revealing a costly slip of a dress kicks the jump suit under the bottom shelf as
the young salesman appears to find her peeking into a shoe box
he is startled
she scowls at him rubbing the grime from her face
gin subtitled mandarin there you are
do you know how filthy this place is
shows her dirty fingers as proof
salesman subtitled mandarin madam no one is supp
gin subtitled mandarin im looking for dress pumps ill need eight pairs
gin subtitled mandarin unless youre too busy to help me
salesman subtitled mandarin well no i
gin subtitled mandarin come to think of it i need some dresses for evening
lifts the halliburton case slings her pack over her shoulder strides to the doorway
see the crowded upscale boutique
gin subtitled mandarin are you coming
out she goes
and he follows
maybe hes on commission
mac very much alive somewhat the worse for wear crawling through a darkened pipe on his belly toward
light filters through
reaching the screen he squints through it
cant see shit
nothing that rises above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct
he grasps the wires pushes and
falls straight through tumbling ten feet to crash land in a heap
hear feminine screams before we look up to
three young women trying on lingerie being attended by an older saleswoman
the girls are half naked and as mac rises one throws a red lace teddy in his face
he peels it off and still holding the garment calmly tells the saleswoman
mac subtitled mandarin its all right the security cameras behind the mirrors are working again
at which the customers shriek cover themselves all the more and begin screaming at the poor saleswoman
mac subtitled mandarin well
if everything is in order
all four women
look at him
close on an entrance just as mac comes
flying through propelled by two sizeable security guards once again landing in pieces
its a long day
as mac clears his head they stand at the doorway with folded arms
hoping he wants some more
the bruisers look at each other
no habla espanol
a super tugboat engines rumbling ready to pull out
a woman paces the deck
every time we see her she seems more tightly wrapped
here he comes stepping briskly from the taxi striding up the gangway pulling from inside his coat
the red lace teddy
he drapes it over her face and she pulls it away steps into his arms
her kiss is urgent
hold on the look in her eyes
what is she thinking
he strokes her hair gently
then goes to look into the halliburton case which stands by the rail
as he crouches
as he looks at the bone
she is watching him
an intensity to her gaze
more feeling than she is comfortable with which
disappears completely as he turns to her
and when he mimes flinging the case into the sea
close on a british petroleum billboard with a huge digital clock counting down by seconds
day pan to an aerial view of

close on the square now
a couple at a sidewalk vendor
mac is purchasing a t shirt
gin dutifully lifts her arms and mac slips the garment over her head
it says china got hong kong and all i he regards her thoughtfully and she turns modeling for him as if wearing a givenchy original
he approves lifts the halliburton case and they move on strolling chatting until mac
bumps hard into a chinese soldier both men reeling with the impact
the soldier carries an identical halliburton case and the two men set their cases down side by side as mac steps forward
mac subtitled mandarin no one notices no one cares
gin tugs on macs arm dont get involved dear
mac reluctantly steps back
the soldier glares at him
then bends and picks up
a parting epithet in mandarin and the soldier starts off
watching him mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed
pistol ready for action
but keeps watching as within a few yards the soldier
opens the case
checks out the oracle bone right there in the middle of the square
mac and gin watching across the distance with hair trigger keenness
at last the soldier closes the case
walks back to us
soldier subtitled mandarin i believe i took your case
handing it to mac he leans forward and in low aecented english
old peak road
picks up his own case
and is gone
a vintage aston martin pulls up to a spectacular gated mansion
sparkling white it is a blend of edwardian and regency
gin is driving speaks into the voice box and the gate swings open
as they pull up the crushed rock driveway
a butler appears as british as the architecture
climbing from the car mac has the halliburton case
will you please come this way
and leads them around the side of the house
they walk slowly a distance behind the butler taking everything in
i like this
his voice is strong calm
no hint of a smile
you like wha
not being told what the fuck were doing
she looks equally serious
just more tense
youre on a need to know basis
youll get each step in time to execute i thought you agreed to those condit
mac quietly i like your not trusting me
because it frees me to do the same
they come upon the spacious grounds behind the mansion
a breathtaking view down the slope of victoria peak to hong kong and the harbor
kowloon across the water
i trust you
i only need to
remain in control
they pass a towering row of perfect rosebushes
mac snaps off a giant blossom
which is a sign of weakness
and hands it to her
their eyes meet
i like that too
at the edge of the garden above the commanding view a luncheon table has been set
spread with delcacies
two servants attend also british
only the host is seated
he does not rise
qiu glances up from his meal
green pla uniform absurdly decorated wraparound gautier sunglasses
we recognize him as the man who took gins call in his mercedes in tienanmen square
the man who accompanied the poor minister of finance to the ophthal mologist
you look lovely ginger
is the rose for me
and leans prettily
to fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel
qiu lai chuen this is andrew macdougal
hearing his real name mac cuts her a look
real names here darling
the colonel and i have every incentive to keep each others secrets
and she sits
close to qiu
mac looks around at the property the view
like the place andy
macdougal will do
the colonel smiles
like an alligator
mac notices that the tablecloth is actually
a union jack
he fingers the flag
doesnt matter if we spill
my sentiments exactly
this place was a gift
from its former owner
a brit whose business will now happily continue to function
mac spreading his napkin planning to spend much time here
tho it has required many sacrifices
the colonel has divorced his wife
to facilitate the necessary entertaining of western women
tho some are more entertaining than others
and runs the back of his knuckles up the length of gins bare arm
you are touching the woman i love
which brings qius eyes over
from time to time
and pulls up the halliburton case
handing it across the table
as qiu takes the case in his lap opens it
youre a scot
would you like some year old macallan
sure ill take a case
qiu glances across the lawn to the butler who stands behind the bar trolley
as the drinks are prepared the colonel studies the bone
the colonel told his minister of culture that he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from taiwan
how much was the minister told the raid would cost
qiu not looking up counting equipment personnel bribes an even fifty million american
which you can now keep
the drinks arrive
he would have paid twice that
but my needs are modest
and lifts from beneath the table a leather pouch
the woman you love
from time to time
drops it into gins lap
she opens the pouch to reveal
like one would wear in a tanning salon
only these are flesh colored with one small hole in the center of each lens
slightly larger than the size of a pupil
she slips them on
a bright smile
how do i look honey
and mac smiles
like a woman
glass doors open wide to a terrace which overlooks kowloon the harbor hong kong island beyond
more lights than stars in heaven
and speaking of heaven
the sounds of lovemaking are fierce feral an urgent rhythm part comic part wondrous and mostly arousing enough to make us lovemaking in silhouette
this is the lovemaking of tigers mesmerizing to watch ferocious enough to inspire envy and somehow
to suggest real love
mac and gin sit before the open terrace
there is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them
she has her pack drawn near
and qius leather pouch
she removes the goggles
this is the moment
in the hong kong and shanghai bank building
is a room with two computers
one for you
and one for me
glad i have a function here
the room is a vault on the th floor
access codes to that room are changed daily computer pass words on the hour but but
she is electric more alive than hes ever seen her
four men in the world dont need codes
their retinas will scan to unlock everything
one of these is chinas minister of finance
she lifts the goggles
and his retinal plate is in there
our trade for the great train robbery
all right lets say were in the door
from her pack she pulls a slender black rectangle
opens it to reveal a shiny metallic disc
hong kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks
in hundreds of separate accounts
holds up the metallic disc
this cd rom is programmed to send instantaneously thousands of instruc tions with all necessary confirmation codes to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts
two or three million at a crack in odd numbers
total eight billion
and youve set up a laundry
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches austria uruguay antigua the channel islands the caymans
mac quietly seychelles
gin beat i left that out
as soon as each deposit lands somewhere its shot somewhere else til the mafia couldnt find it
but those first instructions transferring the billion dollars
theyre recorded in the main computer
she waggles the disc
the cd instructs the computer to erase the real transactions
and replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded xj
little homage to limeyland there
the accounts wont reconcile
she waggles the disc
the cd instructs the computer to over report all account totals forever in the exact amounts weve lifted
so the chinese think the moneys still there
on this one
he has to smile
sure the foreign banks know they sent out some money
but they think hong kong knows it too
and since were leaving plenty in every account
the shit doesnt splatter
until the first account runs dry
and then comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing
i was hoping thered be one
he settles back
looks at her
admit it so far youre blown away
it does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship
and his fingers reach out
pity it will be over
touch her hair
a raw moment
bet you say that
to all the one night stands
but hes just staring in her eyes
the look pins her
she cant wriggle off
he leans to her
only the best of them
close on the british petroleum billboard where the countdown clock says
days hours minutes the square is beyond bedlam
times square looks deserted new years eve compared to this carnival crush of humanity rock and rolling as if reunion with china was the doorway to paradise
singing chanting screaming dancing music and booze everywhere firecrackers exploding soldiers and civilians tycoons and hookers tourists and peddlers and party members and homeless going absolutely nuts
could be the last party
whip pan to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass and steel headquarters of the hong kong and shanghai bank
zoom to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear gin with a large beaded shoulder bag
mac presents an invitation to a pla soldier who admits them into
a vip party going full blast in the lobby of this truly breathtaking structure
a central atrium rises floors creating a soaring clear core around which the offices and working spaces are ringed
the view straight up is interrupted only at three well spaced levels where thick canopies of glass stitched together with spidery skeletons of steel span the open core
mac looks up
at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium the revelers have been granted access to the lower five floors
above these all is empty
nice of the colonel to provide an invitation
she is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors doeuvre stations
half the celebrants seem to be armed pla soldiers many with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders
well i promised him a bonus
comes out of your share
long as i dont have to have sex with him
mac loads up on six hors doeuvres piling them on a napkin as she takes two flutes of champagne
they step away from the mob toward a potted plant near the wall and mac
drops his snacks with a splat
bending to clean the mess he slips from his waistband a flat circuit board with a bank logo and a three pronged plug
in a single motion he plugs it into a socket concealed by the pot scoops up his canapes and we cut to
three security officers blink as all fifty monitor screens go haywire at once
the images compressed to a blur of lines between a series of diagonal slack bars that slash across the screens
the way your tv acts when the horizontal hold goes out
they cant believe it
stumped they start slamming buttons flipping switches jabbering to each other
now the images begin to roll vertically as if in response to their attempts at adjustment
welcome to the world of high tech
mac and gin wait with a party of older brits whove had plenty to drink and are carrying more
two armed soldiers flank the elevators
a car arrives
as the brits enter
mac politely well take the next one
mac smiles at a soldier
mac subtitled mandarin what time tomorrow do the tanks roll in
the guy laughs
an elevator arrives
gin sipping champagne as they enter
the doors close
they are alone
the panel has floors through lit
the other numbers and are dark
there are no numbers
mac pulls from his pocket a small flat device not much thicker than a credit card with a window and a series of led lights on its face
he fits it into a slot beside a black glass plate on the elevator panel
immediately the leds scramble all red numbers flash across the cards window as the device begins to lock on the elevator code
in sequence the leds turn green and
the glass plate lights announcing in kanji and english
acces granted to floors
mac presses the lit number
the elevator rises
he looks over at her
she is tight enough to snap
we can feel her heart racing from here
so all that time sitting at your computers
all the research the access codes your job allowed you to steal floor plans schematics
setting up all your bank accounts
she looks irritated
he is smiling gently
years of work comes down to
checks his watch six minutes
dont be nervous
easy come easy go
she looks away
the elevator stops
your share probly works out to what
dollar and a quarter an hour
the door opens
she is pissed off
whats your point
mac very real that i like you ginger
now theyre staring at each other
an open elevator door
an empty dim hallway
they see only each other
the dedication the skill the guts
he holds out the crook of his arm
as a gentleman escorts a lady
im going to see you get everything you deserve
her eyes flicker on that
so he grins
if you cant have fun right now
youre in the wrong business
she looks in his eyes
her body seems to relax just a little
she takes his arm
close on a keypad
next to it a mirrored plate with two apertures set apart the distance of human eyes
gins goggled face drops into frame reflected in the mirrored surface
she fits her eyes to the apertures
gin whispers open
a red scanning light appears
and from somewhere
a soft click
pull back now to see
they stand at what seems the door to a bank vault
round gigantic heavy steel
mac reaches to grasp the handle and
the door swings open
they stare at the inner sanctum
a windowless room
dim eerie fluorescence
a blast of white noise from the elaborate air cooling system
two large mainframe computers face each other from opposite walls desks and work stations with pc monitors filling the space between
as mac closes the vault door behind them
gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe
pulls the high resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm
the screensaver displays guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish
she hits a key
the screen saver replaced by welcome
authorization mode please
two boxes for password and scan
she hits scan
a plastic shield rises revealing
the mirrored plate the tiny apertures
gin leans to fit her goggled eyes in place
the red scanning light
and the monitor announces
welcome minister feihong
gin takes off the goggles and
throws them across the room to mac at the larger mainframe
as he repeats the scanning process gin is loading the precious cd rom into her mainframes driver
watches the screen
and youve got
two minutes fifty seconds
with mac now
typing the words control panel
the screen now shows icons for time setting and he clicks his mouse to create a clock in the center of the screen labeled local time and reading changing with
each second that passes
so lets see
across town at the british consulate
frenzied activity in a large war room filled with computers wall screens every worker functioning at top speed
continue to hear mac over this
everyone is working frantically to complete transactions before they go off line at midnight
cut back to mac in the vault
he clicks his mouse to create a clock at the left of the screen labeled british terminal time
it is of course showing the same time as the local clock
then deep in the high tech bowels of the bank of china building just across the square
an even larger war room even better staffed and equipped
staring at blank monitors and wall screens
the chinese are sitting on their thumbs waiting to come on line at midnight
cut back to mac in the vault
he clicks his mouse to create another clock at the right of the screen labeled china terminal time
shows the same time as the other clocks
i feel for these boys
lets give them a breather hmmn
clicks the mouse and the british terminal time begins flashing
well let the brits go off line seconds early
as the flashing clock reaches and mac hits the key four times advancing the british clock to seconds four seconds later than the others
and well give our new chinese overlords extra seconds of rest before they have to go on line
as the local and chinese clocks reach seconds mac hits the key four times regressing the chinese clock back to seconds
we watch all three clocks clicking down the last moments of british rule
the british clock is seconds fast the chinese clock seconds slow
playing god here ginger
weve created seconds that do not exist anywhere but in this room
one minute to midnight
seconds where no one is on line but your little cd rom
he turns around
her eyes are waiting
across the room
and when eventually everyone discovers what transaction xj was really about
china will think it happened before midnight
britain will swear it happened after midnight
theyll each be positive
the other guy
this is a sad thing
liable to be an ugly international incident
she squints across at his clock
britain off line in seconds
his smile returns
bittersweet and real
the look holds
he turns back to his screen
she lingers on him for an instant
then back to the mainframe finger poised above her enter key
britain goes bye bye in
the british consulate
all screens go dark
a logo appears of a popping champagne bottle whose spray forms a union jack twined with a prc flag everyone shouts cheers or curses and we smash cut
back to gin
striking enter the screen flashing transactions xj gin softly jesus god its going through
mac watching his clocks hong kong midnight happy new year
except at china bank
gin to her screen cmon cmon
her screen flashes transactions xj completed hear her shriek of ecstasy as we
bank of china where dark screens suddenly light with the same stupid party logo
only nobody cheers
they just get to work
back to the vault
feel like a nightcap
but across the way gin is jamming a button
the cd wont come out of the driver
we have a problem
relax dont jam it
gin jamming it he crosses the room
shes rummaging on a nearby desk finds a dont panic now theres no rush
we cant leave it in there its got all our accounts everything that can nail us to a goddam shes fitting the letter opener into the narrow slot above the
lid of the driver
easy with that theres no ru
every siren in the skyscraper is shrieking lights are flashing crimson gins screen says security breach in a selection of languages
gin just staring at it
theres a rush
the sirens are ear splitting
we know that elsewhere in this building all hell must be breaking loose
gin is yanking macs arm out of the socket
is still in there
she stares at it
we cant help it we
he stares at her
in one motion he snatches a stapler from the desk and smashes the driver with all his strength
it pops open
calmly he plucks her cd from the tray
she mouths a barely audible
what a guy
but just as shes about to bolt
he holds up one hand
slips another cd from his pocket
we see the words kenny g
was wondering where to leave this
pops it in the drive
slams it shut
mac quietly time to go
mac and gin running full tilt through the siren blare turning a corner to see ahead
the balcony railing the buildings empty central core
mac bolts straight toward it gin sprinting to follow lungs pounding they reach the railing looking down to see
hysteria unimaginable chaos
soldiers black tie partygoers scrambling in all directions looking to his left mac sees
the bank of elevators soldiers pouring in some cars already rising fourth floor fifth
now he looks directly below where
soldiers are pounding up the metal service staircase the front rank almost at the third floor
in the lobby some faces look up to see us but no one is shooting
they dont know were the bad guys
he plunges his hand into her shoulder bag
time they find out
pulls out two plasma grenades and flings one toward the elevator cables three floors down and it
explodes in a horrifying fireball causing pandemonium in the lobby below the elevator cables blown away cars plunging the yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below and
mac hurls the second grenade
straight down and the fireball wipes out the staircase a huge section of ninth floor landing raining down on the lobby
how do we get down
i never liked down
grabs her hand and they race to the staircase as smoke billows everywhere below
up they go two stairs at a time the lowest glass and spiderweb steel canopy is three floors above us the cacophany of shouts below is like an amplified insane
he is dragging her now up up bullets are flying blind through the smoke chewing up metal and glass all around us up up and as the smoke at last
clears they have reached
the canopy floor
they can see the army down below
clutching her hand mac leads her over the railing onto the canopy itself and together they run
straight across the heavy glass toward the far side of the building like space walking above the throng feet below bullets now tracing their path from beneath slamming off the
underside of the bulletproof canopy gin shrieking with fright as they go
we see ahead
three executive elevators beginning to climb the far wall
these are glass enclosed tubes all filled with soldiers the car in the lead already at the tenth floor
mac keeps running straight toward them
gin out of breath mac not they make it to the edge of the canopy the lead elevator only two floors below them
we can see the soldiers through the glass
mac grasps her hand and as the car nears our level
you can do this
they leap across five feet of open air to
land squarely on the cars metal roof mac wrapping his free arm around the cable and up we go
the ant colony below us receding fast
gin is hanging onto the cable petrified
mac is looking up toward the roof
okay now what
mac absently shut up
youre on a need to know basis
mac im sorry
he looks at her
just now she seems more miserable than afraid
turns out im a screw up
he doesnt smile
passing the third canopy
something to be said for being self aware
looks back up
forty first floor
six to go
may i have the last grenade dear
its about to rain
so he reaches into her bag pulls out the grenade and throws it
the roof above them explodes in a fireball and shields her body against the wall of their shaft as a huge section of roof comes raining down
we watch as it
crashes through the upper canopy tons of roof and glass plunging to
blast through the middle canopy everyone below scrambling for shelter as the whole shebang
explodes through the lowest canopy
gin can only gape at the incredible display
mouthing a silent wow
theyve passed the second canopy thirty sixth floor
the other two elevators maybe five floors below us
you see banking will be more democratic under china
she looks to him
no more glass ceiling
the elevator car has stopped
we are at the roof
the soldiers are in the car beneath our feet nowhere to get out
above our heads
the last few feet of elevator cable
and starry sky where our patch of roof used to be
the night air
he begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable
at the top he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof grabs it lunges with his free hand and
dangling floors he pulls himself up swings onto the roof
reaches back down
she is only twelve feet below him
frozen with fear
i cant do this
if i say so
she stares up at his eyes
if you stay
youll have to pay for the damage
she looks down at the mess below
and starts to climb the cable
not so easy in a ball gown but the adrenaline is pumping
gets to the top
heres the hard part
one hand reaches out
she lets go
and she is dangling in space
now that split
did we say
and with all his strength hauls her up onto
two thirds of it remain
at the far edge a gigantic maintenance crane itself two stories high
but between here and the crane
big and beautiful and empty
she looks like shes seen god
mac starts to jog toward it she runs to follow but sees him go
straight past the chopper
he turns back
she points to the copter
its over here
got the keys
i thought you could
hot wire stuff
they fix those things so you cant steal them
and keeps walking
toward the monster crane
these theyre not so worried
moving fast he points off to his right
her eyes follow a long cable leading from the arm of the crane across the roof attaching by a huge hook to a massive wrecking ball
go grab that hook
he reaches the cranes cab
turns back to see she hasnt moved
let me rephrase that
run and grab that hook
or die got it
she takes off running
he hops in the cab
pushes the start button
it rumbles to life
tests some levers
he turns to see that hes tightened the cable pulling her ball six feet in the air
she clings to the hook with a true death grip
he lowers her ball to the roof
getting the hang of it
this only works if you shut your eyes
which makes her eyes bug out
youre not gonna lower me over the side
of course not
now close baby eyes
she wont suit yourself
he throws a lever and the cranes arm begins to swing in a circle finally taking the ball with it and as she screams mac
pounces out of the cab racing along the edge of the roof not toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical gin in a widening arc but toward the point
where he thinks the ball will clear the edge and just as it does he
leaps aboard throwing one arm around the hook the other around her and they go
over the side whooshing down in a gigantic every increasing loop as the endless steel cable unwinds from its huge drum like a fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale
the ride no theme park could insure swooping out across the skyline dropping like an anvil as the cable unspools hundreds of feet nothing but nothing for miles below them
gin grabbing a breath to shriek her guts out as the monstrous pendulum reaches its max begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless instant
let go now
he yanks her loose and they drop
the ball swings off lnto space to some unknown mayhem
clutching mac gin looks way down to the street and realizes they are standing on
she whips around glaring death at his eyes
and dumb luck
she collapses in his arms every muscle trembling in spasm sobbing
god i hate you
he holds her tenderly
kisses the top of her head
mac softly good
i hate you too
with gin in a soft brunette wig walking briskly light carry all across her shoulder
very early even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour
tsimshatsui station a tall man with a tourist shopping bag leaning casually against a pole
talking into a cellular
as she approaches mac doesnt seem to notice but she can now hear his conversation
mac into phone if i cant have my usual suite ill take my business to the bristol simple as that
he sees her now
mac into phone why indeed should i be more loyal to you than youve been to me
think it over
snaps the phone shut
you ran your calls
she is frankly exhilarated
all the transactions all the transfers
its a miracle
the cd erased the trans actions all accounts seem in order
it looks like the thieves were stopped in time
it is a miracle
the colonel says police have nothing
a man in black tie a blonde in a gown
the elevator guards saw faces but no mug shots to id
i think its over
except it never is really
it is easy but dazzling
well one hopes not
the bristol huh
youre not going back to mr
cruz and the nine to five
ive arranged to be killed in a car crash
amazing how little it costs
you want to watch those pennies
she takes a breath
scared in an excited way
i could arrange for two
in that crash
his smile back
he looks at his watch
takes her hand
leads her to the subway steps
you know for a bitch
you can be awfully sweet
woman of mystery
what do you say
i like the bristol just fine
mean its not the ritz
you know all night ive been wrestling with something
not the most flattering way to put it
he takes his big tourist shopping bag
puts it in her hand
ive changed your travel plans
they are descending now
into the vast underground train station
instead of taking the subway to the airport you change at jordan station for kowloon tong
jordan is only seconds up the line
like a wire transfer youre gone
he holds up a silencing finger
listen to me
in this bag are passports tickets papers
an amber wig a good one
a dress you can slip on in five seconds
her eyes moving over his face
what is this
youre on a tight connection to the trans siberian express be in europe in a week
you always talk too much
theyre at the booth
he pays their fare
through the turnstiles now
time has come to return the favor
one last time
smiles at her
as they enter a tunnel
im actually in
and in an instant of blind panicked clarity
she gets the whole thing
gin hushed my god
youre a cop
mac very softly thats my girl
people are everywhere
but they are alone in the world
see my profession was cover too
a notorious thief has access to colleagues their plans
ive turned in
well couple hundred
over forty years
scotland yard interpol fbi
looking around the tunnel
thought i might retire
and all the
microchips the diamond machine
well the chips were returned
the machine was just a box did you actually think it was real
glances at her
everything was real
end of the tunnel in sight now
it leads to a massive endless quai
trains in transit
those were your jobs so i could have claimed entrapment
you had to wait
he says nothing
looks pretty grim
the oracle bone
well the state department liked that one
they have more fish to fry with beijing than taiwan
so theyre taking credit for letting it go through
tho im afraid your colonel may be in for a career disappointment
she stops walking
she has to know
and the billion
i havent told them
gently takes her arm
leads her onto the endless train platform
walking slower now
i said you hadnt revealed the job
that it wouldnt take place until after the changeover
down the platform they stroll
as her eyes wander
dont look theyre there
her breath catches
her eyes go down
and my tickets
in the shopping bag
kept my options open
if i give you up they dont matter do they
her heart pounding through her chest
had lots of crazy thoughts
one was retirement
with four billion dollars
after all i know some places where life could be private
but you couldnt do that huh
just two travellers in a strange land
waiting for a train
they wouldnt be here
creature of habit
we feel her adrenaline racing
of thoughts you s
they wont move until i raise my left arm
and so she smiles
as prettily as she can manage
well ive got the cd
i could contact the banks reverse all the transactions
a train is coming
we hear it
leave you with
oh a hundred million say
to tide you over
see the train
then i thought nah
not my style
with a shriek of metal
the train pulls toward us
what the hell
what the hell
let her keep the lot
the train stops
the doors open
people come out people go in
pouring around them
they are alone again
the subway doors stand open
two feet away
she looks at them
the doors wont close for seconds
and still smiling
theres a pistol in the bag
reach in slowly
take it out fast
point it at my temple
she freezes to stone
you can do it
if i say you can
a blinding move the gun straight at his head mac miming fear raising his hands to chill the agents we
whip pan to see
half a dozen everywhere but none too close
they react pull their weapons but its a stand off
alone in the universe
step onto the car keep the pistol trained on my face
does as he says
passengers are screaming cringing bolting for other cars
our world is frozen
his hands raised
seems i was wrong
is what robbers
do to cops huh
her eyes are flooding
the gun is trembling
shoot me in the shoulder itll slow them down
her pistol is shaking like she has palsy
tears are on her cheeks
oughta shoot you in the face
come on you can do it if i sa
she cant stand this
ten seconds hold on
when do i see you
there is no answer
there are no words
the doors hiss shut
she stares training her pistol on him through the glass his hands reaching back to hold off the agents and the train
an instant to pick up speed and it roars into a tunnel
mac stands motionless as all hell breaks loose around him agents rushing to his side mac shaking his head calmly
still staring after the train
changing at mongkok station we can cut her off
walkie talkies whip out
these guys are the same the world over
we begin to crane up
she might lose the wig be looking brunette or blonde navy pants suit
i think yaumatei changes for the airport and its closer
keep pulling up an aerial view now too high to see their faces
i think youre wrong but cover it
you got maybe four minutes
higher still the mob below an ant colony
calmly no problem
but as the crowd parts
we can make out one lone man
what has gone
