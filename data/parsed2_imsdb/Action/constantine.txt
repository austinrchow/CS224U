by kevin brodbin based on the characters appearing in magazines published by dc comics inc
previous revisions by mark bomback current revisions by frank cappello november glimpses of an ancient city
almost motionless against the tide of time
sea swelled along an endless wall
billowing silk frozen against the sky
birds lighting on byzantine columns
final image is of an imposing structure beyond the trees
corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness
stale air hangs in the dim half light like atomized ether
there is whispering
and tangled voices
drift in past prison cells the size of closets
brief flashes of carved faces insanity coming to rest on the a gaunt prisoner kneels on the granite head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of christ
but hes not just praying
with his arm under the tapestry he scratches at the stone with a spoon
after only a year the spoon finally breaks through
prisoner claws his way between ancient walls comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door
he nudges a shoulder against it digs in and pushes
door groans open sucking air into the pitch black chamber
the tapestry covering the hole is pulled against the wall then billows outward like a sail
pulls himself inside chokes in the heavy air
he scans the musty room
a few empty crates
and the remains of several deteriorating skeletons
he looks to the far wall sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone
a way out
too high to reach prisoner pulls an old chest out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light
he steps up onto the chest grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through
prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside wrapped in a red cloth
he pulls it out and as he unwraps it he discovers the cloth is a nazi flag
at the center is a crudely shaped iron relic
eight inches long
stains on the edges
could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal
or maybe an ancient arrowhead
as he holds it feverish sweat starts to form on his face
as if hes being watched by someone else
prisoner spins looks back at us
starts toward the way out
the guards flashlight beam probes the cell one by one falls on the tapestry
christ billows out from the wall revealing the hole
lights blast on
guards with weapons rush through
prisoner squeezes toward light grips the relic tight
sirens blare as spotlights sweep across the ominous structure
prisoner breaks from the darkness runs for the trees on the other side of the wall
in turkish stop
prisoner spins griping the relic tight
gunshots ring out
bullets streak toward him but never hit their target
guards check their weapons on the run
prisoner breaks from the trees runs into a road
headlights wash over him and tires screech
prisoner spins is right in the path of a car
brakes squeal car locks up but too late impacts prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap
car slides to a stop
driver jumps out sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires
he scans the area for a body spots the prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet
prisoner is just as amazed
he glances at the relic in his hand notes the wrist has reddened and an odd symbol has appeared as if embossed in the flesh
driver calls out but the prisoner is spooked runs off
over this we hear a childs scream
father hennessey stands over a young teen jeanie splashes holy water on her body
she screams again
et separatur a plasmate tuo ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
her body convulses pulls against the bandages tying her hands and feet to the bed frame
notice her fingernails
drained of color
her mother is off to one side completely hysterical
on the other side is a crowd of bewildered tenants all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door
nothing can compare with an exorcism
especially one thats gone bad
the rather obese priest tries to steady his hands and his heart
its obvious hes totally out of his league here
girl lets out another scream that echoes over not in a third world country but smack center in one of americas richest cities
sparkling high rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest fashions the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt liquor
a faded yellow taxi pulls up and stops
someone steps out grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt
doors open flood the musty darkness with a brief relief of sunlight
a man whose face we dont see steps inside his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of a raven
he pauses pulls an ornate lighter and lights a cigarette
takes a puff and pushes on inside
lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the unexplainable
the stranger pushes through
suspicious faces step out of his path
the ones that dont he pushes aside even the gangbangers
the man has no patience for politeness no time for tact no fear of anything
this man is john constantine
he arrives at his destination barges into
one scan of the situation is all it takes
the bed the child the panicked priest who rushes to john
whispering thank god youre here
john shoots him a disgusted look
hennessey gives him a wide berth
john walks past the panic stricken mother without a glance sets his cigarette on the nightstand the glowing tip drooped over the edge
he puts a gloved hand to the childs face and it burns on contact
his demeanor instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of the little girl and whispers this is constantine
john constantine asshole
the girl jolts bandages on her arms cut into her skin
eyes snap open glare right through him
how ya doing
vamos juntos a matarla
john whips out a key chain crammed with medallions
lets see who we got here
he holds them up so they cast shadows across jeanies face
he flips through each of these sculptured saints until the child suddenly reacts to one tries to look away
john stares at the saint responsible seems genuinely puzzled
he turns to the mother very serious
i need a mirror
shaken the mother produces a small compact
john pushes it away turns to the doorway crowd
a large mirror
at least sizes up the child three feet high
the hallway crowd discusses possibilities
tenants run to retrieve a mirror
hennessey looks worried
john grabs the bed shoves hennessey aside as he swings the bed around legs gouging hardwood all the way
faces it toward the window
several of the men from the hallway crowd storm through an old womans stuffy apartment locate a huge iron framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the
centers on a drapery rope pulls hard
drapery hooks explode off the curtain rod as he swings open the window looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is parked
chaz s looks up from his cab
you just know hed love to be up there not down here
move the car
john frees the drapery rope ducks back into the room
park the car move the car
chaz shifts into reverse moves the car three feet
there i moved the damn car
four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror
the old woman follows begs them to be gentle
they swing the mirror around take out a chunk of banister
hennessey can only watch as john threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing drapes it back through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan
he climbs onto the bed leans over the child whose eyes have closed and shes shaking badly
her body seems to be going into shock
isnt strong enough for this
john has no choice slaps her
eyes pop back open
dark and dilated
he yells down at her in aramaic and english
amar natash bow basar
rescind from the flesh i command thee the girl chokes as if ready to spit
thats it time to go home
jeanie screams tiempo para morir
her body suddenly pulses half again larger
john recoils for a beat
he continues in aramaic amar natash bow basar another pulse and this time a shape is clearly seen expanding under the childs skin as if the demon inside were trying
to burst right through
john backs off watches as the shape ripples her flesh like fingers caressing from the other side
john glances to hennessey
what the hell
mirror arrives at the doorway bangs against the jam
john waves them in
the four men heft it into the room
over the bed
john ducks settles on the girl as they raise it over him
hennessey tie it off hennessey is glad to be called into service quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror
john straddles the girl positions his head between her and the mirror above him
now close your eyes all of you and whatever happens do not look into the mirror
the men close their eyes
muscles tense under the weight
amar natash bow basar
rescind from the flesh i command thee
jeanie reacts that shape reappears contorts the young body all out of proportion
john unblocks the mirror for a second and jeanie is reflected inside
its not just the image of a young girl in there but something else
the surface of the mirror flexes in the hands of the men
one starts to look no
jeanie screams breaks free of the straps
she rises up grabs john tight around the throat
nails dig deep
looking into mirror not yet
john struggles puts his hands over her mouth cutting off her air supply
question is whos going to pass out first
jeanies body is racked by whatevers inside her
she goes into shock body collapsing shaking close to death
look at me
but shes passing out first
john quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction goddamit look
and presses it against her forehead
eyes snap wide and john unblocks the mirror
jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically
smile pretty you vain prick
the childs reflection has now changed to a pissed off demon
one that knows it just got suckered in
mirror vibrates wildly in the mens grip
demon reflection ripples the glass bending it outward into three d space as the girl takes her last breaths now hennessey
hennessey pulls the rope with all three hundred plus pounds as john gives the demon face a full extended for your boss
demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion
swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood no you dont
john jumps up and helps push the mirror free
falls slow motion from the th story tumbling end over end sunlight beams glancing off the glass projecting the image of the demon into the la cityscape
onto buildings sidewalks a passing truck until all three hundred pounds of iron and glass come crashing down on the taxis hood
demons image shatters on impact glass splintering into a million diamond like fragments that choke the air
the groan of something evil reverberates into the city beyond
chaz looks up sees he missed dying by three feet
jeanie gasps takes her first breath as a child again
mother pulls her in hugs her tight
note the girls fingernails
no longer black
johns beat reclaims that stub of a cigarette still burning
takes a drag
he pushes past hennessey who is approaching the mother
now about the fee
john slips from view into the kitchenette hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance
he catches his breath looks up and is staring right at a childs crayon drawing magneted to the fridge
a drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick
this image is repeated over and over
john tugs it off the fridge tucks it away
hennessey follows john down the spiraling stairs passing the gathered tenants
a few are freaked cross themselves
but many want to touch them shake their hands
a shadowy figure several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below
note the slick suit the polished veneer
this is balthazar and he definitely does not rent here
he flicks an ancient coin between his fingers
john pauses gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something
no one there
balthazar is gone
john shakes off the feeling continues down the steps where hennessey is shoving his hat in front of the tenants
theyre gladly giving to the cause
hennessey stops his panhandling continues toward the exit
john and hennessey stop near the front entrance
john rips the white collar from hennesseys neck
i know i know but i didnt think she was really possessed not like that
im not back an hour and you drag me into dont be mad john dont be john rummages through his coat pockets on the left side
john keeps searching
john rips his smokes from the left vest pocket dont do that shit on me sorry sorry
here you can have half
hennessey starts to divvy the cash but john snatches the hat
i should take it all save you from yourself
he gestures that bagged bottle in hennesseys jacket
it keeps them out so i can sleep
please john i need to sleep
john stares at his pathetic friend sighs finally slips a few bills from the wad and hands them over
hennessey is bubbling with appreciation starts to follow
john simply holds up a hand
hennessey stops watches john walk out
john turns the corner spots chaz punching a dent from the taxis hood
i told you to move it
well maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three hundred pound mirror with a pissed off demon in it i would have moved it further
chaz slams the hood
they slide into the car
chaz reaches back into johns front coat pocket pulls out hennesseys wad of cash slips off a few bills
shouldnt have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment
you were so close to growing a conscience
john grins pulls his special lighter lights a smoke and sits back
he looks back up at the apartment still puzzled
never ceases to entertain
chaz crams the car in gear as john takes a drag coughs
one of those perfect days
with perfect clouds
so clear you feel you could reach out and touch heaven
two young girls rise into frame on side by side swings
for a moment theyre suspended against that incredible sky
then gravity takes hold and they fall back to earth
you still with me
angelas weary eyes open
shes on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper
grips a police issue revolver tight
shes pinned down unable to move
the man is thirty feet down the same track
their voices echo off the curved walls come from everywhere
how either of these two got here isnt important
who will get out is
so whats next detective
we gonna do a full marathon
intermittent radio chatter buzzes from angelas walkie talkie
you get the sense angela is not alone in here
put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head
or how bout you show yourself and i put a bullet in your skull just like i did hers
thats just not going to happen
you sure about that
angela checks the chamber sees she has one bullet left
almost pleading now put down your weapon on the tracks and ground begins to vibrate
tunnel starts to glow
well aint this a peach
angela looks back sees several shadows of figures waving far off
her radio is flooded with futzed chatter
over radio get off the tracks
blueline is coming
clear the tracks
angela peeks over the track
still no sign of her perp
the train is coming into view and its beam shoots through the tunnel turning every particle of dust into a supernova
the sound is deafening
cmon detective step into the light and be saved
angela looks back squints into the brilliant light
she grips her gun and in one burst of flat out bravado rises as she aims
and there he is the man rising with his own gun
angela fires as both dive off the track
his bullet ricochets behind her
hers finds its mark
man goes down right in the trains path
angela rolls over on the side of the tracks catches her breath
she closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur
chazs taxi pulls up parks
opens reveals suitcases stamped with air india
john starts inside pauses as chaz yells there are four bags
i have two hands
this give you any ideas
make two trips
john walks in
chaz curses under his breath
evening leagues are going strong
john walks in looks totally out of place
he moves down the ball rack area runs his fingers across the various leftovers finally stops at a pearl white dazzler
he lifts it from the rack steps out into the prep area in front of one of the few lanes not in use
john snatches a grease pencil from the overhead scribbles right on the ball provisions depleted
he fluffs his trench coat back steps onto the polished wood with his well traveled oxfords
young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity
an attractive brunette is rather curious
john gives her a wink
her boyfriend doesnt appreciate it
perfect hook ball
john returns the smile heads into the hallway by the pool tables
seems small until you walk in and realize its as long as a bowling lane
makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like its a mile away
chaz throws the suitcases on it as john arrives
yells across room simple question
how much longer do i have to be your slave
john pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open
youre not my slave chaz
youre my very appreciated assistant
like tonto and robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend
along the floor encircling the entire room are gallon sparkletts bottles
each is adorned by a small hand marked cross
john takes a moment to adjust one out of place
how much longer
john doesnt like his tone
well i dont know whats the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of hell
so what time you want me back
john gives him a knowing look goes back to emptying his pockets
i need to make an appearance at midnites
say ten ish
chaz sighs starts out chaz
chaz turns back catches an object john throws him
a little something from delphi
its a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow
chaz tips it
john finds it rather amusing
john removes a small black box from his jacket
he sets it carefully on its own shelf by the window stares out
john turns to see beeman waddle in
i gave you three months worth
you were gone only one
this diminutive occult version of bonds q carries a custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole
what can i say beeman india was a real drain
they shake hands
beeman sets his bowling bag onto the table unzips it
so what do you need
everything you got
pausing you smell something john
incubus in this girl i just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual
beeman starts pulling things out
first is a frayed rag
then glass containers
well ive got your stone fragments from the road to damascus dust from the dead sea scrolls oh youll love this out comes a little matchbox with a smiling bug
screech beetle from mount sinai
he shakes the matchbox and the beetle flutters inside
its wings create an eerie high pitched whirl
yeah to you its nothing but to the fallen like fingernails on a chalkboard
what is it with you and bugs
beeman pulls out a set of sculptured brass knuckles
actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings
john takes them tries them on
gold was blessed by the bishop anicott during the crusades
john spots a foot long copper tube in the bag pulls it out grips the bicycle handle on one end
watch it there
with this puny little thing
john gives the handle a squeeze and whoooosh ten foot flame belches out
i thought you couldnt get it anymore
beeman shrugs modesty
john starts to put it down on the table and beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away
whoa dont want to get a flame near this
off johns look piece of the shroud moses wore to the mountain
john picks it up youre shitting me right
got any callinicus
intrigued how spirited was this incubus
coughs like it was trying to come right out through the girl beeman just stares at him is this a joke
i know how it sounds
were finger puppets to them john elaborate costumes they can work us but dont come through us
you know that
check the scrolls anyway
see if there are any precedents
coughs again wouldnt happen to have anything for beeman sets down a bottle from the bag vicks
on the house
lots of blue on blue in this parking lot
locker door opens and angela is there covered in the grime of the subway
shes pained as she pulls off her shoulder holster
looks at herself in the door mirror
tired aging eyes stare back
gutsy move out there dodson
angela glances at detective weiss as he opens his locker
well thats a new one
the two exchange a look
bad guys dead
no point in using the other words
shuts his locker even though it was reckless irresponsible stupid
i knew you still cared
youre good angela real good but one of these days
heard it before i know nobodys luck lasts forever
he meets her eyes
he really does care
weiss breaks it off leaves
angela turns to close her locker door notices her reflection does not turn
she grabs the door looks back in
reflection is as it should be
she shudders slams the locker door
so exclusive theres not even a line out front
just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun
chaz follows john from the cab to the entrance
a bouncer selects a picture card from a deck
on the front are two flying dolphins
only we can see the back which is two frogs on a bench
they let him pass
chaz steps up and lucky him he gets the same two flying dolphins
two frogs on a bench
but chaz is stiff armed because the back of this card shows a bear in a dress
but im with him
john glances back gives him an impassive look
chaz backs away stares after him
music floods this exclusive establishment
its a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated
a retro speakeasy for the new millennium
john walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows
he pauses sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner showing off for several ladies
one fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water
another waves his hand over them turns the water into red wine
the ladies are very impressed drink up
nico a young black man walks past john
neighborhoods going to hell
john offers a half smile
he likes this kid walks on
one of the men in the group turns watches john
he grins and pockets that odd coin
john starts up a long flight of stairs stops in front of two very large doors
their surface is ancient the wood petrified over countless centuries
john places his fingers into the gnarled folds closes his eyes numquam leadatur a morsu
a living groan bellows from the rigid seams but the doors dont budge
bastard changed the code again
bangs the doors midnite
come on do i have to huff and puff here
the doors unlatch
sweep across a meticulously crafted orrery a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion
but the planets here are ancient relics with symbols and names material astral spiritual iconic etc
and the globe at the center creator
this is an orrery of the forces of the universe
and its not moving
et separatur a plasmate tuo ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
john steps in through the doors behind
deciding which color to paint this place again
pappa midnite stands in the jungle he calls an office
part african witch doctor part savvy businessman
a full six and half feet of solid contradictions
youre back early
i got tired of spending your money
but im sure you spent enough
well i do have a certain standard of living
tell me you found it
i found the vault
thats not what i asked
hey can i help it if buddhist monks dont take bribes
midnite strides toward him when john calmly pulls from his pocket a small ebony and gold relic
it stops midnite cold
a reluctant grin cracks midnites stern features
he takes the relic in his thick fingers stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind
second century depiction of a sephiroth in the th realm
so we good here
midnite ignores his outstretched palm slides the relic precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the universal orrery
it should counter the iconic plane that damn things never going to balance
midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts to move
john is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt
midnite deflates stares at john suspiciously
must i remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health
its authentic midnite you just have the wrong piece
the two have a mini stare down
johns rigid poker face is only broken by a cough
midnite sighs breaks it off
i didnt blink that was a cough
you never cough
midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a thick stack of hundreds
better not be any washingtons in here this time
why did you cut your trip short
john stops the counting actually thinks about it
i dont know
just a feeling john suddenly spins toward the entrance doors is stunned to see balthazar
balthazar is behind him
were not still whining about manhattan are we
johns attempt to disguise his anger fails
that expression alone has made my entire night
john takes several steps toward him
theres history here
ill make your night ill deport your sorry ass right where you stand john stops in his tracks
its bad enough that you let these half breeds in at all but this piece of shit perks of becoming a primary investor
midnites eyes say it all not here not now
things change balances shift
get used to it constantine
not while im still breathing john starts to cough again
im sorry i didnt catch that
john tries to catch his breath cant
and that scares him a bit
he tries to hide it pushes out
john slams out the exit coughing
he pulls the vicks from his jacket struggles with the child protector cap
john is surprised to see hennessey waiting
he chokes is about to bust the vicks bottle
hennessey grabs hold twists off the cap with one flick
john guzzles the syrup
im real sorry about this morning john real sorry
please dont hate me for draggin you into that
john can finally breathe
i dont hate you
thats good to hear
but could you at least wait until i call for you before you show up
you didnt call
jesus hennessey you freak me out sometimes
so you want me to go away and come back
ive got an assignment for you
what kind of assignment
the kind youll have to be sober for
oh god you want me to surf the ether
he instinctively touches an amulet around his neck
four intersecting crosses
come on you know that exorcism wasnt right
i dont have the sight anymore
dont have it or dont want to use it
this is obviously tough for him
just look around
a few days
you spot anything unusual anything you let me know
john wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy then reaches behind his neck itll be like old times
and unclips the amulet from hennesseys neck
that unnerves the big guy
john drops it in hennesseys pocket
just for a few days
for you john
like old times
hennessey takes one last sip from his drink hands the bottle over
john downs the rest
angela sits inside
i killed a man today
father garret sits on the other side of the mesh window
im sorry angela
most cops go twenty years without firing their gun
i always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
angela arrives home
pours milk for a cat
lets her hair down
slips off her shoes
i didnt even see his face
i just pulled the trigger and he went away
just like all the others
angela in the shower trying to wash off the guilt
these feelings are natural in your line of work angela
id be worried if you didnt have them
angela now in a recliner cat in her lap
eyes are heavy
but you have to be strong
you cant allow your faith to be overshadowed by guilt
her eyes close
im trying real hard
angelas eyes open
an angela whose frightened features are dripping with a fever sweat
shes in a hospital gown stares around a corner
janitor polishes the floor in the distance
a nurse checks off charts in the f
and right between the two darts angela unseen by anyone
a metal fire door swings open and angela bursts out breathing deep
she runs across the tar roof almost afraid to look back
she gets to the ledge steps up
a bottle in the way fall follow it down to the
where it shatters the sound has drawn the attention of barry lying in bed
he moves up and stares out the window sees the broken glass in the courtyard
he scans up the building and spots a figure standing on the roof
chilling april air flutters angelas gown vaporizes her breath
tears stream down her cheeks as she contemplates the unthinkable
cityscape of lights are spread out below but angela is seeing something else
is a city engulfed in red flames
follow that tear with the same reflection of fire inside as it traces her cheek and slips into her mouth
angela shudders rubs her wrist where we see the skin has swelled and reddened just like the prisoners
and theres that same circular symbol in the flesh
she wipes her tears tries to be strong
takes a few breaths for courage them simply steps off
barrys wide eyes follow her down
barry approaches across the barren courtyard leans down to angelas contorted body
but shes still alive
barry stares into eyes that are fading fast
he reaches out touches her face
angela stirs awake
over this we hear incessant coughing
john switches on the light leans up from the sink and wipes his mouth with a towel
its covered with blood
more runs down the drain
he stares at himself in the mirror
on johns worried eyes looking equally distraught
its her angela
angela is led by detective weiss past several officers and medical personnel
they arrive at the covered body in the courtyard
coroner sees angela approach and lifts the sheet from the face
angela comes to a dead stop emotions coming fast and furious
she leans close and we see a mirror of angela
thats when you realize that wasnt a dream
this is her twin
but that circular symbol is nowhere on her wrist now
angelas eyes well with tears
it takes everything she has to stay in control
helps to wrap herself in the job
she steps back looks up at the tall building
she fell from the roof
angela gives him an incredulous glare
shakes her head
i know its hard to accept but
isabel would never in a million years take her own life
there was a surveillance camera on the roof
john marches down a hallway his trench coat a step behind
he unconsciously rubs his left wrist coughs
flicks an unlit smoke between his fingers
john stops at a doctors office door hesitates
view of the rooftop
theres isabel in her nightgown stepping up pausing just a second
then one step and shes gone
angela shudders as a comforting hand rests on her shoulder
take some time
angela brushes off his hand then spots weiss and the others on the other side of the room
whose hand was that
a line of light boxes illuminate several chest x rays
a dark sinister splotch snakes through both lungs
john stands there stares at this wall of death with disbelief
no ive beaten things insurmountable things things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think im going to be done in by this
he raises a puny little cigarette
les archer sighs
a delicate bedside manner is not his specialty
you wouldnt be the first john
it cant be that simple
i mean come on les you saved me before
you can do it again right
this is different
this is aggressive
john tries to stay cool fails
he trashes the x ray boxes
diseased lungs disappear
doc shakes his head
twenty years ago you didnt want to be here
now you dont want to leave
thats because i know exactly where im going this time
john steps outside of the doctors office pauses to gather himself
he starts walking
wants out of here fast
angela is on the move
emotions are coming in strong
she cant get out of here fast enough
she aims for the elevators sees a man has just entered one
rushing toward it wait hold the door
angela gets to the elevator looks in
john stands inside alone
this should be the first time we realize they were in the same hospital
john pauses as the doors start to close
not if i can help it
the doors close right on angela
a pickup truck crosses a barren landscape
in the back bed are several goats and one prisoner
he grips the relic tight in one hand
that anxious fever has returned
glazed eyes dart to the side and lock on a rising jetliner in the distance dart back to the road theyre on heading the opposite way
prisoner clamps his eyes tight grips to the relic tighter
eyes snap open and he turns thrusts his elbow through the center window leans in and grabs the driver jerks his head back against the bulkhead cracking it in the
prisoner latches onto the wheel takes control
he swerves the car off the pavement gets out and takes over as driver
truck continues on bouncing through a shallow ditch and into the field beyond aiming straight for the rising airliners in the distance
close to condemned status
scan up floor after floor coming to rest on a window covered with aluminum foil
every wall of this tiny shithole is covered in aluminum foil
a sober hennessey stands surrounded by decades of newspapers and periodicals tries to get his breathing in check
he instinctively reaches to his neck to touch the amulet but its not there
oh yeah in the pocket
decision made he reaches up starts tearing the foil from the walls and the window
john sits at a park bench
taking in the world
clouds passing the sun
shadows drifting across the city
leaves swirling after passing cars
john just sits there hearing every breath he takes wondering which one will be his last
john turns to see ellie strutting up the sidewalk
oozing sex appeal
in more ways than you think
thats funny as shit john
as if you guys didnt have something to do with it
hey i think you brought this one on yourself
john stares at her tries to get a read
now why wouldnt you trust me
i dont know something in the air she sits right on his lap playfully
dont worry john youll beat this
you beat everything
not this time ellie
john lifts her off of him sets her aside
oh wow youre serious
no wonder the boss is in such a good mood
yeah i thought maybe you could talk to him for me
ellie jumps off the bench creates an odd sound as she does
dammit john i know i owe you but to even ask that
all those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks
hes going to take all that out on you john and hes going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time
so i take that as a no
youre the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect
and you know how much he despises this place
im starting to see his point
ellie sits back down strokes his arm
have you gone to see the snob
like scratching fingers across a blackboard
look dont let your ego get in the way on this
id miss having someone up here i can
she gives him a kiss
and for a second johns leg is brushed by a tail
john doesnt react
just turns and walks away
seen through a mild rain is the theological society building a foreboding structure that looks out of place for this city
john stares out the back seat window takes a swig from a bottle of hard liquor
he turns to chaz
im sure i can get you in here
chaz gives the building another glance shoves the meter flag back down
a few bishops talk quietly
a cardinal studies scriptures
definitely not the place for atheists
john walks through the vaulted chamber room to the john stops fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front of a fireplace
one is a young man of pure class wrapped in armanis best
the other is father garret
john stands to the side and waits for their conversation to end
an attendant makes the rounds
can i take your coat mr
no thanks im not staying long
how about you maam
attendant turns to angela standing just a few feet away her gaze fixed on the same two men
im not staying long either
john glances over and for the second time they make contact
something about her eyes
john stares a bit too long
angela looks back toward the fireplace
my business with him is urgent
first come first served
so youre rude no matter where you are
john gives her a look
the two men shake hands and start to part
john and angela make their move toward the men
both are surprised when angela goes for father garret and john goes for the snob officially known as gabriel
yes that one
and angela have retreated to another area for privacy
why is he stalling on this
my sister needs a catholic funeral
angela its still considered a mortal sin she didnt commit suicide
the bishop has read otherwise
david this is isabel
meeting his eyes please
father garret stares at her tries to be compassionate
ill talk to him again
but angela has just lost a load of faith
gabriel sits in his chair watches the fire with unblinking eyes
john approaches from behind and against the backdrop of flame sees the nebulous shape of wings
the ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat
without looking back i know what you want son
john sits across from him
been keeping your all seeing eye on me have you
i could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous
so youre going to make me beg
angela pauses on her way out looks over
it wouldnt help
youve already wasted your chance at redemption
what about the minions ive sent back the souls that ive saved that should guarantee my passage across keeping it private no passage requires faith and faith by definition is
belief without proof
you have proof
and that means youre not playing by the same rules as everyone else
your work has mostly been for selfish reasons
this is bullshit bullshit
now hes really got angelas attention
its like youve got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do help an old lady across the street put in a nickel kick a dog take out a dime youre
fucking nickel and diming us to death down here
keep your voice down
john jumps up leans into his face
and you know what youre the ones with the problem not us you make these impossible rules to decide who goes up who goes down and you dont even understand
us this more than anything gets under gabriels skin
each of you is born with the promise of salvation preordained
the cost of your redemption is simple belief
and yet you whine about impossible rules
sometimes i imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given
more like a curse the way you manage things
gabriel stands and towers over john
i am taking your situation into account john but dont push me
why me gabriel
its personal isnt it
i didnt go to church enough
i didnt pray enough
i was five bucks short in the collection plate
gabriel moves right up to him makes this very personal
youre going to die because you smoked cigarettes a day since you were
and youre going to hell because of the life you took
or to put it in a way that your kind would understand
angela stands on the porch at the edge of a downpour
she hears a cough looks over to see john standing on the other side looking equally frayed
they share another glance
john fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket
he has a rotten sense of humor
steps past and his punch lines are killers
john tosses the cigarette pack walks right into the rain away from chazs taxi pulling up
shouting out john
angela watches john disappear in the rain looks down at the empty cigarette pack
lies on the floor next to food wrappers coke bottles and stacks of newspapers
hennessey sits amongst the garbage slumped over
but hes not sleeping
hes surfing the ether
allowing his sixth sense to guide him
his hands move down and across the stacks of newer periodicals fingers probing the layers of information
left hand suddenly stops
hennesseys eyes open
he removes the layers of periodicals on top of his left hand leans close
edges his fingers away and sees an obituary
a name isabel dodson
john walks the streets numb to the world
a rat scurries past near the curb
several crows fly by
above him is a billboard your time is running out
doesnt matter that below it is to buy a new chevy
the point is crystal clear
john shakes his head breaks out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit
he leans to a gutter
another rat scoots past
john barely notices
then a frog jumps past
but its the crab crawling by that finally catches johns gaze
hey buddy you got a light
john turns settles on a silhouetted figure standing behind him unlit cigarette butt in its mouth
coughs we gotta stick together right
john gathers himself
as he walks over to this old man he rummages through his coat pocket retrieves a matchbox
the box shudders as a high pitch fluttering filters from inside
old man winces as his entire body vibrates
john realizes this is beemans matchbox the one with the screech beetle inside
and now he knows a beat too late
old man attacks
john is knocked onto his haunches
as the old man closes in hes revealed in more detail
body and face are actually an intricate puzzle an assemblage of city vermin
rats insects crows frogs crabs all held together in the shape of a man
john scampers backwards just inches from this beings outstretched grasp
he shakes the matchbox and the screech beetle inside flutters again
old man demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart for a second then snaps back together
he grabs onto john with fingers of squirming vermin
snake wraps around his wrist
crab snaps at his skin
john shakes the beetle box harder causing the parts to vibrate even further
old man grabs johns head and vermin of various leg count crawl right onto johns face
johns had enough shakes the matchbox violently then smashes it against the sidewalk
beetle lets out a death shriek and the old man stutters his parts vibrating so wildly you can actually see the b
through the seams
john scampers loose grabs a road barricade and swings it with all his might
old man form shatters on impact
the entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of scattering critters
john starts stomping on them as they scatter into the city
john stands there shocked and concerned
what the hell is going on
that surveillance video footage from ravenscar plays again
theres isabel in her nightgown walking across the roof
spread out on a cluttered coffee table is isabels case file
coroners report is opened
lets see no drugs in system and the biggie cause of death suicide
angela sits on the couch in her robe
disheveled and distraught
shes taking this hard
im sorry isabel
she lowers her head
and in that brief moment of silence on tv constantine
angela snaps back to the tv freezes in shock
theres isabel ready to jump but this time shes looking right back at us at angela
then shes gone
angela quickly rewinds the tape and watches the sequence again
this time isabel doesnt look back
this time there is no name
but angela did see it
did hear it
she sits for a second
john paces as midnite works on that universal orrery adjusting components but balance continues to elude him
a few months maybe a year
end of story
as midnite doesnt react well dont break down on my account
what do you want from me
a shoulder to cry on
this bastard attacked me right out in the open on sepulveda no less
they dont like you john
youve deported how many back to hell
thats just it this wasnt some possession or wayward half breed it was a full fledged demon
on our plane
i know what i saw
you must have just crossed over and didnt even realize it i didnt cross over it was on this side
its wet out youre wandering around aimlessly not to mention completely emotional emotional
john slams a fist against the counter
the orrery almost topples but midnite saves it
decades of work almost lost
midnite glares at a desperate john
okay so you saw something
weve seen a few small ones slip through now and then
its more than that
first the girl then this
john you know my connections
any shifts or tremors in the planes and id hear about it
john just shakes his head looks up convinced
midnite sighs gives up with him
the name john constantine is center screen on a monitor typed into the police stations search engine
angela sits alone in the squad room rain streaking across the windows
interpol comes back with results and a list of priors scroll under johns name
must be a hundred parking violations
several speeding tickets and a few reckless endangerment
in fact johns license has been revoked
but its the other incidents that draw angela in
of specific words in a few headlines occult activity on the rise
claimed possession is refuted by bishop
satanic cult dissolved
accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos
blood patterns on a wall odd symbols burned into a ceiling
a cross burnt to a crisp
john in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her son in her arms
a younger and more noble father hennessey stands beside them looking grateful
another line insufficient evidence to prosecute
angela scrolls sees cities listed where john has made waves london paris rome budapest moscow
stops on the one that matters los angeles
and theres an address
angela hits print and the hp hums away
a desk phone rings
angela quickly looks around sees shes the only one here
she gets up answers it
this is dodson hello
the next phone rings
angela reaches for it when the next one rings and the next the next
the rings hop phone to phone in intimidating mockery
angela freezes forces herself to stay calm
sure enough the rings abruptly cease
angela reaches over rips the page from the printer leaves
a police guard scans passengers and a printout of the prisoner
he walks past a man standing in the metal detector line
this is actually the prisoner wearing the clothes and glasses of the driver
is that a blood stain on the lapel
sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver
he has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt
watching the prisoner
he looks back at us suspicious
looks back nervously as his bag goes through the detector
shows the folds of the bag a wallet a passport and nothing else
the iron relic doesnt even produce an outline
bag slides out untouched
prisoner cant believe his luck grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates
various of the city the contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious
that abandoned mission behind bobs big boy the islamic temple wedged between competing banks
the towering statue of the good shepherd
his hands are welcoming us into the holy cross cemetery
right across the street is the lanes bowling alley
john drinks alone
pissed at life
that small black box of his lies on the table unopened
spider runs across the table
john flips an empty glass traps it underneath
he takes a drag on his cigarette tips the glass and blows smoke inside
spider cant escape the poison air bumps the glass
welcome to my life
john looks up spots angela
those eyes again
i saw you at i remember
she did make an impression
id like to ask you a few questions
im not really in the talking mood right now
could you just listen then
angela sets her lapd detective badge on the table
always a catch
angela sits across from him puts the badge away
my sister was murdered last week
sorry to hear
her name was isabel
she looks for a reaction
you dont remember her
never met her
she look anything like you
as angela nods i wouldve remembered
another beat as their eyes meet
john looks away
she was a patient at ravenscar
then last tuesday she just decided to step off the roof
i thought you said she was murdered
isabel would never take her own life
youd be surprised at what people will do
look i know im not making much sense hell im not really sure what im doing here
i just feel the circles you travel in the occult demonology exorcisms
john just stares at that spider in the glass
i believe someone got to her mr
constantine brainwashed her into stepping off that roof
some kind of legion or cult
sounds like a theory
well i thought with your background and experience you could at least point me in the right direction
john points toward the exit
angela is not amused
but shes not giving up
my sister always talked about a world better than this
heaven as some call it
she wasnt afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her
what everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life
she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as
the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity
beat that about right
the words have hit so hard that angela is speechless
john sees the hurt in her eyes would like to take it back but its too late
she turns and starts out slows youre not the only one afraid of hell
john tries not to let that get to him
he glances out the window watches her pass by
but somethings not right
those deep shadows on the buildings seem to be moving
john watches confused realizes theyre heading in angelas direction
he stands gains his bearings
as he walks out he flicks the glass over
spider runs free
cars are lined all the way down the street
angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her
its joined by another in the trees both closing in with each step
angela looks back sees john in the street
how open is your mind
she doesnt answer continues walking
what she doesnt see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes
but john does
he starts walking toward her
do you believe in heaven and hell
off no answer how about what comes out of each
angela keeps walking
he catches up with her
you mean like angels
angela stares at him continues walking
he keeps up
see you dont have the mindset for this kind of work
they walk together down the lonely street
look i see terrible things every day
a mother drowns her baby
a ten year old shoots his father
but its not demons its the evil that men do
behind them a streetlight blinks out
theyre not looking back so they dont see it
youre right were capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy
another light fizzes blinks out
then sometimes something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it
i dont believe in demons
they believe in us
they pass another streetlamp as it goes bright then blacks out
both look up
the next lamp flares then fizzes out
angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them
she looks to john
but hes staring straight ahead
because now the light in front of them is flaring we should go
second later it blinks off
john grabs her hand fast
angelas confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural wind races toward them
john jerks her into action
they run towards the next light
it blinks out right when they reach it
they race to stay in the light aiming toward the safety of the brightly lit statue of the good shepherd
they make it through the gate pass through an alley of overhanging trees
something ripples through the branches flitters right past angelas face
she swats at it manages to get a branch across the cheek
they near the good shepherd and the floodlights flicker fade out
statues of saints become dark monoliths
john stops in an open area between trees and a mausoleum
a lit cross on the wall provides the only illumination
angela feels the scratch on her cheek sees a trickle of blood
now she hears sounds in the darkness
like leather rubbing
what is that
john is just as surprised hes saying this wings
john rummages through his trench coat fishes out that cloth beeman gave him
the one supposedly wrapped around moses
and maybe talons
the cross is getting dimmer and dimmer
are you kidding
something thats not supposed to be here
john quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand
angela spins eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get closer ghastly sound of movement in the fringes of light
the cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with every second the circle of light gets smaller and those sounds get closer
john takes out his special lighter
close your eyes
they are now standing in pitch darkness
john flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand
sacred cloth catches fire then ignites with a brilliant retina searing flash blinding angela and illuminating a circle of winged demons a roiling broth of reptilian death right there ready
red flame radiates from the cloth and demons shriek as they are instantly vaporized
john tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket extinguishes the flame
he leans down to a rubbery stain left from one of the burnt demon carcasses
shakes his head in disbelief
to himself i accidentally crossed over
i dont think so
coming up behind what was that
i saw wings and teeth they were flying
what the hell were those things
they werent angels
john scans the area trying to think this through
scavengers for the damned
off her lost look demons
you cant be serious
this is impossible
to himself and i dont think they were after me
john looks at her with renewed interest
you really believe she wouldnt commit suicide
a bit thrown my sister
a beat never in a million years
john makes the decision
lets be sure
he starts walking
angela is now compelled to follow
see if shes in hell
not exactly an inviting place
hennessey steps off the curb looks up at his destination
john stares at a photo of angela and her father in police uniform
obviously happier times
angela walks out of her bedroom holding a cardboard box
that gray cat follows close to her heels
these are all isabels things
the cat too
john ignores the box of items picks up the cat
he studies it a bit then sits back in a chair with it
dont you need candles and a pentagram for this to work
deadpan why do you have any
john puts his feet shoes and all into a bucket of water
i need you to step outside now
angela wants to stay
angela reluctantly moves toward the exit
john holds the cat stares into its huge unblinking eyes
theres a moment where animal and man seem to connect
the water around johns feet begins to boil
angela pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch
bulbs pulsate as current ramps down
the room flickers is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half light and john has now crossed over into same layout different decorator
john takes a deep raspy breath slowly stands
he turns to the wall behind him which is torn away looking like some half bombed structure in beirut
beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape but a sickly sepia glow
not quite day not quite night
john steps over the crumbling wall into john walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways
burnt out husks of long forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock
a low drone penetrates the silence
is she here
on the horizon is a dying red sun
it strains to cut through the putrid brown haze
is she here
his voice reverberates to infinity
john cautiously steps closer to the railing looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below
theyre crammed with teeming masses of the damned
all walking down in silence faces numb with sorrow and grief
that low drone rises in pitch and john now spots a huge blanket like blackness crawling over the cityscape rapidly closing in on him
you get the feeling this isnt a safe place for the living
its a simple question
is she here or not
john suddenly locks on something far off
on top of a distant skyscraper is a female figure in a sheer white gown
john cant make out her face but knows shes looking right at him
she lifts something and tosses it
john watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness
in that same motion we left her in angela finishes pushing the door closed
as it latches weakly angela
come back in
confused angela pushes the door back open
cat bolts out
angela catches her breath moves inside
john sits slumped in the chair drained
steam rises off his skin
angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out
she walks in kneels down to him
sweat drips off as he looks up
he opens his palm reveals to angela a simple hospital band
the name isabel dodson is typed on it
even as a semi convert this news completely floors angela
she takes the plastic band grips it tight tries to hold herself together
the adrenaline and pain overwhelm
her knee buckle and she drops to the floor
john watches isnt sure how to help
he finally reaches out a single hand slowly rests it on her shoulder
the contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and angela falls right into his arms
john hasnt been this close to anyone in a long time
angela finally composes herself
how did you do this
john tries not to stare into those eyes too long
body drawer slides open reveals isabel
lying in a cold sterile room of death
a hell of a different type
hennessey stares down at her looks around the room again makes sure hes still alone
he reaches in rips open the protective plastic and lowers his hand inside
places it first on her forehead
then on her chest
wrist is last
this is it
he closes his eyes and opens himself to the void when i was a kid i saw things
a ten year old john comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag
he slows eyes a man at a mailbox
things i wasnt supposed to
the man looks right at young john as he passes
his face is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are dug into the ground
young john looks up toward the voice john looks up at the waitress
angela sits across from him
theyre at the table by the window
my parents sent me to a doctor a shrink a priest
i was in four different institutions by the time i was eighteen
angela notes him rubbing his wrist
the last place they put me was run by a church
a doctor rushes past their table
pan with him into
the doctor rushes toward distant screaming
the revered father made the brilliant deduction that i was possessed said i needed to be exorcised
the doctor runs in
sees the revered father below leaning over a bed where an year old john is held down by three interns and that doctor
john angrily screams at them all
it was like someone trying to pull teeth that werent there
young john clamps his eyes shut tight
present day john does the same remembering the pain
so i took things into my own hands and i found a way out
you attempted suicide
john sees shes looking at his wrist
the hint of a jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve
i never attempt anything
johns reflection in the window becomes kneeling with a pair off scissors
hes inside a
teenage john looks up at a room filled with people from all walks of life
teachers doctors lawyers garbage men
all somewhat different than normal
they sit in school chairs and wait for john to do the deed
he puts the blade to his wrist one swipe and the world around him accelerates away in a streaked blur but youre still here
not my doing
his chest suddenly heaves forward and were on
as hes jolted by defib pads
hes in the back of a
paramedics are soaked in sweat
one looks a bit like a young dr
heart monitor is flat line
theres little hope
the ambulance moves through a city that is transforming
from this worlds los angeles to a barren hell version
officially i was dead for seven minutes
but believe me seven minutes in hell is a lifetime
ambulance heads toward that dying red sun
flat line on the monitor suddenly spikes with a pulse hennesseys hand jerks back from the plastic
his eyes fix on isabels wrist
that odd circular symbol is back
hennesseys unsettled quickly shoves the drawer closed
he rushes out slams right into a security guard coming in
hey whatre you doing in here
guard looks back into the body room sees a drawer partially open
he walks over pulls it out further sees the plastic cut away
the symbol has already faded from isabels wrist
when i returned i didnt just see demons anymore i could do the one thing they couldnt come and go as i please
runs as fast as a very obese man can aiming for that phone booth on the corner
he grabs the receiver punches numbers as fast as he can
ring ring be there john
something shivers up hennesseys leg and into his body
eyes glaze over and hennessey settles on a restaurant
heaven and hell are right here behind every wall every face the world behind the world
its crossing over thats the real trick
thats why most demons can only whisper in our ears
but even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare
hennessey barges in squeezes past the maitre d
sir you need a reservation
but hennessey is on a quest
and its everywhere
he starts grabbing meals right off of plates
fish pasta prime rib
shovels it all in
patrons are yelling screaming
hes eating as if his life depended on it
and even though hes devouring anything in sight this huge man is wasting away before our eyes
in the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal
hennessey hijacks a food cart consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner
he grabs a steak from a womans plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm
she screams as her husband pulls her away
hennesseys strength is withering away
desperate he grabs a fork digs it into his own hand
a hispanic busboy rushes into the room grabs onto hennessey
but the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here the ones that are half human so they blend in
balthazar stands throws a few bills on the table and starts toward the back exit
just like those with the angels touch living alongside of us
the half breeds
that busboy lowers hennessey to the floor
for a moment we see him framed against the front doorway
and in that instant we get a brief glimpse of an incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light
busboy looks up meets balthazars eyes
balthazar grins flips that coin between his fingers
he leaves out the back exit
they call it the balance
i call it hypocritical bullshit
so when one of them gets a little cocky peddles their influence or hijacks a soul i deport their scaly ass right back to hell
takes a sip of tea i dont get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement
sounds like youre trying to buy your way into heaven
well what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you
not a serene image at all
angela studies him
i mean many go to hell why were you able to escape
sips tea i dont know
god has a plan for all of us
not for me
johns bitterness is obvious
angela just stares at him finally isabel saw things too
john looks up
moment is lost when her cellular rings
the cop in her reacts flips it open
detective dodson here
the morgue is seen across the street
the guard that chased hennessey is just outside
security guard spotted him near the body chased him out
we move past angela standing with weiss
around them is a complete shambles of fine dining he comes over here makes a run at the entire menu and pow deflates like a fricken macys day balloon
come to rest on johns shattered face
he stares down at hennessey
now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones
only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now
john leans down to the remains of his friend
a cop starts to intervene but angela blocks him
let him be
john has trouble taking this in reluctantly reaches into hennesseys coat pocket finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend
thats even more crushing
sympathetic why didnt you call me you fat sonna bitch
john lowers his head then spots blood stains on one of hennesseys hands
he opens the fingers studies the fork wound
the blood is already drying over it
john reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube
he pushes it into hennesseys hand wiping away the dried blood
it quickly becomes apparent this isnt random stabbings
this is a shape
john takes a napkin lays it on the palm and presses
residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin
its the same circular symbol we saw on isabels wrist
john doesnt know what it is but he knows its important
to hennessey rest in peace father
with a loud crowd and huge pin machines grinding away the noise back here is deafening
but this is beemans home
see the desk the tv
the fold away bed
beeman is on the phone
theres a conversation but its way too noisy to hear
all we see are the emotions on beemans face
no doubt news of hennesseys death is one of the biggies
beeman quickly reaches for a marker puts it to paper and starts drawing listening and drawing hes finished hangs up
stares at the symbol
that cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention
i need to see where isabel died
graffiti adorned walls give way to a tall iron fence heavily shadowed grounds and finally the six story hospital complex of ravenscar
a rim lit figure stands on the roof
but this one isnt wearing a hospital gown hes wearing a trench coat
seances crystals channeling
our father thought she was just trying to get attention
she certainly did that
angela stands behind john
a large water tank is anchored to the roof next to her
note the flame logo
shed tell everyone about things she said she saw
things that hadnt happened yet
shed scare my mother to death talking on and on about revelations and the end of the world
then one day she just stopped
never said another word
so you put her in here
angela doesnt need to be reminded
it hurts even more now
show me her room
john and angela head toward isabels room
a nurse appears from around the corner walking with a boy
its barry the boy in the courtyard
he locks on angela and when she makes eye contact he breaks away from the nurse runs toward her with arms outstretched
he runs right into angelas arms hugs her tight
angela is totally baffled
john is thoroughly intrigued
she rushes in gently tugs the boy away
no barry thats not isabel
barry stares at angela
he reaches out touches her face confused
nurse pulls him back even further
they were friends
he kind of had a crush on your sister
angela nods understanding
the nurse leads barry away
he doesnt take his eyes off angela the entire time
neither does john
you were twins
angela nods steps inside
john pauses thinking
john steps inside gives the sterile room a thorough scan
so how long
beat this time
he pulls out a drawer looks at the bottom
i already did all that
john runs his hands under the steel bed frame
now youre insulting me
you dont walk off a building without leaving something behind
you saw everything she left behind
in that box
maybe she left something else
something more personal
just for you
angela doesnt like that look hes giving her
you were her twin angela
twins tend to think alike
im not like my sister
but you were at once time
when you were kids
when youd spend every waking hour with each other
youd start a sentence shed finish it
youd get hurt shed cry
that was a long time ago
that kind of bond doesnt just disappear
theres nothing here
angela seems unbalanced
john gets more aggressive
she planned her death in this room she thought it up right where youre standing angela backs away
she knew youd come she counted on you to see what she saw to feel what she felt to do what she did
what did she do angela
how should i know
what did she do angela
i dont know
what would you do
angela backs into a wall
nowhere else to go now
what would you leave her
what would it be
where would it be
where would it be
angela lashes out shoves john hard pushing him out of her way
she turns to the window almost hyperventilating
john stays back watches
angela opens her eyes
the tension seems to flow right out of her when she sees the tree
a lone tree stands in the center of the lit courtyard
john and angela approach it
john drops lower on the tree to a childs height
finally sees something near the ground gestures to angela
she kneels down next to him sees what he sees
that same symbol
the one hennessey carved into his hand
but this time theres more
trying to rationalize there must have been a tree in our backyard
when we were kids
john may not be buying it but hes not saying anything
his fingers trace these words carved below the symbol cor
shaking her head there is no h act in corinthians
johns face goes pale i need a church
several families sit in solemn prayer
the pastor comforts a man and wife
john and angela slip through head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall
corinthians goes to acts in the book of ethenius
its like a dark mirror of the bible
it paints a different view of revelations says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of god but be reborn in the embrace of the
theres a difference
depends on which side of the fence youre standing
john stops casually sticks his hand in the pastors bowl of holy water near the altar
so why havent i seen this book before
because it doesnt exist here on this side
john closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to what do you mean flickering candlelight slows to a stop catching angela mid question and the room in
that dim half light
john turns and is inside
the epitome of blasphemy a church in hell
only they dont worship god in here
and thats not christ on the cross
and those stained glass windows are now slate black
john is now facing books with completely different markings
he searches as a drone rises in pitch and an inky blackness begins to flow down the walls getting closer to john with each heartbeat
he finds the book steps back as he closes his eyes not here on this side
john turns covered in sweat
hes holding a book shes never seen is already flipping through it
where did that come from
stopping to read
skimming to this the sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son
john stands his brain going into overdrive
symbol isnt a demons
thats why i couldnt place it
not a normal possession
john what are you talking about
but he cant cross over impossible for the son to cross over
the other one
off her look lucifer had a son too
beeman sits under the glow of a desk lamp
the narrow alley of machines stretches out behind him
he stares into the scrolls an ancient book with a single page folded a thousand times
turns another page
amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when its closed
rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of beasts
beeman has stopped turning pages
thats because hes now staring at an etching of the same symbol
below are ink drawings of a ghastly beast rising up through a body
but its whats above the beast that is most troubling
a figure on a cross his arms outstretched seemingly welcoming the beast into this world
this is not good
bowling ball hits a lane
beeman spins to the sound
ball rolls round and round closer and closer until it clangs dead against the back wall of one of the lanes
beeman gets up starts down the corridor of dormant pin machines
he stops at lane leans way way down past the machinery and peeks out the pin hole
angelas suv races quickly through traffic while john gets her up to speed
the myth says mammon was conceived before his fathers fall from grace but was born after
but unlike his old man hes never been in the presence of the creator so he has no fear of him no respect either
that goes double for us gods most prized creations
mammon would be the last demon wed ever want crossing over
but demons cant come and go thats what you said
unless they found a bridge
off her look some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit shed pull out
but even a bridge wouldnt help mammon
because to cross over the myth says hed still need the one thing he could never get
the help of god
angela sits back letting that sink in
so its impossible
sure its impossible
thats what makes it so dangerous
these things exist to break the rules to find the loopholes
if the past is any indication then the future isnt on our side
john sits back gut churning
angelas in detective mode
thats why she killed herself
but it doesnt make sense
makes sense to me
john she sacrificed herself to beat him
why is she in hell
one of those rare moments where john has no answer
something small and shiny is rolling down the alley
it lands in the trough spins round and round beeman leans out to try and see what it is
the silver object keeps spinning
he waits for it to stop swats a fly near his face
book on his desk ignites in flame
suv pulls into the empty parking lot
john is out before angela gets it in park unlocks the side door
a few flies escape to freedom as he opens the door
john rushes in
only a low hum pervades the dead stillness of the alley
john grabs the door that leads behind the pin area
its locked from the other side
pounds on door hey beeman
the low hum fluctuates sounds like a buzzing
maybe hes not here
hes always here
several more flies flit by him
this time john notices turns and spots the source of the hum a cloud of flies near the center aisles
angela follows his gaze spots them as well
john heads across the lanes
swarm gets thicker and thicker
angela keeps up with him covers her mouth
they approach the pin area of the center lane
the source of the swarm is slowly revealed
in the catch trough is a solid mound of flies
john leans closer spots a hand protruding from the mound
oh jesus no he rips his coat off flings it at the mound and million flies scatter revealing the body of beeman
flies pouring out of his mouth his ears stepping back oh god john goes ballistic screams to the walls who are you
goddamit reveal yourself
i summon you
he angrily rips his sleeves up revealing two distinct tattoos on his forearms
slams them together with all his might clenching his eyes tight concentrating veins in his arms and neck bulge look ready to explode
angela steps back in awe as the air around his outstretched arms begins to warp to tear a faint hole from the bowling alley right into another world right here
darker hellish into the light i command thee
into the light i john is choked by a cough cant finish arms separate and he buckles to his knees reveals to angela just how ill he really is
she leans down to him sees hints of blood on the floor
this is my fault
i sent them in
i sent them right to their deaths
a damn one man plague
john you need a doctor
ive seen a goddamn doctor
angela glares at him understands now
john stands almost stumbles
angela tries to help
get away from me
stay the hell away tortured look to her please he uses the handrail to walk away
angela stands there confused by her own emotions
she turns back to the carnage hears the distant sirens
john sits in his opened window simmering
he holds a lit cigarette but doesnt dare put it to his lips
outside the city goes about its unending churn
down on the street are several police vehicles
engines start and they drive away
swirl of blue and red lights flash across johns moist eyes
there were no trees in our back yard
john finds angela across the room in his doorway
but you knew that already didnt you
john meets her eyes
sees the questions piling up
walking towards him you see something in me
something isabel had
go home angela
i need to understand john just shakes his head
because you open up to that world youre inviting whatevers out there back in
thats what happened to isabel
im not isabel
no she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why youre still alive
stick with me thatll change
john gets off the window starts walking away
and i dont need another ghost following me around
dammit john they killed my sister
that stops him cold
i cant let them get away with that
even if it means going down the same path she did
now if you wont help me get there ill find my own way
but i wont run
the two stand there locked in this moment
john cant believe this day looks her dead in the eye
you do this theres no turning back
you see them they see you
angela never blinks as she nods in agreement
pushing slowly through a lifeless apartment drawing closer to the opened bathroom door
water is pouring
do i take off my clothes or leave them on
a beat john
on is fine
john fills a year old porcelain bathtub
angela stands in the center
its the universal conduit
lubricates the transition from one plane to another
now ask me if theres water in hell
john turns off the faucet
angela grabs his shoulder for balance lowers herself
when shes sitting the water is all the way to her neck
normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course
teeth chattering what will i see
his eyes say it all
gesturing the depth lie down
you have to be fully submerged
for how long
as long as it takes
here john cups the back of her neck holds her face just above the water as she lowers down
her breathing is picking up
john leans over the tub looks straight down at her
off her look take a deep one
angela takes a deep breath holds it
john pulls his hand away and she settles to the bottom her eyes riveted on his the entire time
a silent john ripples above
his hand grips her arm skin to skin
angela lies there and panic sets in
she starts to surface but john pushes her head back to the bottom holds it firm
her eyes dart about
air is running out
she cant hold her breath much longer
its not working but the rooms lighting begins to pulsate as if the current were ramping down
it slows to that dim half light as johns eyes close
a single blink
angela is lying in now boiling water screaming for all of her life
water muffles the sound but not the fury
huge tub shudders hard snapping out of the hold down bolts
john is stunned how powerful is this woman
another scream and the inch thick tub cracks
water starts streaming onto the tile
john lunges grabs angela and pulls her up from the water her muffled screams shattering the air as her mouth breaks the surface
she slams hard against his chest arms wrapping tight fingers digging into his back leaving marks that might just scar
tub gives way and the damn breaks
john and angela go down hit the tile as one water washing over them both
angela lies there on top of john
she looks up him eyes filled with revelation
all those people
john nods helping her understand
ive always known
where the bad guys are
where to aim when to duck
its not luck
ive always known
tears stream down her cheeks
john reaches out to touch her when her eyes clamp tight in pain angela
eyes snap open and shes off him in a second runs out
john pries himself from the tile goes after her
angela runs behind the vertebrae of machines dripping water the entire way
john tries to keep up
it was rolling toward him not a ball something smaller
she stops kneels to the floor
john walks up to join her
something glints in the catch trough
she reaches down plucks it up and brings an odd coin into view johns face contorts with rage as he takes the familiar coin
beemans bowling bag is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table
powder bugs and bullets go everywhere
john retrieves the odd tipped bullets
those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also
are removed from a display cabinet
theres the pure platinum flask of divinity the petrified husk from the river of life the hollow shaft of an iron cross all striking pieces individually but when twisted and
locked together form a very imposing
he swings the cross down pours a pound of blasting powder into the husk chambers a special bullet into one of the ten barrels snaps it shut turns and fires
bullet leaves a trail of flame as it streaks across his endless apartment blasts the center out of a carton of lucky strikes
settle on the surgeon generals warning burning away
can you kill him
what about the balance
john is stuffing the bowling bag while angela watches now dressed in dry clothes
that shirt is johns
that half breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends
im just adding a little counterweight
john lifts that holy shotgun ka chick what about me
i cant stay here forever
john turns to her locks on those eyes
he reaches into his coat pocket as he walks up to her
she shudders as his arms wrap around her face and for a beat theyre cheek to cheek
when he pulls back she sees he has clipped hennesseys amulet around her neck
think of it as a bulletproof vest
so im going
knows he cant win youre staying in the car
fat ass tires burn under the full torque of a hemi
a jet black s barracuda blasts from the basement garage of lanes slides onto the streets of l
angela hangs on as john grabs the skull shifter knob slams into nd leaves another layer of tread behind
flying over the ocean a roars right over us
dipping out of cloud cover it reveals the coast of a sprawling metropolis stretched out miles below
the big donut the occult bookstores the chevy sign that mission in the park
this is actually the pov from johns barracuda
he downshifts drifts past a building with a facade of pre stressed concrete and huge gold letters bzr this shouldnt take long
elevator opens and john steps out into a lobby of concrete and glass
pretentious design screams money
lots of it
since trading is still a half hour away the place is practically empty
across the room a stainless steal door hisses open
john looks the other way as a security guard exits
thick door glides closed seals with another hiss
no way in
john notices the janitor down one hallway
its nico from midnites
he and john lock stares
nico opens a security only door steps inside leaves the door open
monitors are powering up around the room
a few of those young businessmen we last saw at midnites are here
into phone hey early bird is a fat bird know what im sayin
balthazar walks through looking every bit like the smug and successful businessman he is
he stops at a long mirror on one wall
adjusts his collar his hair
what are we pushing today sir
as balthazar admires himself his reflection distorts slightly
the demon in him
he touches his face does a vowel stretch
his face distorts even further
thats got him moving closer to the mirror
balthazars concerned because now his skin appears in motion rippling as if liquefied
and just when he sees the surface of the mirror blistering and starts to move one way glass explodes outward on the front edge of a fireball sending balthazar flying
with glass and flame
john stands on the other side in an access channel that dragons breath flamethrower now duct taped to his holy shotgun
hows he doing it
john steps into the trading room eyes balthazar rising from the floor
suits in shreds half his face is burned off but now hes pissed
this is in direct violation of the balance
screw the balance
john hits him with another blast of flame pins him hard against the wall
balthazars young turks attack
one leaps over the trading station
john swings around aims the shotgun boom half breed is blasted midair
the other turk seems to defy gravity as he scampers across the ceiling
john aims up pumps several rounds steps out of the way as a body falls smashes into a desk
boom boom thatll keep it down
angela hears the gunshots
cop instinct takes over and she gets out of the car
checks the amulet
john turns his attention back to balthazar doesnt hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame
suit and skin is peeling off revealing something else underneath
the true form
hows he doing it you half breed shit
john swings the flame aside so he can kick balthazar against the wall
but now his weapon sputters
charcoal hand thrusts out bats away the shotgun and grabs john by the throat
balthazar rises from the ashes
he may be burned but hes one tough son of a bitch
balthazar slides john up a wall by his neck
john cant break his hold
hes choking frantically rummages through his coat pockets
comes out with those sacred gold knuckles on his right hand
balthazar tightens his grip and john swings clocks him across the face
the enhanced punch sends a dizzying ripple throughout balthazars body
but he doesnt let go
john is choking starts whaling on him
again and again each punch weakening this demon more
john finally gets him against the wall
right arms tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand and with extreme pleasure continues punching away
drives balthazar to the floor right to the brink of death
he leans up winded
watches in delight as balthazar strains to take his final breaths
i will see you very soon
not really no
you cant cheat it this time
youre going back to hell
but youre not
john removes that small black box from his coat
balthazar tries not to be concerned until john unlatches it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses a bible
what are you doing
im reading you your last rites
this isnt good
your remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind
arent you half human
balthazar doesnt have to answer
you see that makes you eligible to be forgiven
you do know what it is to truly be forgiven
to be welcomed into the kingdom of god
balthazars worst nightmare
a demon in heaven love to be a fly on that wall
youre not a priest you have no power
i escaped hell who else do you know that has the power to do that
balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs
just tell me how mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole
balthazar isnt convinced
john stands raises the bible and starts to read may the merciful god have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins
he places a hand on balthazars forehead
balthazar glares at it as johns voice rises with commanding authority
whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven
i absolve you from it may not even work
hows he doing it
balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him
bellowing out grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the father and the son and the holy gh sangre de dio
john is stunned did he hear right
what killed the son of god will give birth to the son of the devil
johns mind races and he finally puts it together
hes found the spear
balthazars expression confirms it
its tucked between the folds of an airlines blanket
over com ladies and gentlemen weve been cleared for landing
please make sure your seats are in their upright and locked position
hand comes in grips the relic
widen to see
prisoner in an aisle seat trying to keep calm
he looks behind him as if being watched
just nerves again
over com we should be on the ground in los angeles within ten minutes
angela moves through the gathered crowd looking up at the building
as she makes her way through the amulet brushes against bodies swinging from side to side
angela suddenly stops in the center of the street turns
she stares at her surroundings with an increasing sense of dread
then hears the rumble and tires screeching
angela spins spots johns barracuda exploding around the corner
it barrels up the street and slides to a squealing stop in front of her
passenger door swings open
what happened to staying in the car
you were in danger
well now theres a premonition
sirens crack the air
angela jumps in and john peels balthazar is taking his last breaths when the sound of wind filters through the room
he looks up as a shadow drapes across him
one more chance
shadow darkens and his decimated form shudders
jesus didnt die from being nailed to a cross
john takes a turn at as angela stares into johns bible
he was finished off by a soldiers spear
he points in the bible at a detailed painting of the event jesus hanging on the cross being pierced by a soldiers spear
it matches that childs drawing john removed from the fridge now lying on his seat
im catholic john i know the crucifixion story
then you know what this spear would mean to a demon trying to cross over
the stains on its edges
angela looks back at the painting notes the liquid flowing from jesus wound
angela cant believe it mammon needed divine assistance hows the blood of gods only son
angela sits stunned for a moment
so thats it hes got everything he needs to escape
glances at her twins
angela gives him a look
something in the rearview mirror catches his gaze
here we go john floors it and angela glances out the back window spots something in the traffic bounding over vehicles hitting the pavement on all fours what is that
a hound on the hunt
a blur of muscle and bone leaps over cars at incredible speed denting in roofs cracking a windshield causing general chaos
cars brake slide into each other
and still this thing keeps coming
hang on barracuda slides into an alley races toward the other end
angela looks back sees their pursuer enter the alley
it makes huge strides along the walls defying all manner of physics
the beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the building
i lost it
bam something lands hard on the roof denting it a good foot
a huge clawed talon punches into the sheet metal starts shredding it right over angela
talon thrusts in
angela dodges it her amulet swinging wildly
john hits the brakes and the beast flips off the roof and onto the hood right into view
a muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably balthazars
he lashes against the windshield with an extra appendage
thank god for safety glass
he jerks back his embedded talon pulls the entire windshield out with it smashing it on the hood
glass particles explode into the car
john throws the car into a spin slamming the barracuda into several parked cars
balthazar is uprooted is thrown from the car
angela looks back sees balthazar rolling into traffic
hes down hes not down
gimme your phone
angela pulls out her cellular
a british couple sit in the back of chazs taxi staring out at the seedy side of town as if it were wild kingdom
they mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but theyre still very much animals
british woman takes documentary photos
chazs cellular rings over the buzz of a dispatch scanner
this is a private line john
chaz where are you
rd and figueroa
you still got that sedrallus
glancing to couple yeah but im kind of busy right now john
dammit chaz im trying to save my ass here
under his breath what else is new
remember the chalic of enook incident
remembering oh no no no not that i just paid off this car
west side of the rd street bridge say
he checks the speedometer mph
im five blocks away
as john clicks off john
chaz downshifts stops in cloud of dust sorry tours over
the british start to argue
john heads toward the skyline now at mph to the rd street bridge on the horizon
angela scans behind them cant believe her eyes
here comes balthazar through traffic on all fours john hes back and hes gaining
of course hes gaining
john punches the gas to the floor
chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge
he screeches to a stop across the roadway opens the glove box grabs a velvet wrapped object and pulls a glass vial out of it
inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid
chaz jumps out runs to the back of the car pauses when he hears the sound of a straining engine
here comes the topless barracuda over the bridges arched roadway
and what the hell is that running behind it
shit shit shit
chaz twists off the gas cap drops the vial into the tank
he pulls out his beeper rips the cover off exposing the electronics
he wedges the beeper into the tank inlet then starts sprinting off the bridge while john gives angela the number
taxi in view
angela punches in the number
they rip past the taxi
here comes balthazar up the bridge
like a supercharged cheetah running full stride
and not even winded
balthazar is almost to the taxi john waits then
angela punches the last digit as balthazar leaps to jump the taxi beeper contacts buzz spark gas ignites explodes right under balthazar in a tremendous fireball
initial impact only kicks him higher
its when the sedrallus in the tank truly ignites that the real fireworks begin
balthazar is caught in a haze of brilliant red particles that tear his body apart in midair
his final shriek is chilling
john smacks the wheel victoriously looks over to angela who sighs with relief
his expression changes as he centers on the empty necklace dangling around her neck
wheres the amulet
wham something reaches through the roof hole and jerks her right out of the car
john slams the brakes home car spins and john is already jumping out before it comes to a stop
he runs to the rail
running up what the hell was that
both leap onto the concrete rail lean over and spot a huge winged shadow just as it disappears below the bridge
chaz is speechless as he turns to john
this is too much
john gives him the out hes been waiting for were even
chaz nods and john leaves him at the rail
he jumps back in the barracuda and peels out
chaz watches him race away looks back at his burning taxi
prisoner walks out of the terminal here at last
he stares at all the vehicles at his disposal
a family crowds around the back of a minivan
wife hugs the dad
watches him from behind
prisoner turns looks back suspiciously
walks out to the street slides into the minivan tears away
kids toys tumble across the seats
john bursts through a door midnite right on his heels
mammon has been trying to climb out of his fathers shadow for eons
and this time he might just make it
unconvinced because hes got the spear
and the bridge
youre giving this girl way too much credit
you dont know her
and you do
that would be a first
john swings open a storage room door looks in at large scale relics statues props etc
wheres the chair
the delicate little number from sing sing
midnite just stares at him
its a fine line that separates a hero from a fool
ill take my chances
and taint my establishment with your blood
i dont think so
midnite you know what that device can do to the ill equipped midnite and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute where the
hell is the chair you dumb shit
midnite just stands there his body inflating past its seven feet
john knows he went too far
that was the cancer talking you know that right
holds up his finger once
fluorescents flicker reveal boxes of toilet tissue cooking supplies etc
and sitting in one corner by the huge power transformer is
heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last time
yeah its an electric chair right out of sing sing
whats in your bathroom a renoir
i have insurance issues
john clears off the seat starts to sit
midnite blocks him
you havent surfed in decades
like riding a bike
he tries again
midnite blocks him again
youll be lucky to reach an elemental plane
then just increase the juice
john tries again
again midnite stops him
in your condition your body wont take much
i just need enough rope to find her
and if you do what then
one goddamn problem at a time john shoves past him plops his ass in the huge chair
his feet dangle off the ground
midnite stands by wont help
so john starts strapping himself in the chair
his chest his ankles
he obviously cant strap the other
he looks to the big man
you want me to sign a waiver
midnite sighs finally straps the other wrist in pulls it tight
hang on angela
moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky
below her the city of angels sweep past
her eyes drift open and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality the city is on fire
its a repeat of isabels prophetic vision before she jumped
listen to my voice inside
midnite kneels in front of john who is now handcuffed to the chair cables draped from every limb
ill try and guide you out
mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in he would have fallen back to hell
no hes still here
im sure of it
then watch yourself
he could be in anyone out there
midnite lifts a palm of insect wings in front of his face
what happened to using lilac pedals
midnite cranks the juice on the panel as he blows and john reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind
his head slams back against the slats
his skin ripples from the force
stay on his face as the sound of power courses through john
peter do caelis deus misere nobis
fili redemptor mundi deus miserere nobis
a flash turns into a streak behind johns face stretching to infinity
find the possessor and the spear will be revealed
find them and follow
the flash whips back toward us and john is suddenly somewhere else
he looks o
from that mysterious pov we watch the prisoner hold the spear for the first time
like before he turns and looks behind him where john now stands
john centers on the spear in the prisoners hand
that same mysterious pov of the prisoner in line
he turns as he did before and its john behind him
prisoner turns away
mysterious pov is on the prisoner at the exit doors
he looks back suspiciously and theres john
prisoner turns heads to the minivan
of a minivan still smoking from a recent impact against a large iron entrance gate
prisoner is running from it glances back
john is there
watches as the prisoner enters the abandoned wing of ravenscar
how did he miss this
fifty beds with fifty patients
the prisoner kneels next to one of the beds
john walks over touches him and he rocks to the floor
body reveals the spear on the blanket of the bed
john reaches out to touch it when the boy barry suddenly sits up from under the blanket and grabs him by the throat
note the boys blackened fingernails
john struggles to pull him off but the boys grip is locked tight
john grabs at his hands chokes out the name johns hands suddenly become midnites as his ally pulls him back into johns face is held tight in the life saving
fingers of midnites grip
john gasps as he comes back nods to midnite and finally ravenscar
the abandoned wing
hes in the boy
winged shadow glides across the landscape sweeps across manicured grounds and rises to reveal ravenscar hospital
midnite piles assault rifles shotguns glocks onto a table
you know these wont kill them
john adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan
you probably wont even get close enough to use them
in the pan is that religious relic he brought from india
its now melting
midnite has trouble watching it dissolve
and its not just the boy
john coughs pours the melted gold into several small casting blocks
you better worry about whoevers helping him
john gives the big guy a glance dips one of the castings into a pot of water hissssss
as much as i admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of hell
is reaching a bit even for you
john stops the work centers on him and midnite just knows what hes thinking
midnite sighs heavily
well i suppose two fools can die just as easily as one
john almost smiles
hey you think im trusting you to save the world
john taps the casting and out falls a gold tipped bullet
but were going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside
john centers on the sparkletts bottles positioned around the room
just like johns
that ritual you do with the water can you do more than one bottle at a time
midnite raises an eyebrow
the motorized main gate is jammed opening and closing on a crashed van
the van the prisoner carjacked
the abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit night
vague figures move about near the emergency entrance
johns barracuda idles up with its headlights off
john stares out points up to the water tank on the roof
therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in the dimly lit room
barry stands waist deep in a large hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor
his skin is pale sickly looking
obviously containing mammon takes its toll
especially on a child
his hands are below his waist and now we see theyre lowering a still unconscious angela into the water
her face floats just above the surface as he buckles restraining straps around her wrists
front glass doors swing open and john and midnite calmly strut inside
hear the o
murmurs of an unseen crowd
this emergency room is crammed with people
most are crowded in front of a set of double doors
room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys
john steps from midnite raises his hands like a riot cop
okay lets cut the scratch and call it a night
thats got their attention
a few chuckle
john is surprised to see ellie stepping from the crowd
still that bundle of sexual energy
oh john you know how much i love it on this side
this was just an opportunity to make it permanent
you think his son will be any different
hell just turn this place into his own hell and then where will you to party heaven
no need to get nasty
never bothered you before
i am so going to miss our little trysts
ellie steps closer
the crowd starts to close in with her
im sure you will
john pulls out his lighter holds it up flicks it on
now turn around and take your friends with you
can he look more ridiculous
i will deport you
all of you
you know i can
john steps back up onto a chair thrusts the lighter higher
oh john this is embarrassing
where is your pride
right under a sprinkler head
go to hell
ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger
ellie and a room of half humans all looking up as water sprays from every nozzle
john and midnite tense because the first drops have no effect
a beat a spurt in the waterlines and suddenly shrieks fill the room as half human skin begins to fry
emergency lighting has snapped on throwing the room into a strobing nightmare of action
flashes of human skin melting revealing snippets of the true demons underneath
its total pandemonium as their rage is directed toward the only real humans in the room
john and midnite fling their coats open draw their weapons and starts firing away at the attacking horde
sacred bullets cause major damage wounds that ripple out through demon bodies
john and midnite slam back to back spinning under the protective shield of a showering sprinkler head shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture into the column of
one reloads while the other fires
its a hellish form of a turkey shoot
nothing sacred nothing spared
john goes for the double doors
midnite covers him blows away another two disintegrating demons
two come up behind and he spins takes them down
john gets to the doors starts to open them when ellie jumps onto his back nails digging in
im not going back there
we are what we are ellie john fires over his back loosens her grip
he grabs hold shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead sprinkler head
legs flail about
midnite comes out of the rain grabs john
john drops ellie to the floor
no more pretty face no face at all yet the screams still come
john and midnite get to the doors shove through
angelas body and face are completely submerged now
she comes to sees barry above her tries to rise but the boy pushes her head to the bottom holds it there
last bubbles are floating up from her mouth
barry places his other hand on her arm closes his eyes
holy rain has stopped in here
a fine mist floats in the air
john and midnite make their way through
only their footsteps on the tile break the stark silence
another set of doors is ahead
before they reach it a faint shadow crosses in the mist
both pause expecting something to reveal itself
but it doesnt
faint waves undulate barrys skin ripple from his chest down his arms and into a submerged angela
every muscle in her body tenses in stark relief
barrys image ripples above her in silence
room lighting starts to pulse slower and slower and when its caught in that dim half light angela jolts and this time we cross over into
angela is lying in a bone dry tank lifts her head up to see a room not much different than the one she just left
except for the sound
that low drone rising in pitch those demonic screeches scratching at the walls
and now those inky splotches begin consuming the color and light from the walls
moving in on angela
closer and closer whatevers coming is just about on her
angela spins and for a split second comes face to face with the hideous form of mammon
john and midnite burst into the room spot barry standing in the tank
his hands in the water
rushing toward him barry
barry looks up sees the two men rushing toward him
let her up
let her up
a beat as john meets barrys eyes realizes hes staring at a frightened child
barry backs away as angela sits up behind john
water rippling off straps dangling free
john turns locks on her black eyes
shit john thinks fast scans the area and sees every mirror in the room has been shattered
so much for the quick fix
he jumps into the water with her grabs her face and pushes her against the tank walls
this is an exorcism on the fly
amar natash bow basar
rescind from the flesh i command thee
angelas eyes snap open dark and dilated
john sees it clasps a hand over her mouth cutting off her air supply
back to hell asshole her body undulates as mammons shape tries to come through
pulsating through her arms her chest her face
angela bites into his palm
she shoves him off and john hits the tile hard
angela jumps from the tank pushes past in a blur
john spins to see midnite standing right there angela now firmly in his size twelve grasp
to john finish it
john coughs struggles to stand
he tries to cover but its obvious his end is nearing
midnite positions angela to face him braces her arms out from her sides crucifixion style
she tries but cant break free
john puts a hand to her forehead et separatur a plasmate tuo ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes
rescind from the flesh i command thee amar natash bow basar
angelas body stops fighting
the darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade
midnite is suddenly jerked backwards with an agonizing yell
angela is dropped slips into unconsciousness
john watches in horror as midnites pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an invisible grasp slammed into the ceiling then twisted and thrown with incredible force against
midnite glares at john tries to speak
but the words die on his lips
enraged john scans the empty room sees a large shadow on the ceiling that doesnt belong to any object
he holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those tattoos together into the light i command thee
into the light i command thee
it takes every ounce of johns life force to keep this spell alive and when hes about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light becomes
that familiar shape of wings
your ego is astounding
john strains to see the shadow become the real thing the majestic wings of an angel
john is too weak to even be surprised anymore
gabriel touches down in front of him
spear in his hand
and the wicked shall inherit the earth
you presume to judge me john
betrayal murder genocide
call me provincial
i am seeking to inspire humankind to be all that was intended
by unleashing hell on earth
gabriels wings fold behind as he walks around john
youve had it too easy for too long
so whats a few thousand years of pain right
you never deserved to be blessed
youve all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely unconditional love from your creator
and that just bugs the shit out of you
its not your fault
like the animals you are you never learn unless sufficiently prodded
pleasure has no lasting effect
but subject you to pain unpleasantness suffering and you will take notice you will fight to overcome to earn your redemption
that is when youre at your best
angelas fingernails are starting to darken once again
youre trying to teach us a lesson
no im giving you the chance to rise above the suffering and truly earn the love of god
a beat the road to salvation begins tonight
john just stares at this rogue angel centers on the spear in his hand
he makes a break for it
gabriels wings beat once
the gust blows john through the double doors back into the
where he smashes against a mesh screened window drops to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses
gabriel turns back to angela
he approaches her his rippling wings sliding up around her enveloping her pulling her in
those eyes of his could melt dracula
cant even stand let alone save the girl
it would be so easy to give up
to roll over and die
but instead he tries something he hasnt done in a long time
whispering i know im not one of your favorites
im not even allowed in your house these days
but i could use a little attention
john waits for nothing
his body crumples his cheek landing flat against the tile
glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him
as he stares at his reflection in one he gets the idea
begin to quiver
the color drains
blackness is waiting
slides his back up the wall as he reels in that shard of mirror
posture begins to change
mammons form ripples through her starts to push out through her skin
gabriel stands behind her his wings cocooned around her waist
whispering to her cross the bridge to your destiny
pulls up his sleeve exposes his old scar
he pauses a beat closes his eyes
stay on his face as he makes one swift slice movement
but hes in a rush here makes that same motion across his other wrist as well
with both wrists purging his life away john settles back into the corner and waits for the inevitable
reveals the spear
eyes are starting to close as
raises the spear over angelas chest
hear the sounds of a million demons inside of her ready to break free he holds the spear high above her chest readies for the final thrust as bulbs flicker
as current ramps down and time comes to a all were left with is a distant metallic drone like the reverberation of a gong struck a thousand years ago
john lies in that dim half light
something starts to swirl near him and just like that john is no longer alone
shadow falls over his pathetic form
the time has come at last to collect your soul
john pries his eyes open
youre the one show i wouldnt miss
so ive heard
satan sees johns slit wrists
i didnt think youd make the same mistake twice
john looks up at him
you didnt did you
so hows your son
and why would that matter to you
hes helping your son create his own hell on earth
well boys will be boys
he has the spear of destiny
satan didnt know that
now hes concerned
he studies this dying man
this is another one of your cons
go look for yourself
satan is still suspicious
youve waited twenty years for me whats another twenty seconds
satan contemplates his remark
metallic reverberation is overtaken as sound and motion ramp back to real time is about to be thrust into angelas chest
gabriel looks up spots him in the room
gabriel reacts pulls the spear toward her with all his might but satan is faster angela vanishes and gabriel has now pierced dead air
satan holds angela tight covering her mouth like john did
she struggles and the demon inside appears reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on the floor
the real mammon
say goodbye to the sun both of you
mammon shrieks and gabriels beautiful wings ignite in no
is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building to its foundation
a moment later
satan is back
john looks up gives him that look you owe me
satan hates admitting it but knows its true
what do you want
john shakes his head can barely utter a sound
what about her
you would give up your life so she could go to heaven
john manages a nod
closes opens eyes its done
angela gasps her first real breaths a strain
adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her eyes stretches out before us
and here come those two swings penduluming up in slow motion
young angela and isabel share that moment again
but this time isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing
her body sails up and away her fingers reaching out for what seems so close
isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky
time to go
john relaxes stops fighting the inevitable
satan takes his hand starts to pull him home but suddenly finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass
try as he might he cant budge john an inch
and now johns other hand leaves his side and as if weightless begins to rise toward something above
no sense in beating around the bush here john is in the embrace of god
satan sees this and recoils in absolute rage the sacrifice
this one johns rising hand drifts back down in front of satan the middle finger fully extended
satan goes rabid turns to pure energy for a split second
his hands remain on fire
you will live john constantine you will live so youll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in hell
you will live
satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into johns body john screams in agony
satan tears through his tissue collecting the cancer then ripping out a mass of diseased tissue with one vengeful pull
johns final blood curdling scream echoes over through every room
rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills beyond
on his hands and knees john takes that first breath
new lungs fill for the first time
not even a wheeze
face has renewed color
wrists have sealed tight
john is healed
he stands steps back inside the john stops over the body of one seven foot african warrior
he stands immobilized wrecked with emotion
a sound draws his attention to the one thing that could cause him even greater rage is hunched over near a wall
jagged cartilage stumps protrude from his back
a pattern of sinew and bone is burned into the floor behind him
its all that remains of his once majestic wings
john approaches spots blood dripping from the former angel
he realizes what this means
gets a kick out of it
gabriel looks up as john retrieves a gun from the wet floor
you dont deserve to be human
then pass judgment on me now
john raises the gun puts it to gabriels forehead
end my life
johns finger nudges the trigger
pull the trigger
be the hand of god
john pauses realizes whats happening here
and ill be condemned again
it takes everything john has not to pull that trigger
he lowers the gun shaking his head
youre even worthless as bait
john starts to turn away deny your true nature today but what of tomorrow of the tomorrow after that
it is only a matter of time before you end up right back where you belong
it is who you are constantine
johns fist starts behind his back gains momentum the entire arc until it ends abruptly against gabriels face
the ex angel is propelled all the way to the wall slams hard against the concrete
body crumples on impact slides down to the muck
you know this hurt like absolute hell
thats called pain
get used to it
john turns toward the double doors stops cold
huddled in the doorway covered in grime is angela and barry
the experience has obviously left them both drained
john walks across the room kneels down to them
thank you john
he nods beat
wipes a trace of blood off her brow puts a hand on barrys shoulder
hold a beat on this gritty family tableau
moving slowly past the inoperative device
past strangely shaped objects of platinum and gold with names and symbols that make a bit more sense now
huge sun beats down on a lone figure walking across a stretch of the most barren landscape on earth
he stops kneels to the heavily cracked soil
a hand comes in affixes an unseen object to a protruding rod
its weight causes it to drop out of frame but a moment later it rises back into view and finds a balance
john pulls back the protective hood from his face
healthy and tan with a new lease on life
he pops a nicorette tablet then unwraps rolls of cloth from around the spear of destiny
he drops it in the hole stares at it a long beat
the entire mechanism shudders
and now miraculously every globe every moon every obscure object in this miniature occult universe begins to rotate in complete sync
as it does the defining object finally slides into view
angela watches it rotate past nods in approval
john sighs finally sweeps mounds of soil over the sacred relic
he stands nods
a breeze blows past and john senses being watched
he spins and finds nothing
for a hundred miles
he starts walking
some people are born to make a difference
i had to die
walking right in step
something is closing in on her
a new taxi pulls up
chaz is driving
angela gets in
god does work in mysterious ways
john continues walking as something closes in on him at incredible speed
some people like it
our view rises over him and gliding across the barren landscape are the shadow of wings
some people dont
