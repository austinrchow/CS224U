words scrawl up on screen and we hear a resounding voice
in a time of great strife a legendary interdimensional being known as zordon came to the city of angel grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against
with the aid of his trusted assistant alpha the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force
in time of great need the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as zords
while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of legend earning them the title
the mighty morphin power rangers
we hear pumping rock and roll music as the power rangers logo bursts onto the screen
now the logo explodes revealing a prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky
the six power rangers tommy kimberly billy aisha adam and rocky sport sleek sky diving suits parachute packs and helmets
tommy is strapped into a high tech airboard
were outta here
once we hit the target zone weve got fifteen seconds to make the drop
step aside pinheads
bulk and skull push their way through the rangers decked in bizarre skydiving regalia topped off by world war ii leather caps and aviator goggles
the stealth eagle is about to fly
ditto for the swooping swallow
the rangers exchange amused looks
aisha gestures to them lead on flyboys
bulk and skull swagger to the door and open it the ground is a dizzying distance below
they swallow hard
whered the earth go
five seconds to the target zone
aisha you re on
bulk and skull step aside aisha launches herself
the others follow through the opening with flair
on your tail
all systems tommy and kimberly share an infectious glance kimberly a hand indicating tommy should go first
kimberly stands backwards in the doorway
catch you on the flipside
bulk and skull watch wide eyed as she back flips out of the plane
rock and roll fills the track as the rangers plunge towards earth executing a series of mind boggling maneuvers spins fishtails power dives back flips you name it
bulk and skull psyche themselves up
be the eagle
be the eagle
be the swallow
be the swallow
they take deep breaths then charge the door
naturally they get stuck wedged shoulder to shoulder
the pilot glances back chuckles and banks the plane
bulk and skull rotate into frame
now facing straight down they fall into camera clinging to each other desperately the rangers pull off more spectacular maneuvers then swoop together interlocking hands and forming a they look
to one another and a moment of pure magic passes between them
its not usual the exhilaration of flight theyre sharing it s the exhilaration of togetherness of being part of a team
they disperse and yank their rip cords
the sky bursts to life with six blossoming parachutes white pink blue yellow red and black in color
families eat hot dogs and cotton candy at a huge fundraiser
a large banner proclaims save the observatory
we see diving teams with labeled uniforms the bowling team angel grove p
and the fire department

congratulations the observatorys got a new lease on life
ryans comet is passing over in two days
the other rangers approach
whos up for lunch

last one to ernies buys
we hear a vociferous sissing sound but we cant see where its coming from
suddenly the six rangers come screaming around a corner on state of the art rollerblades
these kids are flying
we hear full throttled music as the kids weave duck and swerve like blading virtuosos
tommy leaps in the air does a and the high branches
past a large tree as bulk and skull drop into stealth eagle huh
the lame duck is more like it
the rangers glide around another corner theres buildings on one side of them and a construction site on the other
lets take the shortcut
tommy leads them up a plywood ramp they launch ten feet make spectacular landings on the construction site parking structure
as they shoot across the concrete the camera pushes in on ext
inner city consttzuction site day workers operating heavy machinery cranes bulldozer etc
construction worker jackhammers solid rock
drill makes a clanging sound as it hits metal
a baffled look comes over him as he stops the jackhammer brushes away debris
uncovering an ancient iron plate
he gapes at it too stunned to speak
a large hook has been fastened to the iron plate a crane engine roars as it hoists the plate up revealing a cavernous two more construction workers have joined the
first all of them look on in amazement
whadda you figure it is
hey ya got me
suddenly a purple steam pours from the opening
and now something really amazing happens
a menacing stone claw rises up cradling a huge stone ill be damned
as though drawn by its power he moves to touch it
reporter is talking into camera
were here at the world center construction site where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries
thru omitted we see the reporter then a few cuts of geologists combing the site with scanning equipment and cops sealing off the area with yellow tape
angel grove police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat
the injured workman was quoted as saying
the rangers are at a table tommy is teaching fred martial arts moves
its one smooth move and then youve gotta explode off the top
tommy executes a wicked jumping roundhouse kick
fred is wowed
he drops into position
nice and easy
the jovial proprietor ernie approaches the rangers table with a loaded tray
fred pulls off a dazzling jumping roundhouse kick and almost knocks ernies tray over
hey no karate on the patio

well tae kwan do it some place else
fred moves off as ernie serves the desserts
so whatre the plans for the weekend
i are checking out a new dance spot
i heard that
ill be at the observatory sunday
thats right ryans comet
we should throw a little comet shindig
any excuse for a party
aisha reacts to something off screen
the eagle has landed
bulk and skull swagger past followed by a group of kids
the earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye
we could smell its breath
ernie moves off after bulk and skull
tommys wrist communicator beeps
the kids exchange glances than look for a private area
theres a spot over there
they move out of everybodys sight
tommy into communicator whats up alpha
rangers we need you at the command center l
aisha gives kimberly a puzzled look
like right now
were on our way
they hit their wrist communicators and instantly transform into six iridescent columns of color
the columns shoot up through a giant oak tree knocking leaves loose
zordons remote headquarters protrudes from a craggy mountain top silhouetted by a glorious sunset
the six streak of color slice downward into the roof
everythings gone haywire buttons blink emergency lights flash theres a cacophony of electronic sounds
alpha works frantically amidst the array of computer banks while zordon looks on from his column of light
the six rangers materialize tommy turns to zordon
ay yi yi yi yi
our thermionic sensors have been hit by a cataclysmic surge of evil
rangers you must act swiftly
the planet is in grave danger
danger from what
six thousand years ago a morphological being known as ivan ooze ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror
finally a rebel factor known as the order of the meledon lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground
in a place that came to be known as angel grove
the chamber has been accidently uncovered
you must return it to the depths
or anyone should open it and ivan is released
to assist you i have retro fitted your helmets with new opti scan devices
use extreme caution rangers
you are dealing with an evil here that is beyond all comprehension
barricades and police tape surround the egg
a security guard passes his sleeping co worker drops into a chair sips his coffee
bzzwapp zedd rita goldar and a short fat furry creature named mordant appear
another saturday night and im traipsing around the galaxy with the three little pigs
my mother warned me this would happen
rita she said after marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel
why didnt i listen to her
zedd grumbles to himself
thats a good question
the stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy
you might wanna take a look at this
kurt looks up groggily
no need to wake him
in fact why dont you take a little nap yourself
zedd zaps the guys with a bolt from his staff they are knocked out
goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or mordants foot
mordant knocks on goldars metallic leg
hey bonehead get off my hoof
goldar is oblivious
zedd stands reverently before the glowing egg shape
after two thousand years of searching
i have finally found you
mordant bangs on goldars leg again
yo earth to bigfoot
goldar swats mordant
watch your mouth fuzz ball
rita to goldar where did you find this rabid little rodent anyway
mordants my second cousin three times removed on my mothers side
he s just visiting for the summer
well put a muzzle on him
mordant grumbles under his breath
meanwhile zedd aims is staff at the chamber and bursts a blast of energy
the egg opens up with a whoosh of decompressing air
webs of electricity branch out followed by a swirl of black smoke
when the smoke clears we see a bubbling purple phosphoscent ooze
the group gathers around rita sticks a finger in o the sticky substance
you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of as if in response the ooze boils and froths
zedd and rita are too busy arguing to notice this
dont you ever have anything nice to say
well if i did i certainly wouldnt say it to you
we hear a slithering slurping sound as the substance rises up and takes on the ghastly shape of ivan ooze
mordant tugs at zedd
for your information this is not just your average run of the mill tub of snot
youre trying to tell me there re different levels of snot
zedd and rita finally notice ivan standing with his lips apart revealing jagged teeth one of which is made of he stretches his sinewy arms releases an enormous yawn puts
his hands on his head cracks it
now he smacks his lips together opens his arms theatrically and gives his trademark stance
ladies and gentlemen
the ooze is back
hes so cute
zedd flashes her an angry look turns back to ivan
i am lord zedd sworn enemy of all that is good and decent
it is a supreme honor to finally meet you
ivan gives a slight bow
how can i ever repay you
do you recall the name
zordon of eltare
ivans face goes dark thunder rumbles and the site lights up with a flash of lightning
mordant turns to goldar
seems to ring a bell
i want you to destroy zordon so that my evil may once again reign ivan hissing i will not only destroy him i will obliterate his entire being
it will be like zordon of eltare never existed
finally a real man
goldar hands ivan a scrap of paper
heres his address
left off interstate
puzzled whats an interstate
its like a freeway
how long have you been locked up
we shall leave you to weave your wicked ways
now we go out on the town
first dinner then dancing then bzzwapp
the foursome de materialize
what is that odious stench
his eyes come alive
on cue the power rangers teleport into the construction site
theyre surrounded by rock piles pools of water and a plethora of building supplies
billy looks down at the mud puddle hes standing in
remind me to have a word with alpha about his teleporting calculations
they survey the construction site for a moment
anybody see anything
lets take a look over there
they advance up a slope the egg comes into view
rocky alarmed it looks like its been opened
the kids get close to the egg looking it over with fascination
suddenly a hand falls on aisha
they all whirl around and see the first security guard
he half smiles shaking his head
you had me scared there
makes two of us
you havent by any chance seen a
morphological being lurking around
the only thing ive seen is you teenagers
beat and you know
if theres one thing in the world i reeeeally hate
close on his face as it shape shifts into the hideous visage of its teenagers gross
youre too kind
allow me to introduce myself
i am the infamous world reviled universally despised ivan ooze
well pack your bags cause were sending you back where you came from
gee a teenager with a big mouth
not much has changed in six thousand years
were not just teenagers raisin head
were the mighty morphin power rangers
ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear
ooooh wheres my autoqraph book
he looks them over reproachfully
power rangers huh
so zordon is still using a bunch of rug rats to do his dirty work
and speaking of rats
ivan raises both hands electricity shoots out his fingers and the kids dive clear as the bolt zaps a throng of rats
now incredibly the rats grown into grunting snarling man from this moment forth the world as you know it shall cease to ivan raises his arms thunder crackles and lightning
rips an explosion of purple smoke consumes ivan
the rats attack
lets take these beasts
tommy gets off a stellar cross hock takedown kimberly delivers a world class heel stomp billy executes a lethal reverse handsword
despite their valiant efforts the rangers ar being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants
smoke pours from various circuit boards numerous control panels vibrate
alpha my sensors tell me the rangers were too late
ivan is on his way here
hey nobody enters the command center without a power coin
theres a bleet bleet emergency lights start flashing near the entrance
alpha watches forlorn as ooze seeps through the hairline cracks in the door
the ooze slithers and gurgles across the floor once again ivan rises up
he takes in the state of the art surroundings
pretty fancy shmancy
i guess if you invest your money well over sixty centuries you can buy something pretty nice
alpha drops into a karate stance makes some bruce lee noises then lunges
ivan holds his arm out zaps alpha with an electrical charge alpha starts spinning
welcome to wiener world
may i take your order please
you havent changed ooze
youre still picking on creatures smaller than yourself
ivan slowly circles zordans column of light zordon turns with him
put a cork in it z
ten minutes out of the egg and im already listening to one of your lectures
he explodes furiously you robbed me of my prime
i was the supreme ruler of the most foul empire in the universe
i was the king of calamity
the duke of destruction
the big man on campus
beat and then you came along
you locked me into your stuffy little hyperlock chamber and tossed me into the depths like yesterdays it worked for six thousand years
dont remind me
do you have any idea what its like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years
not to mention ive had a charlie horse since the renaissance
but now the tables are turned
ivan raises his hands he is holding a flute and he plays a few its time to pay the piper
he uses the flute like a lightning rod a bolt of lightning oh the things that i have missed
the black plague
he blows up another panel
the spanish inquisition
another bolt the s
he blows up another panel
ivan casts another lightning bolt and now finally i have the strength to destroy your pathetic powers forever
ive got a news flash for you now ivan begins to throw lightning everywhere laying ivan laughs in the b
as alpha continues to spin moving his arms in and out
you put your left probe in you put your left probe out you put your left probe in and you shake it all about
you do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around
two rats charge aisha and she leaps upward the pair smash into each other
rocky picks up a two by four and starts sparring with another rat
billy shoves a huge wooden spool down a slope and it one rat cracks its tail like a whip knocking adam to the ground
another rat gets kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a face
she grabs a handful of his whiskers
somebody needs a shave
she yanks them out the rat squeals and releases her
the fight well but the rats start to get the upperhand
the rangers click their power coins into their power morphers
they jump into the air and theyre engulfed in a dazzling golden light as we do a d movie version of their they all land and theres a whirring sound
as all six of the face pieces polarize so we can see their faces
the rats immediately scurry off
lets teach these vermin a few manners
activating power beam
a yellow beam slices through the darkness
aisha leads the group through the site
everybody stay alert
they pass a bulldozer some scaffolding hold it
they come to a stop
adam pointing i heard something over there
activating audio enhancer
an auto phonic receiver pops out of the side of billys helmet
as he turns his head the receivers rotate
sound effect we hear silence and then
a raspy breathing followed by a guttural snarl
theyre on the other side of that wall
the rangers advance along a cement wall slowly round a corner
aishas light pans through the gloom
anybody see them
activating power scope
a scope snaps into place over rockys left eye
we see heat sensor outlines pulsating with color
command lines vector and scan as rocky searches the area
eventually he looks up and the lines lock on to the pulsating forms of the creatures leap down and we see the rangers pull off kicks sucker punches spinback roundhouses
you name it
one of the beasts tackles tommy and the pair go tumbling own a twenty foot rock pile
aisha picks up a handful of dirt hey handsome
a beast turns aisha flings dirt in his eyes
she follows through with an over shoulder throw the beast crashes into a johnny on the spot
rocky fights another beast and the creature swings up through scaffolding with phenomenal dexterity
rocky goes after him
the talking saber appears in tommys hand
saba yawning what a dream i was having
weve got company
saba sees the rats
i hate rats
we hear a primitive cry as a beast slams into adam sends him catapulting
adam rises speaks in a low growl
bad move willard
he holds his hand in the air
the stega stinger appears in adam s hand
he aims it toward an overhang fires
a thin wire shoots out the stinger at the end pierces the overhang
adam leaps off a platform swings through the air like tarzan slams into the rat and sends him catapulting
a contraption appears in kimberlys hand and she throws her arm out a long ribbon swirls out and tangles itself around the rat
now you see em
she yanks the ribbon pulling the rat into an opening he now you dont
billy takes a hit rolls across the ground
he stops inches away from a twenty foot drop off
the beast charges him he ducks and the beast goes flying not the brightest of beasts
rocky is now up in the scaffolding
he drops ten feet through the air lands on one end of a board
theres a beast at the other end and he goes flipping through tommy throws saba saber and the knife swoops through the air and zings around the beasts as they
try to knock him down
na na na na na
the rats chase after saba as he heads into a water slicked area
theres a large power cable running across it
once all the rats are in the water saba kamikaze dives into the cable slicing it open with an eruption of sparks
the water sizzles with electricity and the rats go up in a puff of smoke
fried mice anyone
we see the six original small rats scurry away squeaking
suddenly theres an explosion of electrical activity and the rangers watch stunned as their costumes de materialize and they appear back in civilian clothes
whats going on
billy tries his wrist communicator
alpha come in
theres no response
wed better get back
they all hit their communicators and nothing happens
aisha worried somethings wrong
come on guys
they hurry off
the rangers climb a mountain path all of them looking alarmed
up ahead theres a pillar of black smoke rising from the command center
the place is trashed theres smoking debris ravaged panels exposed wires and mechanisms
the kids move through the wreckage in numb silence
tommy barely audible what happened here
adam spots alphas arm protruding from a mound of rubble
the kids quickly uncover the battered robot
alpha are you okay
ill get you my pretty and your little dog toa
he mustve blown an anitromic demodulator
kimberly stunned oh no
everybody follows kimberlys gaze thunderstruck expressions coming over them
laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is zordon
he is still a shimmering spectral being only now he s aged a good fifty years
the kids stand over him forlorn
whats happening to him
outside of his time warp hes aging at a vastly acellerated rate
we have to help him
zordon opens his eyes
thank goodness youre safe
the kids drop down beside him
we have to get you back inside your time warp
im afraid thats impossible
the power has been destroyed
the zords the weapons
all of it
beat the mighty morphin power rangers are no more
the kids are stunned
kimberly gently takes zordons hand
you cant leave us
ever since you came into our lives
youve been like another father to us all
you must be strong
ivan almost overthrew the planet once
and now im afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through
zordon closes his eyes
tommy puts a hand on kimberlys shoulder
the kids slowly rise all of them looking utterly despondent
billy turns to alpha
whatre we going to do
i do not like green eggs and ham
i do not like them sam i am
billy opens a panel on alphas back makes an adjustment
alphas head rolls back like hes going to sneeze
ah ah ahhhh choo
sparks burst from where his nose should be
rocky hands alpha a hanky alpha wipes his nose area
there has to be something we can do
come on guys think
aisha turns to alpha
is there any way we can defeat this monster
any way at all
perhaps there is a way
i have heard tales of another power
they say that somewhere beyond the hyperion constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension
how can we get to it
as the legend goes the power is impossible to obtain
we have to try alpha
its our only hope
alpha shakes his head
its far too dangerous
zordon would never allow it
if we dont try zordon wont survive
if ivan ooze isnt stopped nobody will survive
alpha heaves a sigh
ay yi yi yi
beat the legend speaks of a master warrior who lives on the planet phaedos
this is the only person who knows the secrets of the power
how can we reach phaedos
alpha heaves a sigh
zordons going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this
the kids exchange curious looks as alpha opens a compartment and removes a vile filled with radioluminescent energy
this is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions
it should be enough to get you there
he approaches a damaged panel loads in the vile
there is one problem
i only have enough reserve to send you phaedos
i cant bring you back
so how do we get back
alpha gives them a grim look
youll have to pray that the legends are true
alpha keys in coordinates
youre sure you want to do this
the rangers share purposeful looks
its our only hope
alpha shakes his head punches in the final codes
safe journey rangers
he pulls a lever
the kids transform into six streaks of color and blast ff through the ceiling
alpha shakes his head in despair
ay yi yi yi
thru omitted we see the six colored streaks blast away from earth and shoot past the moon
the camera moves in on zedds ominous palace which rises up out of the tortured landscape
zedd rita mordant and goldar are standing on the balcony
zedd rita and their minions are inside zedds dark palace goldar looks through ritas telescope as rita rants
rita outraged how could he let them slip through his hands
hes no better than the rest of the hired help around here
goldar looks up from the telescope
according to the tx tracker theyre headed for phaedos
im gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not gonna know what hit him
ivan sweeps regally into the room
hi honey im home
you garlic sucking dinglebrain
the rangers are going after the great power to zedd i thought you said this guy was the master of disaster
to ivan hes nothing but a slime infested jelly bellied blob of ivan snaps his hand a wad of ooze flies out splats rita across the mouth muffling her
rrgh mmffpprr brghuh
how dare you
nobody shuts up rita but me
sorry slick theres been a slightchange of plans
arms out in trademark stance the booger man is taking over
ivan drops regally into zedds chair
nobody double crosses lord zedd and lives
mordant slips behind goldar using him as a shield
zedds gonna kick this snotball into next week
zedd shoots a blast from his staff ivan is covered in sparks
ooooh that tickles
ivan raises his hands and the sparks disappear
he zaps rita and zedd and with a brilliant flash theyre gone
mordant moves to a snow globe on the table his mouth falling open
zedd and rita are inside it
rita wipes the ooze off her mouth rants in a munchkin voice
this is all your fault
if youd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to none of this wouldve happened
ivan turns menacingly to goldar and mordant
now you have a choice either serve me or join those insufferable cheesedongs
mordant and goldar exchange a look then turn back to ivan
we never liked the cheesedongs in the first place
couldnt stand them low class all the way
and did you catch a whiff of their breath
its like having a conversation with a couple of onions
not to mention
goldar throws a hand over mordants mouth muffling him
goldar apologetic hes just visiting for the summer
beat now what about the rangers oh hideous one
ah yes the rangers
he makes a hoarking sound then spits ooze onto the floor gasunteidt
now the ooze grows into ten tengu warriors bird like they gobble squawk and chirp like newborn chickens the cacophony growing louder and louder until
the tengu fall dead silent
tengu warriors you will fly to phaedos find the power rangers
and tear them apart
the creatures make horrendous squawking sounds as they spread mordant go with them and report back to me
you know boss id really like to help out but ive got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave one of the tengu grabs hold of mordant and
the flock wings off zedd waves his arms around in outrage
isnt this just typical
we finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens
from now on its e v i l no exceptions
rita optional line it just goes to show ya never go into business with a booger
the tengu warriors sweep toward us we see mordant dangling from one of the tengus talons
watch the hairrrrrrrr
he swings past camera and out of sight
thru a omitted the colored streaks of light shoot through the cosmos heading down toward the planet phaedos
its emerald green with two radiant golden circles around it
the streaks of color hit the jungle floor and only five rangers everybody okay
where s billy
the kids search the sky in a panic
alpha works frantically hitting buttons and levers
ay yi yi yi
the filamentary transistors have malfunctioned
sparks erupt from the panel singing alpha
why you low frequency battery operated alpha winds up and delivers a mighty kick to the panel
suddenly comes to life with bleeps and blips
the rangers continue scouring the sky as billy comes flying
he splashes down in a puddle
the others quickly gather around him
i think so
billy looks down at the puddle
this puddle thing is really getting on my nerves
they help billy up then take in the exotic jungle environment
they hear all sorts of exotic animal sounds
welcome to beautiful downtown phaedos
tommy gives them all an invigorating look
lets see if we can find this master warrior
he leads the team down a narrow path
ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with goldar taking over the world is one thing
its finding good help to run it for you thats the killer
you want me to place a few calls
ivan shakes his head
im going to use the young minds of angel grove
goldar digs for buried treasure deep in his nose
no offense boss but they might find you a little disgusting
yes well i suppose youd know a little something about that
beat not to worry
ill ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils
and what better way to entice them
than with a little ivans ooze
ivan approaches an enormous vat turns a tap it burps and glops as purple ooze pours out
but boss what about their parents
ah the old and doddering
im going to scourge their puny minds reducing them to zombies
and then ill put them to work rebuilding my empire
bulk and skull enter waving a help wanted flier
both them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses
i understand youre looking for a few new assistants
bulk does a g
well put your mind to rest cause now youve got the best
ivan doesnt look too pleased
what is this
i advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants
skull extends his hand
hi im brilliant
bulk hand extended and im good looking
ivan steps forward
and im little bo peep
bulk and skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look ivan
both of them swallow hard
why dont we give mr
peep here a chance to think it over
a stellar idea skull
they start to back away
not so fast greaseballs
goldar blocks their way
youll have to do
thru omitted the rangers move through foreboding jungle terrain their ears alert to all the unearthly sounds around them
tommy watches kimberly who seems to be lost in thought
kimberly glances up
kimberly takes a moment to answer
i was just thinking about zordon
everything weve been through together
you know meeting zordon
teaming up with you guys its the best thing thats ever happened to me
its the best thing thats ever happened to all of us
hes gonna make it guys
the others nod in agreement
well get this warrior
and send that slimeball ivan ooze back to the sewer he crawled out of
tommys words sink in
he stops suddenly sensing something
angle on mordant hiding behind a tree watching the rangers pass
theres a horrific screech the kids look up as the tengu its too late
the tengu attack with unbelievable ferocity they slash with their claws stab with their beaks and batter with their wings
rocky is hurtled into some bushes aisha is knocked against a tree adam splashes down in a small creek
mordant watches of this from the sidelines
he gets so excited that he starts throwing punches and kicks
he accidently punches a tree
one of the tengu gets kimberly in a choke hold tommy rushes to help her and another tengu trips him he tumbles head over heels down a slope
we hear an otherwordly cry as a small hunched figure wearing a tattered robe swings he proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle
he uses the sticks for weapons as he executes a roundhouse kick a scissor kick takedown a sitting side kick a roundhouse drop spin back kick a parallel block from
the outside a reverse handsword and so on
the creature punctuates the hits with an exotic variation of whats the matter with you woodpeckers
take this guy out
the tengu squawk and squeal as the little dynamo wails on them
the tengu warriors my butt
the tengu turkeys is more like it
finally the tengu retreat winging up through the trees
hey arent you bird brains forgetting something
one of the tengu swoops in and snatches mordant up
watch the meathooks
the rangers recover and exchange expressions of utter disbelief wow
that was amazing for such a little dude
the figure speaks in a hoarse whisper
beat now state your business
were looking for the master warrior
do you know where we can find him
the master warrior doesnt entertain visitors but we have to find him
our leader zordon is dying
now the most amazing thing happens
the figure rises to full height of six feet while simultaneously shedding its robe
underneath is a scantily clad stunning amazonian woman
were talking b u i l t
meet the master warrior dulcea
the rangers stand there with stunned expressions
dulcea looks to tommy
how did this happen
tommy just gapes
kimberly gives him a cold glance and thunks him one with her elbow
the lady asked you a question
oh uh we re ah
he was attacked by this horrific being ivan ooze
ivan ooze is free
we are all in mortal danger
she moves off the rangers just stand there staring at each other
let s go
the rangers quickly follow her through the brush aisha turns to kimberly speaks under her breath
kind of bossy isnt she
theres a label with a picture of ivan hes wearing make up to make him a little more presentable
dozens of kids ranging in age from eight to seventeen are swarming bulk and skull who have set up a booth with a large banner that reads free ooze
some kids stretch the ooze others mold it others throw it at each other
its an ooze free for all
boys and girls girls and boys gather round and feast your eyes
this aint sludge and this aint guck
this is the one and only ivans ooze
its ooey gooey and even kind of chewy
but best of all its bulk and skull run a booth
a banner screams ooze rules
kids crowd around
here you go
theres enough for everybody

skull ducks and bulk gets splattered in the face
bulk glares at skull wipes some goop off flicks it at skull

thru omitted an oriental garden set against a stunning hillside vista
the kids are seated on rocks by a lakeside all of them drinking from clay mugs
dulcea finishes handing out bowls
aisha stares into hers with a grim expression
theyre called squirbs
kimberly lifts out an eel like creature and watches it squirm between her fingers
mine seems to be a little undercooked
dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes
add a few dried weevils and youll never know the difference
the other rangers watch as billy holds one of the squirbs over his mouth and drops it in
he chews a few times lets out a not bad
listen we appreciate your hospitality but we really dont have much time
dulcea looks to tommy
what do you know of the great power
only that we need it to defeat ivan ooze
dulceas eyes move from ranger to ranger
it is said that to those who possess the power
all things are possible
where did it originate
in another time another dimension
it was brought here long ago by the nathadians a people who are now all but extinct
they built an impenetrable stone monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies
ominous for thousands of years beings from all over the universe have tried to obtain it
all have perished
dulceas words hang heavily in the air
so how can we get to it
the only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being
and how do we do that
by learning the ancient art of ninjetti
it is the genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the ninja
beat it is the perfect union of mind body and spirit
look zordon doesnt have much longer to live
and for all we know angel grove could already be under attack
we dont have time for this
as rocky is talking a flubbery looking snout works its way over kimberlys shoulder
she hasnt noticed it yet
you dont understand
if you do not have the ninjetti the power will destroy you
beat to reach the monolith we must traverse the neola jungle
we will train today and set out on foot tomorrow
the snout works its way underneath kimberlys chin she this is dulceas ant eater like assistant
he jumps up and down yammering and gesticulating
snoggle you watch your language
snoggle now re fills aishas tea cup
he wants to know if youd like a cube of sugar in your tea
we hear a phoot as snoggle blows a cube of sugar out his snout and it splashes into aishas tea
aisha stares at the cube a moment
the other rangers watch as billy holds one of the squibs above his mouth and drops it in
he chews a few times lets out a not bad
night has fallen on angel grove
we pan across a quiet middle class neighborhood settle on a two story house
we pull back to reveal its sitting on a table
mr kelman enters looks it over curiously
he picks it up opens it and sticks his finger inside
suddenly a crackling electrical current runs over his entire body
his face goes blank and his eyes momentarily glows purple
now he strides purposefully out the door
c thru omitted dulcea and the rangers are gathered around a bird bath stand with flames leaping out of it
in the language of the nathadians nin stands for man jetti stands for animal
ninjetti man and animal together as one
beat now put your hands inside the flame
it will not harm you
the kids hesitate a moment then reluctantly put their hands inside the flame
aisha makes a horrific expression
they remove their hands theyre filled with sand
now tell me
what do you see
aisha studies the sand for a moment it magically take on aisha bedazzled i see
a bear aisha you are the bear stalwart and bold
dulcea turns to rocky
his sand magically takes on the shape i see
rocky you are the mighty ape
we see each of them discover their animal
a fox close
billy you are the wolf cunning and swift
and now kimberly
she studies hers for a moment
it looks like a bird
i think its some kind of bird
kimberly you are the crane agile and sublime
thats gotta be a frog
adam you are the frog quick as lightning
and finally tommy
tommy you are the falcon winged lord of the sky
kimberly regards dulcea with true admiration
how do you know so much about the ninjetti
dulcea stands tall and proud
am the sole living descendant of the nathadians
beat now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal
fred enters the living room and searches for his dad
he heaves a frustrated sigh
fred enters the empty master bedroom a look of concern coming over him
fred comes outside as several kids approach all of them looking forlorn
you seen my parents
i cant find my dad either
whats going on
suddenly a wild kid wearing grunge clothes runs by howling like a banshee
hes holding a container of ooze in one hand and a baseball bat in the other
he smashes a couple of trash cans with his bat
ooze ooze ooze rules
the kid bashes in a mailbox then runs off
fred looks startled
that guy was the student body president thru omitted kimberly and snoggle observe as dulcea walks on her hands across a narrow bamboo log that spans a pond
a waterfall churns in the b
the crane maintains its agility through the perfect harmony of mind body and spirit
she leaps into the air does a round house kick lands perfectly on the narrow span
dulcea reaches the end of the log flips through the air lands flawlessly on the ground
kimberly heaves a sigh climbs onto the bamboo and start walking across balancing precariously on her hands
she gets about a quarter of the way loses her balance and falls into the shallow pond
snoggle laughs making a loud honking sound
kimberly recovers shoots him a look
lets see you do it
snoggle indignant ghun phnug gnouphl
he marches to the pole dulcea holds him back
snoggle we dont have time for you to show off thru omitted dulcea and rocky are standing at the bottom of a twenty foot pole with an exotic oriental carving
the ape is strong but more importantly it is flexible and free
dulcea now scrambles up the pole with the nimbleness of a spider
in less than ten seconds she reaches the top
rocky shakes his head in disbelief
who is this lady
now she slides down like a firewoman drops beside rocky
he takes hold of the pole focuses for a moment
it starts scurrying upward
he gets about fifteen feet in the air loses his grip plummets and slams to the ground
dulcea and billy circle one another fighting with spinning whistling sticks
dulcea is blindfolded billy isnt
the wolf relies on its enhanced senses to guide it
he can hear what we cannot hear he can smell what we cannot smell
billy takes swing after swing dulcea easily deflects every blow
now dulcea takes numerous swings thwacking billy repeatedly and finally knocking him into the water
dulcea adam and snoggle stand in an area filled with flying the frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target
then strikes out in the blink of an eye
we hear a trilling sound as dulcea watches some kind of insect dart around her
the trilling sound is gone
dulcea has literally caught the insect in the blink of an eye
adam shakes his head in disbelief
he waits a moment hears a tat tat tat sound and watches a insect zip around him
he lashes out numerous times missing the insect completely
with lightning speed snoggle vacuums the fly into his snout
crunch crunch crunch
adam speaks under his breath
aisha watches as dulcea goes into a bear stance
the bear is sturdy as a towering tree
nothing can uproot it
snoggle charges dulcea slams into her
she remains as rooted as a tree
snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily damage
girl youve got to be kidding me
snoggle recovers and faces aisha
aisha shrugs goes into a bear stance
snoggle charges slams into her and sends her d thru e omitted dulcea and tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of a dark lake
the falcon never struggles with the air but rather becomes one with it
now dulcea does the impossible
she leaps off the rock soars fifty feet through the air and lands on another protruding rock
tommy is stunned
dulcea calling out tommy psyches himself up
you can do this
you can do this
you can do this
he spreads his arms out leaps
and drops like a rock exploding into the black water
alpha fusses over zordon who is looking a good ten years older
alpha i am deeply concerned about the rangers
i told them it was too dangerous but they wouldnt listen
we must try to communicate with them
alpha looks out over the decimated command center
perhaps if i could locate a vertical deflector then i could assemble a holographic comlink
zordon shudders in pain closes his eyes
alpha watches over his mentor shakes his head in anguish
ay yi yi yi yi
dulcea leads the kids through a circular opening in one wall all of them look completely wiped out
she reaches an ornate doorway faces the rangers
each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts
only then will you know the way of the ninjetti
beat rest for a few hours
we will continue at daybreak
she heads through the door
so where are we supposed to sleep
snoggle points to the campfire
he pushes kimberly toward it making a na na na na na sound through his snout
he then hurries inside and slams the door
that guys cruisin for a bruisin
the kids approach the dying fire all of them limping a little
i can hardly walk
ive never been this sore in my life
they drop around the fire a few of them groaning
they stare into the orange coals for a long moment all of them looking disillusioned
do you guys really think we can pull this off
it takes a moment to get a response
maybe if we had more time
weve been relying on our morphin powers for so long
maybe weve forgotten how to rely on ourselves
theres a somber silence
we should get some rest
they all settle in for the night
a purple haze of smoke has settled on the construction site
suddenly mysteriously swarms of zombified parents emerge from the vapors we see mr
kelman amongst them
ivan steps forward followed by goldar
ladies and gentlemen simon says
all the parents stop
stand on one foot
all the parents stand on one foot
ivan seems to be taking a perverse glee in all this
quack like aduck
all the parents start quacking like ducks
ivan slowly turns to goldar gives him an icy stare
it just slipped out
ivan turns back to the quacking parents
the parents keep quacking
you didnt say simon says
ivan irritated simon says shut up
they shut up now as soon as i give the word i want all of you to start digging
beat do i make myself perfectly the zombie parents have already started going to work
ivan shakes his head in exasperation
this is the iast time i use parents for anything
the rangers are fast asleep
a night wind whistles through the trees causing the branches to shiver
after a moment theres movement in the bushes
suddenly amazingly a wolf emerges his mane glistening in the moonlight his eyes glowing like fire
he surveys the sleeping clan moves straight toward billy
he stands inches away from him watches him with an intense gaze
billy stirs slightly
the embers cast an orange glow on kimberlys sleeping face a shadow moves over her and two crane legs step into frame
theres a flurry of flapping wings as a falcon swoops down and lands on a rock directly above tommy
the bird fixes on tommy with its piercing eyes
we hear a grunting sound as the silhouette of an ape appears now a frog hops through the air and lands inches away from adam
the frog sits there a moment its throat throbbing now we hear a deep growl and a tree shakes
aisha fidgets in her sleep as an enormous bear shadow falls over her
now all at once the six animals vanish into thin air like ivan and goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging
lets pick it up here
ive got a schedule to keep
in twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan
goldar suddenly point to the sky
what kind of landing was that
these clowns are a menace to the sky how did you fare
mordant waves ivan off
oh it couldntve gone better
the power rangers didnt know what hit them
the tengu appear one of them squawks and makes grand gestures
and then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river
so theyve been destroyed
the tengu squawks some more
what do you mean basically
we were about to finish them off
when this huge monster came out of nowhere
okay maybe he wasnt so huge
but you shouldve seen the size of his sticks a pensive look comes over ivan
did these sticks make a whistling sound
howd you know
beat that miserable manipulating loathsome she devil of a witch
to help make the point mordant spits on the ground
how could you let them get away
if dulcea leads them to the great power everything will be ruined
they must be obliterated
one of the tengu screeches again
whatre you talking about
it wasnt my fault
youre the featherbrains that let them get away
ivan looks up to the sky
i call upon the powers of darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold
lightning rips from the sky and zaps the tengu causing them to and now the coup de grace to lead my tribe to victorious battle
he shoots a bolt of energy and creates the oueen tengu
she is a different color than the rest and her eyes glow red
mordant shakes his head in wonder
where does he come up with this stuff
the queen spreads her wings and makes the most horrendous screech imaginable
queen tengu lead your warriors to phaedos feast yourselves upon once again the tengu take to the sky like giant bats
the morning sun bathes dulceas compound in a shimmering golden light
snoggles snout works its way toward her making snorting kimberly bolts awake and slams his snout with her fist
she yelps like a child as he grips the protrusion and jumps all the rangers spring awake
as they get out from under their blankets theyre shocked to discover that theyre all wearing ninjetti costumes with animal symbols on their chest
how the heck
whats going on
i dont believe it
dulcea approaches a wondrous expression on her face
you have been visited by the animal spirits
they have given you their blessing
the rangers continue to admire their symbols in silent wonder
we see aisha standing on a rock her whole body flowing in a martial art exercise
billy and dulcea continue to fight with whistling sticks
billy is starting to get the hang of it
he hits dulcea a few times then she clobbers him
kimberly balances along the bamboo log again
she does a flip and lands it however one foot slips off and she struggles to maintain her balance
tommy stands on the protruding rock again spreads high like a falcon soars through the air
he gets about ten feet then drops into the water
rocky climbs up the oriental pole this time he makes it up about fifteen feet before he slips
he only drops five feet
adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog animal stance his entire being focused on his actions
billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling sticks
the weapons are now a blurr in his hands
kimberly balances along the log executes a flip lands it perfectly throws her arms up triumphantly
adam stands on the lakeshore c ncentrating on a buzzing insect
he strikes out at it but just misses it
aisha also does something appropriate
hundreds of kids and teenagers fill the park all of them wearing purple clothes
theyre all dirty and grunged out they jump around breaking stuff sparring with each other its total pandemonium
suddenly an eruption of smoke and ivan disguised as the wizard magically appears
the crowd cheers nuremburg style fists raised
youre too kind
sotto voce finally
a little appreciation where its deserved
we love you ivan
right back at ya
he smiles now who misses school
at the edge fred discreetly approaches bulk and skull
can i have a word with you guys
he pulls them aside whats really going on here
where are everybodys parents
bulk and skull exchange a look
like we said before thats classified top secret
fred decides to be tricky
look ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them
well why didnt you say so
theyre at the world center construction site
he does a ridiculous mock salute
bulk and skull repeat it
fred rolls his eyes and hurries away
thru a omitted dulcea leads snoggle and the rangers up a stone path
they approach a bush filled with exotic berries
all of them start eating the berries
how do you and zordon know each other
we belonged to an interstellar peace keeping force known as the order of the meledan
beat zordon was widely regarded as the finest commander in the galaxy
he was a true legend
if it wasnt for him the universe would be a very different place from what it is today
the kids are overwhelmed by what theyre hearing
over time our enemies were defeated
i returned to phaedos zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere
beat until you kids showed up i hadnt heard from him for centuries
the rangers are silent for a moment
he was always an inspiration
dulcea speaks with grim visaged intensity
this is why im taking you to the nathadian monolith
that is why im teaching you the ninjetti
beat if zordon dies
then a piece of all of us dies
and the force of good within the universe will be dealt an irreparable blow
these words strike deep in the kids
the bulldozers and earth movers have dug out a twenty foot pit
ivan leads goldar and mordant through the site passing dozens of laboring parents
as soon as weve taken over the world im gonna change my name to sir mordant
or how about major mordant
how about major moron
how about the two of you shut up and pay attention
the entourage comes to a stop goldar and mordant cant believe whats before them
what is that
feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric to parents beat angle on fred as he darts through the construction site taking care not to be seen
he hunkers down behind a stack of two by fours searches the area
he spots his dad speaks under his breath
he glances around to make sure the coast is clear then sprints off to where his dad is digging grabs his hand
we have to get out of here
its me fred
kelman just gives fred a blank stare
suddenly an arm falls on freds shoulder
fred whips araund finds mordant standing behind him
he springs to action pulling off a lightning quick iron hammer fist strike a palm heel block a front kick with jumping mordant is getting pummeled
the last kick sends him flying back into the dirt
fred takes off as goldar stands over mordant
just shut your gap
did i say anything
zordon is looking more decrepit than ever
alpha inserts tube into a make shift electronic contraption
by bouncing ultra high frequencies off one of the network satellites i can send a long range pulsar signal to within two feet of the rangers coordinates
with difficulty i just pray were not too late
alpha continues making adjustments
lets give it a whirl
he flicks a switch and the screen lights up with static
the the same reporter we saw at the opening of the movie appears
angel grove police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing gersons continues to grow theres more static then ivan appears as the wizard
hi folks ivan ooze here
ai yi yi yi yi as ivan speaks we see mordant behind him waving into camera
are you bored with your work
are you bored with your family are you bored with your ife well come on down to ooze city and lets get sticky
the group reaches the crest of a ridge off in the background we can see the outline of the nathadian monolith
the monolith is there in the distance
the kids strain to get a better look
this is as far as i can take you
the kids are thrown by this
youre leaving us
i have taught you all that i know
now you must achieve the ninjetti on your own
the kids share glances not quite knowing what to say
it is said that once youve reached the power
you have only ten triacs to release it
whats a triac
about twenty seconds in your time
and how do we release the power
the legend goes that you release the power with the power
what does that mean
that is a question that even i cannot answer
beat remember ten triacs
after that something bad will happen
dulcea gives them a grim look
they say the power will throw off a super heated radioactive fireball instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone
thats pretty bad
thank you dulcea
dulcea catches her hand and six rangers put their hands on top of hers
kaalabas tor nartu enkata tay
beat may your animals watch over you
the sky above the chemical plant is boiling with dark clouds
the parents have finished assembling the steel tower thick cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of hornitor and scorpitron
we see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the skeletal feet the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze
mordant videotapes ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical foot
finally after centuries of waiting my ecto morphicon machines are ready to take on the world
mordant gets the camera a little too close to ivan
ivan swats mordant and the camera flies up through the air and smashes against a wall
oh man that was a rental
angle on fred watching from behind a generator an alarmed look on his face
ivan steps up onto a platform
let the ooze flow
mordant pulls a lever and the ooze slithers through the goldar
goldar presses a button and the roof of the plant rolls open looks like a fine day for raising ivan holds his arms up to the heavens
give my creatures life
mordant admires ivan
this guy is the king
now the most amazing thing of all happens
the scintillating behemoths awake from the dead their eyes and mouths opening their arms reaching upward
the beasts roar mordants hair literally stands on end he quickly retreats behind a drum
fred looks on in horror
all of them turn their attention to ivan
the parents just stand there with blank expressions
whatre you waiting for
goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around
you forgot to say simon says
ivan shakes his head dismally
the rangers crest a hill and adam whos in the lead suddenly drops down the others following suit
they peer over the ridge their eyes wide
before them a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing
the ocean rages below
on top of the island is the nathadian monolith
its a mind boggling wonder from another time and place
between the rangers and the bridge the tengu warriors are on patrol
man these are the last guys i wanted to see
whadda we do now
kimberly surveys the area
thats the only way to the monolith
we can take these guys
tommy pulls all of them into a huddle
the tengu are on full alert
one of them hears something snaps around theres nothing there
another tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg
he screeches and stomps down his taloned foot missing the creature by inches
we hear a caw and the queen tengu squints as she spots a falcon circling in the sky above
the queen is perched on top of a foot rock face
she looks around hesitantly
now the rangers attack some of them lunging off rocks others bursting out of crevices others coming over the walls
billy wields his whistling sticks misses several times then starts bashing and thwacking the feathered beasts
the queen shoots a laser blast from her eyes it explodes before tommy
kimberly battles another tengu and the creature forces her back on to the rickety bridge
the queen fires another blast
rocky dives knocking aisha away from the bolt
adam and one of the tengu circle each other warily
the frog silently assesses its target then strikes out
suddenly the tengu is hurtled backward ten feet through the air
we didnt even see adam move
in the blink of an eye
tommy steps up behind a tengu
the tengu turns around and tommy whallops him with a spinning heel kick
a tengu faces down aisha and she goes into a bear stance
the bear is sturdy as a towering tree
nothing can uproot it
the tengu charges like a bull slams into aisha
she holds fast and the bird explodes into a cloud of feathers
bye bye birdy
kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she exchanges blows with her foe
she finally drops into a crane stance
then just like dulcea she leaps through the air executes a brutal spinning hell kick and sends the birdman tumbling off the bridge
in a movement that seems to defy gravity she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge
hasta la pasta bigbird
billy swings his sticks bashes one of the tengu in the beak the creature explodes into a cloud of feathers
tommy reaches the top of a rack
he sees a tengu making a toward earth together
they hit the ground and exchange blows rocky slams another tengu in the beak kablam the creature is obliterated
tommy leaps into the air nails two tengu in the beaks
they the queen shoots another bolt of energy a rock explodes showering the kids with shrapnel
aisha turns to rocky
its up to you
rocky takes a deep breath goes into a crouch position
incredibly he scales the wall in the same way he went up the pole
he flips over the top and lands right before the queen tengu
he looks her dead in the eye
polly wanna cracker
with that he executes a devastating spinning heel kick and the queen bursts into oblivion
instantly the remaining tengu retreat squawking and cawwing in rage
the kids turn to eaeh other sharing in a moment of triumph
were on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city theres a burst of purple smoke ivan mordant and goldar appear
ivan looks out on the city holds up his arms theatrically
hornitor appears on the street roaring like a fiend
his enormous foot drops down and crushes a car into oblivion
and his trimetallic partner in crime
scorpitron appears on the street and bashes in the side of a mordant turns to ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation
zordon now barely alive watches as alpha makes more adjustments to his contraption
that should do it
we wont be able to hear them but they should be able to hear us
beat here goes
theres static and then we see the reporter again
the mayor has declared a state of emergency and asked that the city be immediately evacuated
he has reiterated the need for everyone to remain calm
we see images of people screaming their guts out as they angel grove has never before known such a crisis and we can now only pray for the swift arrival
of the power rangers
ay yi yi yi
zordon speaks in a whisper
alpha keep trying
thru omitted thru the kids climb up on top of the rock bluff before them is a huge black monolith
theres all sorts of charred bones and skeletons strewn around it some of them human some of them alien
they approach the massive block stand before it in awe struck silence
in the middle of the monolith theres a large circle with the six animals of the ninjetti carved into it
the nathadian monolith
kimberly looks at all the bones instinctively puts her hand on her animal symbol
i guess these guys werent so lucky
a few of the kids walk around the monolith examining it more closely
weve come all this way for a rock wall
there should be a way to open it
billy tommy latch their hands over the block searching for an opening
release the power with the power
rocky steps back throws his shoulder into the monolith with a thump winces in pain
not that kind of power
the kids exchange discouraged looks
there has to be something were missing
the kids look crestfallen
it cant end like this
suddenly a sizzle of electricity forms in front of them
the kids mouths fall open as
a holographic image of zordons withered face appears
he speaks in a barely audible voice
ivan has invaded the city
time is running out
zordons image flickers a few times then stabilizes again
each of you are now in possession of miraculous skills
but only when the six become one will you have the strength to harness the great power
his image flickers then fades away
billy studies the circle with zealous eyes
six become one
the combined forces of the ninjetti
strength in numbers
they silently assemble in a line all of them interlock hands
they face the monolith with fire in their eyes
i am the wolf cunning and swift
i am the crane agile and sublime
i am the bear stalwart and bold
i am the frog quick as lightning
i am the mighty ape
and i am the falcon winged lord of the sky
a mysterious halo of light shrouds the rangers and they dissapear the kids burst through a wall of light and come down together inside a vast cavern
theres a pyramid shaped steel object in the center of the room a radiant light shining from it
where are we
the power is of another world
thats twenty seconds
the kids advance toward the pyramid
release the power with the power
what does that mean
adam notices their symbols are glowing
the kids ogle the radiant emblems
kimberly takes hold of hers and it comes off in her hand theres a mirror on the other side
ten seconds and counting
its some kind of mirror
kimberly looks at her reflection and primps her hair
the others remove their symbols
release the power with the power
ive got it
we use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself
all of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid
a beam of we hear a rumbling sound as the earth starts to shake
the rangers look to each other horrified
then everything falls still and silent
and then a miracle happens
we hear a harmonious otherworldly chorus as the pyramid opens the kids shield their eyes from the brilliance all of them wearing wonder struck expressions
their visors are clear so we can see their faces
now the symbols in their hands transform into
they hit their communicators they instantly transform into dulcea and snoggle watch as the columns of color streak away from the planet leaving behind a rainbow with the six colors
of the power rangers
they now have the great power of the ninjetti
we see the mass of parents as they march intently down a dark city street
ernies is packed with crazed kids and teenagers who are ripping the place apart
bulk and skull watch while gorging themselves on pizza
there goes the neighborhood
a real shame
suddenly fred appears and shouts out
the place falls silent
youve been brainwashed
this ivan is no wizard
hes some kind of demon
shut up squirt
you cant talk that way about our leader
enraged they move in on fred
you gotta believe me hes the crowd gets angrier
they move closer
fred gulps with fear
glancing around for help he notices a hose
he lunges for it cranks on the water and turns it on the crowd
they get sprayed down
suddenly they stop in their tracks slowly blinking confused
the spell is broken
we hear whats going on
what am i doing here
listen to me
our parents are in danger
if we dont help them theyre going to be killed
he hurries off
a few follow him then a few more
until pretty soon everybody joins him
bulk and skull share a look
what about the pizza
bulk considers the dilemma
we could take it with us
skull nods relieved
they gather up the pizza and move off after the others
the rangers materialize in the command center with their helmets off
alpha approaches speaks in an anguished voice
im afraid youre too late
the rangers are too stunned to speak
they approach zordons lifeless form looking absolutely devastated
this cant be
they stare at zordon with gut wrenching expressions
theyre utterly defeated
eventually tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent voice
to those who possess the great power
all things are possible
the kids gradually exchange zealous looks
they form a circle around zordon and interlock hands
they close their eyes bow their heads
after a long moment a shimmering energy begins to flow down zordon grows brighter and brighter and then theres a dazzling when the light fades we see the command center
back in its zordons youthful face once again looks down from within his pillar of light his eyes filled with a fierce pride
welcome back kids
its good to be back
alpha jumps up and down like a child
we thought you
its good to see you again too
alpha sees the ecto morphicon machines on the viewing globe
ai yi yi yi yi ivan s ecto morphicon machines are leveling the city
weve got news for you ivan
the power rangers are back in they teleport out
close on ivan as he turns into camera a startled look on his face
he looks down on the street as the columns of light shoot down outraged the rangers watch as hornitor and scorpitron come thundering down the street toward them
we hear alpha on tommys wrist communicator
rangers call for your new animal zords
lets do it
one after another they click their new coins into their morphers and go into their stances
from the sky the six new animal zords burst forth like thundering mechanical gods
the rangers look up at the towering assault vehicles in awe
we see various shots of the rangers dropping into their respective cockpits
fred bulk and skull watch a sleek monorail pulling in
skull talks with a mouth full of pizza
look kid i dont think you realize who youre dealing with
i dont think he realizes who hes dealing with
the train glides to a complete stop and the doors slide open
the youngsters pile through the doors quickly filling up the entire monorail
the parents round a corner advance down the street like machines
attack with a relentless ferocity
theres all kinds of crashing and bashing and explosions
theres a blam blam blam as scorpitron repeatedly fires his cannon arm at the bear zord who in turn deflects the volleys
hornitor shoots a blast from its stinger the crane zord dodges the fiery eruption
nice try pinhead
scorpitron repeatedly kicks at the frog zord with its bladed feet sending up oscillatory discharges at the same time somebody back me up here
hornitor bores its drill arm into the ape zord sending these things are ferocious
the bear zord charges hornitor and the two mastodons go the bear kicks butt
hornitor sears the wolf zord with its needle nose
