by akiva goldsman chapter earth pull back slowly as mars fills the frame a sphere of red desert and fast rushing crimson clouds
a triangular cargo ship descends from the dark of space
mars mining base this is grissom one request final descent vector
a row of giant red mountains and beneath on the planets surface the spires of a mining base
illuminated landing crosshairs alight a landing pad beckoning the ship
roger grissom one this is mars mining you are cleared to land
hope you got some partagas in that rust bucket sal
the cargo ship changes attitude landing thrusters firing as the vessel begins to penetrate the atmosphere
i brought you the most amazing
amazing what well never know
the cargo ship begins to explode the bubble bridge blowing out into space in a ball of fire
low angle from the planets surface
two shapes blast through frame bubble fighters single pilot transparent globes racing up towards the sudden star of the cargo ship at impossible speed
pov of the burning cargo ship coming towards us incredibly fast
speed trajectory and tactical readouts flash
the pulse lasers are still hammering the ravaged hull
two sinister attack ships their lasers locked onto the cargo ship fire away as they blast overhead
the nuclear core of the cargo ship overloads the craft finally exploding in a storm of fire
a bubble fighter roars through the hurling world of flame
a lone figure stands in a gyroscopic harness working a heads up holographic display command controls spinning degrees with the pilots comas the fighter screams after the fleeing raider
the harness spins the pilot coming clearly into view
handsome intense reckless eyes
major don west
sino jordanian raiders
theyre claiming the cargo ship violated their air space
another pilot jeb walker commands an identical craft rocketing towards the assault craft just below wests
this cold wars heating up
where did they come from
and were going to send them back screaming
west activates his targeting computer
last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer
targeting display close
the fleeing attack ship jogs in and out of the crosshairs on wests holographic array
the attack ship shoots straight up dodging wests laser blasts
west closes on the fleeing craft as jeb engages the other attack ship lasers firing in the b
visible through the transparent surface of the bubble glass under wests feet
whats that sound
must be the fat lady warming up
the fleeing attack ship loops in mid space reversing direction heading straight towards wests bubble fighter
a game of chicken
west doesnt flinch
bears down firing madly the two space ships heading straight for each other
come on come on you wanna play i wanna play
the two ships are rocketing towards each other locked in collision vectors lasers firing wildly
asdasd i can hear her
oh yes oh yes
shes gonna sing
targeting display close
the attack ship flashes captured in the targeting hatchmarks
the display expands into a tactical grid
the hull of the attack ship fills his bubble glass
the lights are dimming
the curtains coming down
sing you fat old bag sing
west hits the firing stud
wests pulse lasers converge on the attack ship barely meters ahead the roaring craft exploding directly before him
over west screams as he shoots through the sudden conflagration of flame and debris everywhere and then gone giving way to the blackness of space and the starfield beyond
below the second attack ship roars past lasers firing locked in a pinwheel battle with jebs bubble fighter
jebs bubble fighter banks avoiding the high energy volley
a laser burst grazes his bubble fighter the surface of his craft sparking suddenly scored with flames
the attack ship is right behind him
weapons are off line
jettisoning main drive core
the thruster core of jebs bubble fighter blows off in a bolus of flame soaring back into the pursuit craft
the raider explodes
controls are sparking
over an alarm sounds
failure in redundant drive systems
the surface of mars is rushing up fast
impact on in seconds
jebs ship is barreling toward the planet
this is ranger one
engines will not respond
ranger one this is grissom base
rescue craft have been dispatched
three small rescue craft race skyward
impact in seconds
mars fills the view screen
the rescue craft are speeding toward jebs fighter below
grissom this is eagle one
those pugs will never reach him in time
eagle one clear this frequency and return to base
don takes a beat
then he spins his chair towards mars begins working the controls
this is eagle one
im going after him
negative eagle one your craft is not equipped west hits his thrusters
wests craft dives toward jebs ship and mars below
mars is coming up fast
impact in seconds
jeb do you have navigational thrusters
its a yes or no question
mars fills the windscreen
jeb checks his status display
but in the green
impact in seconds
head towards the canals
what are you doing
saving your ass
read towards the canals
the canal streaked face of the mars is all jeb can see
he grabs his throttle engages his navigational thrusters and pulls
a tiny directional thruster fires angling jebs craft so that it scrapes the surface of mars and dives into a giant canal rocky walls rushing up fast
west is accelerating toward jeb
major west your ship is not equipped for rescue
you are not authorized to jeopardize this asset
that is a direct order
west slams a switch deactivating his radio
never liked that station anyway
he blasts into the canal walls rushing up on either side of him
jebs tiny craft is plunging toward the rocky crater floor below
overhead wests fighter appears under full thrusters roaring towards the crater floor faster and at a sharper angle
the canal floor is rushing up fast
impact in five seconds
don is blasting toward the canal floor almost as if trying to beat jebs ship to a fiery impact below
jeb im going to give you a little kiss
dont take it the wrong way
west angles his ship directly under jeb
the expanding surface of mars visible beneath his feet is suddenly obscured by dons fighter swooping under his ship
jebs fighter is visible overhead
west going up
don angles the throttle
dons ship sandwiched between the surface of mars and jebs fighter angles up and like a cue ball hitting its target knocks jebs ship spinning toward the safety of space
wests ship actually scrapes the surface of the planet sending up a plume of martian dust
does this mean were going steady
west pulls his throttle all the way back
west shoots up and out towards the dark of space
you werent getting out of buying those beers that easy
the rescue craft converge on jebs ship as don heads for base

he mimics the naylrator
saving the world for our children
a beat give me a hi test break
spying through the open slats of his biding place into
basic twenty first century modern
maureen robinson stands talking with a principal who in less than happy
he hacked our main power grid to run his experiment
the school was in chaos
we didnt even have lights
the room lights suddenly dim
the principal flickers revealed as a holograph her head now sitting on schwartzenegger body
maureen laughs then realizes the principal has no idea her image is being distorted
maureen begins moving about the room surreptitiously glancing behind couches into cabinets
this is no laughing matter mrs
will is terribly gifted
his little time machines though pure fancy are the products of a truly brilliant mind
the principals body has become twiggys
now that of an ape
maureen pulls open a closet
will sits inside
the changing shape of education
no more monkey business
will shrugs adjusts his deck
the principal returns to normal
the boy is starved for attention
was there no way his father could have attended the science fair
probably austin and dallas too
texas has become a giant urban sprawl spreading into mexico and beyond
immense industrial air purifiers hang in a dark wet sky
a giant dome topped pedestal towers ever the skyline
a man stands before a large viewscreen facing the throng of press
hes a little uncomfortable with all the media attention
this is once we have landed on alpha prime our on board robot will begin construction of a hypergate
on screen a hi tech orbital gate is highlighted and expanded
by then technicians here on earth will have completed a companion hypergate in our planets orbit
on screen an image of an orbital gate now under construction
once both gates are complete ships will be able to pass instantaneously between them
the jupiter can bring the dimondium back to earth without the ten year delay of a return trip
why cant you just use the jupiters hyperengine to zap straight to alpha prime
as you know hyperspace exists beneath normal space
if you try to enter hyperspace without a gate on screen a graphic spaceship appears randomly in the corner of a turning schematic of the galaxy
your exit vector is random
theres no telling where youd come out
professor how is captain daniels recovering from the flu
will we still be able to pilot the mission
john glances to the doorway where a uniformed general stands
ladies and gentlemen you came to get a look at the jupiter one
dont you think youve waited long enough
john hits a button and the room darkens
a giant monitor reveals
a giant saucer sits connected to its launch pad by loading belts steaming fuel tubes and spindled gantries
professor how does your family feel about leaving the earth behind
they couldnt be more excited
a suburban colonial the launch dome towering in the distance
this whole mission sucks
penny robinson furious turns looks downstairs at maureen
i dont want to stay home for dinner
i want to see my friends for the last time
she takes a beat blinking away the tears
lifts her wrist and turns on a video camera watch
she begins down the hall
pennys face in the monitor screen
on the eve before she is torn from her friends kidnapped hurled into deep space against her will what thoughts fill the mind of the young space captive
penny enters a strewn boy a world
will is trying to select items to place in a single packing canister marked personal cargo
will there be boys on alpha centuri
what will i wear
when we wake up in ten years the video journals of penny robinson space captive will be devoured by millions
i will be world famous
you on the other hand will have been totally forgotten
penny shows the camera her arm covered by strings of ribbons
the space captive has decided to wear ribbons of support for fellow sufferers as she is dragged into deep space green for the ecological issues white for human rights youd
probably gag if i described the secondary infections loss of circulation can cause
penny seems about to speak instead just smiles goes to his bed and pulls off the sheets begins knotting them together
what are you grinning at
i just found an upside to this mission
the thought of jettisoning your body into deep space
penny knots the sheets into a rope ties it to the bed post
will lifts several palm sized gold plated stars
each reads st prize
dad says dont bring them
like anything i do matters to him
he never showed huh
maybe if i had actually broken the time barrier he would have paid attention
dont let him get to you kiddo
he just gets busy with work is all
penny tosses the rope out the window prepares to climb
so thats a no to family dinner
lets see do i spend my last night on earth watching mom and dad pretend not to be fighting again or get in ten years of making out at the
you do the math
moms gonna go thermal
whats she gonna do
chapter major west john and the general walk the metal passageway
were lucky they didnt press on daniels condition
i figured a chance to look at the ship would keep the dogs at bay
ben im worried about jamming in a replacement pilot at the last second
my family a on this mission
i need someone whos more than just spit and polish
ive got your man
he just doesnt know it yet
the general palms an access panel
a door hisses open to reveal
a figure stands staring silently out the window
he offers a salute
by his eyes west is clearly agitated
at ease major
sir why was i pulled off active duty
i salvaged my craft and jebs
ill fight a court martial general
do you know professor robinson
by reputation only
to john your fathers battle strategies were required reading at the academy
how much do you know about the jupiter mission major
the jupiter is fully automated
the pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on alpha prime
its a baby sitting job sir
major you are aware earths resources are severely limited
every schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment
sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages
what i am about to tell you is classified
every schoolchild has been lied to
the recycling technologies have failed
in less than two decades earth will be unable to support human life
we spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face keep people from panicking in the streets
we partnered with coke because the billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government
the sinojordanian alliance knows the truth as well as we do
they hope to reach alpha prime first and if they do i guarantee you they will not share the dimondium with western demons like us
our crops will wither
we will be left to die
captain daniels doesnt have the flu does he sir
daniels was murdered in his apartment last night
the flu story is a cover we fed the press
dan was a good pilot
a good man
your rescue stunt over mars was foolhardy
explain yourself major
i had a friend in trouble
you endangered a one billion dollar spacecraft disobeyed a direct order because of a friend
and id do it again
stepping forward congratulations major youre the new pilot of the jupiter mission
smith sun beats hard on a man who stands on a windswept sand dune talking to a smartly dressed businessman
perhaps a brief jaunt down memory lane is required
i was contracted to provide daniels apartment code
my work is done
they found a replacement pilot the mission is going ahead on schedule
we require more direct intervention
well that will cost you
and im afraid my price has just become astronomical
over a knock
the man reaches forward and presses a button
the businessman the desert disappear only holographs
lights come up to reveal
the man turns revealing a face as clever an his eyes are evil
this is dr
he walks to the door palms a panel and the portal hiss open
a technician enters
control hasnt received the results of your final pre flight exams doctor smith
the doctor moves to a circular overhead light board around which are displayed the faces of the crew of the jupiter craft
removes the micro files hands them to the technician
the robinsons are checked out at one hundred percent
they are in perfect condition and ready to fly
he smiles so sweet you can barely see the malevolence behind it
wish them good luck for me
chapter welcome aboard
three small figures walk through a gantry towards the ship
the mission protocols are simple
professor robinson is in command unless you encounter a military emergency
in that case major west you will assume command
the figures have come to the saucer entry port
welcome aboard major
don john and the general enter
dons eyes widen
west looks like somebody sprung for the full extras package on this baby
hi tech heaven
two pilots chairs face a giant windscreen
don walks to the consoles that stretch toward the back walls
some of this technology might be new to you
ill be happy to explain
off the com cold fusion drive off the size consoles rambler krey life sciences stations
don strides to a pedestal in the center of the bridge
flicks a switch and a holographic jupiter craft appears on the launch pad
holographic navigational interface
don points to a row of man sized glass cylinders on the back wall
he approaches the blast doors that lead off the back of the bridge
sick bay remote ops engineering and living quarters are below decks
hyperengine should be in here
don hits a wall panel which opens to reveal an immense engine room
if you have to baby sit its not such a bad nursery wouldnt you agree major
just then the elevator rises from the lower decks
on its circular platform stands a doctor in a lab coat
she walks to the general
the cryosleep systems are running at ninety five percent
doctor smith approved the specs doctor smith is base physician
i am responsible once this ship is in flight
these tubes have to keep the crew in suspended animation for ten years
they will be perfect or this ship will not launch
is that clear
judy id like you to meet major west
hes taking mikes place
hes heavier than mike
well have to re calibrate
id be more than happy to discuss my dimensions perhaps over dinner
west ive read about you
something of a war hero arent you
preening well yes actually
those who cant think fight
a freezing smile well nice to have met you
she heads toward the readouts
west turns to john
thats one cold fish id love to thaw
turning im not going to make it home for dinner dad
west turns to john
its going to be a long flight
lights burn in the windows
john enters to find the remains of an elegant dinner on the table candles never lit food never eaten
john crosses to a small scale model sitting on the table
around it hangs another gold plated st prize star
he won first prize again
he practically brought down his entire school
but he won first prize
maureen descends the steps in a bathrobe
a non working prototype for his time machine
sharp stuff for a midget
maureen is silent
im sorry about dinner
i had to work late
the new pilot
what you had to do was prioritize your family over the mission maureen
this mission is about our family
so we can stay together the perfect nuclear family
the most stable social unit ideally suited for the isolation of a long journey into space
its all just pr john
youre never home
judy is becoming a ghost just like you
penny cant see past her own navel and will has to black out his school just to get his fathers attention
the perfect nuclear family in ruin
john stares at his wife
then he reaches forward touches her hair
i know maureen
im scared too
then she moves to him
and he holds her close
john stands in the yellow wedge of hall light
he touches something hanging around his own neck
a pair of metal dog tags
will lies in his bed eyes closed
john turns heading out into the hall
the bedroom lights go out a normal home against the backdrop of the launch dome towering in the distance
the jupiter one stands amidst loading gantries final supplies rolling into the ship on automated conveyer belts and lifts
chapter primary directives two technicians stand checking off supplies on a lightpad
im showing a late shipment from mission medical
here it is now
hold on a canister that reads biological materials do not open as it passes on the loading belt
follow the drum as it winds along the conveyer up a gantry towards the jupiter one
smith sits crouched inside cleaning his nails
a giant robot stands attached to its service bay
a service drawer slides open and a shadowy infiltrator emerges his face visible in the dim service light
smith approaches the docked robot places a small keypad device on the robots dormant cpu panel
smith activates the device
youll forgive me if i forgo the kiss my sleeping behemoth
smith hits a switch on the panel and the robots system indicators light into life
smith types several keys on the keypad
but the time has come to awake
robot is on line
reviewing primary directives
one preserve the robinson family
two maintain ship systems
three spare me the chatter
smith taps the keypad
the robot is silenced
smith types again
what noble charges my steely centurion
sadly i fear you have far more dire deeds in store for you
smith completes his re programming
hits a switch
robot is on line
reviewing primary directives
two hours into mission destroy robinson family
destroy all systems
removes the re programming module
now thats more like it
farewell my tin plated pal
give my regards to oblivion
smith climbs into a chute marked waste disposal
smith begins crawling down the chute
his tiny reprogramming module beeps
smith activates a tiny built in com link
from the mic the familiar visage of the businessman is projected into the crawlspace over smiths face
i told you never to call me here
i see you have completed your mission on schedule good work doctor
the businessman smiles
suddenly the tiny module in his hand overloads the flesh on his palm smoking as smith is engulfed in an electrical charge
he goes out his body perfectly still
the giant dome shines in the early sun
int jupiter one john and maureen face will and penny who stand now in their freezing tubes
all wear silver flight suits
maureen moves pennys hair from in front of her face
vogue says this will be the style in ten years
will she wake up less annoying
does he have to wake up at all
alright you two enough
maureen kisses her children
john moves to will who reaches to shake at the same moment john tries to hug him
then john tries to a shake as will goes for the hug
a total miss
will backs into his tube
you get a c in paternal expression professor
but an a for effort
john kisses his wife already in her tube
you always get an a in that
dont let me shatter this unbridled display of affection but we are running behind
entering his tube major shes all yours
ill try to give you a smooth ride
judy walks the row checking their bio monitors
enters her tube
mission control this is dr
we are in the green
roger doctor you are go to initiate cryostasis
don walks to judys tube
one question doctor
in there room in these tubes for two
barely enough for you and your ego major
touches her com link initializing cryostasis tubes
the tubes rotate closed around the robinsons
suddenly each crew member is surrounded by a shimmering blue glow brightening like a star and then subsiding
all stand fixed in suspended animation
don stares at the family a beat
he goes to the main console
straps himself in
mission control this is jupiter one
the robinsons are asleep
we are ready to fly
welcome to the future
banks of monitors manned by gum chewing pink haired technicians
a giant monitor shows the jupiter on the launch pad
the controller noah freeman pulls in to his console
jupiter two this is mission control
you are at t minus two minutes and counting
were opening the dome
the dome begins to part
giant gantries retract
fueling lines disengage
external fuel pressure to zero
powering main drive systems
the nuclear drive at the base of the saucer explodes the giant craft trembling straining towards the sky
mission control jupiter one you are at ninety five percent
houston main drive systems to on line status
nuclear engines roar
the ship begins to rise in a bolus of flame
we have lift off
requesting escape trajectory
major your escape vector in clear of all military and commercial traffic
op in go on your command
west reaches for a glowing panel
were outta here
the atomic power source fires a focused blast shooting the jupiter through cloud and sky towards the black edge of space
the main screen shows a graphic of the jupiters trajectory as the ship arcs toward the outer edge of the atmosphere
jupiter one you are clear earths atmosphere
a cheer goes up in the control room
the giant saucer shell explodes revealing the inner ship the glittering high tech shape of the jupiter two
don watches as the earth recedes into a blue marble flickering orbital billboards growing distant
smiles at the familiar sight
jupiter one booster disengaged
proceeding towards mercury
nuclear diodes at the ships base spin into life glowing with atomic fire the ship now heading towards mercury and beyond
the robot stands dormant in his service bay
hold on the closed service drawer in the b
smith lies still unconscious in the dark compartment
mercury hangs like a red moon in the front viewscreen
don presses a button and two giant blast shields close over the jupiter twos main viewscreen
houston diverting all spacecraft controls to the main computer
off mic eight years of flight training
he walks to the center of the bridge and activates the navigational holograph images forming in mid air over the pedestal
the jupiter two is visible backed by the planets of our solar system
navigational holographics on line
off mic fifty combat missions
don touches buttons and a highlight indicates the ships trajectory past mercury around the sun in a slingshot and into space beyond
course confirmed for slingshot exit of the solar system
off mic just so i can take the family camper on an interstellar picnic
don walks to the freezing tubes
he zips up his silver flight suit
ten world series
my nephews high school and college graduations
a decades worth of sports illustrated swimsuit editions
a beat noah ten years in a lifetime
west climbs into his tube
sleep well old friend
don hits a switch and his tube closes
a beat then he is engulfed by the blue glow frozen in space
the tubes rise into the craft
the ship flies on into the endless night
smith lies still
he starts from a nightmare into
a nightmare smith scrambles out of the chute stares at his hand the impression of the overloaded communicator seared into his palm
he spins around disoriented
stumbles to a closed view screen and hits a stud
the blast shield opens
the robot close
in his docking bay
suddenly the automaton powers up lights activating as his cpu comes on line
smith turns slaps the burned out programming module on the robot
the robot continues to power up
smith engage interface
initiate system shut down
robot is on line
implementing prime command directives
the robot disengages from the service bay begins rolling forward
robinson family destroy
the robot rolls towards the bridge
all operating systems destroy
smith grabs a wrench from a tool bracket leaps for the robot
the robot swings once sending smith flying into a flaring console
jupiter two destroy
a single techie annie mans the watch playing holo games with a stylus over her desk
screens flicker into life
into a mic somebody wake up the chief
the bridge doors open and the ambient lights come on
the robot rolls onto the bridge faces the cryosleep array
he extends his arms an electrical charge arcing between his claws
robinson family destroy
he fires a blast of electricity hitting the cryosleep controls
over alarms sound as the tubes begin to descend electricity sparking across the sleeping robinsons
youll kill us all
smith wrench in hand rushes the robot is again hurled across the room
the robot turns towards the navigational computer
all the monitors are manned by sleepy techies
noah enters taking a coffee from annie without breaking stride
alarms flash everywhere
this missions over
wake them up
the techies begins working the controls
no response sir
the robot is facing the navigational holograph in the center of the bridge
the electricity arcs between his claws once again
operating systems destroy
smith is slumped against the bulkhead
he shakes off his fall in time to see the robot fire at the navigational array the holograph disappearing in the flames of the exploding pedestal
the ship begins to veer off course falling towards the sun
the robot is rolling toward the com
the freezing tubes are quickly being engulfed in flames
smith stumbles toward their control station
begins typing madly
wake up damn you
i cant stop this infernal contraption on my own
he smashes a glass panel that reads emergency deactivate
the figures inside the lowering tubes glow
all except judy
the robot is before the com electricity arcing between his claws
off the tubes hurry up
the robot fires at the main com controls exploding everywhere
the freezing tubes begin to open the robot spinning to face them
john blinks to life first
emerges ducking a blast of electrical energy from the robot hitting the deck and rolling
maureen grabs will and penny pulls them down just as the robot blows away their tubes
john pulls a laser pistol from a wall mount
the robot spins towards john fires an electrical charge john dodges at the last instant the grazing blast burning his silvery suit singeing his side sending into the wall his
will ducks under his mothers arm scrambles across the bridge
the robot fires at the scrambling boy but misses will disappearing down the gunny hatch leading to the lower decks
don leaps from his tube atop the robots back trying to grab the robots power source
the mechanical monster electrifies his shell sending the major flying
the robot turns to penny and maureen
extends his arms toward them
electricity arcing between his claws
the two are done for
maureen puts her hand over pennys eyes
look away baby
the robot is about to fire
suddenly the robot freezes his claws deactivate his power lights go to stand by and he stands immobile
will stands in the b
his tiny hacking deck in his hands
return to your docking bay and power down
the robot turns and begins heading for the elevator
all watch in amazement
will grins a familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes
if the family wont come to the science fair bring the science fair to the family
an explosion rocks the ship
mom look its doctor smith
penny stands over smith who lays crumpled in the corner
maureen grabs an emergency medi kit from a wall clamp tosses it to penny
pulse respiration and bleeding basic triage lock down and stabilize
i know the drill
john is standing helps don to his feet
next picnic no robots
don moves fast to the helm
the main view screen is still closed covered by giant metal blast shields
communications links are down
maureen is at the life sciences console
life support is at ten percent
trying to bring secondary systems on line
its not working
video monitor pov
penny is bandaging smiths head her bravado barely masking her fathoml ss terror
explosions rock the ship
danger is everywhere yet the space captive is fearless as she
a console flares
penny fights back tears terrified
i want to go home now
don is at the navigational system
rerouting power from the secondary couplings
try it again
finding a power tap
suddenly the lights go on the air compressors begin to hiss
life support is back on line
i cant get the blast shields open
were flying blind
penny in working ever smith bandaging his head
she runs stimulator under his nose
smith begins to stir coughing
ive got life signs
wincing boy somebody could use a breath mint
west turns spots smith for the first time
to john try the emergency back ups
don moves to the fallen figure lifts him up against the bulkhead
smith what the hell i was making a last minute check
someone hit me from behind
don almost buys it
then he notices smiths hand grabs it
the reprogramming modules distinctive foreign signature seared into his flesh
sino jordanian technology
youre a goddamned spy
realizing you did this
don slams him against the bulkhead begins dragging him towards the airlock
the pilot hits a switch
the inner hatch opens
what are you doing
dropping some extra weight
maureen stands at judys freezing tube
the young doctors cryofield is sparking on and off
the thawing engine in broken
cant get her out
smith uses the distraction to palm slam don in the chin knocking him backwards
don staggers goes again for smith
touch me and the girl dies
don freezes in his tracks
your mission physician is indisposed
i can save her life
but only if you spare mine
i dont deal with dead men
kill me i kill the girl
how much is your revenge worth major
i will of course need your word as an officer that you will let me live
dons decision is lighting fast
ive got a com signal
suddenly the radio squawks into life
is mission control
do you read
jupiter two this is emergency powers on line
i think i can get these blast shields open
the blast shields part to reveal a giant fiery orb in their path
they are heading directly for the sun
noah stands over the com
the room is a madhouse
give me a telemetry projection
noah looks up at the main monitor
the graphic of the jupiter two is heading towards the graphic of the sun
john and don stand over the com
youre way off course
we show you in the suns gravitational pull
how long do we have
we count seven minutes before your outer hull begins to melt
don straps himself into the pilots chair
im going to try for the mercury mines
smith stands at the freezing tube penny and maureen assisting him
i will need dr
robinsons portable gurney
i believe it is stored in im on it
penny races off
smith begins working the controls to judys freezing tube
we trusted you
sinking in you tried to kill us all
existence offers us nothing if not the opportunity for an endless series of betrayals
off her stunned expression theres a world behind the world professor robinson
lie once cheat twice and everything becomes clear
do not mistake my deception for a character flaw
it is philosophical choice a profound understanding of the universe
it is a way of life
youre a monster
but i am also the only one who can save your daughters life
penny reappears a case in hand
she presses a button and the case unfolds into a hovering gyroscopicaly leveled gurney
hes futzing with that robot
alright penny dear i need you to short the power on my command
does he have to call me dear
professor if you will assist me in lowering the body
smith hands penny a wrench
penny slams the wrench into the power circuit
the freezing field flares and deactivates the tube swinging open
lifesign monitor close
smith and maureen lower her onto the gurney
penny maureen and smith rush the gurney out the blast doors towards sickbay just as the ship tilts madly
the sun is growing ever larger
unable to re route to mercury
the suns pull is too strong
a beat noah i need options
major west we are unable to provide contingencies
a beat im sorry don
on screen the jupiter two is heading towards the sun
penny smith and maureen have transferred judy onto a hi tech scanning bed
a hovering holographic schematic of judys physiognomy appears over her descends onto her body
no cardio pulmonary or respiratory functions
body temp at fahrenheit
get her flight suit off
penny unzips the silver material as smith works the console highlighting her holographic heart
the holographic image of her heart beats once then is still
the lights flicker on the bio console the holograph winks out
were losing her
chapter initiate hyperdrive don and john man the com
the sun is a raging fireball dead ahead
ive re routed all secondary systems to the main drive
she wont budge
shortest baby sitting mission ive ever done
my familys not going die in space
im open to suggestions
outer hull breach in seconds
smith begins pumping judys chest by hand
come on child
put a little heart in it
smith steps back begins precise staccato blows to judys chest
hit i save
hit may be hit my own
smith stops presses his ear to her chest takes her pulse
then judy opens her eyes manages a weak smile
you should try to look less worried
it has a tendency to spook the patients
to smith thank you
smith holds her gaze his eyes almost snake like
you are a good woman maureen
any man could see that
i hope i have proven the well being of your family is of great importance to me
perhaps if you convinced your husband to trust me
maureen stares at him
she pulls a laser from the wall
points it at his forehead
stabilize her smith
because you only breathe as long as she does
the ship is shaking in the mighty pull of the sun
don is struggling to keep the ship stable
heat seal breach in seconds
theres got to be some way to get through this
don stares at him
we cant get away from the sun
so we have to go through it
the hyperdrive engage the hyperdrive without a gate we could be thrown anywhere in the galaxy anywhere but here
were getting resident radiation distortions from the space craft
she must be breaking up
let me see those numbers annie
the techie hands him a sheet
noah looks for a beat
son of a bitch
hes powering up the hyperdrive
the saucer is elongating slightly changing its shape as it prepares to enter hyperspace
will scrambles onto the bridge heads towards john who is working the main control panel
hyperengines coming on line
heat shield breach
the sun covers the entire windscreen a furious landscape of flame
hyperdrive at percent
major you have the com
zero to million miles a second in under a minute
lets see what this baby can do
john takes wills hand as west engages the hyperdrive
west john and will are hurled backwards from the sudden acceleration sticking to the walls and ceiling respectively
maureen and penny watch as smith swaddles judy in thermal blanket
suddenly maureen penny and smith fly against the walls
judy is held in place by the gurney straps
the graphic of the space craft is beginning to flicker as it merges with the graphic of the sun
we cant keep a fix on her sir
shes starting to disappear
noah stares at the screen
the jupiter two flies into the mighty ball of the sun
and just as it reaches the tallest of the gaseous mountains the ship becomes translucent falling through the orb elongating and then vanishing in a sudden star of hyperspace
the sky breaks apart giving way to a starfield
suddenly space distorts and in a sudden flash a ship appears hurling into the darkness
the jupiter two
the jupiter two comes to rest at the edge of an alien twin starred solar system near a giant crimson planet
chapter lost in space maureen kneels before penny and will making sure theyre okay
smith stands silently in the b
judys gurney is empty
john enters his face wrought with fatherly concern
is everyone okay
all in one piece
although major west has the most puzzling definition of a smooth ride
just then judy emerges through a door zipping up her flight suit
boy either i cut down on the coffee or sew in a flap
its hell getting in and out of this thing
are you vitals are normal
pulse and respiration seem to be baby are you okay
im fine daddy really
john holds her close spared a fathers worst fear
will every disaster be an excuse for familial sentiment
please tell me now so i may gather up a liberal supply of space sickness bags
don turns towards smith
maureen steps between them
what happened john
where are we
don in at the navigational holograph patching sparking wires
the rest of the crew emerge onto the bridge
you had me worried doc
nice to see you thawed
smart maneuver with the hyper drive
a fighter who thinks what do you know
youre just in time for the show
don makes a connection
the pedestal powers up a holograph of the jupiter two appearing over its surface
computer map our current location
holographic pedestal close
the area around the jupiter two is now filled with a holographic representation of the alien solar system
see anything familiar
don just shakes his head
searching for recognizable constellations
a beat unable to locate
this computer has star maps of the entire known galaxy
were lost arent we
judy wraps her arm around her sister
what the hell is that
the nearest planet is starting to glow
suddenly a distortion field begins to emanate from the alien world
the edges of space seem to sear away leaving a glowing portal
any effect on the ship
all the planets and constellations beyond the portal appear to be in different places
off the navigational hologram all the planets have moved
and where did that come from
chapter the proteus breaking the inner edge of the portal a long silver space needle catches the light from the dual suns
the crew man their stations
only will is absent as they the ship maneuver around the portal
as they move behind the portal it seems to disappear showing only the blackness of space
no ship beyond
go back in front of it
as the ship moves back in front of the portal the hole in space is visible again the giant probe ship revealed once more within
its a hole in space
a doorway to where
if we want to reach that ship were going to have to find out
the jupiter two flies through the pulsing hole in space
the giant silver ship looms in the windscreen
no apparent effects on the ship
im hailing on all frequencies
there are some markings on the starboard side
can you throw some light on her
dont know if the exterior spots are working
there we go
the windscreen close
powerful spotlights hit the ship
west and john close
and really surprised
if this in all a dream why cant there be more girls
the spaceship close
essentially a needle covered with metal scallops
on its hull under the legend proteus an american flag
ive never seen a design like this
what are those scales on her hull
how could earth launch a ship this massive and neither of us know about it
it just doesnt make sense
these scanners are damaged im getting inconsistent life signs but they may be sensor ghosts
maybe her computers still up
im trying standard remote access codes
on screen a docking ring on the giant ship comes to life giant floods coming to life the docking aperture rotating open
what do you know
the jupiter two heads towards the giant ship
can you give me some light on the secondary docking ring
a smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen
what do you make of that
attached to the starboard docking ring is another smaller craft
its snaking anthropomorphic lines are not of human design
boys i think were having a close encounter
the jupiter moves into the docking ring of the giant ship
over a giant thud as the jupiter two docks with the probe
the robot in rolling in through the doorway arms waving wildly before him
don and john are up fast
but the robot just rolls to a stop
will steps from behind the automaton his hackers deck in his hand
he pulls a tiny mic from his deck
lifts it to his lips
will points to several jury rigged modifications
i hacked into his cpu bypassed his main operating system and accessed his sub routines
hes basically running on remote control
all stare at him
penny finally speaks
penny stands guard a rifle in her hand talking into her recorder
and so the space captive finds herself helping the robinsons by guarding the traitor
and she finds pennys voice trails off
stares out the porthole
she finds that out here in the dark and cold shes scared and shes kind of glad theyre all together
just then don approaches a silver bundle under his arm
identify yourself soldier
west major united space force requesting permission to see the prisoner
penny steps aside
proceed major west
don smiles winks at her going through the door
could he be cuter
i dont think so
actually a med lab
smith turns to face don an he enters
these quarters are totally unacceptable
i demand don tosses his bundle on the seat
a silver flight suit
were going to check out the probe ship
maybe we can figure out how they got here
and how to get home
have a wonderful trip
youre coming with us
out of the question
im a doctor not a space explorer
you and but don is in his face in a heartbeat
what you are is a murderous saboteur and i am not leaving you on this ship so you can do more harm than youve already caused
i absolutely refuse closer give me an excuse to kill you
smith stares at him a beat
then he smiles looks to the flight suit
silver always was my color
will stands in front of the robot polishing a blast mark clean
when boarding a mysterious spacecraft it always pays to look your best
john enters removes a gun from the weapons locker
rifle is active
a small light goes from red to green
you did a good job up there son
you saved us all
an awkward silence hangs between them
i know i havent around much these days
that we havent had time to professor were ready
john looks at his boy will in silent
will youre the most important thing in the world to me
i hope one day youll be able to see that
with that john walks out
will stares after him
faces the robot
take care of my dad okay robot
will works his remote sending the robot towards the bridge
a long dark corridor
slowly the ambient lights come up
a door opens to reveal smith john don judy and the robot stepping out of the docking chamber the airlock closing in the b
the air is stale
thats the smell of ghosts
don walks to a computer panel set into the wall
im interfacing with the on board computer
no its just i dont know too fast
most of the systems are down
the robot rolls deeper into the alien ship
the others follow
more lights flicker into life illuminating the long corridor ahead
motion sensors are still working
what do you make of this
smith john and judy join don at one of the bulkhead walls
some kind of hieroglyphics
a series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall
the sketches tell a story
the alien craft docks with the giant ship
second hieroglyph close a trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter the giant ship
third hieroglyph close
the shape of a sun or a disc from which juts many legs
this final hieroglyph is circled in a clotted red substance
don touches the stain
chapter exploration if i didnt know better id say this is blood
i know an omen when i see one
i suggest a hasty retreat
just imagine were retreating in the opposite direction
now move it
don shoves smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle the group heading deeper into the quiet ship
will watches through the robots pov toggling to move the automaton forward
a readout marked audio flashes
will turns up a volume control
over the sound of a slow steady drip
dad do you
the robot turns begins heading further down the corridor
over now dripping can be heard by all
like the drip drip drip of blood
you really need to shut up
the ceiling shows a jagged hole covered with some kind of viscous membrane leading to the dark of a service tunnel above
the membrane drips steadily onto the floor below
that material appears biological
nothing good will come of this
what makes you such an expert
trust me major
evil knows evil
lets find the bridge
maybe we can get some answers
they head off
hold on the dripping membrane
maureen is at the main sensor console working an instrument panel
penny is hanging upside down in a harness overhead using a laser welder on a giant mass of exposed ceiling circuitry
try it now mom
maureen throws a switch
the panel lights up then goes dead
the boarding party stand at the end of the corridor
don presses a wall panel
the giant doors hiss open to reveal
and battle torn
sections of the controls have been blown away
blast scoring mars the walls
what the hell happened in here
some kind of fire fight
look at this technology
ive seen some of this before
on the drawing boards
smith has moved off slightly wandered over to a storage alcove
within a row of docked robots larger and sleeker then ours
john and don are powering up the com console lights coming on
can you bring up the captains log
the data has degraded
im going try and gather any fragments i can
there isnt much but
here we go
main screen close
fills with snow
then a figure can be seen
but his hair is grey
the hyperspace tracker seems to be functioning
static no sign of the jupiter two
static have exceeded our mission timetable by two
static im not willing to give up
don would keep looking for me
the rest of the data is totally corrupted
in the alcove smith frees a power pack from one of the robots
slips it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit
this doesnt make sense
how could they launch a rescue mission for us when weve only been lost a day
judy stands by the life sciences panel
ive got something here
a turning holograph appears over the console panel
a degraded image of a trembling viscous pouch
tiny shapes move within
they brought it up from the planets surface
its seems to be some sort of egg sack
don notices smiths standing in the storage alcove
smith step away from there
happy to oblige major
although i dont think its me you should be worrying about
but rather this
in the corner of the ceiling another membrane covered hole
will is at his station watching don and john via the robots pov
im detecting motion
a towering shadow shoots past the open doorway
to the robot bring smith
don races down the corridor
the walls are matted with flowering plants
vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor
the scurrying shape about the size of a small dog shoots out from behind a bulkhead disappearing into the lush greenery
don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to a door
a plaque reads hydroponics lab
he races inside
john and judy arrive behind don
this explains where all the plants came from
growth like this would take decades
the robot arrives through the lab door carrying smith in one claw
unhand me you mechanical moron
dons eyes fix behind smiths head
i am sick of your terrorism
if you are going to kill me be done with it
otherwise i will insist you treat me with the respect and like steel i said dont move
smith is suddenly silent
dons hand shoots out just missing smiths head disappearing into the brush behind him leaves flying as he pulls from its hiding place a small creature
about the size of a large stuffed bear spiny skin going from leaf color to red shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales of a tiny dragon
and bright yellow cats eyes
will is watching through the robots eyes
west stares down at the creature in his hand now a calmer and more friendly blue
well who do we have here
as the beast struggles in dons hand it changes color chameleon like trying to hide
don holds fast
easy there little buddy
no ones going to hurt you
how do you know it wont hurt us
don has begun stroking the creatures head
after a beat the small beast begins to coo and emit small blipping sounds
looks like youve made a friend
you have a good bedside manner major
im going to let that one go
doctor dolittle of outer space
where do you think it came from
its possible this is one of the creatures represented in the hieroglyphs we saw on the wall
it must have been their ship attached to the other docking ring
the beast has moved onto dons shoulder is now clutching there burying its tiny face into his neck
don cant help but laugh
it looks like a child
if so my dear major what do you suppose happened to its parents
lets get back to the bridge
as they leave a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the background
chapter giant spiders
penny is still hanging overhead
i think ive got it
the sensor console comes back to life displays lighting status lights going green
maureen stares at the monitor
revealed in the sensor scan the scallops pulse with ambient heat
penny lands beside her
those scales are giving off heat
john is at the com
ive tapped into the internal sensor array
besides us this ship is totally deserted
a ghost ship
don is sitting with the tiny creature
he pulls a ration pack from his pocket
turns it over in his hand
and the flavor of the day is
who thinks up these combinations
the creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip sucks a bit loudly
judy cant help but smile at him
major west i highly recommend you never breed
that by the way is my medical opinion
don glares at him hands the tiny creature the pouch
the creature looks at it emits a small blip takes a tentative suck
its eyes widen in delight as it begins to suck the ration pack
little thing was hungry
good lord who will spare us the tyranny of the sentimental
over a distant high pitched whine
do you hear something
suddenly the creature begins to scream leaping on smiths back clinging to his neck for dear life
get this infernal creature off me
the whine is growing louder
it seems to be coming from above
the ceiling close
there in the corner the membrane covering the hole seems to be trembling
this cant be good
you have a remarkably keen sense of the obvious
maureen stands with penny at the main sensor station
john get the hell out of there
the silver disks on the hull of the probe ship are beginning to move rising to stand now on spindraled legs
heads and legs emerging the disks reveal themselves to be armor plated spiders
the monsters find viscous holes in the outer hull and push through vanishing into the probe ship
over a thud
the jupiter two shakes as if struck
give me an external view
penny works the console
spiders are leaping from the probe onto the jupiter two
the lizard monkeys screaming has reached new heights of hysteria
a shape begins to push through the viscous bole in the ceiling
what bursts in is a monster out of nightmare
nearly half the size of a human shiny metallic body from which wet spider like limbs extend
a fang covered vaw opens below ravenous green eyes
don draws his laser and fires but the blast only reflects off the metallic surface of its torso forcing the creature to retract its limbs and eyes hiding within its
the team races for the door as several more spiders drop through the hole in the ceiling landing in the bridge and scampering fast towards our fleeing heros
the boarding party race down the corridor
the spiders are bounding after them using walls floor and ceiling with equal facility
will is madly working his keyboard controlling the fleeing robot
this joy stick is too slow
activate holographic interface
a holographic robot appears on the bridge
will steps inside the image now moving with his body
he spins facing backwards firing
the robot is holding up the rear its torso swiveled backwards so it can retreat and fire simultaneously
the robots plasma blasts have more effect than the lasers blowing the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal
but more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor ceiling some giving chasing others swarming injured comrades
judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren
they eat their wounded
our heroes race to a nexus corridors leading off in all directions
spiders are dropping from the ceiling around them
a graphic map flashes within the holograph
probe ship corridor now right
the spiders are swarming closing fast
got to seal the bulkhead
the door control is at the other and of the corridor
the fire sensor
judy pulls her gun fires hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the corridor
blast doors slam sealing out most of the spiders
blast doors close
metal teeth begin tearing through the steel
our group has made it to the door to the docking bay
they rush in the robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there
don activates the airlock to the jupiter the batch slowly opening
the robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay firing at the spiders as they come down the hall blowing them away
more pour through the now rending blast doors
there are just too many rolling towards them now like a single shifting mass of death
open damn you
its cycling a vacuum check
there is no way to speed up the protocols
i warned you not to come aboard this cursed craft
youve killed us
youve killed us all
judy throws him hard into the wall
now thats a bedside manner
the first spiders reach the robot leaping onto its metal bull
maureen and penny are at the com powering up the engines
will is within the holograph fighting off the spiders
the robots shell electrifies the spiders recoiling
the airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside
will get the robot in here
the robot stands in the open portal covered by spiders their fangs shredding his hull his electrical charge beginning to short
will is throwing off the monsters extending the robots antenna spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by
i cant move him without letting the spiders into the ship
leave him behind
im sorry robot
a spider pushes past the robot head slipping around his metallic body bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within
don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free rushing towards the dropping airlock door
smith recoils from the swiping talon
smiths back close
a tiny rand and beneath a razor thin incision
the door drops the spiders arm still twitching severed inside the airlock
the inner airlock door opens
the crew tumble in
get us out of here
don is already powering up the ships engines as smith tries separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey
get this cloying gargoyle off of me
he throws the beast hard across the bridge
the creature hits the wall screeching begins racing across consoles
john has strapped in beside don
get me an external view
a monitor shows the hull of the jupiter two
more spiders are leaping onto the ship attaching themselves to the hull
prepare to disengage
the lizard monkey skitters up the back of pennys chair over her head getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap
get it off me
get it off
penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face
the tiny creature on her lap begins a perfect imitation of penny
don releases the docking ring glances at the monitor
the hull of the ship is now entirely covered with spiders
lizard monkeys eyes widen in terror as the ship shakes burying its head in pennys chest
then penny hugs the tiny beast
everythings going to be alright
but she sounds anything but sure
everybody hang on
the jupiter twos engines blow peeling into the endless night
over alarms sound
i think those things were using the probe ship as a way to trap food
that i s probably what happened to the monkeys parents
we were going to be desert
but what happened to the crew
were not out of the woods yet
the hull of the jupiter two is covered with the giant spiders their teeth cutting through the outer hull
lets see how these monsters like a hundred thousand volts
the hull glows with electricity
the spiders fly off into space their limbs and heads retracting
and the crowd goes wild
recall your nightmares from childhood major
monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded
over a thunk
on screen the spiders shoot webs from their bellies attaching to the jupiter land on the hull again re extending their limbs starting to burrow once more
can you hit them again
every time i electrify the hull im draining our systems
once or twice more and were going to be dead in space
a fate i fear may be inevitable one way or another
maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spiders severed limb in metal tongs
carries it to her life sciences analyzer
thats the same expression you had when my mother came to stay with us
maureens monitor close
a graphic of the severed spider leg
a small line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure
musculature and flesh are drawn in on the screen
dna extrapolation coming up
admantium shell and lack of respiratory system suggest an ability to live in deep space
tiny front brain implies communal relationships
more like bees
views creen close
more and more spider are spiraling from the probe ship all heading toward the jupiter two
there are thousands of those things maureen is working the computer
they may be attracted to heat and light
don begins typing
with the right command codes i can light up the probe ship from here
more spiders are hitting the bull
command codes are sequenced
try the next series
but they wont work until the next fleet of ships are built
thats at least two years away
just do it
don begins entering command codes
the mighty probe ship begins to power up engines glowing red as they begin their initial burn
how did you know
think about it don
the shipss advanced technology
your friend looking old
what if that ship is from our future
outer hull has been compromised
spiders are eating through the outer hull
its not working
can you get the fusion drive on line
the probe ships fusion drives fire
a few of the spiders divert back toward the probe ship
but most still head for the jupiter
lets turn up the heat
don engages the thrusters grabs the throttle
the jupiter two banks toward the probe ship heading directly for the wake of the fusion drives
inner hull breach in twenty seconds
give them a little encouragement
electrifying outer hull
the outer bull flashes with electricity the spiders jumping off
don pilots the craft directly through the wake of the fusion drive
the spiders jump off begin attaching themselves to the nacelles of the giant probe ship
on screen the giant spiral of spiders in now heading back towards the giant probe ship
get us out of here
don looks at john a beat then he begins working the controls
what are you doing
never leave an enemy stronghold intact
one of your fathers first rules of engagement
don hits a button
on the remote control console a readout begins to flash
the message is simple fusion drive overload
thats a direct order
we might need to salvage this is a military emergency
that means im in command
im ordering you i hate spiders
don hits a button
the panel light flashes overload
hang on it i a gonna be a bumpy ride
don angles the ship away punching the thrusters as the probe ships engines begins to glow
the probe ships nuclear core overloads
the engines begin to glow venting plasma and then explode like a nascent star
the blast wave spreads across space vaporizing the spiders
the blast wave hits the jupiter two
the ship is buffeted by the shock wave
i cant hold her
the ship is knocked into the atmosphere of the giant planet below
don is struggling to keep control
were going down
the ship is hurling toward the planets cloud obscured surface
the windscreen is filled with a rushing blizzard
cant get the stabilizers on line
the storm clouds suddenly part to reveal
a don banks the controls
the ship tilts on its side passing between two snowy peaks still plunging towards the planets wintry surface below
im reading a clearing ahead
im going to try and make it
the jupiter two blows over a carpet of snowy treetops the canopy of leaves bursting into flames from the friction of the hull
the surface is coming up fast
got to slow us down
the jupiter two hits the surf ace of the water and skips once twice three times across the alien sea
brace for impact
the ship smashes into a crater miles long plowing through rock and vegetation finally coming to rest near one of the crater walls
automatic fire systems spray gas everywhere
only the dimmest emergency lights cast any glow
everybody by the numbers
maureen straightens rubs her neck
life sciences still breathing
mission medical im alive
robotics i mean
video mechanics okay
im alive major wests poor excuse for piloting skills not withstanding
lets take a look
don hits a switch the windshield de icing becoming clear
i dont think were in kansas anymore
before them lies the crater snow covered floor spreading out towards a distant horizon stained red by two hanging crimson suns
chapter follow orders
the moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield
the jupiter two sits near the wall of the crater its tiny lights fighting the otherworldly darkness
you violated a direct order
john and don stand by the giant drive engines
don is holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips some glowing with radioactive fire others dull and charred as coal
about half the core material is burned out
well never generate enough power to break orbit
i told you not to blow that ships reactors and you did it anyway
come on professor give it a rest
i was technically still in command
dont hand me that
im commander of this mission
look no offense but youre an egghead with an honorary rank
no one ever intended you to handle combat situations
youre spouting some nonsense about time travel while those spiders posed a continuing threat
i made a judgement call and if i have to ill make it again
hell you of all people should understand that
if your father were here my father is not here
my father is dead killed in one of his combat missions you so admire
my family is on this ship and youre going to follow my orders
whether you agree with them or not
is that clear major
dons face is right up in johns
save the speeches
i like you
but the fate of the earth is at stake here
im going to do whatever i think it takes to ensure the success of this mission
with or without your help
is that clear professor
the two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight
kissing seems less than likely
am i interrupting something
maureen stands in the doorway
i think you two should go ahead and slug it out
i mean here we are stranded on an alien world and you boys want to get into a pissing contest
so please go for it
ill have judy down here in a heartbeat to declare you both unfit and ill take over this mission
now i dont want to hear another word from you two until you can play nice
is that clear
maureen listen not another word
a beat better
now if youve finished hosing down the decks with testosterone i suggest you come with me
i may have found a way to get us off this planet
maureen turns on her heal and exits
the two men exchange a look
tell me about it
they head after her
chapter danger will
out of sequence in screenplay
will sits working over his hackers deck
can you hear me
will tunes the deck
robot unable to register neural net outputs
unable to locate motor controls
unable calm down
your body was destroyed in the conflict with the space spiders
do you remember
but i downloaded your neural net
robot tried to destroy the robinson family
why would will robinson save robots personality
your actions do not compute
i guess sometimes friendship means acting with your heart not your head
friendship does not compute
dont worry robot
im going to build you a new body
will turns to face a pile of pirated components from various par of the ship
he lifts a circular bubble of diodes
mom always said i should try to make new friends
chapter follow orders
return to chapter maureen stands at her life sciences station with john and don
the atmosphere here can sustain human life
ive located rads radioactive material a mile north
thats at least what wed need to get the core functioning again
john looks out the viewscreen at the alien night
turns to don
well set off at daybreak
itll be safer
those are my orders major
i agree with your recommendation professor
dztente is a beautiful thing
judy examines the lizard monkey
penny strokes the tiny creature producing a string of blips
whats the diagnosis doc
is it cowboy or ballerina on halloween
right now shes a girl
but i think your little pal here is from a self replicating species
at different stages of life she or he probably alternates sexes
imagine the savings on dating outfits alone
the tiny creature has begun playing with an aural scanner
can i keep her
penny youve never taken care of a thing in your life besides yourself
shes all alone
i promise ill look after her
she needs me
the moment you misplace her or forget to feed her we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild
im not kidding penny
and with that judy exits
penny sits stroking the tiny creature
were both a long way from home arent we little one
the creature makes a tiny blip
thats what well call you
blip reaches out touches a green ribbon around pennys wrist
you like that
penny takes the ribbon off ties it around blips wrist
blip looks up eyes glowing
penny caresses the tiny creatures cheek
the creature reaches up touches pennys cheek
her tiny tongue trying to imitate pennys words of comfort
judy stands just out of sight watching her sister smiling
chapter alien world don shoves an indignant smith into the room adjusts a newly installed security panel in the wall
remove that lock this instant
i shall not be caged like some animal lethal i gave my word id let you live
i never said for how long
these quarters will be fine
smith stares at him a beat
tell me major west
are you really confident in robinsons ability to guide us
if i were set free i would support your right to command
with minimal force we could take this ship and assure this mission continues under your leadership
my god smith youre right
how could i have been so blind
ill just run and get you a gun so we can hijack the ship
sarcasm is the recourse of a weak mind
im hiding the pain
and with that west leaves
smith tries the door
then from one cuff of his field suit be removes the control belt he stole from the probe ship
i assure you major west
your pain has just begun
smith moves about the room lifting small bits of metal creating an impromptu set of tools with which to alter the control bolt
hold on smiths back
beneath the rend in his suit the tiny tear in his flesh is now covered with tiny alien scales
judy sits in one of the command chairs over a the remains of a meal sipping water staring out into the alien night
star light star bright
a million strange stars and only one wish
i wish we were home
don comes and sits in the co pilots chair beside her
i never thought a sky could look so alien
we really are lost
when the first sailors circled the globe and saw a brand new sky they thought they had sailed off the edge of the earth
but they were really just around the corner
smiles we just billow our sails and let the wind blow us home is that it major
so those sailors found familiar shapes in the stars to make the skies more friendly to help them find their way
don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen
it shows the star field above
he lifts a light tipped stylus
thats how constellations were born
don begins to draw on the screen connecting the stars like dots in a childrens book
slowly a familiar porcine face takes form
porky the wise and mighty pig
she takes the stylus
begins to draw
the great bucktoothed bunny
judy cant help but smile back
their faces are close
so my quarters or yours
we are the only single man and woman of consenting age in the galaxy
how much more of a set up do you need
so you figure just dispense with the pleasantries get down to business
you have a way with words doctor
provocative right here
on this console
don moves his face to hers only a breath apart
here would be fine
judy smiles sweetly
suddenly water begins to pour down over his head
his eyes open wide
judy holds her empty glass in hand
next time fly slower
she rises walks off leaving don mopping his brow
maureen sits on the edge of her bed brushing her hair as john activates the automated security systems
what was i thinking bringing us all out here into space
the world needed saving
you were the right man for the job
but solving the worlds problems doesnt leave much time for the people you love does it
did you get any time with will
now hes decided he can rebuild the robot
wants to show me his designs
ive got too much to do funny creatures men
you try so hard not to be your fathers end up making the same mistakes
will adores you
he needs your attention
we cant get off this planet much less back on course
i dont have time to
john just listen to him
it doesnt matter what hes saying
sometimes at least in the eyes of their fathers little boys have to come first
as soon as we get back into space were going to spend some real time together
maureen looks out the window
a long beat
then she smiles
its nice to have our family under one roof
even if we had to go half way across the galaxy to manage it
john presses a button the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked orbs of three glowing moons
how would you feel about a little late night tutorial professor
john moves to her begins pulling her down out of frame
what are you doing
going for extra credit
the ship sits on the alien landscape
good night john
good night maureen
good night judy
good night will
good night penny
you guys have got to be kidding
chapter the core will comes up on the elevator rubbing his eyes first awake in the morning
he stumbles to the viewscreen
his eyes widen with shock
a giant portal shimmers at snows edge about yards from the ship
beyond it a sun stained field of towering plants and trees
the crew gathers at the table
over a rumbling
the ship shakes
what are those rumblings
theyve been happening all morning
how can half the landscape have grown up overnight
okay lets get settled
maureens monitor close
a geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched
but this planets geothermic plates dont match up
i was afraid of this
al eyes turn to john
i think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways
doorways to where
perhaps the professor was hit on the head when we landed
remember the portal that lead us to the probe ship
what if we crossed a into a time years after earth sent a rescue mission
youre not serious
time travel is impossible
no its not
its just improbable
like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago
nothings really impossible
this world could be riddled with doorways to the future
so if we walk into that forest outside were really just walking into this crater years from now
geological plates from different times wouldnt fit together
that would explain the tectonic mismatch
but doorways in time john
if these portals are opening and closing part of some cascading natural phenomenon they could be tearing this planet apart these portals are exactly what i predicted my time machine
what if the doorways arent natural
a machine that bends space like our hyperdrive could be modified to bend time as well
what if someone on this world has built a device
son i appreciate your input but now isnt the time for flights of fancy
you never listen to me
and with that will storms out
john stares after him a beat sorely wanting to follow
over another rumble
theres no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely
don and i are going to locate the radioactive material for the core
get the ship ready to go
we may have very little time
john suited up heads for the open front hatch when he spots will sitting alone in the com chair tinkering with his deck
arent you coming out to say goodbye
will just shakes his head
youre always leaving
will looks away finally giving voice to his worst fear
what if one time you dont come home
john stares at his son unsure what to say the boys anguish so deep and apparent
he reaches into his shirt takes off his dog tags
whenever your grandfather went away on a mission held leave these with me
for safe keeping
and when he got home i d always be waiting to give them back
he lifts the chain and places it around the boys neck
im coming back will
will is silent
john touches the boys hair then walks out
will looks up after his father fingering the dog tags
the robinsons all except will stand gathered around the front of the ship
don has a small tracking device in his hand
ive got a fix on the radioactive material
its through the portal
well just have to hope the doorways remain stable
these crater walls are disabling the com links
you wont be able to communicate with the ship
over the ground shakes again
maureen come home to me professor
i love you wife
john kisses her
don looks at judy
im going to regret saying this but try to get back in one piece
this is kind of a kiss for luck occasion wouldnt you agree doc
im regretting it already
coy kisses have to be earned
say goodbye blip
blip reaches up and touches johns face
then her chirps form a rough approximation of the words penny taught her
you take care of her penny
kisses her head take care of you too baby
then the two men bead off towards the portal and forest beyond
smith stares out the cabin window
push in as yes enjoy your moments of trite familial bonding
he turns heads back to his table transformed now into a makeshift lab the stolen control bolt in mid modification
because they will be your last
the beginnings of wills home made robot sits on the table
will is in the f
riffling his personal cargo container
penny enters an assortment of small electronic devices hairclips and other metal and electronic objects
dumps them on the table
thats everything even close to nonessential
even my bellybutton ring
you want to come on a land survey
but will just shakes his head sulky
look what does dad know
maybe someone did build a time machine
she ruffles his hair
will activates a cpu speaker
robot is on line
over a knocking has begun
will looks up puzzled
it sounds like old morse code
chapter danger will
will walks down the corridor
over the knocking continues
will follows the sound until he comes to the door of smiths prison
smith is visible through the door window sitting at a table hammering out the code with his boot
he beckons will inside
will shakes his head
smith begins tapping again
sounding out the code danger
the door slides open and will enters a laser pistol in hand
you said someone is in danger
we all are
you are wise to arm yourself
smith eyes the weapon moving towards the boy
this gun is set to fire for me only so dont try anything funny
smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts passing the child going instead to the window and opening the blast shield
william you misjudge me
i only want to help you
you tried to kill us all
but now our fates are intertwined
if your father and that idiot west fail i will have no chance of getting home
it is in my best interests they succeed
and i always follow my best interests
smith gazes out at the exotic terrain
over an inhuman wail
what monsters roam these alien wilds
to set off blindly across this savage land
much as i hate to admit it it will be harder to manage without them
what are you talking about
theyll be back
theyll be okay
smith is silent
a long lethal beat
someone should go after them
will i forbid it
youre a boy
a clever one certainly but a child nonetheless
this planet is likely full of predators
even if you found them what if theyre hurt ravaged dying what good could you do
but youre a doctor
smith turns away hiding his smile
judy and maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds
geologists have speculated that dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds
part of a biospheres way of rejuvenating itself
this one is ten times more powerful then that on alpha prime
theres enough here to save earth
penny stands in the f
with blip on her arm taking plant samples talking into her video recorder
after much deliberation the space captive has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew
the robinsons after all can obviously use her help
blip jumps up on pennys arm knocking her recorder to the ground
flaring now look what youve done
stop hanging all over me
blip stares at her frightened by her tone begins backing away to the edge of the forest
she looks at penny then disappears into the thick brush
penny heads after the creature
hold on her recorder
chapter a different future will and smith are walking down a forest path
the boy has a radiation tracker in his hand
ive got a fix on dads suit beacon
dead ahead is a field of beautiful alien flowers their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea
wow thats moms favorite color
over a tremendous rumbling
the wind roars
suddenly the air in the distance begins to twist a rushing distortion sweeping towards them flowers growing landscape aging rapidly within
run child run
smith turns begins to flee pulling will with him away from the rushing warp
smith trips falls closes his eyes waiting for the distortion to overtake him
he opens his eyes
a glowing stationary portal shimmers behind him revealing beyond a forest ever older darker more overgrown
no sign of the boy
then from behind a tree will appears
the field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants the flowers a deep red
will rushes across the rip in space
see over here im in the future
steps back towards smith here im in the past
if my theories are correct these doorways should remain stable for a while anyway
i can barely contain my glee
why arent you aging like the plants
thats just an effect of the portals forming
once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like stepping between two rooms
off his tracker dads signal is this way
come on doctor smith
will takes smiths hand pulls him across the threshold
where he stands is now lush the sky overhead a glowing crimson
yet behind him the path in as it originally appeared
the sky bright
will has run deeper into the brush
smith notices something by his feet
he clears away the brush revealing shapes beneath the foliage
his expression darkens
what did you find
will has returned
come come son no time for distractions
lets move on
smith shoves will on the boy unable to see what smith saw
each bears a marking the names still legible
maureen penny and judy robinson
john and don emerge from the brush
they have come to one of the crater walls
john looks from the rock face to his tracker
damn is not good
the radiation signature weve been tracking
its a ghost
a reflection from the jupiter two bouncing off the ore in these walls
theres no core material here
over a sudden rumbling
the ground shakes
the roar of wind
a time portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw the side of the crater aging and crumbling in its wake
john and don race away from the distortion ducking falling trees roll clear as the portal stabilizes now a fixed doorway to a darker more deserted future
the ships back that way
we have to go through
penny is pushing through the forest
she spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance
blip sniffs the ground runs a few steps
there before blip is another glittering hole in time
the forest beyond is far thicker the sky red
blip steps through the portal
penny goes to the edge of the portal stares at the monstrously tall trees beyond
then she steps through following
penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and caverns cut into the crater wall
blip is standing over a large circular stone hopping up and down chirping and blipping madly
blip you cant run off like that
closing on the stone what the
the stone close
a series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant rock their images the same style as those on the probe ship
hieroglyph one close
a mighty battle in space is depicted
some kind of fight in space
it almost looks like the probe ship major west blew up
hieroglyph two close
a fiery star falls to the planets surface
that could be the jupiter two crash landing
hieroglyph three close
here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard monkey aloft her face remarkably like pennys
suddenly blip begins to shriek
over rustling leaves
shapes are moving in the trees the vague outline of camouflaged forms dropping to the ground
five figures suddenly de camouflage
lizard monkeys two large two smaller
directly in front of penny the largest monkey de camouflages
fully grown the beast is nearly twice pennys height
around the creatures wrist is something odd
an old tattered green ribbon
blip begins to scream and shriek
blip leaps on the giant creature grabs the ribbon
the beast could slap blip away like a fly
but the creature doesnt resist just stares down at blip with something akin to tenderness
blip looks at the ribbon in his hand
then at the one around her wrist
save for their age difference
the ribbons are identical
the giant monkey moves forward closing on a petrified penny paw reaching out touching her face
the beast begins stroking pennys cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort
penny stares up in stunned wonder
don and john are crossing the brush
the terrain in growing ever more desolate desert like
the double suns hang on the horizon
we should be able to see the ship
something catches the light on the ground beside them
don reaches down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand
on it is the familiar logo of the united space agency
could these be from the probe
this metal is decades old
don finds another piece of wreckage turns it over in his hand
its not possible
the fragment bears a simple legend jupiter two
what kind of nightmare is this
where the hell are we
no major when the hell are we
suddenly don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge goes flying
john ducks and rolls firing his laser from behind the cover of a rocky mound
john goes up to take another shot is bit with a powerful electrical blast falling hard
rolling out from behind him claws extended in attack position and apparently many years old is a rebuilt robot
will and smith are crossing the alien terrain
the plants have given way to desert
the suns hang low in the crimson sky
i feel like we got turned around
just follow your fathers signal young william
a boy of your intelligence shouldnt swear
at the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of the jupiter two
the lower sections are gone the hull scarred open to the sun
stirring to consciousness
or what is left of it
the occasional computer panel flickers shattered monitors
an awful history told in torn metal
john is slumped in a corner don still on the floor beside him
all things really do come to he who waits
a figure sits in the command chair visage obscured by shadow
what is this place
why professor the shock must have scrambled your brain
look around you
dont you recognize the spot
youve come home
this cant be
but even as the words cross his lips he knows it is
what have you done to the ship
wheres my family
your family is dead
dead and in the ground
what fickle consort in memory
time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday
the figure stands light hitting his face
long blond hair a shaggy beard and moustache
ill never forget that morning
twenty years ago
what was it you said
ill be back
but i knew better
you never came home
the figure walks to one of the burned out panels
without you your family never had a chance
a few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship
they reached the planet and attacked
i can still hear the women scream
who are you
the figure walks forward into the light
stands there a moment
then he lifts something hanging around his neck
tarnished metal old but familiar
johns fathers dog tags
dont you recognize me dad
im your son
maureen and judy lasers drawn are pushing through the brush
the four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around penny
baby are you alright
penny rises steps forward carrying blip
the other beasts hang back their faces genuflecting almost reverential
its okay mom
theyre not going to hurt us
its like they think im their princess or something
judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as maureen scrutinizes the images graven into the giant stone
best as i can tell this whole clan was spawned by this single creature
to the beast weve been a busy girl havent we
each creature seems to have unique corpuscular patterns on their palms
as individual an fingerprints no two alike
except the prints on this giant creature and our little blip match exactly
how did you know
because i think blip and our friend here are actually one and the same
penny and judy stare at her in wonder
the robot shoving john with one claw carrying don in the other follows older will into the giant room
father i give you
war torn and pirated
a pit of molten lava bursts through the floor above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by the pulsing field of the hyper drive
tendrils of fire strain towards the bubble
as they explode into the silver liquid images form within the sphere nearly coherent then gone
a tracked gantry stretches from the floor leading out over the bubble
at the end of the track a crows nest of computers shoots a single laser down into the center of the bubble
coming to ouch
who ordered me that last drink
what the hell is going on
i think we crossed into our own future
weve come back to the jupiter two decades after we left
look father what my flights of fancy have wrought
i used your hypergate to build my time machine
will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry
over the years i have struggled in vain to harness the awesome power of time
all my experiments at creating a stable doorway have been futile
today you will witness my ultimate triumph
will hits a button
a generator opens revealing a glowing cylinder of core material incrementally descending into the console
the core material
if we could get that back to our jupiter two
the doorways in time that led us here must be a side effect of his machine coming on line
like streams running into the ocean
once this core material in fully introduced into the control console i will open a doorway stable enough for one person to take one trip through time and space as
today i will change history
will turns a switch on the control console
over more tremors
the laser beams intensity grown and in the corridor cut by the beam into the bubble images begins to stabilize
images of earth
i will return home to the very day you took us on this cursed mission
ill stop us from taking off
ill do what you never could
ill save the family
ill save us all
your machine is ripping this planet apart
what if the force wave you ride home has the same effect on earth
what if in getting home you destroy earth in the process
then will turns away goes back to work
im going home
im going to save the family
will im your father
youve got to listen to me
let me tell you about my father
my father was a walking ghost
never there when i needed him
he dragged his family into deep dark space and lost them there
my father is not coming to the rescue
chapter spiders sting ext
alien planet evening future will and smith are closing on the battered ship
smith puts his hand on the boys arm holding him back
weve got to go inside
slow down now
we cant know what waits inside that ravaged craft
but we can be confidant it is nothing good
and i for one am frightened
but dads in there
will listen to me
i have crossed this world with you found your father as promised
but i cant let you go in there unarmed
but ive got a gun
if we go forward the barer of that weapon must be ready to kill
murder is a skill one which i have developed and luckily dear boy you have not
look inside your heart will
are you truly capable of taking a life
if not then i ask you now put your faith in me
give me your trust
give me that gun
will stares him
pulls free the pistol
thumbs the lock pad
enable gun for all users
will hands smith the gun
smith grabs will by the neck pressing the barrel to his temple
a brief lesson in survival on this world or any other
never trust anyone
remember it into your old age should you have one
shoving him forward now move
john stands facing older will
don is in the b
edging towards the control panel and the descending core material
we can go back across the portals to the past to the functioning jupiter two where your mother and sisters are still alive
we can use this core material to escape together
and then what
all of us lost in space
dont you see
i can do what you never could
i can save us all
don has edged his way to the descending core material
im afraid not
through the doorway comes young will smith walking behind him hand on his shoulder gun to his head
smith is here
dont move professor robinson or this rather peculiar family reunion will be tragically brief
off don ill ask you to step away from that console major
don stares at him a beat
then obliges walking over to join john
smith approaches the robot
well well some of us just dont know when to stay dead
smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt
i borrowed this from the probe ship in hopes of taking over the helm once we were in flight
but i seem to have found a better use instead
smith slaps the bolt on the robots cpu
the automatons arms go up then fall limp
lets try this dance again
you are the puppet
i am the puppeteer
do get it right this time
smith activates the bolt
the robot powers up once again
robot enable electric disrupters
the robots claws begin to glow with electricity
now thats a good gargantuan
smith walks to older will puts the gun to his head
say goodbye to your past
youre future lies with me
im going home in your place
smith starts to pull older will away when will comes forward staring at the time machine eyes wide with awe
you did it
just like i imagined
re routed the hypercore
but the natural power source the delivery system
i never thought of those
older wills smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger self
touches his hair
the future is never what it looks like when youre ten
nauseatingly sentimental but heartwarming
smith shoves the boy back to his father turns to older will
we certainly could have aged better i must say now show me how your little time machine works
but will just smiles
an odd moment for mirth dont you think
what are you grinning at
look around you doctor
at this hostile world
do you really think a boy could have survived all alone
unseen the boulder behind him seems to be moving shifting
a voice comes alien yet terrifyingly familiar
never fear smith is here
the shape behind him unfolds coming up now long spindled arms and legs ten feet tall a hybrid monster half spider half smith
hello doctor how nice to see me again after all these years
smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled legs goes down on its second knee joints coming eye to eye
the spiders sting had some unexpected side effects
spider smith flexes his three jointed arm
but my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world
spider smith reaches out and caresses wills cheek
turns to john
after the women were savaged i became the father will never had
he grabs smiths arms and begins to move him about like a marionette engaging in a bizarre dance with himself
bending him but you doctor
your crude ambition fills me with self loathing
twisting him you see i have looked within me and what i see is you
with that spider smith lifts smith over his head and hurls him like torpedo through a torn hole in the hull towards the rocks beyond
i never liked me anyway
spider smith turns to face the robot
kill them all
but my dear boy once the doorway in time stabilizes this planet is going to come apart at the seams
smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a twenties starlet
i am willing to perish here on this world for the sake of your most noble mission
but your selfish father will only try to stop you
his head comes forward neck elongating so he faces will
once your mission is complete none of this will have happened anyway
so why not just dispose of them
but wills gaze is impassive
spider smith actually sighs
robot take them inside the ship and keep them there
if they move then kill them
maureen and judy are examining the heiroglyph stone
the ground shakes
weve got to get to the ship
the clearing is empty
blip runs cut before them grabs maureens hand trying to pull her forward
where is she girl
in blips hand a mass of colored ribbons from pennys wrists
blip waves them in the air then races off
the women follow
the pulse laser is increasing its intensity the corridor of images in the bubble stabilizing
the tremors are increasing in frequency
spider smith stands with will watching as the robot shepherds the crew towards the body of the ship
well it would seem the time is upon us
off we go william
spider smith starts climbing the gantry truly like a spider up towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble
will walks to the control console platform the platform now beginning to rise on the gantry towards the bridge above
something hangs from below the climbing spider smiths back
its an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log
shouting will its a trick
smiths carrying an egg sack
if hes willing to stay on this world and die why is he about to spawn
hes going through the portal himself
the robot fires a charge between its claws
proceed to the ship or be destroyed
older will close
suddenly smiths head drops into frame
the creature is hanging upside down
time waits for no man
the platform bearing will reaches the top of the gantry and begins moving out across the bridge towards the crows nest
spider smith drops into place beside older will as the control platform comes to a stop on the crows nest
the core cylinder continues sinking into the console
smith looks out over the platform
beneath them imagine of infinity flicker
its almost time
i really am a word smith
once the core cylinder is fully injected the planet will begin to come apart and the time doorway will stabilize
then i jump in
a leap of faith
time bubble close
in the circle made by the laser the images are not yet stable but discernable
earth the day before the launch
tell me again old monster how did the girls die
weve been over this before son
the spiders attacked the ship in all the years since the spiders have never re surfaced
smith stares at him
then he smiles
a horrible sight
lets forget the past
will turns a switch
the laser generated aperture narrows
what are you doing
focusing the aperture
remember the energy around the portal will rip a man to pieces
isnt the doorway too small
not for me
a beat but then im not going am i
the spiders didnt kill the girls
it was you
i just never let myself see it
you kept me alive because you needed me
because i could build this for you
you killed my family
destroyed this world
and i helped
you became mad as the spiders
and i became you
poor poor boy
did you really think i would let you go home
let all that i have become vanish
look at me
i am no mere man
i am a god
spider smith opens his pouch revealing a thousand tiny spiders
your father was right
within me roil the growing needs of a master race
we will descend upon helpless earth
an entire planet to rule
his arm whips out grabbing will bringing him close opens his mouth bearing venomous fangs
an entire planet on which to feed
john and don talk in the holding area
the robot stands guard
over the tremors are increasing in frequency
ill run draw his fire
you may have time to get away with will
halt or robot will destroy
the men look up
in the b
will has approached the robot
do you remember what i taught you
a long time ago
friendship means acting with your heart not your head
thats why i rebuilt you
because i wanted us to be friends
friendship does not compute
act with your heart
robot has no heart
robot is powered by a fusion pulse generator every living thing has a heart
the robot stares at him a beat
any attempts to override command protocols may result in fused processors in my neural net
the floor trembles again
the planet is coming apart at the seams
please robot if you dont let us go were all going to die
im asking you now will you help us
will you be my friend
the robot stands still a beat
then he reaches towards smiths control bolt attached firmly on his cpu
robot attempting to deactivate control bolt commands overriddenattempting to reroute dangercircuitry overloadattempting to escape kill them kill them
the robots claws lift into attack position an electrical charge building with dangerous intensity
he is about to fire
at the last minute the robot jerks his hand upward blowing away a piece of the ceiling
he rips off the control bolt
you did it
robot will save
i will save will robinson
i will save my friend
chapter time to die
penny and maureen chase a frantic blip through the portal back into the daylight of the present
here too the world rumbles
penny stands in front of the jupiter two beckoning them urgently
where did you go
i came through the forest
i had a promise i had to keep
before maureen can respond the ground rumbles begins crumbling
don john will and the robot stand at the open hatch
outside the ground rumbles
youve got find your way back to the ship
the portals may still be stable
ill try to meet you there
what do you mean
im going to get that core material
its our only chance to escape
the family needs their father the crew needs their pilot
no matter what happens when the planet starts to break up you take off
without the core well never have enough power to make orbit
youve got to try
promise me don
then don extends his hand
just then will and the robot arrive
i want you to know fighting tears youll tell me when you get back to the ship
now there just isnt time
john bites back a bittersweet smile
over another rumbling
i could use a weapon
the robot extends his claw
a panel opens on his arm and he tears out a hand made component
a conduit made from wills golden first prize medals joined together to make a jagged star
professor i have a plan
jupiter two engine room control platform future spider smith has will against the rail
time to die son
im not your son
and with that will smashes spider smith in the face with two closed lists
smith recoils lifts the boy aver his head
smith hurls will over the rail towards the time pool below
the creature walks to the end of the arm stares at the forming aperture into the past below him
images of the day before the mission launch swirl in the laser generated opening growing ever more stable
will is hanging over the time bubble unconscious and unseen dangling from the gantry by a flashing chain around his neck
chapter time travel don and the robot will riding his back navigate the terrain alongside the ravaged hull of the jupiter two
on the ground crumpled in a heap is smith
don checks his pulse
hes still breathing
over the rushing wind
a portal opens before them to a far younger world
then another portal to a world far older
a third portal rips across the sky overhead
the time machine must be near full power
the portals are collapsing
which one leads us home
more portals are opening around them others winking shut
through a new rip in time the intact jupiter two can be seen in relief of the battered future craft
the ground beneath their feet is beginning to give way
we cant just leave him here
sure we can
off wills stare damn it
slapping the doctor smith
coming to oh the pain the pain
the portal is beginning to shimmer
the ground starts to fall away
don hurls smith through will the robot and west darting across the threshold just as the portal winks closed
the trees are bursting into flames an will don the robot and smith emerge from the woods
race forwards towards
the women are powering up the ship
the men are visible through the windscreen
outside the ground in beginning to crumble
mom the forest
penny opens the air lock
maureen holds close her son
the portal closed behind us
it was his only way back
mee ground close
a geyser of fire blows into the air
weve got to try and lift off
weve already begun the pre flight countdown
you have the com
off dons expression im going to save as many lives as i can major
now strap in
jupiter two engine room control platform future over tremors
more lava is rushing up towards the mercury the walls themselves beginning to crack
smith opens a gate at the end of the crows nest and a gang plank unfolds above the doorway in time
not so fast
john stands on the platform behind smith fighting star in hand slashes for his face
smith moves fast knocking the star to the gantry bridge with his arm
john leaps on smith using his fists
you sabotaged our mission
hook you killed my family jab you stole my son
its payback time
smiths head moves from each impact but the punches have no effect
grabs john and hurls him across the platform
spare me the fury of the righteous
the monster leans down over john
opens its jaw
i think theres time for a snack before my trip
johns hand is reaching towards the fallen fighting star
at the last moment john grabs the metal weapon from the catwalk slashes smith across the face silver red blood pouring down his cheek
sarcastic oh the pain
you aint seen nothing yet
john feints towards smiths head and then slashes low cutting the viscous membrane of the monsters egg pouch
spider smith close
remember the probe ship
these monsters eat their wounded
smiths egg sack close
scores of the tiny spiders are pouring out of the sack rushing up towards smiths face tiny jaws chomping
spider smith tumbles backwards falling against the rail on the side of the platform
john rises and rushes him shoulder slamming him sending smith hurling over towards the bubble below
spider smith hits the bubble missing the doorway formed by the red laser and is swept up by the tides of time
take all the time you want to die
spider smith screams as he disappears and reappears in the various half formed images within the bubble before vanishing altogether
the core cylinder has descended almost entirely into the main console
only seconds before its too late to retrieve it
the landscape is a sudden inferno
don is at the com
maureen strapped into the co pilots chair
i kept hoping somehow hed appear
maureen stares a beat out the window
lets go major
don hits the engine switch
mighty generators whine into life
quiet goodbye my love
chapter escape velocity the ship rocks as land masses on all sides begin to give way
engaging primary thrusters
the power drive begins to glow diodes spinning
the landing struts retract
the jupiter two begins to rise
control console close
the core material in sinking fast
john moves towards it when something on the gantry catches his eye
wedged into the grill work is a shiny scrap of metal reflecting the setting sunlight
johns fathers dog tags
john rushes to the rail
there still unconscious and hanging by the dog tag chain is older will
the metal links are pulling apart
will is seconds away from falling into the pool
the cylinder has completely sunken into the machine
its will or the core material
no time for both
john stands a beat immobile
then he drops to his knees reaching down as the chain breaks grabbing wills wrist at the last second
the dog tags tumble into the pool below as john hoists older will up onto the safety of the gangplank
come on son
will is still
then finally his eyes open
i thought i lost you
will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control panel the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the cylinders radioactive power
the world begins to explode
you could have taken the core and left before it was too late
you saved me instead
john stares at him
there wasnt any choice
i couldnt let you fall
youre my boy
the laser close
reaches full power
the image in the time pool stabilizes becoming clear
time pool close
mission control the day before the launch
father and son stare into the past eyes filled with wonder
they made it
through a torn hole in the hull and a glowing rip in space the jupiter two is rising into the flame ravaged sky
the ship is shaking madly
were not getting any altitude
the fire geysers are legion giant chunks of the planets surface now falling away beneath them
a huge spew of flame rages from the fire pocked surface hitting the bull of the tiny craft
judy is at navigation frantically enhance the stabilizers
im reading a power build up
markers in the red suddenly the panel explodes sending judy flying across the bridge
penny races to her sister
judys eyes are wide still
the ground is breaking falling into an endless fiery abyss below
not enough power to make orbit
a flame geyser hits the ship
control panels all around the ship begin to slow
the main screen is hit by a flying chunk of rock
the giant glass begins to crack
to maureen im sorry
the windshield explodes sucking them both out into space
the ship is hit by another fire geyser
the jupiter two explodes
john and will kneel on the crows nest as the jupiter two dodges the fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull
the ship is struck once again finally exploding in a roaring ball of fire
a man who has lost everything he ever loved
i couldnt save them
will stares at his father and beyond him
there in the time doorway a young will walks towards the entrance to mission control in the morning sun innocent with no knowledge of the future
so many years ago and i can still feel it
its all ive thought about
will reaches forward and touches the control console
the images in the laser generated doorway begin to change
a long time ago you told a small boy that one day hed understand how precious he was how much his father loved him
today is that day
time bubble close
instead of earth we now see this planets surface the jupiter two rising as it did just moments ago
all i could see was your need to go forward at any cost
what you never showed me was your love
i lost that
robbed by time
i could never see how much you cared
time bubble close
the jupiter two tries in vain to dodge the fire geysers then exploding all over again
will enters some commands
time bubble close
the image in the portal begins to run backwards the jupiter two reconstituting from a ball of flame receding past diminishing flame geysers beginning to land again
father take my hand
we are back in the ship just before take off
don mans the cam
maureen straps herself into the co pilots chair
i kept hoping somehow hed appear
maureen stares a beat out the window
lets go major
don hits the engine switch
the mighty generators whine into life
quiet goodbye my love
the roof of the hull is beginning to swirl becoming translucent like water
there standing above them john and older will
the bridge of the jupiter two is visible in the laser generated doorway
older will looks to his father
dont make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel
and with that he pushes john over the edge the professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below
the ceiling becomes water an john drops into the ship
maureen cradles her husband
then she looks up
will is still visible through the watery hull
come with us
but the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room explodes in the b
there was only enough power for one person one trip remember
its good to see you again mom
its good to see you alive
fading sorry about all the monkey business
maureen reaches up towards her son reaching down the two hands almost touching before will is gone the portal closed forever
he sacrificed everything for his family
fighting tears he had a good example
maureen holds him close
a small figure walks up beside them
a beat then will reaches up hands him his dog tags
im glad you came back
i just want you to know i love you son
i love you very much
john takes the boy in his arms father and son finally holding close
over more rumbling as the ground continues to give way
the planet is breaking up around us
john moves fast to the com
nice of you to drop in
john smiles a beat then hes all business
over a tremendous crash
the land masses are falling away beneath them plummeting into giant caverns of fire
west turns hauls off and punches smith knocking him out cold
boy that felt good
get us airborne
don throws the power switches to full
the landing struts retract
the power drive begins to spin
the jupiter two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself
fire geysers erupt
history in about to repeat itself
im going to try to reach escape velocity
maybe we can break the gravitational pull
we dont have the core material
the gravity wells will drag us down
we might we wont make it
weve got to go down
through the planet as she breaks up
i dont have time to argue
im giving you a direct order major
don and john stare at each other a beat
then don smiles
the world is breaking up beneath them revealing a fiery maw
don guns the engines heading straight for the chasm
the tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice
don is flying into the shattering center of the planet
masses of continents some bearing forests others oceans all soar past
the tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet
a window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond
i see it
don banks the ship toward the opening flying past exploding fragments of this shattering world
the ship clears the planet as the world explodes in the b
chapter alpha prime don guides the ship out into space
judy comes up behind him
nice work flyboy
so i earn that kiss yet
a peck on the cheek you earned that
don shrugs begins to turn away
judy grabs him
this one is on credit
she gives him a long passionate kiss
she lets him go stunned
cold fish huh
penny holds blip in her arms who has begun to blip madly
shes lost her whole family
off penny penny why are you looking at me like that
penny presses a button
blast doors open on a storage hold
i promised judy id take care of her
i couldnt leave her all alone
all stare at her well i am their princess after all
turning you can come out mow
forms in the cargo hold de camouflage
the other lizard monkeys standing amidst glittering canisters of dimondium
now if we could only find our way back to earth
if i may professor
the robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy
the jupiter two is highlighted
earth blinks at the other and
your sons star charts
its a map home
the shattered planets core is turning bright red a sudden roaring blast wave heading towards the ship
the planets gravity field in collapsing
well be sucked in
theres no way to get clear in time
everybody hang on
here we go again
don throws the switch
the planets core explodes as the jupiter two vanishes into hyperspace a sudden star and then gone
