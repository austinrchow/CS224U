written by beau michael thorne i dont believe in heaven but i have this idea about it
something i heard in a song
pristine empty frame
clean and peaceful
heaven is a place where nothing ever happens
theres gentle motion in the blank frame like swirling mm grain
a rumble starts to build low but growing louder
the grain moves faster big chunks fluttering now a dirty dishwater grey
the rumble becoming a howling wind
churning black water laps at the bottom of the frame
a blizzard at the peak of its power
visibility zero new york reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks
max payne thrashes in the water a long way from shore
theres an army of bodies under this river
criminals people who ran out of time out of friends
chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him
maxs body freezing skin turning blue
heavy winter clothes saturating like an anchor dragging him down
the next time they drag this river theyll find me on the bottom with the rest of them
and there wont be anybody left to say i was different
maxs face sinks below the surface
nothing to orient us to the location the time
just a flash of golden light filling the hall warm as the river was cold
around a closed door sunlight streams through the gaps
a woman sleeps on the bed curled up around a bundled baby
is this the final peaceful memory of a drowning man
somethings wrong then the womans body in an unnatural position more thrown than laid across the bed
the crib tipped over blankets scattered
her eyes frozen open
something black flutters against the window pane cracking into the glass
the sound of the blizzard creeps in
wind pounds the river where max had once been but theres no more thrashing in the water
mixed in behind the falling snowflakes black shapes swirl and dive closer to the water
i could feel the dead down there just below my feet
reaching up to welcome me as one of their own
max breaks the surface gasping struggling against the undertow
not simply trying to breathe
trying to swim
it was an easy mistake to make
abruptly the snow is gone
just a bitter wind left in its place whipping through desolate streets long after midnight
shuffling up the littered sidewalk three rough looking men duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway
on the dark side of the street a pair of boots follows them
a filthy platform empty except for the three men huddled on a bench
a squeaking turnstile catches their ear
the same boots grind towards the men
we dont see the walkers face distracted by something else a gleaming gold wristwatch
as if to make certain the men notice he pulls back his sleeve to check the time
quarter past three
the watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked mens
the men follow exchanging wicked grins
the men slink into the bathroom smirking at their oblivious prey at the sink
steam rising he sets the watch on the edge of the sink before washing his hands
hey thats a really nice watch
one of the men locks the door
at the sound of the lock snapping he raises his head
max payne but not yet the man struggling for life in the river clean shaven skin like bleached bone
in the murky mirror max sees the men circling closer
drooling over the watch kinda reminds me of one i lost you didnt lose it
you pawned it up on th a few hours ago
max shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them
nodding to man ask doug
he was there with you
doug frowns deeply confused about being called by his name
youve been following us all night
pointing im only following you
while doug digests that pawnshop pulls a pistol and trains it on maxs forehead
the third man not much more than a kid visibly frightened backs towards the door
you a cop or something
to doug go get my watch
distractedly eyeballing max doug brushes the watch off of the sink
it hits the dirty tile delicate crystal cracking
in a sudden blur of movement max has one hand on the pistol the other one smashing into pawnshops windpipe
doug steps forward to help
the pistol goes off as max pries it free
max looks up at doug
nowhere to run he races into the farthest stall and slams the door
in the same instant the kid bolts for the door
max has to pick follow or stay with the man hes tracking
in the stall doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky floor trying to squeeze under the divider
max raises the pistol and blasts a hole through the door of the next stall
craving eyes closed watch over me watch over me
the newly perforated door flies open
handcuffs snap restraining a whimpering doug to the toilet pipe
open your eyes now
doug finds himself staring at the pistols front sight
max reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph
its the woman from maxs golden vision in the river
have you ever seen her before
doug shakes his head violently confusion and terror rising
you got busted robbing a house in new jersey with william preston three bills dead
thats why im talking to you
moving the photo closer did he ever say anything about this woman
did you ever hear anyone bill died because their wings couldnt lift him up
no he got shot robbing a liquor store
what are you talking about
incoherent rambling their wings are golden the feathers only look black
sighing max unlocks doug from the pipe hauling him up and slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back
max stalks out of the bathroom pushing doug ahead of him
down on the tracks the kid shrinks into the shadows
the kid runs down the dark tracks nervously glancing back at the receding light of the platform
he slows gradually relaxing as escape seems certain
down to a walk he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead flapping wings a bird lost and trapped underground
the kid freezes his frightened breaths almost enough to drown the sound out
it grows though more wings joining
he turns to retreat up the tracks but the wings suddenly seem to be echoing towards him from all directions
panicked the kid becomes disoriented in the growing racket the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins
visible now in the growing light black shapes flicker above the tracks dozens becoming hundreds swelling larger their pounding wings joined by a train rumbling closer
frozen the kid can only squint into the headlights closing in petrified by the dark wings swirling around him
the front room of the cold case department is a mess desks piled high with paperwork and a weeks worth of coffee cups
halfway in the front door a young detective stands holding a box of his belongings
he looks around for signs of life
sergeant adams wanders down the hall frowning at the draft
you my new guy
i didnt think anybody was here
everybodys usually a little late
adams leads the detective down a hall giving the tour
all the cold investigations in the city are collected and delivered over to us
we call each witness to see if they can add anything to their original statement
and if they can
we send the file back to the original precinct for follow up
dont get your hopes up though
the sergeant continues towards the center of the building farther from the light of the windows
he stops at a door
once youve gone through the file and come up empty bring it here
they enter a windowless cave long rows of metal cabinets stretching on forever into the heart of the building
at a desk in the corner max slumps over a stack of files
max here handles our filing
once it hits his desk a case is officially dead
ax looks up dark circles from his long night in the subway
he nods but the detective is too busy making a note to see
what if theres no phone number for a witness
should i follow up in person
nope we dont do that down here
iscretely max slides his cut up knuckles under the desk
i dont understand then how how do you solve that unsolvable murder mystery and redeem yourself
the grand jury couldnt find stop
trust me theres a tragic story behind why im here giving you this tour
we all did something so just save it
moving for the door follow me to the break room
the detective turns to max embarrassed after his reprimand
we should get a beer after work or something
max smiles and nods but his eyes give him away as a liar yeah
the detective steals a look at max as adams shuts his door
so what did he do
naturally this reaction piques the detectives curiosity
emember when you were a kid and youd hold your breath when you went past a graveyard
the detective nods
adams glances through the window at max
try to leave him alone
max sneaks a sideways glance to the door watching adams lead the new detective away
once theyre gone max reaches into his desk and removes a file
preston william a
ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside
a lock pops
max steps inside only silence to greet him
max lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair footsteps reverberating because theres little other furniture to absorb the sound
he keeps walking
past a table with one chair past gleaming counters
max fills a glass of water from the tap
eyes blank patient
carefully max rests the full glass on the arm of the chair
reaching underneath the chair max produces an artists sketchbook and places it delicately on the table before him
sith trembling hands max turns back the battered cover
uddenly colors burst into the monochrome room bright swirls of oil pastels sketch out a still life in technicolor
gradually maxs eyes lose their hardness
his breaths come faster ragged
jaw clenched he turns the page
more flowing brush strokes the artists feminine initials
max reaches up to turn the page hands shaking severely
he takes hold of the corner of the page but his muscles wont cooperate as if the page ways more than max can lift
maxs skin flushes red
tears almost welling
and then at once max slams the book shut and turns away
the door swings open
hanging inside the battered coat we saw max wear in the subway
a pistol on a hook by the door
urban armor scarred by countless nights of service
max dresses himself for battle eyes returning to stone
max climbs out of the subway into a neighborhood with a foot in two worlds the buildings are old and crumbling but the shops inside are sleek and expensive
a jarring combination
ax walks up the street brushing past homeless people and fashionistas jostling for the same space on the sidewalk
the hallway is ancient brick but the doors are pristine steel
pausing at one with a dozen locks max knocks
the door cracks
an eye appears
you cant come here anymore
william preston was a dead end
the door cracks enough to reveal the speaker trevor skinny fat in an sharp suit and sunglasses shirt open a little far
you cant come here i said
im done helping you
lowering his voice paid my debt to society you know
ive cooperated enough
we need to talk
wont take long
max follows trevor inside
the narrow brick entry opens into a cutting edge loft beyond filled with modern art and a gathering of beautiful people milling around enjoying it
i thought you found bills partner
i did but doug only wanted to talk about pigeons or something
i need a new name someone robbing houses to feed a habit around that same time
three years is a lifetime for guys like that
one way or the other theyre probably all gone now
a little self satisfied either way im not the one to ask anymore
i cater to a better class now
one of the guests catches maxs eye natasha young and beautiful returns his gaze for an extra moment and smiles
i can see that
this is a party
these are my friends
you remember friends
i need another name or i start frisking your friends
trevor stands his ground not flinching at maxs threat
dont have one to give you max
look youve gone through all your living leads now youre running out of dead ones
beat i dont think this guys out there
max nods fatigue fighting the determination in his eyes
ry sleeping at night every now and then youd see that for yourself
max doesnt answer
his eyes have drifted back to natasha
she plucks a drink from a passing tray revealing a dark smudge across the inside of her wrist as she does
id invite you in but
suddenly intent max pushes past trevor and into the loft
max weaves through the party towards natasha out of place in his utilitarian clothes
she looks up as he gets closer
ou decided to stay for a while
she speaks with a russian accent smiling a little nervous
rather than answering maxs eyes drop to her wrist
ow its your turn to say something
ax takes her hand gently turning it to reveal her tattoo a black wing stylized feathers tracing faint blue veins
glancing past max shit
max follows her gaze to the front door where trevor is nervously greeting another new arrival mona sax
shes striking beautiful but also a little frightening
it doesnt hurt that shes flanked by bodyguards
seeing natasha standing with max mona barrels across the room towards them
people stand aside to let her pass
ithout preamble mona begins yelling at natasha in russian
natasha responds in kind clearly intimidated by mona
abruptly mona grabs natashas arm jerking her off balance
why dont you let go
in perfect english mind your business
mona returns to natasha dragging her towards the door
natashas tone becomes pleading physically no match for mona
max steps in reaching up to touch monas shoulder
t happens in a flash mona spins and takes hold of maxs arm
incredibly hes just as fast slipping free of the grip that would surely have snapped his wrist
for a moment max and mona stare each other down
surprised reevaluating each other
natasha continues to talk her russian anxious as monas bodyguards push through the crowd
monas eyes drop to maxs chest where the tussle pulled his coat open to reveal a low pro holster and tarnished badge
with the flick of her wrist mona stops her guards advance
the crowd begins to notice the altercation
natasha keeps talking trying desperately to make peace and reassure mona of something
monas eyes cut between natasha and max
till apprehensive mona shakes her head and walks away
beat sort of a bitch
as max nods at the understatement trevor rushes over forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests
he pulls maxs coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door
you have to go
pulling free fine
i just want to ask her something first
max turns to the spot where natasha had been
the party has grown more crowded
max fights his way down a dark hall searching the shadowed faces he passes
back here the music is nothing but growling bass
a flickering glow escapes the gaps around one door
a ring of candles in the center of the floor provides the only light
its not enough to really see the people inside
we hear them chanting low voices murmuring in unison
quick glimpses in the candle light bare flesh writhing
cast on the walls corresponding shadows twist and shift
a black feather billows across the floor between candles
spreading up the wall a new shadow rises above the rest
pair of wings long and distorted in the candle light
max appears in the doorway as the shadows loose their shape max only catching a glimpse not sure what hes seeing
as max strains to see detail in the dark room a face materializes in the haze cheeks laced with tattoos eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow
uddenly max turns and sees natasha standing beside him
we immediately notice something different about her staring boldly into maxs eyes all her earlier shyness vanished
looking for me
natasha glances through the door at the shifting shadows smiling at what she sees
max follows her eyes
were you in there
shrugging coy take me somewhere ill tell you
max leads natasha inside
before he can even shut the door natasha pounces kissing hands running over his body
as he pushes back natashas hands slip into maxs pockets
abruptly natasha breaks away and looks around the apartment
you just move in
not really interested natasha walks deeper into the room
hree years ago
so were somewhere now who was that guy in response natasha unbuckles her pants and lets them drop
still walking opening her shirt on her way out of the room
max moves down the hallway following a trail of clothing
from inside a room we hear the faint sound of chanting
in maxs bed a thin sheet barely covers natashas body
her lips tremble with a slurred song
with predatory eyes she watches max stop in the doorway something holding him back
frustrated sigh fine
what was her name
the girl from the boring story you want tell me
the one that ends with you living here
caught off guard max tries to figure out how much hell say
natasha resumes chanting as she waits a stream of frantic syllables rattling off nothing recognizable as words
tell you what
beat evil smile call me by her name
natasha grins legs spreading sheet starting to fall away
that way you can make love to her again just like she never left you
shrill mocking voice oh max i miss you
like a switch maxs face closes off again
you should go
exhausted to himself theres nothing you can tell me
natasha explodes out of the bed springing up naked in front of max shoulders heaving with rage eyes wild black holes
oure kicking me out of your bed
for a moment it seems like natasha is about to attack
not physically intimidated max stares at her in disbelief
natasha stomps into the hall gathering her clothes
she pulls a cell phone from her crumpled pants and dials
on phone owen pick up if youre awake
max watches her disappear down the hall front door slamming a moment later
he looks around silence returning again
natasha walks down a dark desolate block the sound of her heels echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her
her eyes are still wild her stride quick and aggressive
a group of men huddle in a stairway to avoid the wind
as natasha passes they look up at her with equally wild eyes
atasha steps off the sidewalk and into an alley plunging into the darkness like shes been there many times before
in the distance faint music rumbles through the street
moment later the few working lamps on the street dim
natasha barrels down the alley squinting to see ahead
the music is a little louder bass shaking the dumpsters
wind picks up garbage blowing
suddenly unsettled by something natashas pace slows
she tenses all her swagger vanishing before our eyes
can rattles in the alley behind her
nothing just the flickering of moths swarming the alleys only light their shadows black shapes against the bricks
the sound of much larger beating wings fills the alley
eyes wide with terror natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths dread deepening as she finds it eal winged shapes mix with the shadows flapping wildly
natasha cries out stumbling back
she turns running
please just let me
natashas screams seem lost in the chaos of wind and wings and distant music
she suddenly stops running
more shadows assemble ahead of her their black wings open
max hurriedly dresses wearing the same suit from yesterday
he picks up his keys searching around for something else feeling the pockets of his jacket down in the cushions
max moves up the sidewalk nearly at the steps of his office
a rough running engine idles up the street getting closer
slowly max realizes that hes being followed
lex hillman sits behind the wheel about maxs age but in much rougher condition everything about him a little ashen
he watches max turn away from the office and move closer
max returns alexs stare
we dont know if theyre about to smile or open fire
they dont seem to know either
alex slides over and throws the passenger side door open
alex and max ride in silence a palpable tension in the car
lex pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shakes one out
he holds the pack out to max who shakes his head
alex nods smiling using his lighter and then laying it with the pack within maxs reach
max doesnt even glance down
after a silent moment alex looks over at max and frowns
youre not serious are you
shaking his head in disbelief alex pulls to the curb
heyve parked at a crime scene the alley in front of them sealed with police tape cops posted to keep onlookers away
alex pulls a flask from under his seat taking a quick pull
i need you to look at something
alex approaches the alley pulling on a leather jacket and snapping a badge onto his belt
the cops let him pass
max follows alex slowing as he crosses the police tape
by the crowd of csi techs what started here didnt end well
theres blood everywhere a dozen white sheets on the ground
what happened to them
confused max studies the sheets
on second look they arent covering anything quite big enough to be a whole body
omebody found her leg near the sidewalk called it in a few hours later
we found the other one in the dumpster over there
i dont believe it
max and alex turn to see that theyve attracted spectators the other detectives d the alley watching them intently
in dont tell me you two are gonna start working together again
id ignoring what do we know
only that it didnt happen here
beyond that i dont even know how to describe it in my report
disassembled thats the word we came up with
the detective grins proud of his wit
alex and max move on without comment
max looks at the sheets shaking his head
why are you showing me this
alex pulls out a plastic evidence bag holding it out
we found it here by her heart
inside the clear bag maxs id picture is smeared with blood
as far as we know the victim quiet natasha
ax kneels down over a tarp
the edge is pulled back revealing a pale forearm with a delicate tattoo of a wing
remembering they couldnt lift him up
what did you just say
max looks up at alex who is suddenly quite agitated
he glances back at the other detectives theyre staring at alex and max whispering something amongst themselves
we need to talk max
writing something heres my address
for gods sake i know where you somber no i moved out
alex hands over the address and hurries away leaving max standing in the alley surrounded by natashas remains
max steps out of his car moving up the sidewalk to a surprisingly nice apartment building uniformed doorman the works
double checking the address max steps inside
near the end of the hall max stops at an apartment door
the wood is splintered pieces of the frame hanging loose
max checks the hall in both directions drawing his pistol
careful not to make a sound max steps into a living room so messy that its hard to say for sure if its been ransacked
max flips a switch by the door but no lights come on
are you in here
max pauses so his eyes can adjust to the traces of streetlight sneaking through the blinds
he moves deeper
pistol ready max moves into the kitchen
dirty dishes flies swarming around the necks of countless liquor bottles
nseen behind maxs back the front door pushes closed
max creeps down a hallway
his shoes crunch in something
a broken mirror scattered in the hallway the pieces growing more concentrated towards the dark end of the hall
max reaches an open doorway
cautiously he sweeps inside
in the hallway behind max something moves in the shadows
ax moves deeper into the darkness gleaming shards of mirror grinding underfoot
something lies in the floor ahead
body legs stretched across the hall upper torso not visible inside a room
a badge on the belt a service revolver limp in its fingers tattered leather jacket
at the moment that registers a noise in the hallway behind him sends max ducking for cover in the doorway beside him
max crouches gun raised staring at alexs motionless body
footsteps grow closer
max uses the fragments of mirror scattered around alexs legs each giving a tiny view of the hallway
one piece shows a figure moving closer shrouded in darkness
nother reflection shows a set of eyes
its alex staring at max seeming to silently beg for help
max looks from the reflection to the legs
theres no way
theres no way alexs head is still attached to his body
thunderstruck max looses track of the shadows moving closer to his hiding spot unable to pull his eyes away from alex
the figure lunges out of the shadows slamming into max
the dark shapes slashing blows glint in the moonlight cold metal slicing the air faster than max can fend off
max drags himself up the hall hands slicing on the shards
the air echoes with angry voices laughter and screams
blood drips down the walls shadows teem with movement
the flapping grows louder gusting wind scattering glass
max shouts disoriented instinctively pushing himself on
alexs eyes frozen wide watch as max crawls closer
shadows in the air above max roil with movement
demonic howls rattle the windows
max reaches out to alex
above them black wings pound
maxs eyes pop open
he lies in a hospital bed surrounded by flashing machinery
beyond the soft whir of equipment fans the room is silent
doctors old man was a patrolman in the th
i got him to get you a private room
in a chair by the bed bb hensley s watches max wake up
bbs face is weathered and hard but his smile is kind
our contact information was
pretty out of date you know but one of the dispatchers remembered me and your dad riding together back in the day
max nods groggily struggling to find his bearings
suddenly something breaks through
bb nods shivering at the mental image his name produces
he first unit to respond mustve scared them away before they could do the same thing to you
pretty remarkable considering your luck
he was trying to tell me something
was he alive when you showed up
did you get a look at the guys who
i get bflashes but its
i hate to say it but you need to come up with something better than that
theyve got nothing for leads so the whole force has you pegged as the prime suspect
you tell them where to find me
the funeral starts in an hour
max pops up tangling the iv tubes running into his hand
ust slow down
you need to max wraps the clear tube around his hand and snaps it free
what i need is to borrow some dress blues
can you help me out
my office is on the way
as max takes an unsteady step onto the cold tile floor a concerned bb throws his overcoat across maxs shoulders
bb and max ride in silence radio overpowered by the blasting heater
max closes the overcoat over his hospital gown
with a major system moving down from canada tonight transportation authorities are bracing for a blizzard
bb pulls against the curb on a block unfamiliar to max
a massive stone structure squat like a military fortress and black under the storm clouds
there have been updates over the years but nothing could to hide the age of the building
bb starts across the sidewalk to the entrance
max follows giving a confused frown at the building theyre approaching
you quit working for aesir
bb leads max through a wrought iron gate into a small courtyard leads back to the thick wood doors of the entrance
i didnt quit they made me head of security for the whole parent company
that comes with its own building such that it is
beat check this out
a proud parent bb points at a deep pit in the stone wall
impatient its a bullet hole
yeah from a musket ball
the british used this place as a military prison during the revolutionary war
think about that
its older than st
ax looks up at the crumbling gargoyles perched above
the double doors fly open onto a massive office dark wood panelling a wall of windows glowing white from the snow
max goes to the windows
spreading out bellow him the wide black expanse of the east river rolls past
bridges arc up into the storm clouds and disappear before they hit brooklyn
hen the weather isnt so shitty the view is unbelievable
going to the closet im not making any guarantees that any of this will fit
while bb roots around inside max absently scans his desk
a slick company newsletter aesir pharmaceuticals
on the cover nicole horne s dignified not quite smiling
a holiday message from the ceo printed below her face
i saved one of those for you
off maxs confusion third page from the back
max flips the pages smiling scientists sparkling labs
ichelle payne bright smile illuminating a bland corporate portrait
the same face in the photo max showed the junkie
heyre going to set up some kind of scholarship in her name
taken by surprise max doesnt seem to hear bbs explanation
hey kept coming to me for suggestions over what she might want
i guess since we go back so far maybe they think im family
nobody knew how to find you
beat i said art
she liked art right
max nods turning his eyes away from the photograph
ts a nice thing a scholarship
good way to remember somebody
ax eagerly takes the old uniform from bb happy to have something else to focus on
bb studies his body language
you still havent been out there have you
max doesnt answer slipping into a wrinkled dress shirt
cars line the drive leading into the cemetery
people leave their warmth and hurry through the iron gates these mourners especially determined a community out to honor a fallen brother
bb and max follow them onto the
maxs eyes are on the cemetery
bb follows his gaze
two marble angels on the hill
one smaller than the other
gently pushing its a nice spot
ill go up there with you after if you want
max shakes his head
up ahead a young mother tends to two little girls dressed in black escorted through the cemetery gate by the honor guard
christa hillman alexs widow
face blank still in shock
suddenly anxious go ahead up and say something to christa
ill find us some seats
ax threads his way through the mass of uniformed cops waiting to enter the cemetery
one by one they notice max jaws clenching
max doesnt realize the gauntlet hes in distracted by a glance of bb slinking into the graves
where nicole horne watches the funeral from among the headstones almost overdressed in head to toe black
close at hand jason colvin holds nicoles umbrella
b approaches nicole body language weak and deferential
max glances back at the path and finds himself facing a wall of angry cops
he keeps walking no sign of backing down
let him through
even with the cops making way the walk to christa is hard the heartbreak and grief on her face slowing maxs gait
christa im really sorry about what dont talk to me like some stranger
christas eyes bore into max with all the weight of a long and deep friendship momentarily shaming him into silence
who did this to him max
we dont have a lot yet
christa steps towards max teeth gritted with powerless rage
seething when everything happened to you alex completely fell apart
he ruined his life he cared that much
so what are you going to do for him now
ax could melt under those eyes but christa turns her back and continues up the path to alexs waiting coffin
shamed max turns away and starts back down the path alone
everyone turns to see jim bravura s leaning on the fence
i need you to come with me
hough theyd been moments from brawling theres a common reaction from the other cops nobody likes this guy
max looks around humiliated
the honor guard stands in formation by the flag draped casket
the priest waits his bible ripping in the wind
christa twists around in her chair looking down at the cemetery gate
she sees the crowd max being escorted away
sad to the priest okay
above them all nicole horne stands like a shadow between the graves too far away to hear the words of the priest
a cramped office packed with boxes a civil servants tomb
wedged behind the desk bravura sorts through his notes
max and bb sit across the desk left on ice while bravura reads
bravura slides a folder over to max photographs of the alley natashas covered body
bravura watches his reaction
owd the girl have your wallet
she stole it
picked your pocket
so you didnt know she was a prostitute
the slightest uncomfortable look passes between max and bb
no i didnt
we met through a friend
hes your friend
you know what trevor does for a living i assume
he used to snitch for me
ell me max whats a glorified file clerk still need a snitch for
max stays stone faced burying any emotion bravura could use
so youd piss in a cup for us right
standing i think you just said the magic words
call once you hear from the union lawyer
bravura replaces natashas pictures with a stack of shots taken in alexs apartment
despite himself max freezes
ou and detective hillman havent worked together since your reassignment
what made you get back in touch
max is distracted by the photographs enormous blood stains in stark flash bulb light no longer hidden by the shadows
he wanted me to help him with something
making a note and
max looks up from the picture realizing hes been baited into saying more than hed meant to
he starts for the door
thats what im going to do
ravura gives max a hard look
mad but genuinely searching
ook at this from my perspective ive got two bodies in ten body bags
you were the last person to see either one
pointing to the photos and some of that blood is mine
good luck with your case
as max storms out bb calmly stands and pulls on his jacket
nice work detective
as bb turns to leave bravura stands from behind his desk
youve been around long enough to know im his only way out
bb looks back and sees the business card bravuras holding out
after a conflicted moment bb slips it into his pocket
still fuming from the encounter with bravura max watches the numbers over the door fall
bb stands beside him anxious
a car load of people surround them pressed tightly together
well i hope that felt good
max doesnt respond eyes drifting to the directory mounted above the buttons
nd floor traffic violations th it makes you look guilty
you understand that right
now its not just alexs unit that thinks youre the guy
maxs eyes find th floor homicide division
the doors open with a chime and the crowd presses forward
bb steps out with the other passengers still talking to max
you need friends on the force right now
theres only so much i can do outside
bb turns to see if his words are doing anything to reach max
however max is still standing in the elevator the only one left on the car
he presses the button for the tenth floor
where are you going
the doors lurch shut
max steps into the room
t once youre struck by how this is the opposite of the cold case department desks cluttered by labor instead of neglect detectives engaged in their telephone conversations
eyes start to find him
ax marches forward ignoring the spreading wave of shock
max stops at a door marked alex hillman
ax jiggles the door knob
max doesnt look up
he keeps shaking the handle desperate
detective contd hey asshole that doors locked for a reason
one by one the detectives climb to their feet expressions showing outrage and anger
they close in on max
god damn it that means you need a ax gives the knob a final twist and the door swings open
to himself there wasnt ever a key
max steps inside
enraged the detectives start to follow
ut the door slams again in their faces
the doorknob rattles no method this time
shouts and bangs ring through the door
ignoring it max surveys the room
the office is bare no decorations or personal touches
max walks deeper into the room opening a filing cabinet
trying to remain calm while the door shakes violently max turns his attention to the desk
one drawer empty
max tries another drawer and finds this one locked
ax drives his boot into the drawer again and again
what are you doing in there
teeth gritted against the pain max delivers a final kick
the drawer front shatters and collapses
max reaches inside
iles not criminal jackets like the ones in cold case
more official somehow
max flips through one at random
green owen a
not a mug shot but a military id photo
out in the hall the crowd of detectives seems to grow larger the pounding on the door becoming more severe
he slamming sounds outside push max deeper into the desk frantically spilling the contents onto the floor
maxs eyes go wide
another photograph of michelle
shaking maxs hands dig deeper
an impact sends cracks splitting up the length of the door
two detectives throw their shoulders into the door
the rest crowd around them foaming at the mouth to get inside to max
one more lunge
the door shatters sending the detectives tumbling inside
photos and documents are scattered across the floor over alexs desk mixed in with the fragments of the broken desk
from an open window the storms first flurries drift inside
max is gone
the snowfall has picked up flurries giving way to thick heavy flakes already sticking to the sidewalk
max leans into the stinging wind lost in the nights revelations
hax slows abruptly looking back at the street behind him
eavy shadows pool around the alleys doorways and swelling cars
the streetlights seem to carry less in the snow
a figure walks down the opposite sidewalk
with heavy snow filling the space between them its hard to make out much
but theres something flowing out from the figures back
max turns back to the sidewalk ahead jaw clenching
abruptly maxs ducks into the mouth of alley
back pressed to the cold brick he draws his pistol and chambers a round
unseen by max something moves in the shadows behind him
he street lamps begin to sputter
in the strobing light long black shadows billow from the figures shoulders
max backs away from the corner deeper into the dark alley where three shapes are surging forward to meet him
max dodges but his pistols knocked to the pavement
max stumbles bringing up his guard
the man charges again
max sidesteps grabbing an arm as he does snapping the bone
ut on the street the mans screams mix with the howling wind
the figure steps into the street towards the alley
max is jumped from all sides opponents finally coordinating to overwhelm him
the figure steps out of the wind
and what seemed to be wings turns out to be a long coat
mona sax moves closer opening that coat to reveal a thick metal chain
max growls as arms pull him upright
lose your dog
mona whips the chain into maxs face clanking as it strikes bone
instantly blood begins streaming from his mouth
we need to talk about my sister
the chain cracks again maxs teeth rattling from the blow
hoever killed your sister did the same thing to my partner louder it was the same person
mona hits max again this time in the shins
max cries out
slurred so stupid
slowly at first mona whirls the chain into a larger loop
you left your wallet lying beside her body
ax slumps to the side spitting out a stream of blood
does that sound like something a homicide cop would get wrong
mona whips the chain faster cutting the air
gasping at the pain max slowly straightens up again
you know somebody named owen
mona lets the chains speed gradually slow again
natasha called him on her way out of my apartment
give me one day to mona drops the chain with a clank
she motions for her men to haul max to his feet
mona and max storm down a dim apartment hallway in tense silence
max wipes the blood from the cuts on his face
who is this guy
mona lets her coat fall open revealing a machine gun
somebody my sister used to hang around with
chambering a round you better hope he backs your story up
i have things i need to ask him myself
mona flashes max a look before pounding on a door
calling through the door owen open up
a louder longer knock
open a muted scream filters through the door cutting her short
max drives his boot into the door splintering the jam
max and mona rush into the room breath smoking from the cold
all of the windows are open
gusts of snow blow inside drifts of white powder extending into the room
calling out owen
he screams his response from the next room
through the door weapons drawn
both stop short owen green is all alone in the room
screaming swatting at empty air around him each limb moving a different direction
ax lowers his pistol ready for anything not for this
owens feet slip over the snow toes curling desperately on the ice searching for traction as they slide closer
breathless to no one help me
to an open window on the other side of the room
he doesnt seem to hear sweat streams down his terrified face snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest
owens eyes are instead drawn through the open windows
where silhouettes flicker against the storm darkened sky
oblivious to the shapes outside max and mona watch owens terror intensify his dervish dance growing more frantic
outside every window black shapes float closer in the air above the street vaguely human long wings pounding
sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows kicking up snow and ice
max and mona shrink back shielding their eyes at the blast as owens tortured screams fill the room
twisting like hes trying to pull free from invisible hands owen reaches the window
as if trying to push back his hands and feet fly up to the trim around the window
unable to turn around owens eyes find the reflected images of max and mona in the window hes being pulled to
is attention is torn from their reflections on top of the glass by the spectres looming beyond it outside
their claws reach in raking his body pulling him closer
realizing that owen isnt stopping max rushes towards him
screaming make them stop tell them i cant fly
max lunges forward trying in vain to cover yards
when owen only has inches
hes ripped into the void
max throws himself forward into the window looking down
where owen falls looking up at max helplessly
then less terrified as the wind keeps rushing past
and then just before impact relieved
owen crashes into the sidewalk
mona races up to join max in the window
for a stunned beat they look down at the shattered body of owen green his unblinking eyes frozen on the heavens collecting snowflakes
shaken what did we just see
no answer max studies owens twisted body
long finger like bruises trace out from his neck blending with the tattoos that lace his grey skin
grinning skulls the usmc eagle globe anchor
and a pair of wings just like natashas
max drops a polaroid of owens tattoo onto a glass counter
lue water ripples through translucent pipes in the walls and floor the air of the small room glowing like the ocean
a mirrored ceiling repeats the tattoo parlor again above
youre sure this is the place
natasha had all her work done here
an elderly tattoo artist moves up behind the counter
something i can help you with
max slides the photograph across to the tattoo artist
what if i wanted this tattoo
then youre probably in the marine corps
pointing to the wings this one
the artist stoops closer tensing when he sees the design
mona leans over the counter locking onto the artists eyes
what is it
as encouragement mona lets her coat open to reveal her gun
intimidated its a norse superstition
the vikings used to wear them for protection
trust me my sister had all the guardian angels she needed
he artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books his reference library
he searches through dusty volumes
just past the shelves a doorway is cracked open
a young apprentice artist hovers in the dark and listens in on the conversation unnoticed sweating his pupils drawing back
returning with a book the artist finds the page a winged woman led by a pack of wolves over a grizzly battlefield
in norse mythology the only way you get to go to heaven is to die in violence
die in your sleep you go to hell
valkyries fly over the battlefields picking out the righteous dead
they reward the people who draw first blood
beat a soldiers angel
nodding mona lets her gun drift away from the artist
im generally thrilled to have referral business but i tell people looking for those wings to find ink closer to home
some club down in alphabet city
mona turns to leave satisfied but max is stuck on the book the valkyries empty eyes bloody bodies at her feet
protection from what
suddenly all the lights go out
he pipes stop glowing blackness replacing the blue lights
out of the corner of his eye max sees a darker shadow race across the room towards them almost too fast to be human
max and mona have time to duck the artist isnt so lucky
a crack of bone the old mans skull taking the brutal force
monas weapon barks a short burst ripping through the air
n the momentary fire max can see the shape swinging a club
the bat cuts through the air smashing open glass pipes in the wall behind max the shards raining down over him
the figure charges at max again
maxs pistol cracks
the room is abruptly silent
the lights flash on
mona steps out of the back room
max is stunned to find himself standing over nothing more monstrous than the apprentice one hand over the hole in his chest the other weakly swinging a shard of glass
gurgling to max they see you
they see you
do you know this guy
max shakes his head struck mute by the look in the dying mans eyes
max pushes the car over slick streets clothes covered in the artists blood
lost in thought mona looks out the window
without conviction maybe it isnt anything new
people get strung out act crazy
you think they were both on something
crystal meth maybe some amphetamine that raises your body temperature in an overdose
explains why they were both sweating like that trying to cool off
beat of course a junky wont usually jump out the window if theres someone left in the room to beg or rob
ax nods his agreement replaying owens death in his mind
you were standing right beside me
jumped is not the word id use
in a block of abandoned storefronts only one retains a spark of life its red sign burning in the dying light ragna rok
he streets are more crowded there people shuffling towards that sign and the sounds of dark music filtering from inside
maxs car turns onto the block slowly approaching ragna rok
max and mona silently absorb the scene on the street
even from halfway down the block bass from the club reaches them
they all look
across the street max watches someone dragging a limp body by one leg
nobody he walks past seems to notice
max keeps his speed slow idling away up the block
this isnt anything ive seen before
ragna rok recedes in the mirror the block between it and the car studded with more smoldering cars and dead eye faces their numbers seeming to grow even as mona
you ever been to rome
max doesnt answer the coming plague before him registering
mona glances up at a passing street sign little italy
better cities than this one have fallen
pointing to the curb this is far enough
mona opens her car door and climbs out leaning back inside
sorry about the chain
mona slams the door and moves off down the sidewalk blending into the crowd
max drops the car into gear giving one last glance to ragna rok before pulling away
heres some flicker of movement on the rooftop
p on the roof music inside the club rattles old pipes
perched at the edge of the roof a figure chants along
jack lupino the tattooed face we caught a glimpse of in the candle light of trevors party now fully visible in the failing sun and no less frightening
his colorless eyes absorb the street the screams maxs car pulling away
on his back the tattoos of two elaborate black wings
steam rises from ink blackened skin snow melting before it lands
max sits in his chair in the silent room turning the pages of michelles book
theres more than grief on his cut and bruised face tonight hands not trembling the way they were
fruit bowls delicate charcoal nudes flip past
frustrated max lets the images drift by with less sentiment images no longer speaking to the questions he needs answered
with an exasperated sigh max slams the book closed
a faint white sliver appears in the cover
max leans closer
its the corner of a piece of paper protruding from a razor thin cut in the spine of the sketchbook invisible under all but the closest inspection
max runs his thumbnail into the gap spreading glue crackling he flinches almost afraid to cause the book pain
or a moment max is caught between his desire to protect the memento and to see whats hidden inside
a deep breath
with a sharp pull the cover of the book shears away
the pages wad and wrinkle old paint flaking off
the cover hed caressed rips
fluttering to the floor a sheaf of yellowed pages hidden in the cover flutter to the floor
max opens the folded pages
the first is nearly identical to what we saw inside a bouquet of flowers unfinished
max scrutinizes the pencil strokes
suddenly his eyes go wide a little pair of bat like wings
in the corner of the page having nothing to do with the rest of the still life
max turns to the next page
theres a another drawing of wings larger this time pencil strokes more energetic
horrified by what hes seeing maxs hands tremble as they turn the page
on the next the wings are the main drawing
on the next theyre scrawled in smeared ink
nauseous to himself no
the wings begin to lose their shape overlapping
the last page is completely black
even with everybody out of uniform the builds and body language mark this as a cop bar
bb rushes inside hair giving him away as having been asleep shortly before
he bar is still decorated with plastic mistletoe and fake snow
bb looks at the bartender who motions to the back
bb fights his way to a corner booth where max is slumped over a beer and a shot
a matching set wait for bb across the table
bb pulls off his coat and sits forced casual
it was sitting at this very table that your father told me i needed to retire
beat for about a minute i just sat here thinking about knocking him out of his chair
the job was everything to me to the point that i couldnt see the writing on the wall what it was doing to my marriage my health
your old man knew if i was going to listen to reason it b could only happen in here
b stoops down to find maxs eyes trying for a connection
theres nothing you cant say in here
its like hallowed ground
for a long beat max works up the nerve to speak
i watched a guy throw himself out of a window tonight
the things he was saying any guy who throws himself out a window i wouldnt pay any attention to the things he said
the problem is i knew what he was talking about
bb tries to nod his understanding but concern creeps in
i havent been really afraid of anything since
and you are now
theres something going on and i cant find a rational explanation for it
something out there hurting people okay calm down
im not crazy
then stop acting like it
max youre breaking into offices i
is all over you you wont even show up for work
the night alex died there was something else in the room with us
i saw it
b goes a bit pale smile fading as maxs words continue
its really important that you be careful how you talk to people about this okay
youre already under suspicion its the same thing these people are seeing right before they die
beat pained i think michelle saw it too
for gods sake dont drag her into this
ax stands up storming towards the exit
bb pulls out a thick money clip and overpays before following
bb rushes out struggling to keep up with maxs longer legs
whats really going on here
alex found something out about what happened to her
theres no way
he would have told us
he was trying right before he died
why dont you come back with me let beth make up the guest room for you
just for tonight
max nods but keeps moving away from bb
you need to take some time
get some sleep heal up
see if it still feels real after that
max crosses against the light cutting through the driving snow
bb tries to follow but traffic pushes him back
elpless bb can only bury his hands in his pockets and watch max fade away
after a moment he pulls something out
a business card j
in a ticket booth an elderly attendant shivers by a space heater ticket windows plugged with make shift insulation
the attendant looks up from his book and sees max approaching through the snow
max slows as he gets closer looking up at the glowing threshold to the trains beyond
via intercom you riding
max holds for a moment
for all the danger hes faced this is the most hesitation weve seen from him so far
via intercom if youre coming you better come on
way its looking might be the last train tonight
max takes a step into the light of the ticket booth
the attendant opens the ticket slot letting a gust of freezing air blow inside
max slides a few bills through
ticket in hand max starts his solitary march to the trains
dingy dark bar on the first floor of an even sleazier hotel
its nearly empty only the dedicated drunks venturing out in the storm
the front door swings open
the old men shiver at the stiff blast of wind rushing in turning to look
snowflakes blow inside
from a booth in the corner vinnie gognitti s pudgy shoots a hard look at the open door not immediately recognizing the silhouette in the passage
in or out asshole
mona steps inside boots heavy with ice
her men follow
flanked by men of his own vinnie freezes when he sees mona
we need to talk
gradually vinnie and his men relax
shut the door then
you ruskies may be used to it but im freezing my dick off over here
theyve packed into a tiny back office russian gunmen on one side of the desk italians on the other
mona and vinnie represent their different sides the only people seated
something was taken from me
it involves a club in italian territory so i need your blessing to go make it right
youre asking my permission
smirking to his men well in that case sweetheart
mona looks vinnie over bored to death by the whole thing
i said blessing
well blessing might cost extra
which club are we talking about
innie tries to keep a poker face but the name chills him
over on avenue yeah i know
beat rattled sure fine
you have my permission
mona frowns her wishes granted a little too easily
you do still control that block right
its south of the guys name is jack lupino
well that sounds italian to me
hes no kind of italian ive ever seen
tattooed freak a real sicko from what we hear
sneering youre afraid of tattoos now
when the club first opened i sent somebody down to collect the
you know fire insurance
a day goes by and i dont see him
then i get two boxes delivered to me
one boxs got my guys hands and ears in it
the other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash
this neighborhood has been your familys forever
two fifty large is all it takes to what got my attention mona was that the boxes were delivered by a cop car
a guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight
beat im not scared of tattoos or freaks or mouthy russian bitches
but whoevers watching over lupino whoever it is you really need to bless you walking inside ragna rok
him i am scared of
the platform is cleaner than the ones in the city dressed up for the tastes of the commuters who step off of the train
max threads his way through the handful of exhausted businessmen arriving home moving out into the darkness
the snows driving just as hard out here but peaceful houses with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting
in the yards forgotten sleds disappear under new powder gone for good by morning
snowmen distort as they swell
max payne trudges up the center of the street a black streak spoiling the peace of the evening
one house on the block stands out theres no neatly shoveled driveway no colorful christmas lights flashing from the eaves
a black void behind every window no life inside
ax stands in the street looking up at the house
she was thirty five
the daughter two months
from what we could tell it started out as a robbery
a row of footprints lead around back
oth of the men had records mostly bullshit possession petty theft
hanging in the overgrown hedges an overlooked scrap of yellow police tape shimmers in the wind
ut that day
i dont know
they had something else on their minds
max stands at the back door
he touches the unpainted wood around the glass repairs never fully complete
ax was maybe ten minutes late
max reaches for the handle
hesitant to actually touch
a living room in the stillness of evening golden air packed like amber around baby bottles and toys on the coffee table
the front door opens and a man steps inside
max payne different in every way the malnourishment and neglect gone from his face a fullness in his frame from regular home cooked meals
shave and a haircut
ax picks up the mail from the floor and strolls inside
tie loosened max gets a beer from the fridge
unwinding he takes a long sip and begins sorting through the mail
lancing up from the mail max sees the kitchen door
max charges upstairs
mens voices echo down from above
calling out michelle
his eyes arent hard yet
rushing up the stairs we see maxs faith in the world start to crack for the first time
max turns the corner into a hallway bathed in golden afternoon light the same one he saw in the river
between max and the end of the hall two junkies are huddled against a door
twisting the handle smacking the wood
max pulls a pistol from a low pro holster stepping forward
calling out michelle
the junkies turn to max eyes black and glassy
shouting to the door michelle im right here
without a word the junkies charge
max takes aim and blasts one of them in the forehead
the other keeps rushing swinging a long knife at maxs neck
ax ducks a quarter second and a quarter inch from a slit throat
the swing throws the thin man off balance
he tries again ropy muscles straining skin speckled with tracks
max grabs his arm throwing the thin man off balance
they go down to the hardwood floor together
too close to line up a shot max drives the butt of the pistol into the mans nose splitting it across the bridge
blood spatters his gaunt face but those eyes never change
theyre angels now
straining he moves the knifes tip closer to maxs belly
max jams the barrel under the junkies leering jaw and pulls the trigger
blood atomizes into a hanging cloud around him
max jumps up and races to the door
locked from the inside
calling frantic michelle
max throws his shoulder into the door snapping the hinges
the momentum sends max tumbling inside
a man slips out of the window one leg still inside
ax opens fire at the retreating shape
curtains billow in front of the open window a summer sunset outside
max lets the gun fall to his side breathing hard
ichelle huddles on the bed baby wrapped tight in her arms
max rushes over to her reaching out to touch her shoulder
her mouth is wide open eyes unfocused
michelles not stunned
shes not unconscious
he baby isnt just sleeping
the moment that hits him the lights go out of maxs eyes
max stands at the door seeing the room with those same eyes
the furniture is gone all the carpet ripped out
one window is still open no frilly curtains blocking the blackness outside
snow gusts in piling on the sill
we looked everywhere for the third guy but there was nothing to go on
not a hair of him left behind
slowly marching across the room max slams the window shut
bb stands in the window watching the storm
i called in a favor before i retired had him transferred to cold case while he dealt with the shock of it
i thought it we were patient gave him time max would come back to his old self again
bravura sits in front of the desk watching bb
when bb finally looks over the weight of the story showing in his eyes bravuras face b doesnt reveal any hint of emotion
look i called you because i thought i recognized something in you
i thought if we could talk off the record im listening
emotional this isnt just some job stress freak out
this is a man who lost everything and who deserves a little understanding from the rest of us
if youd known him before
beat pained youd want to believe him too
believe him about what
not expecting this turn in the conversation bravura sits up
are you saying you think max did have something to do with alexs murder
alex was his partner they were like brothers
he couldnt have
theres no way
then what are we talking about
look max is like a son to me
dont put me in a position to have to hang him
beat pained but you should hear the kinds of things hes saying
hallucinations none of it makes any sense to me
im worried hes going to get into another situation before i can convince him to come in
are you telling me he was
im telling you to find him tonight before somebody else gets hurt
bravura nods reeling from the revelation of this new information
bb picks up his coat and starts for the door
is there anything we can do to help you bring him in
unofficially of course
bringing him in wont be a problem
where i need your help will be his why do you say that
bravura stands finishing a note
a new jersey unit idd him near his old house
it shouldnt be long
b nods somberly mulling this over
you have to find him first protect him
some of the guys from alexs unit beat you to him they wont wait for a trial
at the edge of a strip mall a ramshackle personal storage business sits behind a razor wire fence
inside the fence rows of stalls for rent covered by metal garage doors
heres the faint sound of metal stretching and max is over the fence
he moves through the rows reading the numbers
a padlock hangs from the door shining metal glazed over with a sheet of ice
max finds a pristine key on a ring in his pocket
hands shaking he cracks the ice and tries
the garage door raises cold metal rattling as it rolls up
max stands silhouetted in the doorway looking in on ragged stacks of cardboard boxes
his breath blooming around him
max steps inside pulling a box marked garage out into the light
opening it he roots around and finds a flashlight
switched on a golden beam cuts through the blue shadows
max walks deeper into the space brushing the light over the boxes
he holds his hand over one as if warming it
max opens the box
aiting for him under the flaps a stuffed animal stares up at max from inside the box
silly grin frozen eyes shining
hands trembling max pushes the toy aside
deeper in the box he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light
the photograph is of max younger cleaner genuinely smiling
posed along with him olan mills style are elizabeth and the baby
gauzy backdrop church clothes
max studies it haggard new face reflecting in the glass
abruptly max jumps up and moves away from the box
long strides trying in vain to physically shake the memories to block out the emotions with something productive
the flashlight beam keeps sweeping deeper and deeper
max chokes back tears occasionally glancing at the baby box
he beam hits on a document box in the back row
max rushes over nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry to throw the lid off the document box
rows of folders all neatly labeled with feminine script
ax brushes his fingers over the tabs smiling sadly
each year numbered
to himself okay chelle
help me here
maxs fingers skim to the last file in the box marked
much thinner than the others
her last year
only one file in the final section
max opens it finding pages of handwritten notes photocopies drawings
closing the file he checks the name on the tab and frowns
max steps out of the storage locker
he tucks the manila folder inside his coat and pulls the metal door closed
he starts away retracing his steps to the fence
mind reeling with what hes just seen the memories flooding back theres a second set of footprints in the snow before him
max freezes their significance immediately registering
stay where you are
a young cop steps out of the shadows behind max pistol trained on the back of his head
the cops eyes are wide with panic
he assumes an awkward textbook firing position
turning slowly relax im a cop
i know who you are
he gun stays trained on max
slowly he raises his hands
i need you to trust me for a minute
is that what you said to your partner
you dont understand
gesturing with the gun lay down on your face
max studies the cop stiff legs unsteady on the deep snow his frostbitten fingers wrapped around the trigger
trapped between two rows of locked doors max has no cover to run
peeking through the snow at maxs feet an extension cord snakes under the shivering cops legs and down the corridor
bending down okay just take it easy
max starts to lay down causally laying his hand over the power cord
the cop edges closer smirking as max complies
words gotten around about the sick shit you did to him too
if i were you id get ready for sort of a long ride back into the city
max wraps his hand around the cord and whips it tight
the cop pitches backward squeezing off a shot as he falls
before he can fire again max pounces on the cop driving a knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away
he cop twists in the extension cord unplugging the lights
max drives the butt of the pistol into the side of his head
he cop goes limp
max pulls the clip clears the chamber and lets the gun fall in the snow beside the unconscious cop
struggling to his feet max races down the corridor and scaling the icy chain link
he drops into the snow immediately breaking into a dead run on the other side
an express elevator hisses upwards at great speed the sleek interior like a european sports car
alone inside jason colvin watches the blur of numbers with dread
a muted chime and the doors draw back
thin steel beams loft through the air three stories of open air encased by glass a silent void projected into the heart of the storm
in the center of the room a single black bar
its a desk obsidian polished to a mirrored sheen
aesir internationals cool blue logo reflects across its surface
jason colvin approaches the desk nervously watching the shadowed figure of nicole horne read through a document
every hair every stitch of clothing perfect
ootsteps echoing he reaches the desk and waits for a beat
we have a problem
icole cuts her eyes to colvin withering a current of fear passing through him
with great effort she smiles
max slumps in his seat watching the black sky whip past
the manila folder closed in his hands fingers tracing the edges
slowly carefully he lets the folder fall open
maxs eyes skim across the handwritten notes lingering over underscored phrases and circled words
drinking it in
on the next page a sketch of black wings pulls maxs attention
with dread he reads a note below the drawing to himself subjects
the hypnotic motion of the train begins to change the rhythm of the rails faltering a little
ax turns the page
more wings each in a slightly different style each version surrounded by descriptive notes
max skims excited as the trains hiccups grow worse
as the blue and black world sweeps past outside the window maxs face softens almost into a smile
all the lights go out
the train rapidly loses speed
tartled voices murmur
windows that had been black glow to life as the passengers eyes adjust to the dark car
utside the moonless night becomes a hazy expanse of blue snow covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken down houses in the distance
the darkness changes max too hardening his face again
he tucks the folder safely into his coat and zips it up tight
at the front of the car the windows begin to fill with light
the door opens a flashlight beam sweeps inside
pistol between his knees max pulls the hammer back
an obese conductor s steps inside
immediately all of the other passengers begin to question him at once
shouting over ladies and gentlemen please remain calm
the storms caused a power failure but its absolutely nothing to worry about
well be up and running again before long
movement outside catches maxs eye
a figure in the shadows alongside the train
conductor contd our policy is to move everyone up to the front car until the lights come on again
itll be a little warmer if were all together
ax splits his attention between the other passengers and the window watching for more movement outside
suddenly the figure breaks in the opposite direction no attempt at quiet a pounding run away from the train
onfused max straightens up
the temperature has changed
three more figures running in the opposite direction
away from the train up the snowy tracks its yet to cross
recognizing get out of the train
passengers fill the aisle
high school girls sneaking into the city
an old man going to work
drunk yuppies in red and green scarves on their way back from a holiday party
shouting get out an explosion rips through the front of the car and swells a ball of fire smashing through the car and blowing it apart
up and down the dark street shadowed ghouls break windows and claw at abandoned cars searching for anything of value
moving comfortably through the shadows mona follows the general movement towards a bassy quake farther up the block
a red neon ragna rok bloodies the snow in the air marking the entrance to the club responsible for the rumble
inside that music is earsplitting a jet engine at beats per minute
lights strobe past red gels frozen glimpses of thin limbs and black pupils on the dance floor
ona melts into a corner inconspicuously watching the room
inding around the dance floor clubgoers some ragged some in nice clothes queue at a metal door in the back wall
one after another they wait for their moment to enter
theres a disturbance at the front door
black clad guards force open a rift in the crowd on the dance floor
jack lupino walks inside the rift his tattooed face red and black eyes calmly sweeping out across the riotous crowd
lupino moves through bodies roiling like a parted sea sheer walls of twisting flesh towering above him to the rafters
mixed within the wings pound and sweep blotting the light
bb crawls out from under the quilts careful not to wake his wife
he passes windows frosted with ice on his way to
bb shuffles down the hall shivering in his boxers
he pauses at the thermostat frowning to find the heat cut off
b turns startling as max steps out of the shadows steps stiff with pain clothes dripping icy water across the floor
what are you doing
max opens his coat and pulls out the file now badly wrinkled and soggy
he opens it and hands bb a newspaper clipping
those grunts who went crazy in iraq
go a little further read what they did to the bodies
its the same as what happened to alex and that girl
bb reads on frowning
where did you get this
bb looks up startled as max pages through michelles notes
its all in her notes people describing fevers hallucinations
their lymph nodes swell until their necks bruise like somethings been choking them
pointing to the drawings the angels they all talk about
michelle talks about eye spasms that make things seem to flutter
mixed with the other delusions that starts looking like wings
beat she wasnt seeing them
she was trying to figure out why other people were
thought she was working on allergy medicines
somebody at aesir knows what thunderstruck oh my god
slowly bb turns to show max the grief in his eyes
i killed alex
what are you talking about
he came to me about six months ago asking about one of the executives at aesir
at the time i had no reason to connect it to michelle i just thought
beat torn up i tried to warn him this guy has connections to some scary people who
whats his name
bb hesitates rattled by the rage in maxs eyes
he used to be the head of the pharmaceutical division but hes moved up over the last few years
beat i guess michelle probably reported directly to him
max barely nods jaw clenched as he scoops up the documents
ouve got copies of this stuff right
thinking for a moment max sets the folder down again and turns away towards the dark hallway
bb picks up the folder
e careful max
max doesnt respond storming off into the shadows
the snow isnt deep near the charred and twisted metal of the train melted by the fireball
police tape rings the area
etectives wander between yellow tarps in the train sipping coffee
out on the tracks bravura works alone
looks like ten bodies give or take
even in new york that ought to be enough to earn payne the spike
the blast point is outside the train
none of the detectives want to encourage him by answering
ased on the spread of the wreckage
they moving very fast either
he forced them to stop first
bravura nods at the explanation but without conviction
he continues to scan the wreckage still not satisfied
so he had the bomb with him inside but he decided to walk outside to detonate it
are you asking if that seems like odd behavior from a guy who cut his partners head off
the young cop from the storage building slips down the snowy bank and towards bravura
his face is bruised and swollen
you wanted to see me
careful what you say to him if you ever want to make detective
to bravura guarded i already filled out a report
bravura sees the young cop aware of the detectives presence
show me where it happened then
bravura and the young cop stand on the spot where he fought max the night before disturbed snow the frayed cord
he jumped out and wrapped that cord around me and before i had a chance
bravura nods at the bullshit focus drawn to maxs locker
pointing he was coming out of here
when the young cop nods bravura starts to step inside
hey real cops are working here
a few csi techs take photographs of maxs storage locker
bravura walks through eyes quickly scanning the distracting jumble of boxes
the homicide cop follows exasperated
t the back bravura stops and picks something up
its the lid of the box office written in michelles pen
bravura looks around
theres no document box to match the lid
however there are dust free rectangles in the dirt
to a csi tech wheres the stuff you guys moved
nothings been moved
what you playing detective now
on a mission bravura scans the rest of the room
he sees another open box a colorful stuffed animal peeking out
bravura opens it startled by the family portrait
studying the photo this is his wife
bravura finally looks up to see the homicide cop smirking
spent four hours up at homicide going through alexs desk and cataloging pictures of this woman and not one of you bastards bothered to mention that she was max paynes
shrugging if alex was getting a little something on the side who are you protecting
bravura charges closer carrying enough force that the much larger homicide cop steps back
his cool facade crumbles
nobody we just
why would anybody talk to ia without a reason
livid youve got a reason now
tell me everything you know about this woman starting with her name
the city is starting to shut down under the relentless snow the sidewalks are nearly empty only cabs on the icy streets
the aesir corporate offices gleam in the diffuse light a pillar of glass and steel disappearing up into the storm
jason colvin steps out of a cab and marches up the steps
stepping off of the elevator colvin passes a receptionist
you should go on home already
theres nothing going on today
well theres someone in your office
colvin steps through the doorway and stops short
max stands behind colvins desk inspecting the photographs hanging on the wall
hes cleaned himself up a little
pointing to a photo this your daughter
yes it is
three years old
for reasons colvin cant fathom maxs mood seems to darken even farther
colvin sees the badge clipped to his belt
is there something i can help you with detective
you can tell me about project valhalla
nervous laugh i think you might have the wrong
barely keeping his poker face colvin eyes the phone
eed to make a call
maybe id better
max motions for colvin to go ahead
while the executives shaking hands dial the number max closes and locks the door
yes theres a detective here
to max what did you say your name was
abruptly max rips the phone cord out of the wall
low she was my wife
the words maxs flat delivery catch colvin like ice water
still holding the dead receiver colvin staggers back
stunned excuse me
michelle payne was my wife
what color there was to begin with drains out of colvin
what before you say anything else i want you to know who i am
max throws his elbow up crushing colvins nose
bravura enters the soaring lobby of the aesir building stomping his shoes clean
he approaches the front desk
flashing his badge i need to talk to somebody about a woman who used to work here
colvins eyes flutter open
his nose is smashed flat
hes being held upright by his belt which loops around his neck and the headrest of his ergonomic chair
his wrists are bound to the armrests with strips of his tie
max sits on the edge of the desk heavy lamp in his hand
weakly eyeing the lamp please dont hit me again
max wraps the cord in his hand and jerks it free from the lamp which he tosses with a crash
the cord he keeps
a week ago i thought the universe had turned against me
everything i loved was gone and for some reason id been left here to suffer alone
max strips back the insulation on the cord exposing two frizzed bundles of wire one brass the other silver
positive and negative
colvin watches apprehensive
ut it wasnt the universe that took my family away from me
max plugs in the cord
it was you
he crouches by colvin wire in each hand moving them closer
tell me about valhalla
colvin struggles to pull away from the approaching wires
there is no max brushes the bare wires against colvins throat
heres a bright spark
theres no project valhalla anymore
i shut it down years ago
a timid knocking starts on colvins door voices calling in
max waits for more eyes frozen wires hanging ready
reluctant it was a disaster
the drug was so addictive the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost our government funding
by the end we couldnt even guarantee the safety of our scientists administering the experiment
test subjects would follow them home and kill them for an extra dose
is that what happened to michelle
nobody knows what happened to her
max picks up a cup of coffee from the desk and pours it over colvins face as he struggles more frantically
max brings the wires closer to colvins wet skin
terrified people thought michelle might be a whistle blower
that she wasnt loyal enough to aesir and she might go public about the program
maxs eyes thaw hit by the first true words about her death
bravura sits in the lobby impatiently skimming a magazine
on the far side of the enormous room movement draws his eye a line of black clad security guards swiftly moving in formation into a stairwell
swat precision heavy hardware
bravura springs up approaching the guards left at the door
authorized personnel only
bravura pulls out his badge and plans to keep moving
but the guards dont immediately part
they look at each other silently conferring
bravuras eyes light up
dont look at him
louder m authorized
max lets the wires fall away
solemnly he draws his pistol
why are you asking me about this
i already told you
be quiet now
max chambers a round leaving his hand up to block the spray
but why today
its over i got rid of everything before they moved me out of the division
then you havent been downtown lately because you missed a spot
colvin looks up maxs words suddenly scarier than the gun
are you telling me that there are people out there taking the drug again
urgent how many of them
max shakes his head
colvins eyes show real terror
i knew it i knew something was going on
i told her the numbers were too good the pounding outside the door is louder more voices calling
calling through the door mr
colvin are you okay in there
securitys on its way
max turns to the door trapped ready to fire on what comes through
colvin looks at max a sudden realization dawning
theyre not coming for you
what are you talking about
colvin begins to struggle harder than ever but his fear isnt directed at the man with the gun standing over him
you only know my name because somebody high up decided to cut me loose
gesturing theres a safe in the wall
earing a trap max pushes aside a painting and pulls open the door
a small stack of dvds sits inside
show that to whoever will watch
if this thing spreads nothing will keep the rest of you safe
max looks at the middle manager desire to pull the trigger slowly losing out to the credibility of colvins story
max unfastens the belt using it to hoist colvin to his feet
terrified wait im not ready
office workers draw back and gasp as colvins bloody face appears
max is close behind holding the belt around colvins neck pressing his pistol to the back of his head
back up all of you
make a path
theres a disturbance at the back of the crowd glimpses of black uniforms fighting forward
max pivots holding colvin towards the guards as a shield
calling to the guards stay back or ill crack
colvins head snaps back blood spraying over max
he crowd goes crazy screaming and trampling each other
more shots ring out ripping through colvin as max lets his lifeless body fall and hides his retreat in the scramble
the guards chase after max slowed by the panicking crowd
exhausted bravura plods up steps to a landing
suddenly automatic weapons erupt nearby
he fumbles for a cell phone
this is jim bravura ia
you need to tell the units responding to the aesir call to come equipped for automatic frowning the aesir building nobodys called anything in yet
beat hell yes id like to report something
weve got machine gun fire in midtown
bravura snaps his phone shut trying to regulate his breath
drawing a tiny service revolver he creeps to the door
max stumbles up the hall
he chances a look back at the black clad guards crashing through office workers
a burst of machine gun fire pounds the floor in front of maxs feet
more guards seal off the hall ahead
nowhere else to go max grips a cubicle wall and vaults over
ax gets a few careful shots off from his new elevation dropping guards whove lost sight of him as he jumps from desk to desk working deeper into the maze
the fastest guards race ahead to block off a burning exit sign
maxs boots thunder across desks papers flying
the guards ahead fire but max shows now sign of slowing
overhead lights explode smoke and sparks raining down
max launches himself into the air pistol cracking as he falls
bullets rip through the retreating guards
max hits the ground hard scrambling through the exit
and around the corner
shouting put your hands up
max slides to a stop startled to see bravura aiming at him
while he doesnt exactly comply max does lower the barrel
more human you need to come in now before anything else gets pinned on you
ax shakes his head
heavy boot steps rumble closer
she was trying to stop it
tell me whats happening
bullets strafe the wall just above maxs head
he dives to the ground plaster dust and smoke pluming above him
hile max scrambles for cover bravura charges forward waving his badge in the air above him
hold your fire
uards flow into the hall a black mass bristling fire
it takes a split second for bravura to realize they arent stopping
he slips tumbling back as bullets rip past him
screaming hold your fire
finally the machine guns go quiet
smoldering gunpowder clouds the hallway
bravura and the guards search
but max has disappeared into the smoke
mona struggles up a narrow street buffeted by the wind
ahead flashing blue and red lights electrify the snow
squad car idles towards her searchlight flashing into dark shadows
mona ducks her head away as the spotlight finds her at her building door
for a moment shes in a whiteout
lowly the cop car moves on
mona starts to use her key
but the lock has already been forced open
mona steps inside ready for ambush
she turns the corner
max sits on her couch scraped and scorched from his escape
pointing to the tv you need to see this
over black the aesir corporate logo flashes up quickly replaced by a simple block letter title card
from the beginning of time great generals have all wrestled with one undeniable truth morale wins battles
ver an up tempo rock soundtrack a slick montage of war imagery tanks roaring over sand dunes missiles ripping through palace walls american troops firing machine guns
fear fatigue loss of focus
the future of combat medicine lies in the mind of the soldier
a cutting edge lab scientists working complex machinery
thanks to breakthroughs made by aesir pharmaceuticals the military of tomorrow will be able of unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier
n screen the shot cuts to the interview of a young soldier in uniform
he smiles easily confident eyes alert but maybe a little distant
something familiar about him
ow has my experience in combat changed since being selected for project valhalla
beat smiling im never scared for starters
uperimposed under his face pvt
tartled mona moves closer to the screen
thats the guy
what are you talking about
hes the one behind ragna rok
its his club where the drugs being sold
you face down a group of insurgents and instead of fear youre filled with
peace i guess
like youre aware of the power you have in your own hands to make the world a better place
max studies lupinos image thinner no visible tattoos
theres already something in his eyes though
as mona sits back down max brushes past her to get his coat
so what do we do now
max stands up from the couch and starts away
confused mona tries to follow but stumbles when something pulls her back he looks down to see shes been handcuffed to her chair
what are you doing
beat louder uncuff me
beat louder still hey
on screen lupino smiles beads of sweat forming on his face
deliberately max stops the dvd and cuts off the television
hat is this
you think just because he killed your partner you can decide whether i when max finally speaks the sound scrapes out of his throat like he hasnt used his voice
in years he killed my wife
mona struggles at the cuff chain clanking but holding
ive been inside that club
you dont have a chance on your own
realizing but you dont care
max stoops down to pick up monas machine gun where it leans against the base of the couch
mona thrashes helplessly
you dont want my help because you think if he puts you out of your misery youll get to see her again
without a look back max starts out the door
i hope thats really the way it works
the door pulls shut behind him
the red neon sign is only an ember muted under caked ice
n a chair blocking the front door a guard watches the silent street shivering uncontrollably
inside the dance floor is empty
sitting at the top of the stairs another guard sleeps rifle propped beside him
a room like the inside of a smokers lung walls painted black haze from candles and whatever else blurring the air
jack lupino sits on the floor surrounded by candles watching the flames with manic focus
two guards stand above him
nto a bent spoon lupino taps greenish powder from a small glass vial
he uses the candle to heat the spoon
checking his watch one of the guards produces a cell phone and dials
on phone all quiet a
lupino dips a needle into the spoon drawing the bubbling green liquid into the body of the syringe
the guard stomps his feet trying in vain to keep some blood flowing
blowing in his hands he looks both ways down a street that is still just as empty as it has been for hours
chattering to himself screw this
frozen fingers fumbling with the keys the guard opens the door
moving the chair just inside the doorway the guard settles in the alcove
he pulls the door shut
somethings blocking it
the guard stands up opens it wider to build some momentum
max stands on the top step
lupino shoots up gritted teeth tugging his belt tourniquet tight
eyes clinched beads of sweat already forming
the muffled blast of a machine gun out on the dance floor
the guards surrounding lupino spring into action
ait here mr
lupino lets the belt slip free a deep sigh rattling out
he opens his eyes just in time for us to see the irises retracting
candles shine in the black holes left behind
i dont need protection
i have my own
the guards at the door lock and load moving out
max walks into the ballroom motionless guard bleeding out on the dance floor before him
gunsmoke hangs in the air
in that final stillness max checks his clip
thundering boots echo out from the belly of the building
doors fly open guards racing out from the kitchen on the first floor two more from the office crashing out upstairs
ax opens up flames of automatic fire lighting his way
lupino and the guards listen to the shooting grow closer
suddenly the metal door flies open banging at the stop
with lightning reflexes the guards blast down the hallway
upino slowly stands eyes glowing in the guards muzzle flash
forgotten now he fades away into the smoke
the guards crumble and fall until the room goes silent
ax melts out of the smoke weapon raised
the back room is deeper than the poor light gives away
maxs boots grind over burned out candles occult runes
lupino launches out of the darkness at max
before he sees it coming lupino drives a hard punch into maxs skull
max stumbles forward ears ringing from the blow
lupino draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on max
upino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur blade whistling as it cuts through the smoke
he slashes the knife across maxs thigh dropping him to the ground
nable to stand max thrusts the rifle up for protection
the blade clanks against the barrel carving deep trenches in the stock finally gashing the back of maxs fingers
blood rushes from the cuts loosening maxs grip on the weapon
teeth gnashing like an animal lupino reaches out and tries to pull the machine gun out of maxs hands
upino buries the knife into maxs shoulder
he cries out
an you hear them now
lupino drives his knee into maxs chest
arm numb from the stab wound maxs grip on the gun is slowly overpowered
helplessly watching it slip away max screams with rage
outside no voice could carry on that raging wind
two figures walk up the street closing slowly on ragna rok
lupino leans over max one hand grinding the knife deeper into his shoulder the other wrenching the machine gun free
max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip
well see which one us theyre flying for
well see who they love best
sweat streams down lupinos face dripping down onto max
fingernails splitting max finally loses hold of the gun
the sudden shift in momentum pitches lupino back
for an instant they are apart
in that instant max pulls the knife from his own shoulder and buries it to the hilt in lupinos stomach
lupino drops the machine gun
max clamps his hand over lupinos throat using his grip to force the knife deeper
while lupino gasps eyes wide max struggles to his feet
who is your contact at aesir
lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach
louder who sent you after michelle
with difficulty you are so blessed
max looks at lupino up close his undyed skin is ashen and pockmarked older than his age
blood drools from his lips
lupinos eyes swim around lost in a fog of drugs and pain
ou dont know what im talking about do you
lupinos eyes stop swimming
for a moment he sees max
the angels are not done with you yet
lupinos skull explodes
max spins towards the hall but another shot rakes across his shoulder and slings him to the ground
defenseless max can only lift his eyes to see whos coming to finish it
b steps out of the smoke
as max reels at the sight of bb joe salle s rumbles in
alle stomps on maxs wrist in the same motion telescoping a metal baton and cracking it across his skull
with the grace of an old pro salle snaps on a pair of handcuffs
in shock max is hauled to his feet bleeding cuffed and trapped
and bb walks right on by
whats going on here bb
as max watches in disbelief bb paces around the room taking stock noting the dead guards crouching over lupinos body
t ease soldier
max struggles to break free of salles grasp
draws pistol re
not unless you feel like carrying him out of here
max knows me and i definitely dont know mr
shouting look at me bb
at least face what youre doing
bb finally does look at max
cold dead eyes
bb steps through the door over the guards upturned chair
the blizzard has won streets and sidewalks no longer scraped cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons
the fifth largest city in the world reduced to a ghost town
happy new year
b strides out in front taking in the sight
it might as well be a desert white sand sifting around their boots buildings rising above like black canyon walls
max shuffles along behind bb head bent low in the wind
plumes of his ragged breaths trailing out behind him
bb contd look at it from my perspective this thing is going to be a true epidemic
one hundred percent dependence within a few doses and we control the only source
this is so much bigger than lupinos little bar
this is every street corner in the city in a month nation wide in two
max keeps trudging one foot in front of the other
bb looks annoyed that hes not getting a reaction out of him
i hope youre not over there blaming me
really this is michelles fault
maxs eyes start to burn
bb sneaks a peek encouraged
she had no right to put me in that situation
asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bosses
im sorry but thats unreasonable
maxs head snaps up eyes simmering with rage
but then again who could blame her for getting confused being married to such a righteous man
so maybe it is your fault after all
beat just like your old man
always knew you were better than everyone else no
just better than you
bbs smile seems to double
he considers max for a moment
for what its worth he didnt know michelle was going to die
max starts walking again doesnt raise his eyes
the seed has been planted though
bb plays with the silence
he thought they were going out there to scare her destroy her research
looking up from the mail max sees the smashed kitchen door
max keeps walking trying to fight off the memories
bb strolls along beside him taking his time with the story
id arranged with the other guys to finish the job
max races into the hallway bathed in golden light
between max and the end of the hall two junkies are huddled against a door
twisting the handle smacking the wood
he locked them out of the bedroom tried cpr
boy scout shit
he junkies turn to max eyes black and glassy
max looks nauseous
bb sees it thrilled
smiling and as thanks you nearly blew his head off while he crawled out the window
max throws his shoulder into the door snapping the hinges
a man slips out of the window one leg still inside
ax opens fire at the retreating shape
maxs gait begins to falter lost in the memory hes played a thousand times the images shifting to show something new
b watches eagerly waiting for what comes next
max charges in again firing on the man escaping
but this time we watch the glass behind the billowing curtains
the fabric ripples revealing a reflection
thats funny to me
a momentary flash of his profile a mask of guilt and shame
max stops walking
all of his will gone
bb steps closer drinking in the pain in maxs eyes
you really didnt know
with a shrug bb turns away from maxs fury and moves on
above them traffic signals strain under thick icicles
intermittently the lights go dark the power faltering
soft you should have killed me then when you had a chance
i learned something from your father years ago
always give people a choice
tepping into the intersection bb stops
abruptly joe salle closes with max meaty hand clamping onto his arm
he gave me the choice between early retirement or facing the charges he was going to bring against me
he sat me down in that bar and explained that i could either give up the thing i loved or i could have it taken away by force
that was my choice
you could have put a gun in your mouth any time you wanted
or you could have kept living in the hell i made for you
thats your choice
just out of curiosity though why dont i have a chance now
maxs eyes are clear almost peaceful for the first time
because now i know its you
bb moves closer the arrogance in his smile deepening
well youre suddenly max launches himself forward a fullbacks explosion into the line that catches salle by surprise
hands cuffed behind his back max drives his shoulder into bbs jaw splitting his lip
bb tumbles back into the snow
joe brings the club out again bashing max across the head using it to choke max until his struggles lose power
this is far enough
bb looks around wiping the blood from his lip
his eyes fall on a mound of construction rubble in a vacant lot
bb stands and walks onto the lot kicking away snow until he exhumes a cinder block in the rubble pile
bb picks it up
ve got something better
carrying the cinder block bb starts off down a different street
grudgingly salle pushes max along after him
visible a few blocks away the black body of the river waits
an ancient shipping pier juts out into the river murky water high and roiling around its pilings from the stormy weather
b motions for max and joe salle to follow him out onto the pier its planks buried under a thick sheet of ice
to salle taking max grab me some of that rope
bb drops the cinder block at maxs feet cracking the ice
its not like we didnt see it coming
clamping onto maxs arm bb unlocks his handcuffs
max just never seemed the same after the tragedy
ights running the length of the pier flicker eventually dying altogether
all down the shore the power fails
its a good thing his father didnt live to see it though
bill paynes only son a strung out suicide
idden in the now deeper darkness bb pulls something from his coat two glass vials like lupinos filled with the same green powder
he tucks them into maxs coat pocket
smiling it would have eaten him alive
bravuras not going to buy it
not even once the autopsy turns up traces in your blood
max looks at bb trying to understand how that could be
dosed you that night at alexs just to make sure things were fuzzy
compliments of the house
seeing that bb has removed maxs cuffs salle hurries over
the motion puts both men off balance on the slick boards
oe why dont you calm down
salle grabs maxs arm
max looks down at salles feet hard soled shoes slipping
salle anticipates his next thought
abruptly max jerks his arm away
not able to let go in time salles feet fly out from under him
the big man crashes down hard on his side
max ducks and stumbles forward
bb fires missing
max looks back
beached on his side joe salle draws his pistol the next shot coming any moment
struggling to right himself hands scraping over rough planks another shot cracks inches from maxs legs
with nowhere else to go max turns to the water
boots slipping he lunges for the edge careening over
max splashes down into the dark water body twisted in an awkward position wind blasted from his lungs by the impact
shots from the pier above cut into the water around him
max dives under as much as he can stand it in the frigid water swimming farther from shore
shots continuing to splash around him the current pulls him into deeper water
bb and salle fire with less conviction
in the water the disturbance made by max grows smaller as hes swept away
bb lowers his gun motioning for salle to do the same
its fine as cold as that water is
beat just in case though
salle frowns shoots bb a look
max lifts his head
the wide expanse of the river stretches around him surface broken by swirling pocks of falling snow
the current caries him farther from piers and buildings receding into snow as black as the water they rise above
turning max sees that the opposite shore is even farther
slowly the exhilaration of escape begins to change
icy water bites his skin
muscles beginning to tremble
limbs heavy with saturated clothing joints seized by cold max tries to swim against the current with little success
max sinks lower churning water lapping his face
gasping breaths becoming sputtering coughs
max moves down the hallway the familiar golden light
boots stepping quiet past the bloody and motionless bodies
t the bedrooms door max pauses
unable to go through
michelles body faces away bundle cradled in her arms
as max stands watching michelles body stirs
max breaks the surface coughing gasping flailing his arms
its hopeless he immediately begins to sink again
desperation panic move his limbs but for nothing
max payne slips under without so much as a ripple
tentatively max crosses the threshold into the bedroom
michelles eyes open aware that shes being watched from the doorway
she looks up at max a lazy smile forming
the bundle of blankets stirs
michelle grins down at their infant daughter offering her finger to the tiny pink hand
max edges closer overwhelmed by the sight
michelle pats the bed beside them inviting max to sit
he doesnt move
are you home
for a long moment max drinks in the sight of his family
out in the middle of the river the white curtain of blowing snow parts to reveal a dark shape drifting in the fog
like an island in the black water a small boat bobs in place
he captain steps out onto deck zipping his coat against the weather while talking into a two way radio
faintly visible around him larger ships are outlined by twinkling lights
into radio you know how blind i am im not crashing into the dock again
when the power a thud against the hull of the ship something in the water
ang on a second
the captain leans over the gunwale
a body floats below the surface bumping as it bobs in the wake
to himself jumpers
the captain swings a gaff splashing and glancing the sharp hook across the body
he tries again a solid hit
a hand breaks the surface weakly grabbing the pole
to the engine room somebody get out here
the boat barrels out of the fog moving too fast towards the pier
the captain and his first mate crouch over max
its too late
hes frozen solid
ax lies on the deck ice water streaming from his clothes
hes blue gray shivering violently tiny puffs of breath
the boat tries to ease into the dock but is moving too fast it crashes against the pilings
the gathered crowd shouts
calling to the pier somebody get some blankets
the captain and mate lift maxs rigid body up to the pier
people start to inspect his cut and battered body
all the cops hes bleeding everywhere
catatonic to this point max suddenly tries to shake his head
he attempts to sit up but hands force him down
powerless maxs eyes desperately look around searching
weve got help coming
hand shaking violently max reaches inside his coat and pulls out the vials bb planted
trembling he flips the caps away
what is that
with everything he has max opens his chattering jaws and dumps the green tinged powder into his mouth
great a junkie bleeding on my boat
the dust on maxs lips liquefies
his trembling grows worse
the crowd parts and a man rushes up with blankets
he kneels down over max whose body keeps shaking
touching max confused he doesnt really feel that bad
what do you mean hes a block of ice
the captain touches maxs skin jerking away in shock
maybe its a fever already
max pushes their hands away his strength suddenly regained
unsteadily max climbs to his feet
the crowd pulls away
let him go then
max wobbles up the planks the snow fall not quite as hard as it had been when he went into the water
maxs gait grows more steady each step forcefully forward
one by one the flakes become burning embers drifting from the sky
max marches ahead bits of fire raining over him
a exhausted man in the uniform of a guard slumps in an interrogation room
bravura paces the floor grilling him
again from the beginning
before the guard can answer the door flies open
without a word the ranking officer summons bravura into the hall
where a row of more guards are handcuffed to a bench
nder what authority are you interrogating these men
an investigation into departmental corruption
theyre material witnesses just between you and me i wouldnt count on these men being any kind of witnesses at all
i served with a few of them and remember what kind of officers they were
from the bench bravura sees the smirks from the guards
what kind would that be
at the far end of the hall a group of serious looking men in dark suits file out of the elevator
bravura cracks a smile
the suits get closer revealing badges on their belts
to the lead agent agent taliente id like you to meet a real cop
the ranking officer and the agent shake hands
standing in the doorway of an office down the hall a detective shrinks back to his desk and picks up the phone
on phone let me talk to bb
with dead streetlights the hulking black shape of the asgard building looms like a mountain at the end of the block
ax moves up the street steam rising from his clothes as they dry from the heat of his skin
sweat beads on his face
max enters asgards courtyard the gothic facade rising high above
he passes through its security lights shadow casting down onto the clean white snow like a projection screen
invisible to the naked eye more shadows of winged shapes dart and swoop in the air above maxs outline on the snow
bb pounds the receiver down onto the phone cracking the base
joe salle watches him angrily pulling on his coat
whats going on downtown
bravura called in the feds
bb storms for the door surprised to turn back and see that salle hasnt followed him
the big man scowls nervous
or gods sake come on
max is dead theyve got nothing else
bb and salle storm down the steps into the main entry hall
get up to the armory hide the salle grabs bb by the arm
on the floor between them and the front door two guards sprawl face down in enormous pools of their own blood
hes not dead
theres no way at that moment they both see movement in the shadows
max steps forward into the light soaked in blood up to his elbows eyes black and animalistic
no longer himself
oe salle reaches for his pistol
with freakish reflexes max raises one of the guards machine guns and opens fire
bb and salle fall back diving into an ancient elevator car
slugs ricocheting bb and salle struggle to shut the doors
from maxs pov as the elevator doors slam shut a glimpse of bbs face stretching and distorting into a demonic grin
bb and salle watch the floor number rise
bb finds his cell
who are you calling
by salles face thats a thought scarier than max
the giant glass walled penthouse office of the aesir building sits above the storm clouds
up here dawn is close
nicole horne watches the storm below her feet
even this isnt a number you use
need you to send a helicopter to my building
nthe storms breaking
here was a shoot out in my building yesterday twenty floors from where im sitting
a secretary was killed
i understand an executive named jason colvin was also among the dead
senseless tragedies all
nicole sighs eyes still fixed on the window
everythings fine were just this was more than you were ready for
what is that supposed to mean
perhaps our partnership has run its course
think pretty hard about that
im about to be surrounded by federal agents shadenfreude good heavens bb
best of luck
who needs luck
theyre going to love the stories i can tell
losing it send the helicopter then
after a moment horne lets her eyes drift shut
its on its away
the elevator opens and bb steps out snapping his phone shut
take everybody and get downstairs
i want no less than his head
max turns the corner into a long hallway of prison like offices
emergency lights flicker through barred windows
a group of guards look up and see max at the same moment
max is without hesitation shooting two before they can raise their weapons
falling back the others start firing
uddenly an office down the hall bursts to life a roar of flapping wings light from the window strobing with movement
max doesnt seek cover walking into blazing machine guns
one by one all the offices flicker with fluttering wings
max marches on rage filled eyes set in a lifeless face
guards empty the weapons lockers loading for bear as the sounds of gunfire grow closer
bb and salle supervise
take some c wire it so he cant make it to the roof
ill wait on the chopper
salles mistrust of bb is painted all over his face
smiling you know i wont leave without you
max fires plaster from shattered walls caking on his sweat soaked skin
guards take cover fall back for position
with every shot fired the muzzle flash glows in maxs empty black eyes the flames glowing brighter as he advances
into the vast open space at the heart of the building
guards appear at the other end of the hallway opening up
their shots echo the great room ringing like a cave
max lifts his eyes what had been four stories now seems like forty the top not visible behind hazy black smoke
bullets whistle past maxs ear
distracted he returns fire but his eyes are drawn back to the black smoke above
something moves in the clouds swirling closer
more guards thunder up steps littered with spent casings
in their haste they dont notice the thin gap in one window
lender fingers slip in with the swirling snow opening it
crashing back into maxs perspective a rushing wind presses down from the black clouds above the darkness spreading
maxs legs buckle his machine gun scattering shots
the room goes darker as it gets louder light blotted out by winged creatures drifting down from above circling closer
max stumbles buffeted by their pounding wings
choking on sulfurous smoke hair smoldering skin starting to singe
a small group of guards race forward dodging the bodies of others max met along the way
they hesitate form ranks
and the frightened guards charge into the great room
it is silent
just a hall
blood streaks the walls flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead guards
at the far end of the hall something moves max
on his hands and knees rivers of sweat flowing
confused the group of guards approach max
crushed inside the deafening blackness max lifts his eyes to see leering demons gazing down distorted versions of
the four guards who look down on maxs trembling sweat logged body on the floor
hes muttering chanting
so easy it almost doesnt seem fair a guard aims his pistol
suddenly bullets rip through the guards from behind
no chance to respond bodies torn open with a merciless blast of machine gun fire
they fall around max joining the rest
gun smoking mona rushes up the hallway to max
the demons fade away their howling screams lingering behind
awaiting the next horror max is shocked by something else white light splits open the smoke cutting the black in two
mona kneels down over max lifting up his head
maxs skin is pale slick like melting wax
his eyes are empty
theres nothing gentle in her touch she slams maxs head back onto the cold marble jerking him up again by his hair
gradually maxs black eyes start to find monas face
the white light grows brighter blasting away shadows and smoke
in its center traces of monas face appear
max starts to sit up gazing with confusion at the hallway
you dont have much time
no idea if he understands mona helps him up
ill do what i can to slow them down but you have to hurry
max looks back at mona clearly having some idea of what that means for her
they look at each other for a long moment
youre not done yet
sickly light glows in the east
the snow has all but stopped
bb strides across the roof hope in his eyes
on phone the weathers broken your pilot is going to have no problem landing
nicole horne sits at her desk watching the storm recede
a red light flashes on her phone
she ignores it
joe salle kneels over a pile of c bricks wiring a bomb
he tenses hearing something in the hall behind him
raising his hands and turning slowly he finds mona waiting
wheres the detonator
slowly salle holds it out for mona
she grabs the remote
theres more like this all over
even if the building doesnt collapse this floor is gone
beat careful with that thing is what im saying
im sure you and i can work something out
suddenly boot steps ring up the hallway behind mona
drop your weapon
max staggers through the door to bbs office
out the big windows the east river begins to glow with approaching dawn
ax scans the room for bb his vision still plagued by flickering shadows hallucinations receding but not yet gone
he pauses at the glass caught by his twisted reflection
ax can see his own wings
salle holds out his hand for the detonator
behind mona elevator doors open to reveal more guards
they file out
to the guards hurry maxs already upstairs
to mona frustrated just hand it over
mona watches the guards file towards the stairs
behind her the elevator car waits empty the doors starting to close
bs done for but this thing doesnt have to stop
im his number two and somebody has to take over for lupino
like i said we can work something out
ever so casually mona takes a step back onto the elevator
the doors hiss along their tracks converging
frowning confused give me one reason we cant do business
mona presses the button on the detonator
he window max stands in front of shatters in the explosion his demonic image bursting into a thousand shards of glass
from the ground the explosion rains glass down over the feds and waiting swat team
shielding his eyes bravura squints up at the flames in the windows
taliente pats his shoulder
try to take payne alive if theres anything left
on his signal the swat team mobilizes
wind gusts through the shattered windows of bbs office
max brushes away diamonds of broken glass struggling to stand
hin rims of color have returned to his eyes
max draws his pistol and strides through the roof door
a shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside
max cant react
bullets shred the door behind him one slug hitting max in the stomach and knocking him to the ground
cross the roof bb keeps firing until his pistol clicks
bb returns his attention to the sky hopelessly waiting
all that snow and
watch it end up being a beautiful day
ritting his teeth max struggles to his knees
blood rushes between his fingers streaming out of the hole in his side
earing maxs effort bb turns away from the empty sky
using the pistol as a crutch max finally stands
you want my confession first
you came all this way for it
bb tosses his useless weapon aside
mock penitent forgive me max for i have sinned
i should have bet more on you and less on that helicopter
max limps closer pistol swinging at his side
a thin trail of blood follows behind him in the snow
bb watches maxs approach his swagger rapidly failing
just get to it already
thats all i ask
youve earned it so just
with the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty max pulls the pistols slide back to check for a live round
bb watches maxs preparations terror growing
unable to resist his panic bb abruptly tries on a helpless smile
but i want you to listen to me first
just try to hear what max raises the pistol and pulls the trigger
the slug hits bb in the center of the forehead snapping his neck back
the shell casing twirls down landing in the snow without a sound
bbs corpse lands a moment later with a clumsy thud
max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body bbs eyes frozen on the sky red halo slowly expanding
max reaches the edge the rivers black body revealed below
his gait falters blood filling each footprint in the snow
the swat team streams through the door racing for the roof
max stands at the roofs edge
a stiff wind buffets against his chest forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little
slowly his eyes drift from the water below to the sky
from the doorway max watches michelle smiling down at their baby who grabs at her finger with a wide grin
i dont believe in heaven
gently max takes a seat on the edge of the bed beside them
max looks up at the sky
behind him the swat team races outside swarming and barking orders at max weapons raised
max drops to his knees
he raises his hands one dripping with his own blood
but his eyes stay on the sky
but i have this idea about it
where a tiny tear opens in the clouds revealing steel grey dawn beyond
