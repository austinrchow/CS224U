star wars episode the phantom menace title card a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title followed by a roll up which crawls up into infinity
turmoil has engulfed the galactic republic
the taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute
hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships the greedy trade federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of naboo
while the congress of the republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events the supreme chancellor has secretly dispatched two jedi knights the guardians of peace and justice in the
galaxy to settle the conflict
pan down to reveal a small space cruiser heading toward camera at great speed
pan with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of naboo which is surrounded by hundreds of trade federation battleships
in the cockpit of the cruise the captain and pilot maneuver closer to one of the battleships
qui gon off screen voice captain
the captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her
captain yes sir
qui gon v
o tell them we wish to board at once
captain yes sir
the captain looks to her view screen where nute gunray a neimoidian trade viceroy waits for a reply
captain contd with all due respect for the trade federation the ambassodors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately
nute yes yes of coarse
as you know our blockade is perfectly legal and wed be happy to recieve the ambassador
the screen goes black
out the cockpit window the sinister battleship looms ever closer
the small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the federation battleship
a protocol droid tc waits at the door to the docking bay
two worker droids pk and eg watch
pk they must be important if the viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them
the door opens and the republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay
two darkly robed figures are greeted by tc
tc im tc at your service
this way please
they move off down the hallway
eg a republic cruiser
dont you think
pr im not made to think
a door slides open and the two cloaked shapes are led past camera into the formal conference room by tc
tc i hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here
my master will be with you shortly
the droid bows before obi wan kenobi and qui gon jinn
he backs out the door and it closes
the jedi lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of naboo
qui gon sixty years old has long white hair in a ponytail
he is tall and striking with blue eyes
obi wan is twenty five with very short brown hair pale skin and blue eyes
several exotic bird like creatures sing in a cage near the door
obi wan i have a bad feeling about this
qui gon i dont sense anything
obi wan its not about the mission master its somethging
qui gon dont center on your anxiety obi wan
keep your concentration here and now where it belongs
obi wan master yoda says i should be mindful of the future
but not at the expense of the moment
be mindful of the living force my young padawan
obi wan yes master
how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellors demands
qui gon these federation types are cowards
the negotiations will be short
nute gunray and daultray dofine stand stunned before tc
nute shaken what
what did you say
tc the ambassadors are jedi knights i believe
dofine i knew it
they were sent to force a settlement eh
blind me were done for
a hologram of nute surrounded by battle droids appears in the conference room hallway
nute they must be dead by now
blast whats left of them
the hologram fades off as a battle droid owo cautiously opens the door
a deadly green cloud billows from the room
battle droids cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke
it is tc carrying the tray of drinks
tc oh excuse me so sorry
the protocol droid passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords fly out of the deadly fog cutting down several battle droids before they can fire
the bridge is a cocophony of alarms
nute and rune watch owo on the viewscreen
owo not sure exactly what
owo is suddenly cut in half in mid sentence
rune gives nute a worried look
nute what in blazes is going on down there
rune have you ever encountered a jedi knight before sir
nute well not exactly but i dont
panicked seal off the bridge
rune that wont be enough sir
the doors to the bridge slam shut
nute i want destroyer droids up here at once
rune we will not survive this
qui gon cuts several battle droids in half creating a shower of sparks and metal parts
obi wan raises his hand sending several battle droids crashing into the wall
qui gon makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it
the crew is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door
qui gon and obi wan are on the view screen
nute close the blast doors
the huge very thick blast door slams shut followed by a second door then a third
there is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut
qui gon tabs the door with his sword
the screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door
theyre still coming through
on the door chunks of molten metal begin to drop away
this is impossible
rune where are those destroyer droids
ten ugly destroyer wheel droids roll down the hallway at full speed
just before they get to the bridge area they stop and transform into their battle configuration
qui gon cant see them but senses their presence
qui gon destroyer droids
obi wan offhand id say this mission is past the negotiaion stage
the wheel droids led by p rush the entry area from three hallways blasting away with their laser guns
they stop firing and stand in a semi circle as the smoke clears
obi wan and qui gon are nowhere to be seen
p switch to bio
there they are
the jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut
the wheel droids blast away at the two jedi with their laser swords
obi wan they have shield generators
qui gon its a standoff
nute and rune stand on the bridge watching the view screen as the wheel droids pov speeds to the doorway
rune we have them on the run sir
theyre no match for destroyer droids
tey how sir theyve gone up the ventilation shaft
qui gon and obi wan appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay
they are careful not to be seen
thousands of battle droids are loading onto landing craft
qui gon battle droids
obi wan its an invisible army
qui gon its an odd play for the trade federation
weve got to warn the naboo and contact chancellor valorum
lets split up
stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet
obi wan you were right about one thing master
the negotiations were short
tey how recieves a transmission
tey how sir a transmission from the planet
rune its queen amidala herself
nute at last were getting results
on the view screen queen amidala appears in her throne room
wearing her elaborate headdress and robes she sits surrounded by the governing council and four handmaidens eirtae yane rabe and sache
nute contd again you come before me your highness
the federation is pleased
amidala you will not be pleased when you hear what i have to say viceroy
your trade boycott of our planet has ended
nute smirks at rune
nute i was not aware of such a failure
amidala i have word that the senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours
nute i take it you know the outcome
i wonder why they bother to vote
amidala enough of this pretense viceroy
im aware the chancellors ambassadors are with you now and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement
nute i know nothing about any ambassadors
you must be mistaken
amidala surprised at his reaction studies him carefully
amidala beware viceroy
the federation is going too far this time
nute your highness we would never do anything without the approval of the senate
you assume too much
amidala we will see
the queen fades off and the view screen goes black
rune shes right the senate will never
nute its too late now
rune do you think she suspects an attack
nute i dont know but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there
the queen eirtae sache and her governor sio bibble stand before a hologram of senator palpatine a thin kindly man
how could that be true
i have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassaodrs did arrive
it must be the
the hologram of palpatione sputters and fades away
amidala senator palpatine
turns to panaka whats happening
captain panaka turns to his sargeant capt
panaka check the transmission generators
bibble a malfunction
panaka it could be the federation jamming us
bibble a communications disruption can only mean one thing
amidala dont jump to conclusions governor
the federation would not dare go that far
panaka the senate would revoke their trade franchise and theyd be finished
amidala we must continue to rely on negotiation
weve lost all communications
and where atre the chancellors ambassadors
how can we negotiate
we must prepare to defend ourselves
panaka this is a dangerous situation your highness
our security volunteers will be no match against a battle hardened federation army
amidala i will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war
six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet naboo
three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet
one by one the federation warships land in the eerie swamp
obi wans head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake
for in the background the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist
obi wan takes several deep breaths then dissapears again under the muddy swamp
troop transports mtts emerge from the landing craft
the droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain
oom in his tank looks out over the vast army marching across the rolling hills
a small hologram of rune and nute stands on the tank
and there is no trace of the jedi
they may have gotton onto one of your landing craft
oom if they are down here sir well find them
we are moving out of the swamp and are marching on the cities
we are meeting no resistance
qui gon runs through the strange landscape glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports emerging from the mist
animals begin to run past him in a panic
an odd frog like gungan jar jar inks squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp
the shell pops open
jar jars greta tongue snaps out and grabs the clam swallowing it in one gulp
jar jar looks up and sees qui gon and the other creatures running like the wind toward him
one of the huge mtts bears down on the jedi like a charging locomotive
jar jar stands transfixed still holding the clam shell in one hand
jar jar oh noooooooooo
jar jar drops the shell and grabs onto qui gon as he passes
the jedi is caught by surprise
jar jar contd hey help me
qui gon let go
the machine is about tp crush them as qui gon drags jar jar behind him
just as the transport is about to hit them qui gon drops and jar jar goes splat into the mud with him
the transport races overhead
qui gon and jar jar pull themselves out of the mud
they stand watching the war machine dissapear into the mist
jar jar grabs qui gon and hugs him
jar jar oyi mooie mooie
i luv yous
the frog like creature kisses the jedi
qui gon are you brainless

jar jar say what
the two staps barrell down on obi wan
jar jar contd oh nooooo
qui gon throws jar jar into the mud
qui gon stay down
his head pops up
the two troops fire laser bolts at obi wan
qui gon deflects the bolts back and the staps blow up
obi wan is exhausted and tries to catch his breath
obi wan sorry master the water fried my weapon
obi wan pulls out his burnt laser sword handle
qui gon inspects it as jar jar pulls himself out of the mud
qui gon you forgot to turn your power off again didnt you
obi wan nods sheeplishly
qui gon contd it wont take long to recharge but this is a lesson i hope youve learned my young padawan

obi wan when they find us they will crush us grind us into little pieces then blast us into oblivion
jar jar oh

qui gon and obi wan pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn into breathing masks
jar jar contd my warning yous

jar jar jumps does a double somersault with a twist and dives into the water
breath masks on qui gon and obi wan wade in after him
qui gon and obi wan swim behind jar jar who is very much at home in the water
down they swim into murky depths
in the distance the glow of otoh gunga an underwater city made up of large bubbles becomes more distinct
they approach the strange art nouveau habitat
jar jar swims magically through one of the bubble membranes which seals behind him
obi wan and qui gon follow
gungans in the square scatter when they see the strange jedi
four guards armed with long electro poles ride two legged kaadus into the square
the guards led by captain tarpals point their lethal poles at the dripping trio
jar jar heyo dalee capn tarpals mesa back
tarpals noah gain jar jar
yousa goen tada bosses

tarpals gives jar jar a slight zap with his power pole
jar jar jumps and moves off followed by the two jedi
jar jar how wude
the bosses board room has bubble walls with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars
a long circular judges bench filled with gungan officials dominates the room
obi wan and qui gon stand facing boss nass who sits on a bench higher than the others

jar jar mesa cause ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes
yud say boom da gasser un crash der bosses heyblibber
suddenly there is a loud crash and the little craft lurches to one side
qui gon looks around and sees a huge lumimnous opee sea killer has hooked them with its long gooey tongue
qui gon full speed ahead
instead of full ahead jar jar jams the controls into reverse
the sub flies into the mouth of the creature
jar jar oooops
obi wan give me the controls
obi wan takes over the controls and the opee sea killer instantly releases the sub from its mouth
jar jar wesa free
as the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws munching on the hapless killer
the jaws belong to the incredible sando aqua monster
the lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom
qui gon theres always a bigger fish
nute and rune stand before a hologram of darth sidious
nute the invasion is on schedule my lord
darth sidious good
i have the senate bogged down in procedures
by the time this incident comes up for a vote they will have no choice but to accept your control of the system
nute the queen has great faith the senate will side with her
darth sidious queen amidala is yound and naive
you will find controlling her will not be difficult
you have done well viceroy
nute thank you my lord
darth sidious fades away
rune you didnt tell him about the missing jedi
nute no need to report that to him until we have something to report
sparks are flying and water is leaking into the cabin
the sound of the power drive drops
were losing power
obi wan is working with the sparking wires
jar jar panics
qui gon stay calm

jar jar what yet
monstairs out dare

the lights flicker on revealing an ugly colo claw fish right in front of them
jar jar monstairs back
the large colo claw fish is surprised and rears back
the sub turns around and speeds away
jar jar contd wesa in trouble now
qui gon relax
qui gon puts his hand on jar jars shoulder
jar jar relaxes into a coma
obi wan you overdid it
the colo claw fish leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the sando aqua monster
obi wan contd this is not good
jar jar regains consciousness
jar jar wesa dead yet
jar jars eyes bulge and he faints again
the sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the aqua monster
the colo claw fish chasing them isnt so lucky
it is munched in half by the larger predator
the little sub slips away
qui gon head for that outcropping
the long columns of the droid army move down the main road leading to theed the naboo capital
as the queen watches helplessly from a window in the palace a transport carrying nute and rune lands in theed plaza
they exit the transport
nute ah victory
the little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface which is brightly lit
jar jar wesa dude it
billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water
there is a loud rush of bubbles and a small sub bobs to the surface
the current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river
obi wan switches off the two remaining bubble canopies
qui gon stands up to look around
jar jar lets out a sigh of relief
jar jar wesa safe now
qui gon get this thing started
jar jar dissen berry good
obi wan what is it
jar jar looks back to where theyre drifting
he sees they are headed for a huge waterfall
jar jar what
obi wan tries to start the engine
the long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate
obi wan struggles until finally a few feet short of the waterfall the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current
the sub slowly moves forward
in the background qui gon takes a cable out of his belt
the engine coughs and dies
they start drifting backward again
jar jar panics
jar jar contd iyiiyi wesa dien here hey
qui gon shoots the thin cable and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore
the sub pulls the cable taut and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall
qui gon come on
obi wan climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable
qui gon starts in after him
qui gon contd come on jar jar
jar jar no
obi wan get up here
jar jar no a mighty no
jar jar looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall
jar jar contd oie boie
jar jar starts to climb out of the sub
obi wan is on shore and helps to pull qui gon out of the water
obi wan that was close
battle droid b o
s drop your weapons
the two jedi turn around to see a battle droid standing in front of them
jar jar climbs up on shore between the jedi
battle droid b i said drop your weapons qui gon ignites his laser sword and in a brief flash the droid is cut down by the jedi
a stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose crashing down the waterfall
the jedi move on
jar jar reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess
jar jar whoa
the waterfalls of theed sparkle in the noonday sun
queen amidala sio bibble and five of her handmaidens eirtae yane padme rabe sache are surrounded by twenty droids
captain panaka and four naboo guards are also held at gunpoint
nute and rune stand in the middle of the room
how will you explain this invasion to the senate
nute the naboo and the federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here
ive been assured it will be ratified by the senate
amidala i will not co operate
nute now now your highness
you are not going to like what we have in store for your people
in time their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view
oom steps forward process them
oom yes sir
turns to his sergeant take them to camp four
the sergeant marches the group out of the throne room
and four guards are led out of the palace by ten battle droids
the plaza is filled with tanks and battle droids which they pass on their way to the detention camp
unbeknownst to them qui gon obi wan and jar jar sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the
four battle droids are instantly cut down
more droids move forward and are also cut down by the jedis flashing lightsabres until there is only the droid sergeant left
the sergeant starts to run but is pulled back to qui gon by the force until finally he is dispatched by the jedi
jar jar yousa guys bombad
queen amidala and the others are amazed
jar jar is getting used to this
they move between two buildings
qui gon your highness we are the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
bibble your negotiations seem to have failed ambassador
qui gon the negotiations never took place
your highness we must make contact with the republic
captain panaka steps forward
panaka theyve knocked out all our communications
qui gon do you have transports
panaka in the main hanger
they disappear down an alleyway as the alarms are sounded captain panaka cracks open a side door to the central hanger
qui gon looks in over his shoulder
obi wan jar jar and the rest of the group are behind him
they see several naboo spacecraft guarded by about fifty battle droids
alarms can be heard in the distance
panaka there are too many of them
qui gon that wont be a problem
to amidala your highness under the circumstances isuggest you come to coruscant with us
amidala thank you ambassador but my place is here with my people
qui gon they will kill you if you stay
bibble they wouldnt dare
panaka they need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal
they cant afford to kill her
qui gon the situation here is not what it seems
there is something else behind all this your highness
there is no logic in the federations move here
my feelings tell me they will destroy you
bibble please your highness reconsider
our only hope is for the senate to side with us
senator palpatine will need your help
panaka getting past their blockade is impossible your highness
any attempt to escape will be dangerous
bibble your highness i will stay here and do what i can
they will have to retain the council of governors in order to maintain control
but you must leave
the queen turns to padme and eirtae
amidala either choice presents a great risk
to all of us
padme we are brave your highness
qui gon if you are to leave your highness it must be now
amidala then i will plead our case before the senate
to bibble be careful governor
the door opens to the main hanger
qui gon obi wan jar jar captain panaka two guards and three handmaidens padme eirtae rabe followed by queen amidala head for a sleek chrome spacecraft
sio bibble yane and sache stay behind
the handmaidens begin to cry
panaka we need to free those pilots
captain panaka points to twenty guards ground crew and pilots held in a corner by six battle droids
obi wan ill take care of that
obi wan heads toward the group of captured pilots
qui gon and the queen captain panaka jar jar and the rest of the group approach the guards at the ramp of the naboo craft
guard droid where are you going
qui gon im ambassador for the supreme chancellor and im taking those people to coruscant
droid guard youre under arrest
the droid guard draws his weapon but before any of the droids can fire they are cut down
other guards run to their aid
obi wan attacks the guards around the pilots
qui gon stands fighting off droids as the others rush on board the spacecraft
obi wan the freed pilots including ric olie guards and ground crew members rush on board the ship
the other pilots and guards race to sio bibblr
after everyone has made it onto the ship qui gonjumps on board
more droids rush into the hanger and fire as the ship takes off
the ship exits the hanger
battle droids standing in the hanger shoot at them
the sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of naboo and heads for the deadly federation blockade
the pilot ric olie navigates toward the massive battleship qui gon and captain panaka watch
our communications are still jammed
jar jar is led into a low cramped doorway by obi wan
obi wan now stay here and keep out of trouble
obi wan closes the door
jar jar looks around and sees a long row of five short dome topped astro droids r units
the all look alike except for thier paint color and they all seem to be shut down
jar jar ello boyos
no response disa wanna longo trip
jar jar taps a bright red r unit on the head and its head pops up a bit
he lets out a gasp as he lifts the head
jar jar contd tis opens
many springs and things come flying out
jar jar quickly closes it again very embarrassed
jar jar contd yoi
ric olie powers back
that little droid did it
he bypassed the main power drive
deflector shield up at maximum
the lone blue droid finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship
the naboo spacecraft races away from the federation battleship
ric olie theres not enough power to get us to coruscant
the hyperdrive is leaking
qui gon well have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship
qui gon studies a star chart on a monitor
obi wan here master
its small out of the way poor
the trade federation has no presence there
panaka how can you be sure
qui gon its controlled by the hutts
panaka the hutts
obi wan its risky
but theres no alternative
panaka you cant take her royal highness there
the hutts are gangsters
if they discovered her
it would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the federation
except the hutts arent looking for her which gives us an advantage
cpatain panaka takes a deep breath in frustration
the naboo spacecraft races away
nute and rune sit around a conference table with a hologram of darth nute we control all the cities in the north and are searching for any other settlements
darth sidious destroy all high ranking officials viceroy
and queen amidala has she signed the treaty
nute she has disappeared my lord
one naboo cruiser got pat the blockade
darth sidious viceroy find her
i want that treaty signed
nute my lord its impossible to locate the ship

a second sith lord appears behind darth sidious
darth sidious contd
viceroy this is my apprentice
he will find your lost ship
nute yes my lord
the hologram fades off
nute contd this is getting out of hand
now there are two of them
rune we should not have made this bargain
what will happen when the jedi become aware of these sith lords
qui gon obi wan captain panaka and the little blue droid stand before queen amidala and her three handmaidens padme eirtae and rabe
an extremely well put together little droid
without a doubt it saved the ship as well as our lives
amidala it is to be commended

the little blue droid lets out a series of bleeps
captain panaka leans over and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the droid and read the number capt
panaka r d your highness
amidala thank you artoo detoo

padme bows before the queen
amidala contd clean this droid up the best you can

captain panaka looks nervously to obi wan and qui gon
qui gon yor highness we are heading for a remote planet called tatooine
it is a system far beyond the reach of the trade federation
there we will be able to make needed repairs then travel on to coruscant
captain panaka your highness tatooine is very dangerous
its controlled by an alliance of gangs called the hutts
i do not agree with the jedi on this
qui gon you must trust my judgement your highness
amidala and padme exchange looks
padme moves next to the droid
padme sits in the main area cleaning r d the brave little astra droid
jar jar pops out of an open door
jar jar hidoe

a large yellow planet appears directly ahead
ric olie searches his scopes
obi wan tahyts it
ric olie theres a settlement
a spaceport looks like
qui gon land near the outskirts
we dont want to attract any attention
the ship heads toward the planet of tatooine
the naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust
the spaceport of mos espa is seen in the distance
obi wan is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel
jar jar rushes up to him and falls to his knees
jar jar obi wan sire pleeese no mesa go
obi wan sorry qui gons right
youll make things less obvious
jar jar walks back to artoo in the hallway as qui gon dressed as a farmer enters the main area
obi wan cantd the hyperdrive generator is gone
we will need a new one
qui gon moves closer to obi wan and speaks quietly to him
qui gon dont let them send ant transmissions
i sense a disturbance in the force
obi wan i fell it also master
qui gon goes into the hallway to meet up with artoo and jar jar
they head to the exit ramp
they start their trek across the desert toward the city of mos espa
in the distance a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport
jar jar dis sun doen murder tada skin
from the spaceship captain panaka and padme run toward them
qui gon stops as they catch up
padme is dresses in rough peasants garb
panaka contd her highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you
she wishes for her to observe the local
qui gon no more commands from her highness today captain
this spaceport is not going to be pleasant
panaka the queen wishes it
she is curious about this planet
padme ive been trained in defense
i can take care of myself
panaka dont make me go back and tell her you refuse
qui gon i dont have time to argue
but this is not a good idea
stay close to me
he gives padme a stern look
the little group walks down the main street of mos espa
they pass dangerous looking citizens of all types
padme looks around in awe at this exotic enviroment
moisture farms for the most part but also a few indigenous tribes and scavengers
the few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found
jar jar is in a constant state of panic
artoo whistles along with perfect confidence
jar jar dissen berry berry bad
steps in ooze ooooh
the group comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship dealers
qui gon well try one of the smaller dealers
they head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships stacked up behind it
qui gon jar jar padme and artoo enter the dingy junk shop and are greeted by watto a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a hummingbird
watto subtitled hi chuba da naga
what do you want
qui gon i need parts for a j type nubian
watto ah yes ah yes
we have lots of that
what kinda junk
naba dee unko boy get in here
qui gon my droid here has a readout of what i need
a disheveled boy anakin skywalker runs in from the junk yard
he is about nine years old very dirty and dressed in rags
watto raises a hand and anakin flinches
watto subtitled coona tee tocky malia

anakin subtitled mel tassa cho passa

artoo and qui gon follow watto toward the junk yard leaving jar jar with padme and the young boy anakin
jar jar picks up a gizmo trying to figure out its purpose
qui gon takes the part out of his hand and puts it back
qui gon dont touch anything
jar jar makes a rude face to qui gons back and sticks out his long tongue
anakin sits on the counter pretending to clean a part staring at padme
she is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life
padme is a little embarrassed by his stare but she musters up an amused smile
finally he gets the courage to speak
anakin are you an angel
anakin an angel
ive heard the deep space pilots talk about them
they live on the moons of iego i thimk
they are the most beautiful creatures in the universe
they are good and kind and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry
padme looks at him not knowing what to say
padme ive never heard of angels
anakin you must be one
maybe you just dont know it
padme youre a funny little boy
how do you know so much
anakin since i was very little three i think
my mom and i were sold to gardulla the hutt but she lost us betting on the podraces to watto whos a lot better master than gardulla i think
anakin looks at padme defiantly
anakin i am a person
my name is anakin
padme im sorry
i dont fully understand
looking around this is a strange world to me
anakin studies her intently
anakin you are a strange girl to me
jar jar pushes the nose on what appears to be a little droid and it instantly comes to life grows legs and arms and starts marching around knocking over everything
jar jar hold on but cant stop it
anakin contd hit the nose
jar jar hits the nose and the droid collapses back into its original state
anakin and padme laugh
anakin watches padme straighten her hair
watto reads a small portable monitor he is holding
he stands before a hyperdrive
here it is
a t hyperdrive generator
thee in luck im the only one hereabouts who has one
but thee might as well buy a new ship
it would be cheaper i think
sying of which hows thee going to pay for all this
qui gon i have republic dataries
watto republic credits
republic credits are no good out here
i need something more real
qui gon i dont have anything else
raising his hand but credits will do fine
watto no they wonta
qui gon using his mind power waves his hand again
qui gon credits will do fine
watto no they wonta
what you think youre some kinda jedi waving your hand around like that
im a toydarian
mind tricks donta work on me only money
no money no parts
and no one else has a t hyperdrive i promise you that
jar jar pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it and they all come tumblimg down
he struggles to catch them only to knock more down
anakin and padme are oblivious
wouldnt have lasted long if i werent so good at fixing things
im making my own droid
qui gon hurries into the shop followed by artoo
qui gon were leaving
jar jar follows qui gon
padme gives anakin a loving look
padme im glad i met you
anakin anakin skywalker
padme padme naberrie
padme turns and anakin looks sad as he watches her leave
anakin im glad i met you too
watto enters the junk yard shaking his head
watto subtitled ootmians
tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia
they think because we live so far from the center we dont know nothing
anakin subtitled la lova num botaffa
they seemed nice to me
watto subtitled fweepa niaga
tolpa da bunky dunko
clean the racks then you can go home
anakin lets out a yipee and runs out the back
qui gon artoo jar jar and padme have found a quiet spot between two buildings
the busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking creatures
qui gon is talking on his com link while jar jar nervously watches the street
obi wan is in the main hold of the naboo craft
obi wan youre sure there isnt anything of value left on board
obi wan v
o a few containers of supplies the queens wardrobe maybe
not enough for you to barter with
not in the ammounts youre talking about
qui gon all right

qui gon puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street
jar jar grabs his arm
jar jar noah gain

qui gon not likely
we have nothing of value thats our problem
qui gon padme jar jar and artoo move out into the street
jar jar is walking behind the others
they walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens one of which is especially ugly sebulba a spider like creature
jar jar stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire
he looks around to see if anyone is looknig then sticks out his tongue and gets hold of one pulling it into his mouth
unfortunately the frog is tied tightly to the wire
the vendor suddenly appears
vendor hey that will be seven truguts
jar jar opens his mouth in surprise and the frog snaps away ricochets around the market and lands in sebulbas soup splashing him
as jar jar moves away from the vendor sebulba jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless gungan
sebulba subtitled chuba
jar jar who mesa
sebulba subtitled ni chuba na
is this yours
sebulba holds the frog up to the gungan threateningly
several other creatures start to gather
sebulba shoves jar jar to the ground
the gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety
jar jar to himself why mesa always da one
o because youre afraid
jar jar turns to see anakni pushing his way next to him
the boy stands up to sebulba in a very self assured way
anakin subtitled chess ko sebulba
coo wolpa tooney rana
this ones very connected
sebulba stops his assault on jar jar and turns to anakin
sebulba subtitled tooney rana nu pratta dunko shag

sebulba turns away
anakin subtitled eh chee bana do mullee ra

qui gon nevertheless the boy is right

padme looks at anakinb and smiles he smiles back
they start walking down the crowded street
jar jar mesa doen nutten
anakin fear attracts the fearful
he was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you
be less afraid
padme and that works for you
anakin to a point
he smiles obi wan stands in front of the naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and begins to whip at his robe
captain panaka exits the ship and joins him
obi wan this storms going to slow them down
panaka it looks pretty bad
wed better seal the ship
captain panakas comlink sounds off
panaka contd yes
panaka well be right there
anakin and the group stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly but very poor old lady named jira

qui gon picks it up revealing for a moment his lightsabre
anakin contd whoops i thought i had more

the wind picks up
shop owners are starting to close up their shops as jira gives them their pallies
jira gracious my bones are aching
storms coming on annie

anakin to qui gon do you have shelter
qui gon well hed back to our ship
anakin is it far
padme on the outskirts
anakin youll never reach the outskirts in time
sandstorms are very very dangerous

the group follows anakin as he rushes down the windy street
the wind is blowing hard as qui gon jar jar and padme follow anakin down the street and into a slave hovel
qui gon jar jar artoo and padme enter a small living space
jar jar dissen cozy
anakins mother shmi skywalker a warm friendly woman of forty enters from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people
shmi oh my
annie whats this
anakin these are my friends mom
this is padme and

qui gon im qui gon jinn and this is jar jar binks
artoo lets out a little beep

anakin a sandstorm mom
the wind howls outside
qui gon your son was kind enough to offer us shelter
anakin come on

anakin leads padme into the other room
artoo follows beeping all the way
qui gon takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to qui gon i have enough food for a meal
shmi oh tank you
thank you so much
im sorry if i was abrupt
ill never get used to anakins surprises
qui gon hes a very special boy
shmi looks at him as if hes discovered a secret
shmi yes i know
anakin shows off his android which is lying on his workbench
there is one eye in the head the body arms and legs have no outer coverings
anakin isnt he great
hes not finished yet
padme hes wonderful
anakin you reall like him
hes a protocol droid

anakin pushes a switch and the droid sits up
anakin rushes around grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets
threepio how do you do i am see threepio human cyborg relations
how might i serve you
padme hes perfect
anakin when the storm is over you can see my racer
im building a podracer
padme smiles at his enthusiasm
artoo lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles
threepio i beg your pardon
what do you mean im naked
threepio contd my parts are showing
oh my goodness
amidala eirtae rabe and obi wan watch a very bad transmission of a sio bibble hologram
cut off all food supplies until you return
the death toll is catastrophic
we must bow to their wishes your highness
please tell us what to do
if you can hear us your highness you must contact me
amidala looks upset
obi wan its a trick
send no reply
send no transmission of any kind
qui gon listens to his comlink
obi wan is in the cockpit
the queen is upset
but absolutly no reply was sent
qui gon it sounds like bait to establish a connection trace
obi wan what if it is true and the people are dying
qui gon either way were running out of time
darth sidious and darth maul look out over the vast city
darth maul tatooine is sparsely populated
if the trace was correct i will find them quickly master
darth sidious move against the jedi first
you will then have no difficulty taking the queen back to naboo where she will sign the treaty
darth maul at last we will reveal ourselves to the jedi
at last we will have revenge
darth sidious you have been well trained my young apprentice they will be no match for you
it is too late for them to stop us now
everything is going as planned
the republic will soon be in my command
the hologram of darth maul fades off as darth sidious looks out over the city
mos espa sandstorm day the giant sandstorm engulfs the town including the naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center where wattos ship is and the slave quarters where
drifts of sand begin building up against anakins house
qui gon anakin shmi jar jar and padme are seated around a makeshift table having dinner as the wind howls outside
jar jar slurps his soup rather loudly
everyone looks at him
he turns a little brighter red
shmi all slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere
anakin ive been working on a scanner to try and locate them but no luck
shmi any attempt to escape
and they blow you up
padme and jar jar are horrified
jar jar how wude
padme i cant believe there is still slavery in the galaxy
the republics anti slavery laws
shmi the republic doesnt exist out here
we must survive on our own
an awkward silence
anakin attempts to end the embarrassment
anakin have you ever seen a podrace
padme shakes her head no
she notices the concern of shmi
jar jar snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue
qui gon gives him a dirty look
qui gon they have podracing on malastare
very fast very dangerous
anakin im the only human who can do it
shmi looks askance at her son
anakin contd mom what
im not bragging
watto says hes never heard of a human doing it
qui gon you must have jedi reflexes if you race pods
jar jar attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl with his tongue but qui gon in a flash grabs it between his thumb and forefinger
jar jar is startled
qui gon contd dont do that again
jar jar tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling
qui gon lets go of the tongue and it snaps back into jar jars mouth
i was wondering
qui gon what
anakin well ahhh
youre a jedi knight arent you
qui gon what makes you think that
anakin i saw your laser sword
only jedi carry that kind of weapon
qui gon leans back and slowly smiles
qui gon perhaps i killed a jedi and stole it from him
anakin i dont think so
no one can kill a jedi knight
qui gon i wish that were so
i had a dream i was a jedi
i came back here and freed all the slaves
have you come to free us
qui gon no im afraid not
anakin i think you have
why else would you be here
qui gon thinks for a moment
qui gon i can see theres no fooling you
leans forward you mustnt let anyone know about us
were on our way to coruscant the central system in the republic on a very important mission and it must be kept secret
how did you end up here in the outer rim
padme our ship was damaged and were stranded here until we can repair it
anakin i can help
i can fix anything
qui gon i believe you can but our first job is to aquire the parts we need
jar jar wit no nutten mula to trade
padme these junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind
everything here revolves around betting on those awful races
qui gon podracing
greed can be a powerful ally
if its used properly
anakin ive built a racer
its the fastest ever
theres a big race tomorrow on boonta eve
you could enter my pod
its all but finished
shmi anakin settle down
watto wont let you
anakin watto doesnt know ive built it
to qui gon you could make him think its yours and you could get him to let me pilot it for you
qui gon looks to shmi
she is upset
shmi i dont want you to race annie
i die every time watto makes you do it
anakin but mom i love it
and they need help
theyre in trouble
the prize money would more than pay for the parts they need
jar jar wesa ina pitty bad goo
gui gon your mothers right
is there anyone friendly to the republic who might be able to help us
shmi shakes her head no
anakin we have to help them mom
you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other
shmi anakin dont
jar jar belches
there is silence for a moment as they eat
padme im sure qui gon doesnt want to put your son in danger
we will find another way
shmi no annies right there is no other way
i may not like it but he can help you
he was meant to help you
anakin is that a yes
that is a yes
the storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel
the storm has passed
vendors and street people clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls
jar jar sits on a box in front of wattos parts shop watching all the activity with growing nervousness
artoo is standing next to him
padme stops qui gon as he is about to enter the shop
padme are you sure about this
trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know
the queen will not approve
qui gon the queen does not need to know
padme well i dont approve
qui gon turns and starts into the shop
watto and anakin are in the middle of an animated discussion in huttese
watto patta go bolla
ankain no batta
maa kee cheelya
anakin bayno bayno
qui gon walks in and watto and anakin join him
watto the boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race
you cant afford parts
how can you do this
not on republic credits i think
he laughs qui gon my ship will be the entry fee
qui gon pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket and a hologram of the naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
he studies it
watto not bad
qui gon its in good order except for the parts we need
but what would the boy ride
he smashed up my pod in the last race
it will take some time to fix it
anakin is embarrassed and steps forward
it wasnt my fault really
sebulba flashed me with his vent ports
i actually saved the pod
watto laughing that you did
the boy is good no doubts there
qui gon i have
acquired a pod in a game of chance
the fastest ever built
watto i hope you didnt kill anyone i know for it
laughs so you supply the pod and the entry fee i supply the boy
we split the winnings fifty fifty i think
qui gon fifty fifty
if its going to be fifty fifty i suggest you front the cash for the entry
if we win you keep all the winnings minus the cost of the parts i need
if we lose you keep my ship
watto thinks about this
anakin tries not to be nervous
qui gon contd either way you win
watto subtitled deal
yo bana pee ho tah meedee ya
your friend is a follish one methinks
obi wan stands outside the naboo spacecraft speaking into his comlink
qui gon is on the back porch of the hovel
obi wan what if this plan fails master
we could be stuck here for a long time
qui gon v
o a ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere and there is something about this boy
qui gon puts the comlink away as shmi comes onto the porch padme anakin jar jar and artoo work on the engines of the podracer in the courtyard below
qui gon you should be proud of your son
he gives without any thought of reward
shmi he knows nothing of greed
qui gon he has special powers
qui gon he can see things before they happen
thats why he appears to have such quick reflexes
it is a jedi trait
shmi he deserves better than a slaves life
qui gon the force is unusally strong with him that much is clear
who was his father
shmi there was no father that i know of
i carried him i gave him birth
i cant explain what happened
can you help him
qui gon im afraid not
had he been born in the republic we would have identified him early and he would have become jedi no doubt
he has the way
but its too late for him now hes too old
kitster a young boy about anakins age seek a boy of ten amee a girl of six and wald a greedo type six years old join anakin jar jar artoo
and padme securing some wiring
anakin padme and jar jar this is my friend kitster and seek amee and wald

seek wald and amee take off laughing
jar jar is fiddling with one of the energy binder plates
stay away from those energy binders
jar jar who mesa
anakin if your hand gets caught in that beam it will go numb for hours
jar jar peeks at the energy plate it makes a little electronic pop zaps him in the mouth and jumps back
jar jar tries to say something but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled
jar jar ouch dats muy bigo oucho
gibberish kitster but you dont even know if this thing will run
anakin it will
qui gon approaches the group and gives anakin a small battery
jar jar gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell anakin but cant get words out that make sense
qui gon i think its time we found out
use this power charge
anakin yes sir
anakin jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines
he puts the power pack back into the dashboard
everyone backs away except for jar jar who calls for help
finally padme frees him and the engines ignite with a roar
shmi watching from the porch smiles sadly
anakin sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as qui gon tends to a cut
the boy leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky
qui gon sit still annie
let me clean this cut
anakin there are so many
do they all have a system of planets
qui gon most of them
anakin has anyone been to them all
qu ig n laughs not likely
anakin i want to be the first one to see them all
qui gon wipes a patch of blood off anakins arm
qui gon there good as new
shmi yells from inside the hovel
qui gon scrapes anakins blood onto a comlink chip
anakin what are you doing
qui gon checking your blood for infections
anakin ive never seen
im not goiung to tell you again
qui gon go on you have a big day tomorrow
anakin rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel
qui gon takes the blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink then calls obi wan
qui gon contd obi wan
obi wan yes master
qui gon make an analysis of this blood sample im sending you
obi wan wait a minute
qui gon i need a midi chlorian count
obi wan all right
ive got it
qui gon what are your readings
obi wan something must be wrong with the transmission
qui gon heres a signal check
obi wan strange
the transmission seems to be in good order but the readings off the chart
over twenty thousand
qui gon almost to himself thats it then
obi wan even master yoda doesnt have a midi chlorian count that high
qui gon no jedi has
obi wan what does it mean
qui gon im not sure
the jedi knight looks up and sees shmi in the doorway watching him
embarrassed she goes back into the kitchen while qui gon ponders the situation
the sinister looking sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus scattering a herd of banthas
darth maul walks to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars
he picks out the lights of three different cities in the distance then pushes buttons on his electronic armband
six football sized probe droids float out of the ship and head off in three different directions toward the cities
darth maul stands on the mesa and watches them through his electrobinoculars
padme exits the hovel
as the twin suns rise artoo is busy painting the racing pod
anakin is asleep
padme passes artoo
padme i hope youre about finished
artoo whistles a positive reply
padme sees kitster riding toward them on an eopie a strange camel lile creature
he is leading a second eopie behind him
padme goes over to anakin
he looks very vulnerable as he sleeps
she watches him then touches him on the cheek
anakin wakes up yawns and looks at her a little puzzled
anakin you were in my dream
you were leading a huge army into battle
padme i hope not i hate fighting
your mother wants you to come in and clean up
we have to leave soon
anakin stands up and stretches just as kitster arrives
anakin hook em up kitster
to padme i wont be long
wheres qui gon
padme he and jar jar left already
theyre with watto at the arena
race crews mill about outside the main hanger
the hanger is a large building with a dozen or so podracers being readied for the race
alien crews and pilots rush about making last minute fixes on their vehicles
watto qui gon and jar jar walk through the activity
i want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over
qui gon patienc my blue friend
youll have your winnings before the suns set and well be far away from here
watto not if your ship belongs to me i think
i warn you no funny business
qui gon you dont think anakin will win
watto stops before an orange racer
sitting to one side having his shoulders and neck massaged by twin yobanas is sebulba
watto dont get me wrongo
i have great faith in the boy
hes a credit to your race but sebulba there is going to win i think
qui gon why
watto he always wins
laughs im betting heavily on sebulba
qui gon ill take that bet
watto suddenly stops laughing what
what do you mean
qui gon ill wager my new racing pod against
the boy and his mother
watto a pod for slaves
i dont think so
the mother maybe
the boy isnt for sale
qui gon the boy is small he cant be worth much
watto shakes his head
qui gon contd for the fastest pod ever built
watto shakes his head again
qui gon contd both or no bet
watto no pods worth two slaves
not by a long shot
one slave or nothing
qui gon the boy then
watto pulls out a small cube from his pocket
watto well let fate decide
blue its the boy red his mother
watto tosses the cube down
qui gon lifts his hand slightly it turns blue
qui gon smiles
watto is angry
watto contd you won the small toss outlander bou you wont win the race so
it makes little difference
anakin and padme enter the hanger on one of the eopies pulling an engine
kitster on the other eopie is pulling another engine
with threepio walking alongside artoo trundles behind pulling the pod with shmi sitting on it
watto passes anakin as he leaves
watto contd subtitled bonapa keesa pateeso o wanna meetee chobodd
better stop your friends betting or ill end up owning him too
watto walks off laughing
anakin what did he mean by that
qui gon ill tell you later
artoo beeps at threepio
threepio oh my
space travel sounds rather perilous
artoo emits a series of beeps
threepio i can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships
kitster to anakin this is so wizard
im sure youll do it this time annie
padme do what
kitster finish the race of course
padme youve never won a race
padme not even finished
anakn looks sheepish
but kitsters right i will this time
qui gon of course you will
one of darth mauls probe droids slowly floats down the main street of tatooine
it looks in shops and studies people as it searches for obi wan qi gon or the queen
an extreme high wide angle reveals a vast arena in the tatooine desert
a large semi circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand people dominates the landscape
large viewing platforms loom over the racetrack
mos espa arena announcers box day fx a two headed announcer describes the scene

i see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid
on the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands a line of podracers emerges from the large hanger surrounded by several crew members
pods are pulled by a wide variety of creatures and are led by aliens carrying flags
the pilots stand facing the royal box

a ody mandrell
coona wa wunda dunko
ody mandrell into the pits for some attention
terter is getting close to sebulba who purposely breaks a small part off his pod sending it into terters engine causing him to veer into anakin and unhooks one of
the main straps on anakins engines that links the pod to his engines
anakin struggles to keep control of the little pod
it whips about wildly

b skywalker is forced onto the service ramp
a oh noah
on a tight corner anakin dives to the inside and takes the lead
a controlled thrust and hes back on course
what a move
sebulba is furious
he stays right on anakins tail crowding him and pushing him through the turns
sebulba pushes anakin harder and the young boy has a difficult time keeping control
one of the parts on anakins engines begins to shake loose
anakin sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system
while he is trying to accomplish this maneuver sebulba races past him
anakin tries to get around sebulba to no avail
every move anakin makes sebulba is able to block
finally anakin fakes a move into the inside as he usually does then tries to go around sebulba on the outside
they race sid by side down the final stretch of the track
b hes catching sebulba
sebulba veers toward anakin and bangs into his pod
he crashes into anakin over and over
the young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering rods on the two pods become hooked together
sebulba laughs at anakin
b that little human being is out of his mind
a punda tah punda
theyre neck and neck
b theyre side by side
a bongo du bongu
shoulder to shoulder
as they head for the final stretch anakin fights to unlock the steering rods by trying to pull away from sebulba
the strain on the steering rod is tremendous
suddenly anakins steering arm breaks and his pos starts spinning
the release of tension sends sebulba into an ancient statue
one engine explodes then the other
sebulba skids through the fire balls blackened but unhurt
he slides to a smoking stop gets out of his racer and throws whats left of a shifter arm on the ground
suddenly he realizes his pants are on fire and he struggles to put them out

watto sees qui gon standing in the doorway
you swindled me

watto flies up to qui gon and puts his face right up against qui gons
qui gon simply smiles
qui gon whenever you gamble my freind eventually youll lose

watto you cant have him

qui gon would you like to discuss it with the hutts

obi wan why do i sense weve picked up another pathetic life form
qui gon its the boy whos responsible for getting those parts
on a hill far overlooking the naboo spacecraft the sith probe droid turns and speeds away
anakin and a greedo are rolling around on the floor fighting
about a dozen or so kids are standing around them yelling
suddenly a long shadow is cast over the two boys they stop fighting and look up
qui gomn is towering above them
kitster is with them
qui gon whats this
anakin he said i cheated
qui gon did you
qui gon do you still think he cheated
qui gon well annie

you will have to tolerate his opinion fighting wont change it
qui gon moves off down the street
the greedo wanders over to wald who has been watching the goings on
wald keep this up greedo and youre gonna come to a bad end
farther down the street qui gon and anakin head toward anakins hovel
qui gon takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them to the boy
qui gon these are yours

anakin suddenly beaming yes
shmi is cleaning up as anakin bursts through the door followed by qui gon
anakin mom he sold the pod

anakin pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket
shmi oh my goodness thats wonderful

qui gon kneels down to the boy
qui gon anakin training to be a jedi will not be a easy challenge
and if you succeed it will be a hard life
anakin but its what i want

qui gon this path has been placed for you annie the choice to take it is yours alone
anakin thinks looks to his mother then to qui gon
anakin i want to go

anakin hugs his mom and starts for the other room then stops
shmi and qui gon give each other a knowing look
anakin has realized something
anakin contd what about mom

youre coming arent you mom qui gon i tried to free your mother annie but watto wouldnt have it
anakin but the money from selling
qui gon its not nearly enough
shmi comes over to her son and sits next to him
taking both of his hands in hers she draws him close
shmi son my place is here
my future is here
it is time for you to let go
to let go of me
i cannot go with you
anakin i want to stay with you
i dont want things to change
shmi you cant stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting
listen to your feelings annie you know whats right
anakin takes a deep breath drops his head
qui gon and shmi exchange a look of concern
when anakin raises up there are tears in his eyes
anakin im going to miss you so much mom
shmi i love you annie
anakin and shmi hug
anakin runs into the other room
shmi contd thank you
qui gon i will watch after him
you have my word

shmi he was in my life for such a short time
anakin has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack
as he leaves he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up
threepio stares at him blankly
anakin well threepio im free

in a starship
threepio master annie you are my maker and i wish you well

kitster runs up to anakin as he and qui gon exit anakins hovel
shmi stands in the doorway
anakin pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket and gives them to kitster
kitster there are so many of us who want you to stay annie

qui gon has moved a short way down the street
kitster thanks for every moment youve been here

anakin hugs kitster and runs toward qui gon then stops to look back at his mother standing in the doorway
he turns back to qui gon then turns and runs back to his mother
anakin starting to cry i cant do it mom
i just cant
shmi hugs anakin
qui gon watches from the distance
she kneels down and looks him in the face
shmi annie remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase the banthas away so they wouldnt be shot
remember how you collapses several times exhausted thinking you couldnt do it
anakin shakes his head
shmi contd this is one of those times when you have to do something you dont think you can do
i know how strong you are annie

anakin will i ever see you again
shmi what does your heart tell you

shmi hugs anakin then turns him around so he is facing qui gon and off he marches like the brave little trooper that he is
he marches right past qui gon starring right ahead tears in his eyes determined not to look back
the probe droid beeps and whistles to darth maul
the sith lord gets on a speeder bike and follows the probe droid into mos espa
anakin and qui gon exit wattos and stop before jiras fruit stand
anakin hands jira some coins
anakin ive been freed and im going away
buy yourself a cooling unit with this
otherwise ill worry about you
jira is astonished
she stares not knowing what to say
jira can i give you a hug anakin sure
she gives him a hug
jira ill miss you annie
there isnt a kinder boy in the galaxy
you be careful
anakin runs to join qui gon who has already started down the street
as they walk along together qui gon notices something out of the corner of his eye
suddenly without breaking his stride he ignites his laser sword swing around and lunges forward and cuts a lurking probe droid in half
qui gon inspects the sparking and fizzing droid
anakin what is it
qui gon probe droid
not like anything ive seen before
qui gon and anakin start running
qui gon and anakin run toward the naboo spacecraft
anakin is having a hard time keeping up
anakin master qui gon sir wait
qui gon turns to answer and sees a dark cloaked figure bearing down on a speeder bike
qui gon anakin drop
anakin drops to the ground just as darth maul sweeps over him
darth maul jumps off his speeder bike and before he has hit the ground the sith lord has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked
by anakin picks himself up
the two galactic warriors sith and jedi are bashing each other with incredible blows
they move in a continual cloudof dust smashing everything around them
this is a fierce fight
anakin gets up bewildered by the confrontation
qui gon contd annie get to the ship
qui gon struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as anakin races to the ship
anakin runs into the main hallway of the spaceship where padme and captain panaka are working
anakin qui gons in trouble
he says to take off
panaka who are you
padme hes a friend
captain panaka anakin and padme rush into the cockpit where obi wan and ric olie are checking the hyperdrive
panaka qui gon is in trouble he says to take off
pilot i dont see anything
obi wan over there
in the distance is a small cloud of dust
qui gon and darth maul continue theirsword battle
leaping over one another in an incredible display of acrobatics the two warrios hear the ship fly over them a few feet off the ground
qui gon almost dissapears for a moment
before darth maul knows whats happening qui gon is on the spacecrats ramp
the sith lord immediately jumps onto the ramp after qui gon but barely makes it
his heels hang over the edge of a forty foot drop
qui gon swings his laser sword with all his might and knocks darth amul off the ramp and onto the desert floor
the ramp closes and the naboo craft rockets away leaving the sith lord standing alone
the sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet tatooine
anakin and obi wan rush into the hallway to find qui gon collapsed on the floor opposite the entry
artoo is looking over him
the jedi is breathing hard wet with sweat and covered in dirt
anakin are you all right
qui gon i think so
that was a surpirse i wont soon forget
obi wan what was it
qui gon i dont know
but he was well trained in the jedi arts
my guess is he was after the queen
anakin do you think hell follow us
qui gon well be safe enough once were in hyperspace but i have no doubt he knows our destination
anakin what are we going to do about it
obi wan gives anakin a who are you
anakin returns an innocent stare
qui gon we will be patient
anakin skywalker meet obi wan kenobi
anakin pleased to meet you
youre a jedi too
obi wan gives the boy a skeptical look
ric olie pulls back on the hyperdrive
obi wan qui gon and anakin watch
qui gon lets hope this hyperdrive works and watto didnt get the last laugh
the stars streak outside the cockpit window
the ship streaks into hyperspace
several federation droids patrol a deserted city street
the palace can be seen in the distance
nute sits in a strange mechanical walking chair which approaches sio bibble and several other naboo officials
rune follows a few paces behind
droid guards surround sio bibble and the others as four council members watch
nute when are you going to give up this pointless strike
your queen is lost your people are starving and you governor are going to die much sooner than your people im afraid
take him away
bibble this invasion will gain you nothing
were a democracy
the people have decided
they will not live under your tyranny
bibble is taken away as oom approaches nute
oom my troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages
they will not stay hidden for long
the ship is asleep
the lights are dim as padme walks into the main room
she goes to a monitor and watches the bibble plea recording
jar jar is stretched out on the floor snoring
artoo is to one side cooing as he rests
padme appears tired
she senses someone watching her and turns around with a start
she sees anakin sitting in the corner shivering and looking verydejected
she goes over to him
he looks up at her with tears in his eyes
he is holding his arms to keep himself warm
padme are you all right
anakin its very cold
padme gives him her over jacket
padme youre from a warm planet annie
too warm for my taste
space is cold
anakin you seem sad
padme the queen is
her people are suffering
she must convince the senate to intervene or
im not sure what will happen
im not sure whats going to happen to me
i dunno if ill ever see you again
he pulls something from his pocket i made this for you
sou youd remember me
i carved it out of a japor snippet
it will bring you good fortune
anakin hands a wooden pendant to padme
she inspects it then puts it around her neck
padme its beautiful but i dont need this to remember you
many things will change when we reach the capital annie
my caring for you will always remain
anakin i care for you too
anakin is disturbed about something
tears are in his eyes
you miss your mother
anakin looks at her unable to speak
she hugs him
move with the ship as it heads toward coruscant
the spacecraft dlies over the endlesscityscape of coruscant the capital of the galaxy
anakin looks out the cockpit window in awe
ric olie coruscant
the capital of the republic
the entire planet is one big city
its so huge
the ship flies through the cityscape of coruscant
supreme chancellor valorum several guards and senator palpatine stand on a landing platform
the sleek naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level of the galactic capital
the ramp lowers
obi wan qui gon jar jar and anakin descend the ramp first and bow before palpatine and valorum
captain panaka two guards queen amidala then padme rabe eirtae and more guards descend the ramp
queen amidala stops before the group
anakin and jar jar stand to one side looking at the huge city
padme smiles at anakin
palpatine bows before the queen
palpatine it is a great gift to see you alive your majesty
may i present supreme chancellor valorum
valorum welcome your highness
it is an honor to finally meet you in person
i must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation
ive called for a special session of the senate to hear your position
amidala i am grateful for your concern chancellor
palpatine starts to lead queen amidala and her retinue off the platform toward a waiting air taxi
palpatine there is a question of precedure but i feel confident we can overcome it
jar jar and anakin start to follow then stop noticing that obi wan and qui gon are staying with the supreme chancellor
queen amidala waves to the duo to follow her
anakin looks back to qui gon and he nods to go ahead
anakin and jar jar join the queen palpatine padme rabe and eirtae in the taxi
palpatine gives the gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a skeptical look
jar jar leans over to anakin
jar jar da queens a bein grossly nice mesa tinks
he looks around pitty hot
valorum and the jedi watch the taxi move off into the city
qui gon i must speak with the jei council immediately your honor
the situation has become more complicated
queen amidala is sitting listening to palpatine
eirtae and rabe stand behind the queen padme is nowhere to be sen
anakin and jar jar are waiting in an adjoining room
they can see the queen but cannot hear what is being said
jar jar dissen all pitty odd to my
anakin dont look at me
i dont know whats going on
captain panaka enters then goes into the room with queen amidala
palpatine is pacing as captain panaka enters
eirtae and rabe stand to one side
the republic is not what it once was
the senate is full of greedy squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems
there is no interest in the common good
no civility only politics
i must be frank your majesty there is little chance the senate will act on the invasion
amidala chancellor valorum seems to think there is hope
palpatine if i may say so your majesty the chancellor has little real power
he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption
a manufactured scandal surrounds him
the bureaucrats are in charge now
amidala what options do we have
palpatine our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor
one who will take control of the bureaucrats enforces the laws and give us justice
you could call for a vote of no confidence in chancellor valorum
amidala he has been our strongest supporter
is there any other way
palpatine our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts
amidala theres no time for that
the courts take even longer to decide things than the senate
our people are dying senator
more and more each day
we must do something quickly to stop the federation
palpatine to be realistic your highness id say were going to have to accept federation control for the time being
amidala there is something i cannot do
a unique building with it tall spires stands out against the coruscant skyline
a small transport passes by the vast temple
qui gon stands in a tall stately room
twelve jedi sit in a semi circle
obi wan stands behind qui gon in the center of the room
the senior jedi is mace windu
to his left is an alien jedi named ki adi mundi and to his right the jedi master yoda
my only conclusion can be that it was a sith lord
mace windu a sith lord
ki adi impossible
the sith have been extinct for a millenium
yoda the very republic is threatened if involved the sith are
mace windu i do not believe they could have returned without us knowing
yoda hard to see the dark side is
discover who this assassin is we must
ki adi i sense he will reveal himself again
mace windu this attack was with purpose that is clear and i agree the queen is the target
yoda with this naboo queen you must stay qui gon
mace windu we will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker
may the force be with you
yoda may the force be with you
obi wan turns to leave but qui gon continues to face the council
yoda contd master qui gon more to say have you
qui gon with your permission my master
i have encountered a vergence in the force
yoda a vergence you say
mace windu located around a person
qui gon a boy
his cells have the highest concentration of midi chlorians i have seen in a life form
it is possible he was conceived by the midi chlorians
mace windu youre referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the force
you believe its this boy
qui gon i dont pressume
yoda but you do
rrevealed your opinion is
qui gon i request the boy be tested
the jedi all look to one another
they nod and turn back to obi wan and yoda trained as a jedi you request for him
qui gon finding him was the will of the force
i have no doubt of that
there is too much happening here
mace windu bring him before us then
yoda tested he will be
queens quarters coruscant day anakin tentative walks down one of the long hallways in senator palpatines quarters
he stops before a dor that is flanked by two guards

the guard speaks into his comlink as anakin looks around a bit nervously
guard the boy is here to see padme

amidala ive sent padme on an errand

the queen just stares at him
anakin contd i may not see her again

anakin bows again
anakin thank you your highness
im sorry to have disturbed you
the queen dissapears behind the doorway and anakin exits
a large distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape of coruscant
the senate chambers are huge
thousands of senators and their aides sit in the circular assembly area
chancellor valorum sits in an elevated area in the center
hindreds of aides and droids hurry about
senator palpatine queen amidala eirta rabe and captain panaka sit in the naboo congressional box which is actually a floating platform
palpatine leans over to the queen
palpatine if the federation moves to defer the motion
your majesty ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session
amidala i wish i had your confidence in this senator
palpatine you must force a new election for supreme chancellor
i promise you there are many who will support us
it is our best chance
your majesty our only chance
amidala you truely believe chancellor valorum will not bring our motion to a vote
palapatine he is distracted
he is afraid
he will be of no help
valorum the chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of naboo
the naboo congressional box floats into the center
palpatine supreme chancellor delegates of the senate
a tragedy has occured on our peaceful system of naboo
we have become caugt in a dispute youre all well aware of which began right here with the taxation of trade routes and has now engulfed our entire planet in
the oppresion of the trade federation
a second box rushes into the center of the senate
it is filled with federation trade barons led by lott dod the senator for the federation
lott dod this is outrageous
i object to the senators statements
valorum the chair does not recognize the senator from the trade federation at this time
please return to your station

palpatine to state our allegations i present queen amidala the recently elected ruler of naboo to speak on our behalf
queen amidala stands and addresses the assembly
there is some applause
amidala honorable representatives of the republic distinguished delegates and your honor supreme chancellor valorum i come to you under the gravest of circumstances
the naboo system has been invaded by force
against all the laws of the republic by the droid armies of the trade
lott dod i object
there is no proof
this is incredible
we recommend a commision be sent to naboo to assertain the truth
lott dod your honor you cannot allow us to be condemned without reasonable observation
its against all the rules of procedure
a third box representing malastare moves into the center of the room
aks moe the ambassador addresses the convention
aks moe the congress of malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the trade federation
a commision must be appointed
that is the law
valorum the point
valorum confers with several of his aides and vice chairman mas amedda
palpatine whispers something to the queen
palpatine enter the bureaucrats the true rulers of the republic and on the payroll of the trade federation i might add
this is where chancellor valorums strength will dissapear
valorum the point is conceded
section a take precedence here
queen amidala of the naboo will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations
queen amidala is angry but remains composed
amidala angrily i will not defer
i have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now
i was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee
if this body is not capable of action i suggest new leadership is needed
i move for a vote of no confidence
in chancellor valorums leadership
this causes a great stir in the assembly
a loud mumur cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers
chancellor valorum is stunned and stands speechless
his vice chair mas amedda takes over
mas amedda order
we shall have order
things settledown a little
the federation box settles next to amidala
prince bail organa moves his box into the arena
bail organa alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in chancellor valorum

the assembly begins to chant

queen amidala is standing staring out the window with jar jar

amidala i will sign no treaty senator
my fate will be no different from that of our people
panaka yes your highness
amidala ready my ship
panaka please your majesty stay here
where its safe
amidala no place is safe if the senate doesnt condemn this invasion
it is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions as a democracy
if you win the election senator i know you will do everything possible to stop the federation
i pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate
amidala and her retinue exit the room
palpatine has a self satisfied smile on his face
anakin obi wan and qui gon stand before the twelve members of the jedi yoda
correct you were qui gon
mace windu his cells contain a high concentration of midi chlorians
ki adi the force is strong with him
qui gon hes to be trained then
the council members look to one another
mace windu no
he will not be trained
anakin is crestfallen tears begin to form in his eyes
qui gon no
obi wan smiles
mace windu he is too old
there is already too much anger in him
qui gon he is the chosen one
you must see it
yoda clouded this boys future is
masked by his youth

yoda our own council we will keep on who is ready
more to learn he has
mace windu now is not the time for this
the senate is voting for a new spreme chancellor
queen amidala is returning home which will put pressure on the federation and could widen the confrontation
yoda and draw out the queens attacker
ki adi events are moving fast
mace windu go with the queen to naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior

he has nowhere else to go
mace windu he is your ward qui gon
we will not dispute that
yoda train him not

mace windu protect the queen but do not intercede if it comes to war until we have the senates approval
yoda may the force be with you
obi wan qui gon and anakin leave
qui gon obi wan and anakin stand on the landing platform outside the ship
artoo whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the platform watching the traffic
suddenly he leans over too far and falls overboard
after a moment he reappears using his on board jets to propel himself back onto the landing platform
the wind whips at anakin as he listens to the jedi
obi wan it is not disrespect master it is the truth
qui gon from your point of view
obi wan the boy is dangerous
they all sense it
why cant you
qui gon his fate is uncertain not dangerous
the council will decide anakins future
that should be enough for you

obi wan reluctantly boards the naboo spacecraft followed by artoo
qui gon goes over to anakin
anakin master qui gon sir i do not wish to be a problem
qui gon you wont be annie
im not allowed to train you so i want you to watch me and be mindful
always remember your focus determines your reality
stay close to me and you will be safe
anakin master sir
ive been wondering

qui gon midi chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells and communicates with the force
anakin they live inside of me
qui gon in your cells
we are symbionts with the midi chlorians
qui gon life forms living together for mutual advantage
without the midi chlorians life could not exist and we would have no knowledge of the force
they continually speak to you telling you the will of the force
anakin they do
qui gon when you learn to quiet your mind you will hear them speaking to you
anakin i dont understand
qui gon with time and training annie
two taxis pull up and captain panaka senator palpatine twenty or so troops guards and officers walk briskly toward the ship followed by queen amidala padme eirtae and finally jar

troops unload the ships in the background as obi wan approaches qui gon
obi wan jar jar is on his way to the gungan city master
qui gons thoughts are elsewhere

obi wan and qui gon stand silently for a moment

jar jar swims down into bubble city
jar jar enters the main square of the bubble city
he stands stunned in amazement and fear
he is nervous and shaking
jar jar ello
where das everybody
the plaza is empty
he notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if there had been a battle of some kind
jar jar exits the swamp lake and walks over to queen amidala captain panaka obi wan and qui gon
padme eirtae rabe anakin and artoo pilots and eight guards stand in the background near the starship
jar jar dare sa nobody dare

qui gon do you know where they are
the group follows jar jar as he moves through the swamp
jar jar stops and sniffs the air
the group stop behind him
jar jar dissen it
jar jar makes a strange chattering noise
suddenly out of nowhere captain tarpals and six other gungan troops riding on kaadus emerge from the brush
jar jar contd heyo dalee captain tarpals
jar jar we comen to see da boss
captian tarpals rolls his eyes
tarpals ouch time binks
ouch time for all n youse
eirtae and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of gungan refugees
at the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive carved heads
boss nass and several other council members walk out on the top of a three quarter submerged head
boss nass jar jar yousa payen dis time
whos da uss en others
queen amidala steps forward
captain panaka and the jedi stand behind her
amidala i am queen amidala of the naboo

boss nass naboo biggen

dya busten uss en omm
yousa all bombad
yousa all dien mesa tink
captain panaka and half a dozen guards and pilots look around nervously and the gungan troops lower their long power poles
the jedi stay relaxed
anakin watches everything with great interest
amidala we wish to form an alliance
suddenly padme steps forward
padme your honor
artoo whistles a quiet uh oh
boss nass whosa dis
padme i am queen amidala points to queen this is my decoy
my loyal bodyguard
anakin is stunned
obi wan and qui gon give each other a knowing look
i am sorry for my deception but under the circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself
although we do not always agree your honor our two great societies have always lived in peace
the trade federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build
you are in hiding my people are in camps
if we do not act quickly all will be lost forever
i ask you to help us
no i beg you to help us
padme drops to her knees and prostrates herself before boss nass
there is a gasp from captain panaka his troops and the handmaidens
padme contd we are your humble servants
our fate is in your hands
slowly captain panaka and his troops bow down before the gungan council
then the handmaidens anakin and finally the jedi
the gungans are puzzled by this
boss nass begins to laugh
boss nass yousa no tinken yousa greater den da gungans
mesa like dis
maybe wesa bein friends
nute rune and darth maul walk with a hologram of darth sidious
weve sent out patrols
weve already located their starship in the swamp
it wont be long my lord
darth sidious this is an unexpected move for her
its too aggresive
lord maul be mindful
darth maul yes my master
darth sidious be patient
let them make the first move
a gungan sentry sits on top of the ancient temple heah searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars
he sees something and yells down to anakin at the foot of the statue
gungan lookout daza comen
anakin all right
anakin yells and runs over to padme and the jedi who are discussing a battle plan with five gungan generals
sabe and eirtae stand nearby
boss nass puts his arm around jar jar
boss nass yousa doen grand
jar jar bringen da naboo together
jar jar oh no no no
boss nass so wesa maken yousa bombad general
jar jar general
jar jars eyes roll back his tongue flops out and he faints
four speeders pull up to the group
captain panaka and a dozen or so and pilot pile out and join the group
padme what is the situation
panaka almost everyones in camps
a few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement
i brought as many of the keaders as i could
the federation armys also much larger than we thought and much stronger
your highness this is a battle i do not think we can win
padme the battle is a diversion
the gungans must draw thedroid army away from the cities
we can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side
once we get to the main entrance captain pnaka will create a diversion so that we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy
without the viceroy they will be lost and confused
qui gon and obi wan look on with interest
padme contd what do you think master jedi
qui gon the viceroy will be well guarded
panaka the difficultys getting into the throne room
once were inside we shouldnt have a problem
qui gon there is a possibility with this diversion many gungans will be killed
boss nass wesa ready to do are sa part
jar jar smiles a very worried and sheepish grin
anakin watches with interest as does artoo
padme we have a plan which should immobilize the droid army
we will send what pilots we have to knock out the droid control ship which is orbiting the planet
if we can get past their rayshields we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless
qui gon a well conceived plan
however theres great risk
the weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship
obi wan and theres an even bigger danger
if the vicroy escapes your highness he will return with another droid army
padme that is why we must not fail to get to the viceroy
everything depends on it
nute rune darth maul oom and a hologram of darth sidious walk through the throne room
she is more foolish than i thought
nute we are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp
it appears to be made up of primitives
we do not expect much resistance
oom i am increasing security at all naboo detention camps
darth maul i feel there is more to this my master
the two jedi may be using the queen for their own purposes
darth sidious the jedi cannot become involved
they can only protect the queen
even qui gon jinn will not break that conenant
this will work to our advantage
nute i have your approval to proceed then my lord
darth sidious proceed
wipe them put
all of them
naboo swamp lake all is peaceful
small critters drink out of a large swamp lake
suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake
a rush of bubbles then a gungan soldier riding a kaadu emerges from the water followed by several others
frogs and other little animals flee in all directions as the gungan army marches through the swamp
the kaadu shake themselves off as they exit the lake
when jar jars kaadu shakes off jar jar falls off
soldiers on huge lizard like fambaas with large shield generators mounted on their backs follow the marching warriors
the gungan army heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills
hundreds of gungan warriors march in lon lines toward the horizon
federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop
in the distance they see the gungan army marching toward them
the gungan general ceel sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt
the gungans are spread out in a large line
jar jar is nervous
general ceel signals to the shield operators
general ceel energize the shields
a red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the back of a second faamba and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled padme
followed by eirtae obi wan qui gon anakin and artoo stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger
they are followed by about twenty naboo guards pilots and troops
they stop and padme uses a small red laser light to signal across the plaza to captain panaka rabe and twenty other assorted naboo troops
they signal back
qui gon leans over to anakin
qui gon once we get inside annie you find a safe placeto hide and stay there
qui gon and stay there
droid troops mill about the tank filled plaza
at the far end of the plaza several droids begin to run and fire
naboo soldiers begin to fire back at the battle droids
as the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza padme and her troops rush into the main hanger
captain panaka and his soldiers continue to engage the droids outside
alarms are sounding a padme the jedi anakin eirtae and padmes troops rush into the hanger
battle droids begin firing at them as they run for cover
anakin runs under a naboo fighter
the jedi deflect bolts aimed at padme back onto the battle droids causing them to explode
nute rune and four council members watch the plaza battle on a large view screen
nute i thought the battle was going to take place far from here
this is too close
rune what is going on
darth maul enters the throne room
darth maul i told you there was more to this
the jedi are involved
the federation tanks begin to fire on the gungans but they are protected by their energy shield
the tanks stop firing and the gungans cheer until they see the doors to the massive transports open and racks of battle droids are pulled out and lined up by
a squad of staps
the battle droids reconfigure into their standing position
the gungans get ready for an attack
oom gives the command to move forward and thousands of droids march toward the gungans
the gungans power up their weapons
the droids slowly march through the protective shield and start firing
the gungans throw their power poles and fling small balls of energy with slingshots
the warriors dump large balls of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the battle droids causing them to short out
the battle rages and the gungans defend their shield generators against the army of droids
oom watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle
anakin hides behind one of the naboo fighters ducking as large bolts whiz past and explode near him
padme and the two jedi destroy battle droids right and left
the queens troops and eirtae also blast away at the droids
padme signals to her pilots
padme get to your ships
the pilots and artoo units run for the naboo fighter craft stacked in the hanger bay
one of the pilots jumps into a fighter right above where anakin is hiding
fighter pilot better find a new hiding place kid
im taking this ship
the ship begins to levitate out of the hanger
battle droids fire at it as it falls in behind five other fighters
artoo whistles to anakin from a second fighter not far away
anakin runs and jumps into the second fighter to hide
two naboo starfighters exit the main hanger
a tank fires at them hitting one of them which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and explode
captain panaka sabe and naboo troops rush into the hanger and overwlm the few remaining battle droids
padme obi wan and qui gon join forces with padme my guess is the viceroy is in the throne room
she looks to qui gon
qui gon i agree
they start to head for the exit on the way passing the fighter where anakin is hiding
artoo whistles a greeting as anakin peeps out of the cockpit
wait for me
qui gon no annie you stay there
stay right where you are
anakni but i
qui gon stay in that cockpit
they head for the exit
as they are about to go through the door suddenly everyone scatters revealing darth maul standing in the doorway
captain panaka padme and her troops back away
qui gon and obi wan step forward
qui gon contd we handle this
the two jedi take off their capes and ignite their laser swords
darth maul takes off his cape and ignites his laser sword
both ends of the sword light up
at the far end of the hanger six wheel droids roll in and transform into their battle position
artoo calls anakins attention to the droids
the jedi begin to fight the sith lord
anakin oh no
the droids begin to advance and start firing on padme and her troops
anakin contd we gotta do something artoo
artoo whistles a reply
suddenly the ships systems go on and the ship begins to levitate
anakin contd all right thanks artoo
ill take over
anakin steers the ship toward the droids
he pushes a button and the ship begins to shake
anakin contd wheres the trigger
oops wrong one
maybe this one
anakin pushes a second button and the lasers begin to fire wiping out several destroyer droids
artoo whistles a cheer
anakin contd yeah all right
the jedi are engaged in a fierce sword fight with darth maul
they have moved into the center of the hanger
while the wheel droids are momentarily distracted by anakin captain panaka padme and her troops exit into a palace hallway
the wheel droids start firing at anakin
there are explosions all around him
anakin contd oops
always on the right
shields always on the right
anakin flips several switches and the after burner ignites
anakin contd i know were moving
ill shut the energy drive down
the fighter rockets out of the hanger
artoo and anakin hold on for dear life
anakin contd oops
anakin contd im not doing anything
anakin contd i know
i didnt push anything
the sith lords moves are incredible
he is fighting the two jedi at once flipping into the air outmaneuvering them at every turn
the naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station
ric olie bravo flight a take on the fighters
flight b make the run on the transmitter
bravo two roger bravo leader
the fleet approaches the space station
many federation fighters exit the hangers and attack
ric olie enemy fighters straight ahead
jar jars clumsiness works for him in the battle
he gets caught up in the wiring of a blasted droid dragging the torso around with him the droids gun firing randomly accidently blasting several droids in one process
oom decides to send in the wheel droids and gives the signal
hundreds of wheel droids roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle
they slowly roll through the deflector shields then transform themselves once they get on the other side
the gungans blast the wheel droids with energy balls
the destroyer droids blast many gungans
a giant dogfight ensues
anakins fighter flies into space above naboo
artoo beeps a worried concern
anakin the autopilot is searching for what other ships
artoo beeps and whistles
anakin contd there is no manual override artoo
youll have to rewire it or something
artoo chirps that hes trying
anakin contd look
there they are
thats where the autopilot is taking us
anakins fighter flies toward the federation battleship
the sith lord drives the jedi out of the hanger and nto the power generator area next door
three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship
the jedi and the sith lord fight their way across the narrow bridge of the theed power generator
darth maul jumps onto the bridge above them
the jedi follow one in front of the sith lord and one behind
they continue their sword fight
padme captain panaka eirtae sabe and thier troops are trapped in a hallway by battle droids
padme we dont have time for this captain
panaka lets try the outside stairway
captain panaka blasts a hole in the window and they make their way outside the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall
sabe eirtae and about twenty naboo soldiers stay in the hallway to hold off the padme captain panaka and about ten other naboo soldiers are lined up along the edge
they have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and fire at a ledge about four stories above them
thin cables shoot out of the pistols and are embedded into the ledge
padme captain panaka and the others begin to climb up the wall
the gungan army is no match for the destroyer droids
jar jar tries to run from the battle droids
general ceel retreat
the gungans begin to turn and run on foot on their kaadu and in wagons
jar jar attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to unhitch the back gate causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill
jar jar scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the balls
four destroyer droids arent so lucky
they get blasted by the energy balls
the gungans renew their attack on the droid army
jar jars bumbling destroys several more destroyer droids
anakin finds himself in the middle of the space battle
a ship explodes behind him over his left shoulder
anakin whoo boy
this is tense
he looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on
anakn contd oops
artoo get us off autopilot
artoo screams a reply
anakin contd ive got control

artoo sees droids appraoching and beeps frantically
the laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power pit
darth maul kicks obi wan off one of the ramps and he falls several levels
qui gon knocks the dark lord off another ramp and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below
qui gon jumps down after him
the dark lord backs away along the catwalk into a small door
qui gon follows as obi wan runs to catch up
the sith lord followed by qui gon enters a long hallway filled with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down
the corridor every minute or so
darth maul makes it down several walls of deadly rays before they close
qui gon is one wall away from the dark lord
obi wan is just starting into it and is five walls way from the jedi must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor
obi wan is impatient and paces waiting for the wall of rays to open
qui gon sits and meditates
the sith lord tries to patch up his wounds
a window in the hallway blasts apart
padme captain panaka and her soldiers climb into the hallway
they head for the door to the throne roo
suddenly two destroyer droids skitter in front of the door
padme turns around and sees two more appear at the far end of the hallway trapping them in the middle
padme throws down her pistol and turns to captain panaka
padme throw down your weapons
they win this round
panaka but we cant
padme captain i said throw down your weapons
captain panaka and his men throw down their weapons
a destroyer droid blasts one of the shield generators causing it to explode
the protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart
oom sees the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward
the gungan general signals a retreat as the tanks enter the battle
the gungans flee as fast as they can
jar jar is blown off his kaadu and lands on one of the tank guns
a gungan warrior signals jar jar to jump off
jar jar is afraid
the gun swings around trying to knock jar jar off
jar jar hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along
finally he jumps onto a kaadu behind a gungan warrior
explosions from the tank fire are everywhere
it is chaos
the electric rays cycle as qui gon sits meditating
the wall of the deadly rays turn away and obi wan starts running toward qui gon and the dark lord
when the wall between qui gon and darth maul opens qui gon is in a split second fighting the dark lord with a ferocity not seen before
they move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole
the electron ray gates begin to close
obi wan tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short
he slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field
qui gon and darth maul battle around the melting pit as a frustrated obi wan watches
darth maul cathces qui gon off guard
the sith makes a quick move bashes his lightsaber handle into qui gons chin and runs him through
qui gon slumps to the floor in a heap
the gungans have beeb overrun
some flee into the hills chased by battle droids on staps
many others are herded into groups by battle droids and jar jar and general ceel are held in a small group with other officers
jar jar dissa bad berry bombad
general ceel mesa hopen dissa working for da queen
padme captain panaka and six other officers are brought by ten battle droids before nute and rune and four neimoidian council members
nute your little insurrection is at an end your highness

and end this pointless debate in the senate
sadbe dressed like the queen appears in the doorway with several troops
several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance
sabe i will not be signing any treaty viceroy because youve lost
nute and the others are stunned to see a second queen
nute yells at the ten guards in the room
nute after her
this one is a decoy
six of the droids rush out of the throne room after sabe
nute turns to nute contd your queen will not get away with this
padme slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that opens a panel in her desk opposite captain panaka
padme grabs two pistols tosses one of the to captain panaka and one to an officer
she takes a third pistol and blasts the last of the battle droids
the officers rush to the door control panel as padme hits the switch to close the door
the officer at the door jams the controls
captain panaka throws more pistols to the other guards
the neimodians are confused and afraid
padme now viceroy this is the end of your occupation here
nute dont be absurd
there are too few of you
it wont be long before hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us
obi wan screams as the pulsing electron gate opens and the sith lord attacks him
the dark lord is relentless in his assault on the young jedi
obi wan and darth maul use the force to fling objects at each other as they fight
darth maul seems to have the upper hand as obi wan grows weary
darth maul catches obi wan off guard and the jedi slips into a melting pit
he is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit
darth maul grin evilly at obi wan as he kicks obi wans lightsaber down the endless shaft
the sith lord smiles as he goes in for the kill
at the last moment obi wan jumps up out of the pit calls qui gons lightsaber to hi throwing darth maul off
the young jedi swings with a vengeance cutting the sith down
darth maul falls into the melting pit to his death
obi wan rushes over to qui gon who is dying
obi wan master
qui gon it is too late
obi wan no
qui gon obi wan promise

obi wan yes master
qui gon he is the chosen one

obi wan cradles his master quietly weeping
anakin peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see battle droids surrounding the ship
he ducks back down
anakin uh oh

he looks at the dashboard to see red lights
anakin contd the systems are still overheated artoo
the battle droid captain walks up to the ship and sees artoo

he flips the switch and the engine starts
battle droid captain seeing anakin you

anakin not if i can help it
anakin flips a switch and the ship levitates knocking over the battle droid captain
the other droids shoot but the lasers are deflected by anakins shields
anakin contd this should stop them
anakin fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate
and take this
he presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the droids
anakin contd darn
the two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room
anakin contd lets get out of here
anakins ship roars through the hanger deck bouncing over the droids
