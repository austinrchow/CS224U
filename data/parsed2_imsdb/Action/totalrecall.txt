screen story and screenplay by ronald shusett and dan obannon fifth revision by ronald shusett and steven pressfield all we can see filling the entire frame is a flame orange
almost like the sky from the burning of atlanta in gone with the wind
superimpose presenter credit
pan down lower and lower until we see the terrain below
there is no vegetation whatever just sand and odd shaped rock formations
the air is filled with red dust which alternately obscures and then reveals the image
camera moves forward optically enlarging the film grain in the process
another shot of a barren landscape once more with bizarre rocks
sound of wind
camera moves forward again
another landscape but this time in the distance are some enormous plastic domes
sunlight striking them and reflect ing causes brilliant rainbows
camera optically tracks toward the dome seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust
another angle and in the distance on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge sphinx like structure
it is reminiscent of the egyptian sphinx but both body and face though gargoyle like are different in design
there are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx
camera moves optically forward
camera is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front
it moves combination of zoom and optical printer move towards the eyes which appear to be red gems
as camera approaches one of the eyes it appears to be stained red glass as in a temple
suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera
a man wearing a lightweight thermal suit is running through this labyrinth of tunnels
the ground trembles under him as if in an earthquake
we cannot clearly make out his face especially since he wears some kind of breathing apparatus over a portion of it
the surface of the tunnels walls is curious the walls are again bright reddish orange and a composite of two different substances rough textured clay like material and red quartz
which glistens like crystal
the man throws a backward glance over his shoulder fear fully as he runs
his hands are splattered with blood
because of this the red glow the air of fear to the man and the ground heaving and buckling there is almost a satanic suggestion to the scene
suddenly up ahead of the man there appears a brilliant white light
he sees it and runs even faster towards it
we are almost up to the light and we see hands reaching out of the light towards us
that seem to beckon him to abruptly the entire screen goes red but in reverse negative with yellow layovers
so that all the images we see entire frame are small yellow areas diffused on a red background
it is much like looking at a tableau made out of molten lava
douglas quail and his wife kristen are asleep in bed
gradually the room lights brighten
the clock chimes and begins speaking in a soft feminine voice
sweetly tick tock seven oclock
time to rise and open your eyes
they dont budge
shortly the clock chimes again
continuing tick tock seven oh one
time to get up the day had begun
quails wife stirs
maddeningly the clock chimes a third time
continuing tick tock quail reaches out and shuts the clock off
then he sits up in bed
he swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the edge of the bed
he puts on his glasses and sits lost in thought
he is a good looking but conventional man in his early thirties
he seems rather in awe of his wife who is attractive and rather off hand towards him
kirsten pulls on her robe lights a cigarette sits fishing for her slippers
i dreamed about mars again
it was bizarre yet is was so real
casual its your time of the month again
quail looks at her quizzically
continuing world weary air at least once a month
douglas quails obsession
for twelve years youve been talking about mars
people do go to mars you know
thats right douglas
but not you
quail looks crestfallen
continuing disdainful as it is we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week
she leaves the room
he meditates on what she said depressed
quail and kirsten sit at a small table eating breakfast
on the wall is projected the front page of a newspaper
drinking his coffee quail studies the wall with the air of a man who had his node stuck in a newspaper ignoring his wife
the newspaper headline reads rioting on mars over water his wife is reading a different article four women rape man in park
mumbling what do they expect
the way men dress these days
then they scream rape
quail is absorbed in his own paper and doesnt hear her
you know lets really do it
rape men in the park
go to mars
withering go to hell
we can pool our savings and ive got some sick leave coming besides my regular vacation
interrupting corrects herself more of a half wit
for a start a war could break out there any day
she gestures toward the tv screen where martian police are keeping protesters behind a barrier
some have signs reading a free mars down with cohaagen earth out etc
thats just media talk
indicating the protesters just a minority
well theres a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to mars
im just a slave around this dump
now if you were capable of finding a better job
the kitchen clock chimes and talks
its now eight
youll be late
ill be late
he jumps up quickly from the table picks up his coat and briefcase kisses kirstens perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves
camera tracks with quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station
modern cars out of focus pass noiselessly between the camera and quail
there is a plaintive tune being played on violin
quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist then walks on briskly
quail enters the station
everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms
two armed guards stand at either side as commuters pass through an electronic beam
on a screen the entire body of each person is seen in x ray
all of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket
no weapon again mr
i keep forgetting herb
they frighten me
well its the law mr
has been since they tell me
tomorrow ya carry ya gun or ya get reported
guard gestures to his associate
theyve obviously been through this with quail before
quail walks on to the track area
the train arrives
signs above each approaching car say car full room for persons etc
quail goes to a carriage marked the doors open and the crowd surges on
quail grabs a seat
at intervals throughout the car are video monitors on which a news broadcast is showing
more violence today from marss strike torn ore colonies everyone ignores the broadcast except quail who perks instantly at the word mars
the newscaster is a young black man
continuing but earth intelligence operations director vilos cohaagen clearly worried about the damage to marss all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups
tv scene switches to a press conference
cohaagen sur rounded by aides steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras
cohaagen is a striking intense man with an obvious air of power
were dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics
mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of earth
and will remain so
the train stops at another station and more people pile on
quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image
there have been some criticisms sir
i have no further comment
the news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen
quail continues to watch though not as interested initially as he was by the mars story
few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen
good morning commuters
this portion of your trip is brought to you by rekall inc
do you have a dream that never came true
do you aspire but only perspire
has the great adventure passed you by
then come to
rekall where what might have been will have been
for the memories of a lifetime
quail watches the commercial through to the end but doesnt seem to take it very seriously
he glances away as a card comes on the screen with rekalls numbers
quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room
numerous people are typing information onto the screens
quail pauses in his typing thoughtful
he then types in a little more information then pauses again
on the screen a sentence types itself
quail read it and continues
mcclanes office rekall day scene opens on a cu of mcclane a genial bubbling enthus iastic man
mcclane were all dreamers douglas
but here at rekall dreams are our business
he presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated appear to be in outer space
countless stars glitter all around
startlingly a comet whizzes by
quail is amazed
mcclane grins and presses the button again
the scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral reef
multi colored fish swim around the chairs and desk
is the process really that effective
a false memory
mcclane shaking his head smiling we prefer the term extra factual implant
your memory will be complete in every way
you will have gone to mars
we guarantee that
is it in any way dangerous
i mean the medical techniques
mcclane not when you deal with qualified operators like us
he presses the button again and the normal office returns
quail looks around impressed
its just incredible
mcclane and look at our follow up program
he puts items on the desk as he talks
mcclane continuing space flight ticket stub
matchbooks from martian nouvelle cuisine restaurants souvenirs post cards
even names of people you met now back there who you can call and discuss your trip with
by the way we plant these things where youll come across them at random in the future
ill know i hired you
thatll destroy the whole illusion
mcclane smiling self satisfied but you wont remember me or having been here
mcclane your money back if you do
weve never paid out yet
quail slumps backs in his chair overwhelmed
mcclane continuing and we have a special this month for only two hundred thousand dollars more
at the press of a button a list appears on the wall
mcclane continuing you can have a new identity for the duration of the trip
quails eyes linger on intelligence agent
wouldnt that be dangerous
i might attack
mcclane airily no
youre a retired agent
mars was your last mission and youre never to break your cover
but youll have got the girl killed the baddies and saved the universe
not bad eh
i dont know
about the whole thing
its all such a fake
i wont really have gone
i wont really
mcclane kind but firm lets face it douglas you and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to mars and youd never qualify as a secret
agent for eio
this rekall is the only way to achieve your dream
he gets up and walks around to quails chair
mcclane continuing think about it douglas
think too what a terrible boor a real holiday is
lost tickets endless arguments lousy hotels missed connections rotten weather
rekall will supply you with perfect happy memories
quail is thoughtful willing to be totally convinced
quail is sitting distracted in an uncomfortable modern chair
kirsten is watching a near pornographic film on tv
she casually lights a cigarette
you know thats illegal
whos going to report me
she watches a torrid love scene on the video
continuing screwing arounds illegal too
but just give me half a chance
quail looks at her with distaste
his expression changes to one of resolve
quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch alongside some strange looking lab equipment wearing a hospital type smock
in the b
hovers a technician adjusting some instrumentation discreet banks of computers etc
that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to quail
the room in a dim soothing booth lit by indirect lighting
quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him as one always does at the dentists looking at the drills
the door opens abruptly in walks a cute looking little old lady wearing a jogging suit
a ruth gordon type
hi im doctor sophie lull
sorry im late
walks toward coat closet ill be right with you
she dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging suit then slings on heavy lead lined protective vest
looking at instrument console this really going to work
it the pope martian
lulls assistant the technician in b
who had been steadily working on the instrumentation now looks over at lull
at machine okay thats it
now lull extends a long rubber tube a hypodermic needle attached to it
quail eyes it warily
she swabs the back of his hand in preparation notices his apprehension
now just relax kid
this aint gonna hurt
just a controlled drip of narkadine
when youre under ill just ask ya a few questions nothin real personal just full details of yer private life sos we can tailor the wish fulfillment program to your
she injects the needle into his hand as she speaks tapes it down
i didnt feel a thing
hey youre a nice kid
you like a little somethin extra
quail embarrassed starting to go under nods
continuing pleased good
kid have i got a girl for you
shes gonna like you
youre good lookin
beat gettin sleepy
he nods good
now whats the first thing you think of when youre thinkin about mars
id like to see the martian sphinx
okay you will dougle
i want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me
sleepily one hundred
his voice drops off his eyes close
lull studies him adjusts some instruments then turns to ernie glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her
okay ernie the trip to mars number sixty two
and throw in that blonde
well give him a real good time
he takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine
boy is this one wild
he wont want to come back
ernie inserts the second disk
this sophie lull
can ya hear me
im gonna ask ya a few more questions now
ya think youll be able to answer em
to begin with i wanna ask ya you sex life
how many orgasms a week
mcclanes office day mcclane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse objects and placing them on his desk
these items apparently are objects rekall inc
intends to plant for some client of theirs to find perhaps even quail as part of his fantasy
while he is putting these things on his desk the phone buzzes
he answers it
filtered tense howie
listen youd better get in here
mcclane not too concerned not another schizoid embolism
filtered youd better get in here
mcclane come quickly in brushing the swinging door open
lull and ernie look up as he enters
quail lies on the couch breathing slowly and regularly his eyes closed
mcclane looks queryingly at lull who motions him to silence
bends over quail quail
dougie can you hear me
tell mcclane what you told us
mcclane glances sharply at lull then turns to quail
quails eyes open and scan the room
they settle on mcclane
these eyes have changed they have become cold and steely
in fact quails entire personality seems to have changed his face has acquired a flint edged hardness
he is chillingly menacing
a deadly voice all of you in this room are dead
mcclane not quite taking it seriously whats he talking about
youve broken my cover
mcclane what is this
mcclanes eyes flash angrily at lull
the narkadine cracked a memory cap
mars shes scared hes really been there
there is a chilly silence in the room as mcclane digests this
mcclane forced suppression
with spontaneous breakthrough
mcclane holy shit
they stare at quail as if hes a ticking bomb
coldly youve compromised the sphinx project
youll have to be silenced
now theyre all panicked
mcclane wait a minute
quail my name isnt quail
whoever you are
almost pleading this is all an accident
well destroy all the records
no one will know
i swear it
i believe you but that wont stop e
from killing you
the rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror
continuing killing you
his voice trails off his eyes close
intensely he wants a false memory implanted of a trip he really took
pause someone at earth intelligence operations erased his memory
all he know was going to mars meant something special to him
what do we do
graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing
shaking her head uh uh
that could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip
mcclane overlapping revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here
why dont we just wipe out the memory of his visit here
mcclane nodding relieved yes
ill destroy his file and cancel his fee
i have a feeling that the longer he doesnt know who he is where hes been where hes going and who we are the better off well all be
im taking a holiday
a real one
the others stare after him looking very grim
a dazed and disoriented douglas quail comes out of an inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit door
an attractive receptionist her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse watches him she then looks toward mcclane who has half opened the door to view quails progress
quail travels down
uncomprehendingly he looks out at the city
quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer oblivious to anything around him
a red headed man may or may not be watching him
he makes a phone call from a pocket phone
scene open on quail in the back of the cab he looks around slowly coming to his senses
where am i
travelling south along third avenue passing fourty third street
although the drivers voice is a little mechanical flat in tone he is filmed from quails pov and it isnt obvious he is anything other than an ordinary cab driver
where am i going
thirty three thirteen g street sector l twin towers apartment six thirty five
how did i get here
camera now cuts to a shot in front of the driver
he is a fairly human like robot
i don not understand the question sir or madam
how did i get into this cab
you stepped into it in the normal manner sir or madam
the reception area and hallway leading to the elevators is smart and clean though not lavish
a uniformed and armed doorman is standing by the entrance door
filmed from the elevator end of the area we see the cab pull up and quail alight and enter the building
he nods to the doorman and approaches the elevators
as he reaches them a man steps out from behind the camera
a nd man enters from a door opposite the elevators
quail looks at them and becomes quite panicky
arent you the man from mars
he takes a modern lethal gun from his pocket
quail turns but the other man is behind him
dont give us a reason to kill you
quail looks toward the doorman who is paying little attention to the events
as the two men edge quail towards the door he call out
but the doorman turns calmly away
the two men lead quail past a number of cars to their own vehicle
where are you taking me
you told everyone at rekall about you trip to mars
where you went who you worked for what you did but i didnt
are you telling me
i did go to mars
i dont remember
youve remembered too much
the sphinx project for a start
confused remembers only fragments sphinx
no no i dont i
what about the people at rekall
i dont recall rekall but you said if they know what i did
why dont you ask them
theyll tell you i didnt
theyve been taken care of
what do you mean
neither man bothers answering
they arrive at their car and open the door for quail
continuing what are you going to do with me
get in the car
he slaps quail hard across the face
quail is terrified
he is tearful with fear
youre going to kill me
his hands across his face
no ones going to kill you if you do what youre told
were visiting e
for some new tests
now get in or do we start playing rough
its not my fault
you cant do it
they start to force him into the car physically
suddenly quail stops cringing
the fear disappears from his face and is replaced by an odd thoughtful expression
continuing wait a minute i remember what quail
what do you remember
they tried to kill me
in an instant he karate chops both agents across the windpipe and they crumple to the ground
quail steps back
he stares at the two bodies incredulous then stares at his own deadly hands
it is as though they belong to someone else
then leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley he races back into the basement door of his building
kirsten is watching another pornographic video when quail bursts in
he is still disoriented
did you know ive been to mars
kirsten gets up and turns off the movie
this stupid obsess
interrupting i think ive been
i vaguely recall
doug youve got to forget
remembering is the problem i mustve been to one of those artificial memory places
oh my god
but something went wrong
something about a real memory
and then those men
tried to kill me
doug youre crazy
she starts to mix a drink from a well stocked cabinet
continuing youre here now
they didnt kill you
thats whats so amazing
i killed them
kirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply
where are they
quail points down with his finger
its something they put into your mind at the memory place
thats their business
she sips her drink
continuing youre a computer operator
youre a bore
youre a wimp
youre not a killer
im involved somehow with e
its no fantasy
he walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting out the lights
doug i want you to see a doctor
now alec and shirley turnbull have a good man
he helped alec through his breakdown
for fucks sake this is no breakdown
kirsten is taken aback at his use of language
he strides into the bathroom and slams the door
she turns on one lamp goes to a telephone and dials
quail takes a washcloth turns the hot water up full and soaks the cloth under the steaming water
using it as a compress he presses it against his face and his neck to drain off some of the tension
he turns off the water
towelling his head dry he opens the bathroom door
the instant he does this a blinding white burst of light comes arcing into the bathroom and the back wall crinkles and chars into a swatch of blackness
quail dives out the door just as another bolt incinerates the spot where he was standing
the room is in total darkness
the only thing visible is the pale rectangle of the balcony window with the curtains drawn over it
quail and his assailant cannot be seen but they can be heard
there is the sound of a scuffle the meaty thud of a fist connecting with flesh and a painful grunt as someones breath whooshes out
the light comes on
quail is standing with one hand on the lamp and the other twisting kirstens arm up behind her back
a pistol lies on the floor
quail is totally stunned
he releases her arm shoving her away from him at the same time scooping up the pistol
did you say i need a psychiatrist
coolly i havent seen you move that fast since ive known you
outraged how could you do it
after eight years
im not your wife quail
not my wife
you are out of your mind
indifferent nursing her arm its a false memory implant
i never saw you before six weeks ago
quail is totally disoriented
why are you lying like this
you work for e
so do i
as she speaks she walks to a picture on the wall and from behind it pulls out a small wallet
she flips it open to show him her e
he looks down uncomprehendingly at the holographic lettering earth intelligence organisation
indicating their surroundings but why all of this
shrugging we had to watchdog you
make sure the erasure took
a wife seemed like a good idea
but i remember it
all of it
the jobs real youve had is six weeks since you got back from mars
he sits down holds his hand to his head
continuing its all a fabrication quail
everything you know
this is crazy
if all my memories are false who am i
what am i
its like i dont exist
you exist all right
very cold thats the problem
a pause as quail mentally gropes frantically for what to do next
why did you try to kill me
why does e
want me dead
they dont particularly
that was my idea
this assignment was boring me to death
the personality they gave you wasnt too thrilling
well what did i do on mars that they have to keep me from telling
ive no idea
i just work here
dont try and follow me i dont have to follow you
you cant get away from e
quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time
no wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife type casting
kirsten smiles secretively
she goes to a drawer opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks like a tv channel changer
there is a very small light on the instrument which begins flashing on and off as the instrument begins to make beeping sounds
quail walks briskly out onto the street controlling his paces trying not to look suspicious
after a beat he heads for the nearest subway entrance
now underground quail tries to blend in with the other subway people
he heads toward the weapons check
an official vehicle slams to a halt next to the subway entrance and a whole load of intense men pours out of it
quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting to get through the weapons check
he tries to control his nervousness
the guard smiles at him pleased to see he has remembered his gun
all the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway stairs
the subway cops and weapons check are stunned to see four large men brandishing guns push their way through the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them
one gunman flashes a holographic badge encased in plastic at them
the gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer to the subway train which is just departing
the men halt abruptly
the second gunman adjusts a small plug a radio receiver in his ear
we wont be able to track him again until he comes up above ground
quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the night not knowing exactly where he will go
he is confused distraught
a commercial comes onto the video
need a vacation
dont settle for memories experience the real thing
daily departures on the space shuttle to mars
visit the wonders of
quail emerges from underground and looks around
the streets are almost deserted
the gunmen sit in the ov
the one with the ear plug suddenly talks
coming in again
loud and clear
he looks down at an illuminated street map built into the cars dashboard
a cab comes into view
quail quickly hails it and jumps in
cab moves off
quail is still pondering what to do next
he glances out one window though not at anything in particular
suddenly the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window on the other side
quail ducks to the floor
a wide shot shows that the cab is being fired on by a man leaning from the window of an official patrol vehicle
he is aiming at the tires and driver rather than directly at quail
bullets are still pouring in
unemotionally you are being fired on sir or madam please leave the cab at once
from the floor quail pushes the door handle and rolls out onto the street
the pursuing car occupants fail to notice his exit
cars continue as quail picks himself up from the gutter and moves off down a narrow side street
bullets rip into the robot drivers neck severing the head from the body
the head hits the window then bounces back onto the front seat
it continues talking
continuing leave the cab as bullets are hitting the vehicle in considerable quantities
the taxi mounts the footpath and smashes through the display window of a store
clothes models are scattered and broken
when the noise abates the severed head of the robot driver is lying among the dummies
this company sir or madam will institute legal action for damages
quail emerges from the side street and sees end of the line hotel
it is clean bland middle class
he quickly crosses the road and enters
the foyer is brightly lit and empty
quail approaches the desk clerk who is reading a book
no marked in flowing script from the classic series
without looking up help you sir
handing over money a room for the night
reluctantly putting down the book handing over money heres ten thousand
forget the id
desk clerk looks up at him with interest
his hand hovers over the money
continuing i have a liaison with a lady
and im married
i understand sir
nothing like a bit on the side eh
bit of fugitive flesh
the greatest aphrodisiac is a new body wouldnt you say sir
quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to be given the key to his room
he says nothing
quail unlocks the door and enters
no sooner does he relock the door then the phone rings
he freezes stares at it for three rings then picks it up
into receiver i told you i dont want to be disturbed
filtered if you want to live dont hand up
quail is stunned
he says nothing but doesnt hang up
continuing filtered theyve got you bugged
theyre gonna find you
faster than you can say back rodgers
quickly and dont bother shaking down your clothes the monitor is embedded in your skull
reeling who are you
what the hell is this
the man telephoning quail is calling from a bar
occasion ally people pass him on their way to the toilets
he is youngish and conservatively dressed
he speaks rapidly and urgently
take a wet towel and wrap it around your head
that will deaden the signal
itll take longer for them to pinpoint you
why should i trust you
filtered theres a real old saying beggars cant be choosers
go and soak your head
quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom
the earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal generated by quails bug
suddenly the small illuminated cross on the dashboard map cuts out
cut the language will ya
unscientifically he prod the screen
world weary air toldya the martian assembled stuff dont work
quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel turban like wrapped around his head
he rapidly picks up the phone
filtered head over to skid row to the lucky stub pawnshop corner of park avenue and fifty eighth
tell the man youre mr
hotchkiss you came for your grecian candlesticks
infuriated what do i want with grecian candlesticks
the man on the phone looks around anxiously
just do it
this is no time for small talk
filtered not quite convinced how did you know where to find me
ive been tailing you since you get back from mars
youre on the other team
filtered im e
but i was your best friend
scott stevens we arranged this
trying to recall i cant remember only bits
filtered overlapping i was your fail safe if and when the shooting started
look me up if you remember me
scott stevens hangs up the phone
he looks around cautiously then walks a few steps to the mens room
scott stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to urinate
the room is empty
he hears a noise and looks around
two eio men are standing there aiming lethal looking high velocity weapons at him
one of them is the red headed man weve already seen
well look at that
hes really got his hands full
not so full so ive heard
still urinating the frustrated scott stevens can only look back over his shoulder
laughing both men open fire riddling him with bullets
he collapses in an undignified heap his head in the water at the base of the trough
quail with towel around his head glances up and down the corridor spots a sign that says fire exit
he races towards it
the ov slams up in front of the hotel and a carload of men tear out of it and barge into the hotel
the startled clerk jumps to his feet as the group of armed men enter rapidly
the guy who checked in fifteen minutes ago
most of the armed men instantly head off up the stairs their weapons at the ready
clerk watches astonished
continuing he was only meeting a lady
arent you guys overdoing it a bit
quail is walking along briskly still with the towel around his head
a few passers by look at him curiously
he puts his hand together and greets them indian style
which reads park avenue th street
pull back to reveal the lucky stub pawnshop
winos lurk on the corner
park avenue has deteriorated into a slum
quail enters frame and approaching the pawnshop stepping over a bum in a doorway
quail is just entering an old fashioned bell overhead tripped by the door opening announces his entrance
at once an immense fat man emerges from the back room
you wanta camera
i got some good top quality ones
you want silk rugs
handmade last century in iran
you want videos
all those vietnam war ones
real quaint stuff
interrupting awkwardly im hotchkiss
i came for the
the fat man studies him warily for a long moment then he disappears through the curtain
in a brief moment he emerges again carrying a small makeup sized case as well as two large candelabra
the pawnbroker puts the case on the counter
quail looks at the case with curiosity
continuing i wonder if you could tell me
they both look around as someone enters
i trust these will look well in you
opening up the small case
pull back to reveal they are quails hands
the hotel room hes now in is obviously a different one than the last one we saw him in
the room is large but run down the walls are peeling the architecture is much older etc
quail examines the contents of the case there are credit cards and also money several stacks of bills neatly tied some of it the conventional green but most of it
on the face of it is printed mars federal colony
mutters martian money
quail thumbs through the money and whistles softly to himself as he sees how much there is
also in the case are two passports a small cassette recorder a rolled up leather pouch and a spray can of some sort and a strange thing that looks like
a silver mask
he examines the face mask studies black letters written across it which we are not close enough to read and then puts it aside
another item now catches his eye a wristwatch
he sees a conspicuous red button on the side of the watch and presses it
instantly to his quail hes an exact holographic duplicate of quail down to the clothes quail is wearing now
the image stands and watches quail
continuing what the hell
quail smiles presses the red button again
there is a humming sound and the man fades into thin air like a television set being turned off
quail looks bemused
now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside
there he finds what look like surgical instruments a sponge a long piece of wire doubled over with some attachments and a tiny metal head on one end and some
tubes of salve
he turns on the cassette recorder
the voice he hears on the cassette tape is his own
quails voice hauser this is hauser or whatever you think your name is now
if youre listening to this im talking to myself
your memorys been erased and youve got a wet towel around your head
he does the first thing youve got to do is get rid of that bug in your head
the sound of the tape continues as quail follows instructions pushing the wire up into a bloody portion of his neck just below the ear
the monitoring device is located in your left maxillary sinus cavity
make a small incision in your neck just below the left ear and insert the wire up into the sinus
the head is self guiding
quail makes a face
continuing you wont feel a thing
the spray cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant
careful its my neck too
holding the wet towel against his neck quail slowly withdraws the wire
on the end of it is a tiny metal bead the transmitter
the man with the ear plug suddenly reacts
its come on again
the st man quickly check the map grid in the dashboard
a small bright x is flashing
hes in that old flophouse
central park south
quail is anxious to get rid of the transmitter
he looks around and notices a rat trap near a rat hole in the skirting board
he carefully avoiding springing the trap removes the piece of cheese and pushes the transmitter inside
he then throws the cheese into the rat hole
the car is moving swiftly through the streets
boy hes really moving around
a cu of the screen shows the small x moving in circles
the car pulls up
another follows it
armed men leap out from both
the earplug wearer indicates they should go down an alley at the side of a service door
they advance cautiously guns at the ready
they see no one
the earplug wearer indicates another even narrower alley leading off to one side
two of the men sneak cautiously up to it their guns at the ready
a large rat scurries out from behind overfull garbage bins
furious they fire
the bullets rip the bins to shreds scattering refuse everywhere
the rat is killed
they all stare in disbelief
ya dirty rat
opening close on a monitor screen slated hauser quail followed by a serial number and some dates
the slate vanishes replaced by a scene of quail undergoing some kind of military training
pan to other monitors all depicting quail in other action scenes on some kind of mission driving a car etc
technicians man the monitors scrolling through them in fast forward and fast reverse as if searching files
the technicians turn as cohaagen and his aides enter
were running every one of his memory tapes for the past fifteen years
nothing yet sir
there must be something some place he would go some friend he would run to
the red haired e
man joins them
to cohaagen quietly they lost him
the red headed man nods
continuing are you sure the original suppression took
he thinks hes quail a computer
interrupting then how do you explain what hes doing
just his instincts
he was well trained by e
maybe the memory caps fractured
portions of his prior identity could be leaking through
very anxious hell remember mars
the sphinx project
nothing he could piece together
i did advise terminating him rather than implanting an identify alternative
what do you think i am
were not living in the twentieth century
he looks at the video screen again
an image has flashed onto it of an attractive eurasian girl
continuing hold it there
he studies the picture which changes to show the same girl from different angles
passengers are boarding a commercial spacecraft
in addition to the stewardesses checking their tickets there are two plainclothes men checking every passenger
they carry some kind of small portable electronic device that they shine in the face of each passenger going through
it gives off a blue beam and hums
the passengers are a diverse group businessmen officials government people etc
there is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle aged and determinedly jolly crowd many of them carrying duty free bags
they are being marshaled by an harassed tour organizer who is carrying aloft a hand painted sign
martian tour group
the last of the passengers board the spacecraft
the chief plainclothes man nods to an official and the door begins to close
if he had to travel to mars with that bunch id be sorry for him
we couldnt have missed him
lets get a coffee before the next shuttle
one of the passengers a middle aged woman unbuckles her seat belt and heads for the restroom carrying her handbag and some clothes on a hanger
the woman locks the door and turns to the mirror
she opens her bag takes out a spray container sprays her face with it and takes out the silver face mask we saw in quails emergency kit
she holds the mask to her face
there is a sizzling noise and smoke rises from behind the mask
she lowers the mask
her face is now that of quail
he tears up a passport and drops it down a chute
he reaches inside his dress starts to remove his falsies
we can read the black lettering written across it now quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour crowd
he turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video theater advertising rocky with sylvester stallone iii jnr
he isnt too excited but heads towards it
he pauses a little when an announcement comes over the intercom
a little bell sounds followed by intercom static
quail looks up
ladies and gentlemen if youll glance out the starboard viewports youll behold an indeed awesome sight quail goes to a viewport and peers transfixed
he is seeing
the object of his obsession
the spaceliner which we have deliberately not seen before this moment for dramatic effect banks and turns suddenly bringing into view mars
an immense orange globe so close it looks like its going to fall on us
it dwarfs the spaceliner
those long gorges you see clearly are the legendary canals of mars
the liner drops toward the surface of mars
below a network of intersecting lines crisscross the planet
continuing of course they are not manmade canals but vast natural chasms many deeper and larger than the grand canyon
though utterly without moisture now scientists have determined that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago
quail stares his brow furrowing as if with some deep hidden memory he cant quite recall
continuing surface temperatures at the martian equator is minus one hundred and twenty degrees centigrade in winter
fortunately this time of year its slightly more seasonable sixty degrees fahrenheit outside the domes
beat please remember folks that outside the domes youll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply at all times
the atmosphere of mars is almost a vacuum
thank you for flying with interstellar and we hope your stay will be a pleasant one
camera follows the spaceliner until the entire frame is filled with the red orange sands of mars
an endless expanse of boulder studded red sand under a red orange sky
the desert is cut by a road which snakes across the rocky terrain
some surface traffic moves along the road all pressurized vehicles since the atmosphere of mars is almost a pure vacuum including the in the midst of the stark trackless landscape
its midday scorching rises a huge weatherbeaten geodesic structure its glass surface scarred by sandstorm damage
its feeling is like an old western when clint eastwood rides into tombstone the raw forbidding vistas with a tough town carved out of the wilderness
quail is looking out at the desolate landscape
the tour organiser an amiable middle aged man sits beside him
it is possible he is not a married man
its no garden of eden
quite a bit to see though
the canyons the old sphinx
what do you know about that
not much really
millions of years old
bit like the one that used to be in egypt you know
got destroyed in the arab wars
what about this independence movement
dismissive not worth worrying about
mostly descendants of the original colonists from earth
now they want self rule so they can sell us all the minerals
i dont think weve met
you with our group
takes me a while to know everyone
they shake hands well doug i hope well see a lot more of each other
the bus pulls up outside a modern tourist hotel
the buildings surrounding it have a much more improvised temporary look
most are pre fabricated structures
the streets are crowded and there is a frontier town atmosphere
stalls sell fruit and vegetables also water and air containers
a lot of greenery is evident this is to absorb co and emit oxygen thus helping with the air supply under the dome
some small ragged boys look at quail as he looks around before going inside the hotel
suddenly one of them throws a small sack at him
it hits his chest and leaves a yellow stain
the hotel doorman chases the boys away
from the other side of the street a gang of urchins with a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant patriotic you know how it is sir
some of these red asses are a bit prejudiced
the street song has swelled adult miners and citizens joining the belligerent chorus
what are they singing
the martian national anthem
quail tips the doorman enter the hotel
quail passes several kiosks a magazine stand currency exchange clothing store shoeshine stand
a shoeshine boy looks up at quail
quail walks past enters the main lobby
the atrium entryway is absolutely fabulous a complete contrast to the dirty casbah like streets
affluent looking people in spotless linen fill the lobby
quail stops to examine a large rotating display sitting on a table in the middle of the lobby
it is a stand up model of a sphinx
across the top is written the first wonder of mars
a recorded voice repeats a canned speech
the martian sphinx
only evidence of non human civilization ever discovered age estimated at over eighteen million years
he stares at quail
quail approaches the registration desk
nice to have you back with us mr
quail is startled to be recognized particularly by this name
he tries to stay casual
nice to be back
pick up pen im flattered you remember me
part of my job sir
starts to sign hesitates do you remember my first name too
charles hauser right
now he signs listen
i need transportation to the
can you arrange it for me
im sorry sir
but earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely
no one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles
the clerk taps a few keys on a computer
spots something on the computer do you want the item you left with us
the clerk turns to the safe retrieves an envelope
he hands it and an electronic room key to quail
far in the distance a dusty red structure squats amid barren dunes
we see vehicles scaffolding a fortified perimeter
quail stands at the window looking through binoculars
he lowers them irritably tosses them on the bed
quail tugs the envelope from his pocket tears it open
inside is a single slip of paper on which is written in longhand last chance air station kilometer gird square t it is now sunset on mars and its literally
of inearthly beauty
the sun is bold and blood red the foggy drip ping glass of the dome tints the light into strange colors
quail emerges from the hotel properly attired now in a white tropical suit and starts for the taxi stand
behind him also emerging from the hotel is the shoeshine boy
he keeps out of sight but is definitely tailing quail
as quail nears the first solar powered taxi in line he is approached by an amiable looking calypso guy wearing a west indian shirt and bright straw hat
need a cab boss mon
quail hesitates unsure of the protocol
continuing mines right around the corner
indicating first cab in line that ones closer
but i out hustle him right
two cabbies exchange curses as quail wary follows the calypso guy around a corner climbs into the small solar car
an air lock whooshes open underneath a checker cab sign
bennie and quail emerge in the solar powered car set off into the desert
the taxi traverses the same type desert that quail crossed a few hours ago
only now is looks completely different
the late light tints everything in pastel shades quail is awed by the grandeur of the lawrence of arabia like setting
quail and bennies taxi approaches a brightly lit oasis in the middle of the desert
theres a cafe repair facilities and a huge parking lot all under a garish neon sign quail and bennies taxi pulls in and parks
in the lot is a collection of strange and colorful vehicles huge ore trucks that pull eight trailers mountain prospecting jeeps grapes of wrath jalopies
quail and bennie disembark wear ing breathing masks and enter the main building
the joint is a combination saloon cathouse casino
there are slot machines hookers miners and homesteaders it is like a nevada brothel packed with wild and woolly indi vidualists the equivalent of old west trappers prospectors and cowboys
but with a space age look
quail and bennie elbow their way to the bar
fragments of conversation are overheard
if that intergalactic little napoleon thinks im sellin and clearin outta here he can think again
with a laugh watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air luke
youll be breathin red dust and shittin bricks
bennie and quail pass another group
my wife aint goin on one of those space shuttles
she hates flyin
aw come on
flyins safern crossin the road
yeah there aint been a real disaster since that collision off phobos nigh on twenty years ago
alarmed well that killed twelve thousand
what is this bennie
bunch of miners out here got their own claims from way back
cohaagens buyin em all up says hes gonna cut off the air an water if they wont sell
quail attracts the attention of the bartender
im looking for melina noel
youve found her
his nod indicates an area behind quail
he turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables
she doesnt notice quail
he walks toward her through the crowd
bennie watches then tactfully slips away
melina turns to return to the bar and runs straight into quail
she stops obviously astonished to see him
almost in tears she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors
there are no occupants and it is almost in darkness
quail bewildered follows her
inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which illuminates the area of the table
note as quail and melina speak the activity in the outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors
melina is still fighting back tears
quail stops in front of her unsure about what to do
he has no recollection of how well he might have known this woman
suddenly she slaps him hard across the face
quietly you bastard
he rubs his painful cheek
continuing thats new the innocent look
bitter sarcasm you didnt have that one before
quail is speechless
all right ill say it for you
he looks relieved but tries to cover
continuing dont worry
i got the note
you discharged your obligation
oh the usual one
must return immediately to earth
the wife needs me
i dont have a wife
well i do but not a real wife
getting desperate hell
someone else sent that note
someone who what are you here for
i dont even know why melina bursts into tears
quail rather tentatively puts his arms around her
she welcomes this at first but then pushes him away
continuing whoever i was i must have been a helluva guy
whoever you were
ive for to tell you something
i beg you to believe me
help me all melinas suspicions come rushing back
continuing something happened to my mind
memory suppression false implant i dont know what melina backs off
quail grows more desperate
continuing what im saying is
i dont remember you
i dont remember us
i dont remember me melinas expression grows dead hard
and i thought
who is us
ignoring the question memory erasure is what they use on agents
i was an agent im not now just tell me who i am
how did we know each other
why are they trying to kill me
he takes a step toward her nearly frantic
im not trusting you again
you loved me once you must have that you was a liar
who you are now i dont even know
please melina tears starting get out
i need your help crying quietly get out
get the hell away from me
quail gives up goes through the doors and leaves
melina slumps her shoulder against the table and cries
quail enters from the cafe
bennie is kneeling beside his taxi repairing a tire
he look up sees quail approach
on his right hand bennie has a mechanical device capable of spinning degrees
he uses it to twirl a lug nut tight on his tire
as quail approaches bennie removes the tool attachment from his hand tosses it into a kit beside the taxi
you dont look so good boss
all over the universe women is an awful curse
he opens the door for quail beams
quail still broods bennie tries to cheer him up
its a tough planet boss
some guy really screwed her screwed her up real good
just hopped on a space shuttle
bennie bright tone isnt improving quails mood
youre pretty well informed
if that means i know it all youre right boss
what do you know about the sphinx
i dont know nothin
not about the sphinx
thats out of the ball park
i have to get there
cant you help me
no can do mon
you want women cigarettes red market money booze even air or water
bennies your man
but the sphinx
thats the solar car is moving through the crowd when suddenly sirens approach on a cross street
bennie brakes and stops
he and quail watch as police motorcycles clear a path for a huge gas powered limo
miners on the sidewalks shout well
look at that one eh
big cheese in town
big smelly cheese
but isnt he often here
that cat just cheat the martian workers without ever leavin his place in beverly hills
somethin must be cookin
quail keeps his face in shadow and watches cohaagen with curiosity as he passes
cohaagen is lit up briefly by a street lamp
his face makes an impression on quail who perhaps faintly remembers him in the past
quail enters turns on the lights locks the door
he checks all the rooms
then he crosses to the dresser studies himself in the mirror
he looks haggard
quail opens a drawer takes out his emergency case sets it on top and opens it
he removes a shoulder holster and pistol sets them aside
he takes out a tape recorder
he sets the recorder down gingerly as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions
hes just about to activate it when he hears a knock at the door
through door mr
who is it
hauser i want to talk to you
about douglas quail
quail ditches the recorder and the emergency case into the drawer everything except the pistol
quail approaches the door very cautiously from the side out of the line of fire
tensely who are you
my name is george edgemar
i work for rekall incorporated
stunned incredulous rekall
its difficult to explain
could you open the door please
im not armed
quail opens it carefully his gun at the ready but out of view of the person at the door
a dignified looking gentleman stands there calm and pleasant wearing an earth style business suit
may i come in
i wont be offended if you prefer to keep the gun youre holding trained on me
he cant see the gun but somehow knows
quail does keep his gun trained on the man
the man enters holding in his outstretched hand a business card
my card mr
quail frisks him then takes the card glances at it
okay so youre doctor george edgemar of rekall inc
as i said
this is going to be very difficult for both of us
im afraid youre not really standing here at this moment
sat that again
i said youre not really here
neither am i
were both in the memory studio in the offices of rekall inc
are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some
artificially injected fantasy
that i never really left earth
no not quite
we didnt give you this
youre creating it yourself pauses choosing his words remember the option we offered you
something inside you liked that idea fastened on it
what youre experiencing now is a free form delusion that you yourself are fabricating
what is this shit youre giving me
this is not shit mr
its the truth
beat i know its very hard for you to accept but youre having a schizophrenic reaction
we cant snap you out of the narkadine
youre in a world of your own fantasy
then how the hell can you be in my dream if you know its just a dream
ive been artificially implanted like the first part of your fantasy
im actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console
this is a last resort
when somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy we send in someone after them
a specialist like myself
i dont believe a word youre saying
i was afraid youd think that
im sorry to have to do this but you really are stuck
calls out doctor noel would you come in now please
the door starts to open
quail pivots and points his gun at the opening door
melina walks in carrying a clipboard
she looks at quail with professional detachment
quail im afraid its all true
quail is staggered
continuing i tried to break through to you earlier but you just molded me into your fantasy
sometimes it takes dr
edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you
wavering so whats supposed to happen now
just do exactly as we tell you
stares at him coldly somehow that doesnt appeal to me
try to cooperate
youre having a schizophrenic embolism
if we cant get you out now
you may never come out of it
your wife calls every day even more suspicious
if this is a fantasy therell be no real consequences when i pull this trigger
but there will by consequences inside your mind
consequences that wont hurt me
but could be fatal to you
beat if you shoot me youll wipe me out of your fantasy i cant come back again
because to you ill be dead
i cant help you get back to reality
youll be stuck in permanent psychosis
trembling holding the gun point blank in edgemars face
showing no fear of tension whatever
youre going to lower the gun mr
youre going to hand it to me straining desperately to find the true reality
quails finger on it
youre going to do exactly what i tell you quail pulls the trigger
we see the results of the gunshot from this angle only and so briefly as to produce an almost subliminal effect the back of edgemars head blows off he collapses
to the floor
melina leaps at edgemars falling form and clamps her hands over edgemars right hand
watch out charles
theres more of them in the hall
quail spins toward the door just as it bursts open
a man enters firing but quail has fallen to the floor and returns the fire
he staggers back out into the corridor and slams against the wall dead
from hall youve had it hauser
throw out your weapon if you want a past
melina is still crouched by edgemars body holding his hand for some reason
her clipboard dangles by her side
whispering theres an explosive in the clipboard
he has a dead man switch in his hand
squeezing edgemars hand shut with one of hers she holds up her other wrist to show that the clipboard is bound what do you say hauser
we havent got all night
quail hauser shoots off the chain
what happens it i come out
quail takes the clipboard from melina and eases himself to the side of the doorway
well put in a word with the big boys
maybe youll just get exile to venus
here comes the weapon
quail reaches around the corner and sails the clipboard into the hallway
melina lets go of edgemars hand there is a tremendous explosion in the hallway quail comes out in crouch ready to shoot
on the floor lies a dead man and the body of the shoeshine boy sprawled grotesquely
the hallway is filled with smoke
the floor covered with debris
plaster falling from the ceiling
all over the hotel alarms begin blaring
quail strides back in icy furious
he seizes melina by the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor
two more e
men appear but quail shoots them while dragging melina down the hall in the opposite direction
he pushes open the door leading to the staircase
quail and melina run down the stairs
on the next landing is a service elevator from which a waiter is emerging carefully carrying a tray with hors doeuvres and champagne
back in quick
wouldnt you prefer your order in your room sir
quail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the elevator
quail presses the basement button
as he talks to melina he opens the champagne and pours two glasses
the waiter is too frightened to protest
they kidnapped me
said theyd kill you if i didnt cooperate
i told them i didnt care but then when i realized they meant it
i dont know why theyre after me but whats your connection with all this
we were together before
believe me im really sorry i cant recall the details of that encounter
the elevator has reached the basement
they rush out
quail and melina run from a basement door into an alley
a solar car whips out in front of them
quail and melina leap aboard
go bennie for gods sake
bennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic quail and melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat
glances in mirror bad news boss lady
black cruiser just pull out behind us
a large gas powered official looking car is pushing its way through the crowds and traffic behind them
quail is aiming his gun at the following car
forget the shooter boss
i lose em for you
bennie reaches down grasps a knob
he yanks it like someone starting an outboard motor and an ear splitting loud engine roars to life
bennie opens the throttle and the solar car hurtles down the street
quail and melina are thrown back in the seat
gunfire blazes all around the car
quail fires back at the pursuing car
shouts over youre gonna get a ticket for that engine bennie yutani you like it boss
nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed
bullets from the cruiser rip through the car
you better have two aces bennie
glances behind theres a second cruiser and its gaining bennies car hurtles through the crowds with the official car gaining on it
bennie takes a corner sharply near a huge water selling stand
the official car brakes to make the same turn but clips the side of the water stand
the water container tips and empties water through the open roof i
through which one of the agents has been firing so that the car completely fills
the driver continues the chase but the occupants are now submerged
they frantic ally open the windows while continuing to follow bennies car
the solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead end street with the official vehicle water pouring out of the windows in pursuit
at the end of the street however bennie doesnt stop but continues going into a large opening
it is an abandoned mine
the bigger car follows him but wont fit
the roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into the narrow opening
the second official car pulls up behind
a chauffeur jumps out and opens the rear door
cohaagen steps out
he sur veys the scene
the four men in the wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the wreckage
they are covered in blood and their clothes are in shreds
i take it then youve failed to get him again
cohaagen turns to an associate emile a youngish well dressed executive type
continuing proceed with operation sphinx
gestures toward the mine on the lose im not taking any more chances
operation sphinx will flush him out
the solar car proceeds along the tunnel
it enters an area full of smoke
dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes pipes and cigars
quail looks at them in amazement
whats all this
just old smokies
only place they can come for a puff
its all banned topside
they have now climbed out of the car
quail looks searchingly at melina and bennie
so you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck stop business
thats right boss
he unzips his jacket to reveal a t shirt with martian liberation front and an appropriate symbol emblazoned on it
they died out on earth years ago
hurt well maybe we aint fashion leaders boss
but we still believe in a free mars
they walk as they talk into a room off the main tunnel
it is adorned with free mars and martian liberation front posters
a group of people are printing t shirts and leaflets
they exchange greetings with melina and bennie
so where did i fit into all this
you when you were charles hauser with e
o infiltrated our group
i guess cohaagen didnt trust you any more when you and her gesture suggests their liaison
and i cant even remember it
well have to arrange a return bout
so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity
but the sphinx
why is that stuck in my mind
whys it so important
i dont know
just an ole heap o stone boss
its more than that bennie i know its more
somehow its connected
he slumps into a chair with frustration
reflecting maybe theres a way you can get your memory back
a bit of martian wisdom
were not all stupid colonists
bennie quail and melina are walking in a crowded area of town
water sellers and food stalls are everywhere
an armored loudspeaker vehicle appears broadcasting to the crowd
it is also swinging a powerful searchlight along the footpaths and streets
all residents are to report to their nearest space travel agent within twelve hours all residents will be departing on shuttles within twenty four hours
air and water supplies will be cut off at that time
hes doing it
clearing everyone out
its been rumored for months
the searchlight approaches bennie quail and melina
bennie ducks into a doorway while quail grabs melina and kisses her passionately
the light sees only the back of his head
she responds warmly to his kiss
i can see why i was willing to betray e
i though you believed in our cause
they move into the crowd
the message on the loudspeaker is repeated
the interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its ghetto exterior
the decor is a baroque combination of middle eastern opulence and st century flash
it looks like something out of the arabian nights
a man enters from another room
although the mans features are east indian he is very much a peter lorre type he wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl draped
around the back of his neck
nodding to quail your servant fahreem kuato
i greet you by the twenty seven names that still remain praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life
as kuato speaks quail unimpressed talks sotto voce to melina
what use is this weirdo
there are skills on mars that earth has forgotten
no need to introduce yourself mr
smiles at quails surprise tolerate my presumption but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought after man on two worlds
from the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about quail and co
can be heard
searchlight beams occasionally sweep past the windows
continuing this way my dear man
we have much to accomplish ominously and very little time
a bysantine salon filled with enormous oriental pillows
note in the scenes inside kuatos sanctum the loudspeaker vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to to time
they are repeating the evacuation message from scene but alternating it with a call for the apprehension of quail and melina
for information leading to these arrests first class travel to earth will be provided plus a weekend at the leningrad disneyworld all expenses paid
i repeat an oriental girl and earthman possibly to be found in the company of a black taxi driver
these are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of the glorious peoples republic of mars
the turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you
you have brought it to mars in your search for yourself
kuato takes a seat on the pillows invites the others to join him
and youre going to help me by reading my mind
there is only small matter of a fee
this is for our cause
soothingly income before ideals
shall we say five hundred thousand dollars
appalled five hundred thousand martian dollars thats
think calculating the exchange rate not martian dollars mr
quail earth dollars
thats interplanetary robbery
with todays exchange rate
thats over two million martian dollars
suave what price do you put mr
quail on the future of the solar system
aw come off it man
just for a bit of mumbo jumbo with a crystal ball
his manner slipping listen buster were talking heavy stuff here
you try and work out whats with this guy
he jerks his thumb toward quail
ill pay it but the interstellar trade practices commission might be interested in this
everyone calms down
he extinguishes all the lights save one small blue one which illuminates the room eerily like a seance
retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road
the half recalled the half forgotten the repressed the fantasies the triumphs joys failures betrayals
he closes his eyes and concentrates
i can feel it
erasure techniques are so brutal
frowns scans harder blocks
future and past all jumbled
i shall have to enter deep trance to break through
rising i will be scanning you through the oracle head
kauto turns around and sits down with back toward quail
he reaches up and lowers his cowl revealing the heads eyes are closed in sleep
it is utterly hairless and looks like one of those dolls made from dried apples a shriveled ancient looking yellow little ball
the little face twitched yawns and opens its eyes blinks
it looks at melina then at quail
it opens its toothless little mouth and speaks
do not fear me
i need your openness
continuing open you thoughts to my presence
continue zoom until entire frame is filled by quails eye
the alternations between dark action and white light are rhythmical so as to create a hypnotic dream like feeling
fades to reveal a dramatic close up of the sphinx
we see its face shoulders and behind it the red martian sky to reveal the sphinx is a projection on a screen in a windowless briefing room
quail is seated across from cohaagen and other senior e
on the walls are numerous satellite photos recon maps and excavation drawings all relating to the sphinx
scaffolding and excavation works cover a wall of the sphinx the sphinxs huge carved face visible in the background
quail and several other e
agents stand poised wearing breathing masks and protective gear as a powerful excavation device prizes back a huge stone revealing an entrance to some kind of hidden chamber
the other agents are fearful dont want to proceed
quail ignores them enters the chamber as he enters
we read awe shock and fascination on his features
he approaches something we cant see
his hand reaches out
suddenly a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out striking quail like a bolt of lightning
quail and melina are dancing
the faceted mirror ball on the ceiling become the melina watches from the bed as quail dresses
she rises with only the sheet around her tries desperately to make quail stay
plainly he wants to but he cant
they kiss lingeringly then quail as if called to duty exits
quail alone hands bound in a holding chamber
suddenly the door opens and three beefy e
they grab quail to haul him out
quail battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness
with his bound hands he slugs one man hurling him into a wall he rabbit punches a second man with a two handed blow and knocks him unconscious
the third man sneaks around behind quail and drops him with a blackjack to the back of the head
quail on his back all four limbs pinned by some futuristic version of the rack his head held imobile by a fearsome device similar to the one we glimpsed on
earth in the van the two agents tried to shove him into
several doctors stand over him
into frame moves
cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to probes already inserted into quails brain
as they turn up the power quails face contorts in a grimace of agony you have seen your past
now read the future
the same scene we saw during the films opening sequence
a man wearing a light weight thermal suit races through a labyrinth of tunnels
the ground trembles beneath him as if in an earthquake
explosions rumble deep in the ground below him
suddenly we realize the man is quail he throws a backward glance over his shoulder fearfully as he runs
suddenly a brilliant white light floods in from ahead of him he puts up his hands to protect his eyes and sees his hands are splattered with blood
quail runs even faster ahead the brilliant light seems to promise safety
he battles toward it
sounds of explosions increase building urgency
up ahead emerging from the light hands reach out to help quail
he seems almost to safety
but just as he reaches the hands quail awakens with a jolt
white as a sheet
sweating like hes just run ten miles
then a transformation seems to come over him
he looks and sees kuato slumped across the cushions melina beside kuato bennie standing holding a smoking gun trained on kuato
rushes to quail charles
are you all right
quail stares at her as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place continuing he kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance
we couldnt wake either of you
you stopped breathing
quail gives bennie that same eerie look then turns to kuato who is sprawled motionless across the pillows a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine
why did you kill him
it was the next bit i really
no choice boss
it was him or you
quail lunges across the pillows to kuatos unbreathing form
quail shakes the ancient mystic trying to find a last flicker of life
kuatos body is dead white
quail releases his grip he about to give up when a muffled chocked sound comes from behind kuatos neck
its the oracle head
quail instantly rolls kuatos body over
the head is still alive
quail bends closer kneeling
whispers the vengence you seek
and the salvation of mars
are waiting for you in the crown of the sphinx
sags gasping the oracle head lets out a long sigh and goes limp a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth
phobos and demos
what was that all about
quail ignores him still kneeling deep in thought over the oracle head
are you okay
quail reaches out and closes the oracle heads tiny eyelids
melina and bennie exchange a glance
for a moment his back is to melina and bennie
then he turns
he has become a different man
his eyes gleam
he is forceful purposeful contained
once again the ace e
melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before even his voice has changed im fine
only im not doug im charles hauser
and i know everything hauser knew
he turns to bennie continuing bennie wheres your depot
working it out well
you go outta here
take a left then down past the first
water bureau you
briskly can you get us there
were going to the sphinx
he strides off
the others follow still full of questions
what did you learn
ive got total recall
they are now heading down the stairs toward the street
quail melina and bennie make their way through the crowds to bennies depot
the streets are even busier then before people are now beginning to evacuate the city
everyone is carrying their possessions bundles suitcases pets etc
the loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad casting the same message
bennie indicates a building on their left
bennie and melina follow quail as he walks up and down the rows of vehicles in the vast building
there are bull dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis
well never get near the sphinx
theyll blow us apart
quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself
he rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they pass
camera tracks rapidly with them
what are we doing charles
for gods sake tell us
its not some useless artifact its a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago
the same race that built the on one earth
for the same purpose
he stops in front of a large odd shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front
continuing this is what we need
he begins to climb in the others follow
referring to the sphinx its a hunk of old stone man
bennie starts the engine
come on bennie move it
then to melina have you heard the word terriform
melina shakes her head
the vehicle moves off
guards are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city though this has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving for the space ports
the vehicle with bennie quail and melina arrives
bennie is nervous
melina and quail are in the back but cannot be seen
guards are checking all vehicles exiting looking for quail and melina
calling to guards just deliverin some old junk to the mine out at apidalia planitia
got them people youre lookin for in the back as well
the guards laugh and signal him on
once through the second door of the air lock i
to the area outside the city quail and melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats
the machine in the sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet
there are tunnels and ducts everywhere all powered by fusion generators
you sure the little man didnt fry your brain quail
overlapping for what
to do what
to combine elements in the martian core and release them as oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen
in a wide shot the vehicle is traversing the desert
the domed city is some distance in the background
voices are heard in false perspective
emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of mars
air and water
terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for mars
no more pressurized cities no more containers in the desert
therell be rivers vegetation life the same as earth
baffled so why is cohaagen shipping everyone out
dont you see
from being a pile of red dirt with minerals mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate
and cohaagens going to own it all
he can start selling it off to well heeled investors from earth
beach condos ski resorts you name it
no wonder he wanted you to
nods once word of this gets out the whole planet will support you
the vehicle is now approaching the sphinx
both it and the pyramids can be seen some distance away
voice are heard in cu perspective
so what can we do
ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule while the inhabitants are still here
melina is amazed
but wholl work the machine
do you know how
im the only one who does
why do you think cohaagens left me alone all this time
the vehicle is even closer to the sphinx
i was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the sphinx
it mustve been programmed
some kind of
shot into me
but cohaagen wiped your memory
smoothly just a way of putting me on ice
hed of reversed it once the planet was evacuated
this is real complicated
go over it again real slow
ignoring bennies aside what he hadnt counted on was your effect on me
smiling and all without the marvels of modern science
quail looks out the back window his attention attracted by two patrol vehicles
they are some distance away but approaching steadily
a wide shot shows a total of four patrol vehicles approach ing the vehicle with quail melina and bennie
suddenly it stops moving
the vehicle had just stopped
bennie dont stop now take it
he turns to see bennie is covering him and melina with a pistol
like i said
its a tough planet
im a baddie not a goodie
i should have known you were just too helpful
eio rule one man
now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone
but what about the martian people
i thought you believed in it
that bunch of dead beat radicals
when i hand in this little number
flicks his gun in quails face ill get real estate rights on the whole of chryse planitia
at that instant melina lunges punches a red emergency button
the vent beside bennies hand blows open causing a powerful suction caused by marss vacuum atmosphere
bennies gun hand is planted against the vent opening
simultaneously the air in the vehicle starts rushing out
all three parties begin choking
as bennies mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent quail has a moment to jump him
he pounds bennies gun hand the quail delivers a roundhouse punch to bennie knocking him clear across the bus
melina seals the vent repressurizes the cabin
bennie gets up off the floor shaking off quails punch the e
vehicle are a half mile off and closing in
quail glances at the vehicles turns to bennie ready to jump him
but stops short at what he sees bennie doing
bennie is clipping on his mechanical arm
it sprouts several rows of vicious looking steel blades this makes bennie a cut above anyone else
bennie presses another button and the blades start spinning
bennies mechanical arm is in effect now a buzz saw
the fight begins
bennie attacks quail with his buzz saw arm quail dodges
bennies arm shreds various articles in the cabin and keeps melina at bay with well timed swipes
finally bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to quails jaw with his real hand
quail sprawls dazed
now bennie goes for the kill
but melina leaps onto him
bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his spinning hand in for the quick kill
melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands desperately keeping it at bay
but her strength is no match for bennie the whirring blades are just about to bite into melinas neck when quail comes back lands a ferocious rabbit punch to bennies
quail lunges at him grabs the blade weapon he and bennie crash into the cabin wall and the blade rips clear through the moles wall
alarms sound as a gaping hole is blown in the side of the now no one can breathe
they all claw for their masks still in place
bennie is first he recovers lunges with his spinning arm for quail
quail barely dodges grabs the arm muscles it back toward bennie the spinning blades sever bennies own oxygen line
gasp ing he falters
quail aims a titanic blow punches bennie out through the hole in the moles wall
quail and melina masks on stare out as bennie claws desperately at his severed air line
the martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from bennies lungs he chokes staggers bennie is beside the vehicle
he implodes like a balloon with all its air gone
melina hides her face in horror
at that instant bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle
the patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away
loud speakers call for quails surrender
quail lunges for the vehicle controls
presses a button marked dive
the vehicle tilts
the vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand
as the patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire the vehicle vanishes from sight
in the distance the sphinx looms ominously
a driver in one of the patrol vehicles filmed from outside the windscreen is speaking into a microphone
he cant be heard but can only be radioing a report
the little mining vehicle moves powerfully propelled by its borer nose
quail mans the controls while melina struggles to shore up the gaping hole in the side into which sand is pouring as the mole moves forward
quail looks at a compass in the control panel
he makes a correction
shouts over engine noise hope ive got this direction right
sand pours over him from bullet holes resulting from the encounter with patrol cars
cu speedometer mph
every other gauge is overheating flashing warning lights cohaagen and a number of his associates plus scientists and heavily arms troops are present
the air supply is off under the domes
in a couple of hours itll be all gone
any trouble with the rabble
not much sir
a lot of complaining
but theyre all heading towards the shuttle areas
on some of the video screens a number of space shuttles can be seen ready for departure to earth
the mole bores through a sand wall emerges into a cramped horizontal tunnel
quail and melina leap out
the poor mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit
its nose is worn to a nub
we got in with this thing but well never get back out
such a pleasant trip
theres a lighted area at the end of the tunnel
quail and melina hurry toward it moving silently close to the wall
they draw up an abyss where their tunnel intersects the main downshaft
melina gasps at the colossal scale of the drilling hundreds of yards across deeper than the eye can see and crisscrossed by catwalks buttresses and super sophisticated technology
quail and melina are forty feet below the upper end of the main downshaft
they can look up the shaft and see the first interior level of the sphinx itself
points down shaft this is the main tap straight down to the core of mars
when we trigger the mechanism fusion reactors will detonate down there four hundred miles deep
remind me not to slip
the new elements will come booming up through this shaft and six thousand others all around the planet
hes right at home and full of confidence
quail climbs onto the ladder which links various top levels
he starts to climb
melina follows him
they are tiny figures
the space around them plummets down to infinity
a patrol of nine heavily armed guards appear from a corridor in level one directly above where quail and melina are climbing
quail and melinas heads inch into view at floor level
they take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck back swiftly out of sight
to two of his men stay in contact
i want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes
seven of the guards move off two remain in position
we hear the footsteps of the seven guards recede
the two remaining guards realize their isolation they glance tensely to one another
did you hear something
the first guard points to the edge of the main shaft right where quail and melina are hiding
the guards cock their weapons start cautiously forward
just as theyre about to peer over the brink guns at the ready from behind the guards im not there boys
the guards spin around weapons poised
standing in the shadows near the corridor is quail
still with no gun both guards walk quickly toward quail covering him with their weapons
to guard watch him
he was eio trained
theyre all full of tricks
who was that guy
to quail keep em up fred keep em up
quail has his arms raised high
just as the guards reach him he fizzes electronically emitting a humming sound then disappears
before either guard can react the real quail appears one foot behind them
with two lightning blows he dispatches the guards
apparently quail has climbed out of the shaft while the guards were distracted
quail snatches both guards weapons grenades and ammo belts
melina climbs out of the shaft
quail tosses her one of the guards guns
alarms go off everywhere
quail carrying a gun and all the grenades and ammo belts and melina just carrying a gun bolt down a corridor past a sign level one
running whered you get that little trick
running mail order company
its a great one for fooling the wife
cohaagen and his aides hear the alarms see quail and melina on monitors as they race down the corridor on level one
how the hell did they get in
up the fusion core
up the fusion core
he exhibits begrudging admiration for quail
studies monitor more carefully theyre on level one
a wall sign behind cohaagen reads level thirteen
seal all upper levels
a button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front of the formidable doors already closing the control room off from the outside corridors
quail and melina are still racing through the corridors
he passes her a fresh ammo belt
indicates weapons know how to use one of these
melina expertly ejects her spent clip that guards fired at quail slams in a fresh clip and cocks the gun
quail has a half second to react impressed then four guards pound into view at the end of the corridor
melina opens fire nails two
quail heaves a grenade as it explodes he and melina bolt down a side corridor alarms continue as quail and melina dash down the side passageway
more guards cut them off melinas machine gun sends them scattering quail pauses at a corner
he looks around quickly and sees that an elevator is arriving
he motions melina back
the doors of the elevator begin to open
very quickly quail bobs his head and arm around the corner
he calls out loudly
he hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator
instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object
it is an explosive device of some sort
quail and melina press themselves against the wall just around a corner from the elevator
there is a tremendous explosion
quail followed by melina rounds a corner
the elevator is in ruins bodies are scattered everywhere
great stuff but how do we get up
she points toward the upper levels
melina and quail can be seen on the security monitor from a high angle
quail looks up spots the monitor and shoots is to pieces
the image on the screen goes black
well pick up quail once the shuttles have left for earth
quail spots a large windowed air lock at the end of the corridor
he and melina race to it
quail starts to open the inner door of the air lock
if youre afraid of the heights you better get over it real quick
he is pulling melina through the inner air lock door just as guards stampede around the corner of the corridor toward them
quail is out of sight but they see melina poised near the window
she waves and smiles to them hiding her gun behind her body
they slow down and approach less cautiously beguiled by her manner and attractiveness
as they get close she suddenly lifts her gun and opens fire mowing them down
quail and melina climb through the outer air lock door
they are at the sphinxs shoulder with a dizzying drop beneath them
melina looks down
shes sorry she did the fall is at least feet
both are wearing their breathing apparatus
quail and melina start to climb
up the sphinxs shoulder along its egyptian like headdress cohaagens chief aide emile addresses him quietly
if quails the only one who can operate all this
gestures toward sphinxs controls then he can call all the shots
well tell him the computers worked out the operational details so we dont really need him
were just doing him a favor
and if that doesnt work
we offer him rewards
what if that doesnt work
well torture him
you dont think i got this far by being a nice guy
quail and melina traverse across the cheekbones haul themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes the video monitors show the space shuttles
an operator with earphones turns to cohaagen
first of the shuttles ready for departure sir
two minute countdown
quail jams three grenades against the glass of the eyes pulls melina back behind the stone cheeks a muffled explosion due to the thin martian atmosphere detonates overhead
the sphinxs right eye blows in a storm of shards and shrapnell
instantly the room turns into a hurricane as the martian vacuum sucks out all air
everyone panics grabbing their seal the breach
an aide dives for an emergency switch
but now quail and melina wearing breather masks bursts in onto an overhead catwalk
they open fire on the guards who are choking struggling with their masks
an emergency pressure seal powers into place sealing the breach in the eye
repressurization comes up the internal atmosphere stabilizes none of the men inside the control room still moves
the victors tug off their masks spring down to the main level
melina hurries to the main control panel
melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure
those shuttles are starting up any minute
if you know how to work this thing you better do it now
quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex machinery
dont you know how
transfixed mesmerized quail moves closer to the control panel
theres a vital connection missing
he approaches even closer
he begins to raise his arm towards a blank area a little above his head
if you activate the mechanism youll die
there were glimpses of it in your memory
wrong cohaagen theres a long tunnel a brilliant white light hands reaching for me
assured thats your death
thats what it looks like
thats what is always looks like
quail looks around him half convinced
looking toward space shuttles on video screens charles for marss sake
he looks from melina to cohaagen
its not too late
join us again
uve a lot to offer
a whole world
quail continues to look at him thoughtfully
you dont deserve a new world you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one
time someone else had a chance
he turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm again
his fingers reach towards the blank section on the panel
slowly through the panel a luminous hand reaches toward quails fingers
gently the fingers of the two hands touch
the entire control room begins to rumble and shudder
as quail reaches for melina cohaagen suddenly dives on him
they grapple amid the shuddering sphinx and can be seen only intermittently as debris crashes around them
the fight ends as cohaagen is hurled backwards and disappears when a section of floor collapses underneath him
a reprise of the sequence that opened the movie
quail runs through a labyrinth of tunnels
the ground all sides
we hear an explosion and another and another each one sounding closer than the last quail clamps him breathing mask on as he runs
is this his own death
where is melina
the tunnel walls are just like the ones in quails original nightmare bright reddish orange clay and quartz
quail throws a backward glance fearfully over his shoulder
the explosions are closer
suddenly up ahead appears a brilliant white light
quail sees it but it only terrifies him more
is it death hes running to
he hurries on with all his strength but just as he nears the white light he falls
on his knees too weak to move
he struggles hands are reaching out to him from out of the brilliant light
quail stretches for them just as a final explosion blows him forward straight into the white light
the hands seize him pull him upward to the hands belong to breather masked miners dismounting rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was taking them to the space port
quail looks from them to melina who is walking towards the group
the miners desert garb shield goggles and breathers add to the surreal nightmare quality of quails tortured perspective in terror lost disoriented totally
am i dying
i wont lie to you pal
miner from melinas bar id say in about forty years
he and others help quail to his feet come on weve gotta get to the space port
that intergalactic napoleons switched off the air
shippin us all out
mars is finished
a miners wife watches them
she is crying
quail looks up at the sky
melina follows his glance
so do the others
slowly but perceptibly the color is changing from yellow to blue
what is it
all the miners are puzzled apprehensive
quail reaches toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his breathing apparatus
at first the man is shocked then realizes he can breathe without it
quail takes off his own then melinas all the miners watch in amazement
they all remove their breathing masks
thats just the start
next therell be rain and growth and
melina embraces him
continuing rekall could never have come up with anything like this
melina looks oddly at him smiling mysterious
as the sky becomes more and more blue more of the miners descend from the bus
softly at first then with more and more confidence they begin singing the martian national anthem
the music swells
quail puts his arm around melina
they both join in the chorus
it reaches an impassioned crescendo as the frame freezes and the end credits roll up the screen
