written by chris bertolini from space a view of the earth
the vibrant blue of its oceans is striking against the vast black void of space
move closer to the earth where the shimmering pacific ocean meets the california coastline
a birds eye view of los angeles comes into relief a criss cross of streets freeways
the buildings not more than dots
keep moving closer as sound fades in
we notice movement through the sprawl of city now masses of people and cars moving away from the ocean as we arrive at
the sound is at a frantic pitch here the sound of chaos on the streets
people screaming car horns blaring as cars jockey for position moving eastward among
hordes of people on foot their panicked faces rushing past
super los angeles contact hour as we
then super the day before
we are close on sergeant michael nantz late s tall battle hardened staring forward listening impatiently
must be some kind of mistake
company st sergeant john roy also late s sits behind his desk holding nantz file
i got paperwork here with your signature says youre retiring
no mistake john
you got a box full a medals file full a commendations
roy contd hell everything but the good conduct
they can take the good conduct medal and shove it up their
see thats what im talking about mike
youre a marine
nantzsmiles back now
i appreciate it john
you know that
but i been to too many funerals
had to visit too many moms and dads tell em about what happened to their sons
youre on that training assignment right now
why dont you just ride it out for a month or two
see how you feel
i did my twenty
roy takes this in nods
he stands holds his hand out
youre gonna miss it
looking out onto rolling hills and trees
we hear o
i dont see it
im telling you its in the trees
from the st platoon nd battalion th marines the
camo uniforms night vision goggles on stare into the dark
correggio linebacker big shakes his head frustrated
im gonna launch another one
the other marines back away quickly as
widen to see were
correggio golf club in hand steps to a golf tee
he tees off
the marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness
thats more like it
lenihan baby faced looks impressed
imlay a dense but good natured country boy moves to the tee
dont encourage him
correggios freakin egos big enough already
he takes the club from correggio
let an expert show you how its done bro
imlay tees off his swing plainly choppy uncoordinated
as he whacks the ball visible in the night visions greenish glow
it hooks into a sand trap
then he stops as a light flashes beyond the trees
told you theyd come
three girls signal with a flashlight
then race down a small hill onto the golf course
the three girls sit around a beat up tahoe parked near the tee case of beer on its back gate sipping beers
corpsman adukwu a tall thin nigerian tees off
that dogll hunt
damn daktari you can play
we have courses in nigeria imlay
well how would i know
i mean its an american game
actually imlay its scottish
kerns an antsy fireplug of a guy shakes his head
lenihan you as good with an m as you are with your mouth
lay off him
just wanna make sure the rookie wont fold under fire
correggio shoves a beer into kerns hand
he throws an arm around kerns shoulder smiles at the girls
my buddys jumpy cause he got an assfull a shrapnel our last tour
youre crawling up your own ass cause we train with sgt
correggio eyes kerns
this was the wrong thing to say
one girl smiling seductively steps to correggio takes the golf club
if this is the officers course what happens if they catch you out here
she readies to take a shot
correggio snuggles up behind her ostensibly teaching her how to swing
we can handle it baby
were experts at night maneuvers
nearby the second girl chats up adukwu
so youre from where again
imlay pops a beer interrupting
adukwus our corpsman
like a medic
saved kerns ass
daktari tell her about nigeria
adukwu starts to talk but imlay interrupts again adukwus a green card marine
motions to lenihan and lenihan here hes just green
mom signed so he could join at
im looking after him since he dont know his ass from a hot rock
lenihan suddenly ducks behind the tahoe throwing up
youre doing a good job
we always take the new meat out here to christen em
lenihan shuffles back out from behind the tahoe
grab your beer
everyone holds beers aloft
lenihan joins in reluctantly
who gets his first taste a those hills tomorrow
he points off to the hilly desolate terrain near the course
good luck rookie
the marines chuckle knowingly about to drink
then they hear the sound of tires skidding to a halt
they look toward the hillside see the white helmetsof mps
the marines grab the goggles and clubs pile
with the girls
the tahoe skids away the beer crashing off the back
the first girl eyes correggio
correggio grins sheepishly
sweetly taking his hand writing her phone number on the back of it as
a modest working class two bedroom apartment
a television on in the b
a news program what appears to be an unprecedented meteor shower falling off the falkland islands
bennie martinez whose youthful looks and open smile contrast with his muscular frame rolls in bed to see
his wife anna sitting on the edge of the bed next to him turning something over in her hands
what are you doing up so early
she holds up the object in her hands its martinez lieutenant
i still have to get used to that
she kisses him lightly stands
martinez smiles watching her move off
yeah lot of things we gotta get used to
we see her very pregnant belly now as she smiles back exits
as she does martinez turns back to the television meteors falling into a distant ocean
this dazzling display is visible from argentina to southern chile
martinez in uniform now exits the ground floor apartment heads to his car as anna exits watching him go smiling
call me later
ill call you later
he stops smiling back at her now
she waves coyly
then martinez is running back to the apartment
moving with the grace of the college football player he was just a few years ago
we dont go with him
just observe from a distanceas
martinez arrives at anna who laughs as he leans down kissing her stomach now
the st platoon of the marines all years old sweating as they run hills in full gear in the blazing sun
key on the marines from the golf course staring forward at
nantz running up ahead
heard nantz put in his papers
wish he done it years ago
lenihan struggling breathing hard looks up at this stumbling as he does
nantz looking back at the chatter sees
imlay grab hold of lenihan helping him forward now
goddamn it imlay you gonna wipe his ass for him too
every man carries his weight
nantz drops back runs alongside the struggling lenihan
just quit lenihan
do us all a favor
cause the squads only as strong as the weakest man
lenihan stumbles and falls in the dirt
and right now youre getting us all killed
on these words nantz meets eyes with correggio further back in the pack
nantz looks away sees
imlay suddenly at lenihans side helping him up
nantz shoves imlay away knocking him onto his ass
you think youre helping him imlay
you think youre making him stronger
nantz puts a boot into imlays chest shoving him flat
correggio stares at this steaming
stay on the goddamn ground imlay
youve just been gut shot
your buddys down bleeding to death lenihan
lzs at the top of this hill
you gonna let this man die in the dirt on some stinking hill
or are you marine enough to save him
lenihan stumbles to his feet wiping dirt from his mouth
im gonna save him sir
lenihan bends strains somehow heaves imlay up
he begins stumbling up the hill carrying imlay on his back
come on goddamnit
its a hot lz
the choppers gotta move
theyre gonna leave you both to die
lenihan staggers knees trembling weaving back and forth
then his foot comes down on a rock in the trail
his ankle gives way
lenihan falls yells in pain grabbing his ankle
dont you ever tell me you cant
correggio takes a step towards nantz now
kerns stops him
hes injured sergeant
a moment as they stare at each other
nantz voice like ice hes not injured
he twisted his goddamn ankle
nantz looks over the men sweaty covered with grime
we are marines
cant is not the code we live by
cant gets marines killed
do things the right way the marine way maybe you get to come home
maybe your buddy gets to come home
correggio stares back sullenly on this
dyings easy ladies
everything else takes balls
nantz spits on the ground
run a bag of saline into lenihan and tape that ankle
we start back in ten minutes
we recognize two marines from st platoon cpl
devrey harris african american steely quick witted and cpl
nick stavrou a greek hulk with an easy smile
harris stares at a television on a table behind the counter
meteors are falling off the coasts of california ireland india in the bay of bengal all less than ten miles from land
man i thought lenihan was gonna wash out today
hey i remember carrying your fat ass up that hill hung over as shit
newbie gets no sympathy from me
a woman cherise harris fiancee hurries over

harris looks pained
but before he can speak up well i think its a no brainer

cherise looks expectantly to harris who smiles back weakly
of course baby
whatever you want she kisses him heads to the florist as harris turns on dude what are you doing
busting your balls

stavrou throws an arm round harris shoulder smiles
i love cake
a drab nondescript office
kerns sits across a desk from the base psychiatrist whos consulting a file
still not sleeping
and the nightmares
i mean sometimes
but its no big deal
youre not drinking right private
thats just a crutch
the psychiatrist stares at this
then writes in the file
whats my status
am i cleared for combat
i feel good
lets meet again next week
two surfers cpl
grayston looking grizzled beyond his years and pvt
simmons a spaced out surfer vibe sit on boards in the water staring at
two mps on the beach waving them in
i dont know why they always have to give us shit
its not fair
question is why does everybody think lifes supposed to be fair
why do bad guys want to kill us
why cant i have a nipple ring
why is it the more power we get the more we want
nothings fair simmons
i just like to blow shit up
suddenly a siren begins wailing from the base
grayston and simmons exchange a glance
they start paddling in quickly
nantz is running with another platoon of marines
everyone slows as the sirens wail from the base
the squad stops following nantz gaze to
an approaching dust cloud being kicked up by
a humvee and two five ton trucks speeding up the dirt road toward the marines
everyone is silent as they watch the humvee and trucks pull up
this is not normal
st sergeant roy hops from the humvee shouting marines
into the trucks
proceed to the armory and draw weapons
the marines exchange glances heading for the five tons
roy motions to nantz who follows him to the humvee
whats going on john
look mike i know youre burnt out ready to move on
whatever you want to call it
but everybodys being deployed right now
and the platoons down a sergeant
we need you
do i have a choice here
they arrive at the humvee
roy turns to nantz
its all hands on deck mike
nantz nods resigned
starts climbing into the humvee
just dont lose my paperwork
roy drives back to base nantz next to him
sirens are wailing helicopters taking off in the distance
meteor storms hittin up and down california now
all i know is this is a helluva lot more than just some space rocks fallin out to sea
what dyou mean
stares at nantz
whole base is being mobilized
theres some kinda bad shit hittin the fan
the humvee and five tons swing into the base past a mass of activity trucks being loaded with supplies tanks driving onto flat cars marines racing about
youre assigned to st platoon under lt
his platoon sergeant was rushing back to base got in a car accident
what are the odds
as the humvee pulls to the command building nantz sees
martinez hurrying to meet them
theres the lieutenant
young been with us three months straight outta basics school
bright kid but this is his first deployment so keep an eye on him mike
lenihan and imlay correggio and kerns are getting their gear together hurriedly packing
lenihan checks and double checks a list with the contents of his pack ticking off poncho liner gore tex jacket socks vest first aid kit flashlight
its probably just a drill right
they shifted nantz into our unit
something must be going on
i heard nantz kicked ass on his last tour
went into a compound by himself killed like ten insurgents
that what you heard
you dont know shit lenihan
correggio pissed grabs his pack heads for the door
move your asses
they want us in the armory
and hes gone
lenihan confused looks at imlay
whats his problem
nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour
correggios brother was one of em
lenihan nods somber getting it
nantz and martinez walk through quickly
all around them numerous officers hurry all responding to ringing beepers
nantz peers into various offices
every one is buzzing with activity clerks bustling maps spread out phones ringing
and every office has a television on
we hear overlapping
reporters voices from the offices they pass cluster of what appears to be meteors is tightly packed
hard for scientists to predict the size or quantity striking the oceans
they calling us
in because of these meteors lieutenant
i assume so
maybe an evacuation
whatever it is itll be good to get out in the field with the men
nantz looks askance at this
martinez catches it
look sergeant lets be clear
i know your rep know what youve done
but this is my unit
were not gonna have a problem are we
no problem sir
its all yours
at numerous windows
lines of marines hand in weapons cards receiving their weapons in return
the marines from st platoon of the correggio and kerns stavrou and harris imlay and lenihan adukwu all watching mounted televisions a woman reporter s on a beach
behind her police disperse thin crowds of people bullhorns blaring
a legend on the tv screen reads santa monica ca
mottola squad radio man tall and thin listening to an ipod and pvt
guerrero lumbering eyes on the tv
we never got a chance to finish the new mix man
we were gonna add some metal to it
well have time later
the marines stare at the harried reporter on tv
national guard troops have flown in to evacuate all surrounding beach areas
nantz and martinez crowd in among other sergeants and lieutenants the company captain briefing them
these objects were completely undetected until they entered our atmosphere
what are they captain
we have no idea
but whatever they are theyre not hitting the water at terminal velocity
theyre able to slow down before impact
glances exchanged in the room now
this is no meteor shower
homeland security has bumped the threat level to red
marines we are the first line of defense
all units gear up be ready to move
the young marines from st platoon are still in line for their weapons along with many other marines
some are nervously bullshitting others intently watching
the reporter on the beach looks harried now as thick smoke rolls in across the water
police sirens wail in the b
some sort of smoke has appeared over the ocean now
hey shut up
others quiet down now
all focus slowly shifting to
the reporter on the beach is cupping her earpiece
im being told a coast guard cutter just issued a mayday
the tv shot pans to the water
the distant cutter lists to one side sinking below the waves as indistinct dark shapes clamber onto it from the water
push forward scrambling to the tvs
what the hell are those things
the cutter disappears behind the thick rolling smoke
the camera pans back to the reporter silently staring out
crowded with marines including squad leader grayston all getting ready
or they were
right now activity has ceased
marines silently stare at
the reporter on the beach staring out clearly panicked
the cutter has
she stops seeing the smoke reach the waters edge
a hush falls over the crowd as smoke rolls across the beach
now all officers and marines are frozen crowding around open office doors staring at
as the reporter reacts to isolated shouts echoing from the crowd on the beach
some are pointing out to the ocean
what is that
in the water
the news cameraman pans to the water as it begins to churn
nantz and martinez stand among the other sergeants and lieutenants staring stunned at
screams and panicked voices ring out from those on the beach now as indistinct figures appear from under the waves
people race away plodding along the sand in hopeless flight as these figures charge into the crowd
gunshots ring out police shooting at the indistinct figures that appear then disappear in the ever thickening smoke
move in on nantz staring at the tv as
the news cameraman runs away now the picture being transmitted growing shaky indistinct frenzied as
a dark figure appears overruns the cameraman as
the news camera suddenly cuts to black
in black all we hear is screams echoing from the beach
all activity has doubled a frantic energy now
trucks race along the perimeter of the air field massive ch helicopters take off loaded with marine units
the st platoon stands together lt
martinez addressing them as another ch helicopter is landing nearby
as you probably heard sgt
nantz will be taking over for sgt
were lucky to have him aboard
the ch helicopters touches down now its massive bay door opening for them
martinez barks lets move men
the platoon grabs gear runs for the helicopter climbing aboard
nantz hurries them along grabbing packs throwing them on after the marines
then he grabs correggios pack about to throw the pack on
correggio grabs it back from nantz
nantz turns faces off with correggio
you got something to get off your chest corporal
its cool sergeant
you got a silver star and my brother came home in a box
i get it
get aboard corporal
correggio jumps into the chopper
the marines helmets on packs between their knees sit facing each other
the sound of the ch s massive rotors is deafening
some shout over the din too nervous to remain quiet
what the hell you think those things are
gotta be extraterrestrial
you mean like from space
correggio looks down at his hand
sees the girls phone number written on it
across the deck martinez huddles with nantz map in hand
santa monica airports our forward operating base
we get some cobras and f s in the air well have plenty of support
theyre flying into the unknown and martinez seems as nervous as the younger men
kerns leans in to nantz desperately needing reassurance
how many a them you think there are sergeant
nantz just stares out stone faced
well know soon enough private
the marines are glued to the windows shocked by what theyre seeing as the chopper banks toward venice santa monica fires raging from various explosions
in the distance massive lines of traffic moving away from the ocean
the streets bordering the beach look deserted except for the bodies dotting the landscape
nantz looks at martinez who is hunched over scribbling a letter
martinez folds it then writes the name anna on it
we realize its a letter in the event of his death
martinez stares at the letter
then carefully tucks it away
the airport is being quickly transformed into a military base military vehicles line the runway more being driven from a nearby cargo plane
the ch lands
the platoon jumps out squad leaders forming the men up as
nantz and martinez salute a captain heading to them as f jets take off screaming overhead
st platoon of the
situation is as follows most of santa monica is cleared of civilians
weve got a defensive line at lincoln boulevard a mile from the ocean
he points out lincoln boulevard on a map the ocean close by
everything from lincoln to the ocean will be bombed
leveling it captain
weve got an infestation of god knows what
its an enemy ground force only they have no aircraft
so our jetsll tear em a new asshole
we will rule the air
there must be civilians stuck behind the line sir
were getting distress calls sending squads out
he points to the map to streets running from lincoln blvd
your mission lieutenant take your st squad proceed west from lincoln to a community center located here
pointing to map in a park on th and bay street
police were using it as an evacuation point
they got overrun

you got three hours
another chopper is landing
nantz yells over the sound what do we know about these things captain
but police have shot em
the captain hurrying to the next chopper yells back its our job to kill em
nantz and martinez are double timing with the st squad cpl
grayston correggio and kerns stavrou and harris imlay and lenihan mottola and guerrero simmons and adukwu
as they approach lincoln they slow eyes widening
reverse to see what theyre staring at lincoln boulevard
being fortified into a defensive line
marines are setting up sand bagged machine gun nests in a parking lot fronting a nail shop and a china express
other marines hunker behind barricades in front of a goodyear tire store firing mortars toward the ocean
smashed in storefronts
cars crashed at intersections the echoing wail of car alarms
pockets of civilians are being waved forward by marines
a little girl with a smurf backpack is rushed across lincoln
martinez turns rallies the squad most of whom look shocked
lets go marines
focus on the mission
were gonna get to that community center and get those people safe
a cobra attack helicopter screams overhead firing into the distance
martinez turns to nantz shouting over the din something to add sergeant
to the squad kill anything thats not human
nantz and martinez lead the squad from lincoln onto th st
various structure fires are visible in the distance
the squad passes a fire truck crashed against a fence engine idling
firemen lie near their hose lines dead
deep deafening sounds exploding in the distance
the ground shakes from massive aftershocks
billowing smoke rumbles from the west
ash rains down the sky turns black
the squad hunkers down panicked looks exchanged
what the hell is that
keep it together
watch your angles
the aftershocks fade
ominous quiet again
the squad continues down the street
helluva way to get citizenship eh daktari
shit id rather be in afghanistan
thick smoke hangs in the air
the lack of visibility is clearly adding to the marines fright
numerous shapes become visible in the smoke
as the squad approaches slowly the shapes become clear
bodies splayed in the street
cherise and i were supposed to register at bed bath beyond tonight
think youre gonna be busy bro
nantz points his rifle into a crashed pickup truck
a body is slumped beneath the wheel
simmons comes up behind nantz
peers into the truck sections of the body appear almost dissolved by a white phosphorous like substance
what is that shit sergeant
caustic dismissive something bad private
now get back with your team
a shape is moving to them through the smoke
the marines aim about to fire just as the smoke clears
standing there staring mournfully at them
nervous chuckles now
correggio sidles up to kerns
kerns just shoots him a look
the squad moves on
as they approach a side street that intersects th
the dog whines
correggio pets it trying to comfort it
but the dog suddenly races off disappearing into the smoke
the marines spin rifles up growing unnerved
what the hell
something spooked that dog
then kerns sees the smoke swirling down the side street
as if something is racing through it
kerns breaks formation sprints down the side street firing
discipline shatters as the squad follows kerns
hold your position
kerns stops spinning looking
for targets breath ragged eyes panicked
correggio races up
whatd you see
suddenly the indistinct form of an alien creature appears through the smoke moving fast down the side street
kerns is ready firing
the others react firing as well
the alien form is blasted dropping into the smoke
hold your fire
hold your fire
everyone stops firing
nantz gets in kerns face
one enemy runs and you break discipline and chase it
to the others think marines
the sergeant is right
stay on course
we have a mission
suddenly the shadowy alien form rises again darting off disappearing into the smoke
the squad stares back stunned
how many rounds it take
correggio edges to kerns whos looking panicky
theyre real bro
i kept prayin they wouldnt be
nantz unnerved himself stares into the smoke
what is it sergeant
that thing running down the street
that was to draw us in
slowly fading in we hear what nantz hears now
a rumbling sound behind them
nantz spins to it
we took the bait now theyre cutting us off
i cant see a goddamn thing
but the sound of their advance tells us theres many
light it up
the squad lets loose with a barrage of fire as
tracer fire shoots back at the marines from the smoke
glimpses of indistinct figures moving fast
mottola get on the radio
see if we can get some air support
mottola starts working the radio trying to remain calm as
projectiles explode in bright flashes around the marines
correggio frustrated peers through the smoke
what are we shooting at
command says air power is totally committed
enemy contact all over the area
martinez stares back at this ominous news as
the marines fire back into the thick smoke
but the enemy attack keeps increasing in ferocity
one projectile hits a wall above lenihan
it explodes some kind of liquid splashing onto him
his helmet is being eaten away by the liquid
imlay is immediately at lenihans side pulling the helmet off
lenihans skin is blistering oozing
my face man
hows my face
ugly as ever bro
the squad hunkers down trying to find any cover available behind cars trees
martinez drops behind a car pulls out his map checking it for escape routes
chaos as enemy tracer fire increases exploding around them
martinez looks desperate forced to flee from cover by the alien fire
he leads them further down the side street
we can hold this position lieutenant
were gonna get pinned down
sir these things seem to be operating tactically
dont let them dictate your decisions
move to live marines
the squad follows martinez retreating
just a sidewalk separates the houses opposite each other
nantz looks at the heavy foliage dense shrubs and trees on both sides
he knows its an ambush
this is the kill zone
nantz slings his combat shotgun forward
on nantz order the squad opens fire just as
alien fire explodes from the thick cover of bushes and trees
nantz leads the brutal counterattack pumping and firing his combat shotgun
martinez is shouting orders directing the men as
kerns backs against a fence overwhelmed by the chaos
he aims shoots
then he freezes
correggio steps in front of kerns firing to protect him
lenihan takes a hit from the enemy tracer fire explodingaz around the marines
hes blown back into thick bushes as
the rest of the squad battles fiercely
an alien projectile slams into cpl
the spray of liquid bubbles out from the wound
then something grabs grayston through the bushes
nantz sticks his shotgun into the bushes fires
and grayston is suddenly free
nantz drags him into
the squad follows correggio pulling kerns into the yard
guerrero imlay and simmons lay down an awesome barrage with powerful saws squad automatic weapon covering
trees and bushes are shredded houses are splintered
all this mayhem allows the squad to
the marines are sweaty bleeding scared
oh my god
keep your shit together
what the hell are those things
theyre the goddamn enemy
yeah and theres a million of em
whered they come from
whyd they come here
just calm down
we keep shooting them
why dont they die
stow that shit private
turns to the others watch the yard
secure the back

the marines take up firing positions at windows and doors
kerns stares back deer in the headlights
adukwu is wrapping graystons arm as grayston fumbles for a cigarette
adukwu lights it for him
these thingsll kill me
grayston stares at his arm ironically hell now that just aint fair
nantz moves to martinez who is staring down at the wounded grayston and guerrero
sir what are your orders
martinez turns stares at nantz
i led us right into that ambush
lets figure out how we get out of here
well medevac the wounded from that park
nantz nods turns to mottola
radio the fob
get us a medevac at that park by the community center
as mottola works the radio hes startled to see guerrero who has been slashed across both eyes
i cant see motorola
mottola horrified steadies his voice
youll be okay
a slight beat
youre one shitty liar bro
hey where the hell is lenihan
everyone stops stares
lenihan pressing a hand into his side blood oozing between his fingers peers into the back yard at
a swimming pool its water gently lapping
a garage nearby
lenihan startled by the sound of aliens running in the alley behind the house takes cover by the garage
he struggles to remain calm
then the sound fades
lenihan starts to edge out as
a bang rings out on the far side of the garage
lenihan spins back behind cover eyes desperately searching
nantz shoulders his m
martinez eyes him
ill go for lenihan sir
well package the wounded then rally on th street
go with the sergeant
the two quickly step to nantz
we got your six sergeant
anything you need
what i need is for you to keep quiet
and stay close
starting now private
as nantz turns mottola slaps imlay in the helmet
lenihan creeps around the garage spies a side door leading into it
he grabs the handle
mercifully the door opens
lenihan falls into the dark garage
boxes and old furniture
just one dirt stained window on an opposite wall
lenihan crouches in the dim light coughs spitting up blood
he turns on his radio says into it motorola
his radio buzzes back with nantz voice lenihan
this is sgt
sergeant jesus i had to turn the radio off
these things are everywhere
nantz is moving with mottola and imlay
were coming for you lenihan
whats your location
lenihan looks across the garage out of the window
im in a garage
i can see two palm trees right next to it
house is white with black shutters
just as something bangs against the garage
is the house a two story
lenihan stares his eyes going wide panicked
lenihan is the house a
lenihan clicks the radio off
then waits very still listening m held tightly
his breathing turns shallow from loss of blood and from fear
lenihan sees the branches of a bush swaying outside the window as if something just brushed past it
nantz mottola and imlay moving through the thick smoke
nantz still trying to raise lenihan on the radio
imlay taps nantz on the shoulder motions to his ears
he hears something
the marines freeze nantz clicking the radio off as
nearby they hear sounds of aliens running
the marines crouch weapons up straining to see through the smoke
they remain stock still
the sound fades into the distance
nantz looks at the men
they creep forward as
lenihan moves to the window searching the garage floor desperate not to step on anything that would make noise
he edges forward to peer through the dirty glass
thud thud thud
on the garage roof now
lenihan looks up panicked as
the window suddenly crashes in
lenihan spins firing wildly lighting up the garage as
he stumbles to the door fumbling for the handle falling
out of the garage
lenihan staggers back eyes darting along the garage roof gun aimed
as lenihan continues backing away peering through the drifting smoke at the garage hes unaware that behind him
lenihan doesnt see it but he senses it
he turns fires
a splash as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back into the pool disappearing under the water
quickly nervously he loads another mag edging to the pool
he peers over the pool edge
an indiscernible dark form lays on the bottom of the pool
lenihan is transfixed a moment
then he raises his rifle to punch more rounds into the thing as
the creature launches out of the water
as nantz mottola and imlay burst into the yard
they fire as does lenihan
the fusillade of bullets tears the creature up
the marines stop firing as the alien falls to the ground
they stare amazed at the ft
tall alien corpse
rigid skeleton bursting out of its skin some strange layer of machinery intertwined with its flesh
oh my god
what the hell are these things
theyre butt ugly thats what they are
nantz grabs onto lenihan noticing his wound
were gonna get you to the medevac private
thank you sergeant
thanks for coming for me
ever get separated from your unit again ill find you and shoot you myself
imlay slings lenihans arm around his shoulder and theyre instantly moving running from the yard
the men meet up with the others
adukwu and kerns carrying grayston on a litter simmons holding onto the blinded guerrero guiding him
all right lets get to the community center
they head off simmons still supporting guerrero as thwack
an alien projectile slams into simmons throat
choking he crumples to the ground
guerrero stands blind helpless
the marines spin searching for targets
stavrou hoists simmons as the marines run off firing to cover their retreat as
the silhouettes of dark alien forms are visible on distant rooftops watching the rifle squad disappear down the street
nantz martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently through the street supporting their wounded
they take cover behind cars peering out to see
the park in the distance
a wide open field with a community center building on the far side
there are distant sounds of warfare but the area here seems strangely quiet
then out of the smoke an image appears
something moving the marines all shift aim forward about to blast away as
four marines come into view moving ghost like
nantz signals with his flashlight
the marines hurry over silently falling behind the cars
you guys are
nd squad rd platoon
wheres the rest of your unit
this is it lieutenant
everyone else is dead or missing
the news hits martinez hard
he eyes nantz
we were on the street like ten minutes and they ambushed us
as soon as we radioed for help its like they were everywhere
medevacs incoming lieutenant
stay with us
and the squad moves out
a large field stretches from the street to a squat building the community center
the specter of lights is thrown onto the field an other worldly effect until we realize the lights are coming from
descending steadily its thundering rotors whipping the air
load the wounded
harris lets find the civilians
martinez nantz and harris run to the community center as
the wounded are hustled to the chopper as it touches down
the marines burst in looking around
to the right a gym
to the left a hallway with numerous side rooms off of it
the marines immediately move toward it peering down the dark hall
then the door to a side room opens to reveal
a woman michele staring out looking shell shocked
how many of you
a man joe rincon jacket and tie behind her
theres five of us
nantz is immediately moving
where are the kids
he pushes past the adults sees two girls and a boy
the marines run up to the chopper with the wounded
inside the medevac they see wounded laid across the helicopters cabin
a crewman in the medevac yells over the din you called in with two wounded
we got four
cant take four
we have no room
make goddamn room
the crewman relents in the face of stavrous impressive bulk tries to make room
imlay and stavrou get simmons and grayston on
mottola helps guerrero in squeezing his hand
ill work on that mix for you
think im gonna need it
lenihan crawls onto the choppers deck with imlays help
you just had to get outta the shit
lenihan smiles back
were moving now
imlay bumps fists with lenihan backs away as
nantz runs out with the boy
followed by martinez and harris hustling the two girls out
stavrou hold it
stavrou tries to hold the chopper screaming at it as
nantz martinez and harris run to the chopper with the kids
the marines around the medevac are screaming up at it trying to hold it but to no avail
the chopper gains altitude as suddenly
a shock wave of energy fires from the west as
the medevac takes a direct hit
the devastating energy wave blasts it end over end
the massive helicopter crashes into a house blocks away exploding as
nantz turns ominously as an unearthly buzzing sound fades in
lights are advancing from a street leading to the field
as the sound and lights build nantz runs to the other marines to get them off that field
he pulls on them urging them to the community center doors
they reach the community center fall into it just as
glowing through the heavy cover of smoke
the strobing lights of some strange alien aircraft zooming overhead
speeding toward lincoln
firing pulsing waves of energy lighting up the distant sky
the marines and civilians fall into the large entryway
the marines are breathing hard looking stunned
goddamn flying saucers now
all those guys on the chopper
whyd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit
that is not relevant imlay
theyre trying to kill us
kill them first
martinez eyes nantz on this
then barks orders secure the perimeter
stavrou give me an ammo check
correggio take three men set up an observation post on the roof
you heard the lieutenant
the dazed marines begin covering doors and hallways
we see in their faces that its a very different fight now
nantz turns can see the medevac ablaze out a window
his solemn stare hints at a growing desperation
martinez steps up to him looks out
quietly they got air power too
knocked that medevac right out of the sky
so much for ruling the air
nantz just keeps staring out
these men are scared
a little compassion would go a long way
nantz turns on martinez now
hows that gonna help them survive lieutenant
ill lead these marines
but dont ask me to get close to them
nantz walks off
marines on post watching various windows and doors
imlay kneels by the kids who look devastated by the days events
imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen wiping the dust and dirt from the kids faces
the younger girl kirsten begins crying
she suddenly hugs imlay
imlay startled by this looks uncomfortable at first
then hugs the little girl back smiling at the older
girl any kirstens sister
youre not gonna leave us are you
then imlay smiles
no way sweetheart
the woman michele mcdermott is clearly rattled struggling for composure eyes constantly moving to the kids
rincon a calm watchful air about him stands with his son hector the kid who nantz had carried to the chopper
my son and i came here
there were only three cops spread pretty thin
then those things attacked
police couldnt stop them
what happened to everyone
i dont know
most people ran
we hid in a side room found michele and the girls
couldnt see what happened
i have my nieces for the week
my sister and her husband are in hawaii for their anniversary
is it safe there
i heard this is happening in other places
martinez is at a loss for words
what do they want from us
why are they here
right now our job is just to get you to safety okay
harris appears from the hallway
lieutenant something you should see
the door opens
nantz and martinez edge out with harris
as they peer into the smoke drifting past the building an image becomes clear
an alien body
on the ground nearby
ripped by bullets
they step to it cautiously realizing
its not quite dead
the alien moves turning as if to stare back at them
without a word nantz lifts his rifle shoots it in the head
hector sits with kirsten and amy digging candy nerds out of his backpack
he turns to the other kids holding the box out
both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy
then hector notices imlay standing nearby
want some nerds
imlay holds his hand out
hector shakes candy into it as
nantz enters calling to adukwu adukwu bring your kit
adukwu is immediately up moving to nantz
were gonna cut one of these things open
see if we can figure out what makes em tick
michele overhears offering maybe i can help sergeant
im a vet
youre a veteran
cant help but smile no a veterinarian
well thanks um
nantz has forgotten her name
smiles embarrassed sorry
mottola walks up
cant raise anybody on the radio
were cut off
off nantz look
kerns correggio and two nd squad marines are on watch peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof
all on edge exhausted dirty
no one says a word
correggio eyes the other marines
they exchange an all clear sign
then correggio pulls up a radio
were clear up here
correggio and kerns look over the destroyed streets smoke and flames rising from buildings in the distance glimpses of white phosphorous raining down
a beat then
kerns looks at correggio starts to chuckle at the absurdity of it all
then correggio laughs
then the laughter slows
you think those things get scared
theyre probably just grunts like us
probably dumped into battle told to go fight
kerns looks out
the constant thud and crack of warfare
a city crumbling
v i thought i could handle it
you are handling it
thing im worried about is nantz
sergeant saved our ass at that ambush
he knows what hes doing
tell my brother that
nantz enters with michele and adukwu
stavrou and harris are in the room with martinez
they step aside revealing
the alien body on the floor
michele stops stares
she and adukwu are both taken aback at the sight of one of these things up close
you sure you can do this
i was more sure two minutes ago
she looks to adukwu
they step to the body together as
nantz approaches martinez
whats the plan lieutenant
mission is still to get the civilians to the forward operating base
weve got a battalion there all that firepower
i was thinking i saw a bus couple of blocks back on th
maybe we should stay on foot
martinez looks at nantz
then opens a map pointing to santa monica airport on it
the fob is here at the airport
thats miles to cover with those kids
and those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour
thinking deciding weve got to move fast
we have no radio contact nothing to let us know the best route to take
and a bus is a big target
i made the call sergeant
its my responsibility
then nantz nods turns
harris stavrou lieutenant needs recon on a
it was abandoned two blocks south off th
if it runs get it back here
can you hotwire a bus
gestures to stavrou hes from jersey sergeant
a nod from nantz on this
correggio and kerns are surveying the street
correggio pulls the radio up talks quietly into it stavrou harris
stavrou and harris peer out an exterior door as they hear correggio v
from the radio youre clear down th street
they exchange a quick glance
every day a holiday buddy
every meal a feast
they slip outside running off silently
correggio and kerns watch harris and stavrou run down the street covering them with their m s
adukwu and michele scalpels in hand hover over the alien body
its thick leathery skin has been sliced open
martinez and nantz observe imlay on post nearby
hows it going
well lieutenant im a medic dr
mcdermotts a vet
we werent sure who was most qualified to cut this thing open
its been surgically modified
he pulls tissue aside revealing where the aliens gun is attached to its arm
part of its arm has been amputated to fit this weapon
talk about commitment to cause
adukwu examines a vented cap just to the right of where the aliens heart would be
thick fleshy veins run from it
what is that thing
hes from nigeria lieutenant
not a different solar system
nantz looks over at imlay
thank you private
adukwu twists the cap
it comes free revealing
a gelatinous organ
slimy viscous fluid seeping from it
everyone steps back reacting to the putrid smell
whoa that stinks
everyone steps back except michele that is
unfazed she takes her scalpel makes an incision across the organ
im gonna puke
swear to god im gonna puke
whatever you do do it quietly imlay
stavrou forces the door of a metro bus open climbs into the bus ducking below the steering wheel as
harris covers staring off to the far street
tree branches there cast long shadows which sway with the breeze
the indistinct form of an alien scout appears in the shadows
first thing i wired was a school bus
trying to impress this betty
she had a huge rack
move your ass
stavrou doesnt look up
just works diligently
dont rush genius
correggio and kerns remain still peering into the distance
you seeing what im seeing
correggio pulls binoculars
pov through binoculars a side street trees overhanging it
alien shapes massing on the side street
appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees
then the pov through binoculars pans to pick up
in the path of the alien movement
correggio grabs the radio
movement meters up th
suddenly a loud bang rings out below them
what the hell was that
they exchange glances with the other marines across the roof
all four move quickly converging on one side of the building look down the side of it
an exterior door leading into the center is broken open
michele finishes her incision carefully peels a section of something vaguely metallic is revealed within it
as michele touches her scalpel to it it sparks
then starts rhythmically glowing
looks like its receiving a signal
suddenly the organ convulses rapidly
nantz sees the aliens gun vibrating now the whole arm twitching spreading through the aliens body like a seizure
this things still alive
nantz pulls his ka bar fighting knife thrusting it deep into the organ twisting viciously
the organ stops vibrating
the glow fades
the body slumps
not so hard to kill when you know where to aim
mottola appears in the room a sense of controlled panic
theres a breach
the marines step from the side room with michele
they peer up and down the dark hallway listening
other doors along the hall take on an ominous presence now
they in the building
no clue sergeant
an exterior door was broken open
maybe we should gather the civilians in the gym
good idea sergeant
stavrou still beneath the wheel
harris eyes on the street as the radio crackles with correggios voice harris hostiles advancing right at you
approximately two hundred meters and closing
stavrou hops into the drivers seat tries to start the bus
it doesnt turn over
harris and stavrou exchange a quick glance
stavrou drops below the wheel again
more ominous bangs ring out from down the long hallway building in intensity
nantz stands staring down the dark hall with his m surprised as martinez steps up next to him
were in it together sergeant
martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now
get that bus here
mottola is on the radio frantic where the hell is that bus
stavrou is still underneath the wheel
harris looks out to see aliens rounding the corner in the distance
get this thing started
hey why didnt i think a that
down the hall the sound of a door splintering
were out of time
martinez looks into the gym sees the kids staring back
get em out
imlay swings the gym door open moving the civilians out
nantz and martinez stand together aiming at the hall as
a final bang
we hear a door being burst open
nantz in the front exchanges a glance with martinez at the ominous sight of
a plume of black smoke rising in the distance
screech to a halt at the obstacle course of battle wreckage strewn across the street
noxious black smoke is rising from burning humvees and trucks
smoking craters pothole the street
those alien ships took the whole line out
weve got forty minutes til they level this area
get us to the forward operating base
stavrou lays on the gas speeding away as in the back the other marines stare out
mottola peers into the sky
where the hell are all our jets
the bus snakes through jammed streets abandoned cars bombed out buildings
martinez is in the front with stavrou nantz in the middle of the bus hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor
rincon holds hector michele with her arms around both girls
marines on the seats above weapons ready
nantz hears imlay whispering to harris why the helld the lieutenant wanna take a bus
were sittin ducks
low hard the calls been made private
you so eager to decide the fate of all these people
imlay is stone silent
didnt think so
then nantz looks up meeting eyes with martinez as
a noise in the distance now
a low vibration building
nantz moves to martinez
they peer out of the front
lights fill the sky heading east
as they approach
the vibration gets louder and louder shaking the bus now
everybody get down weapons inside the bus
make no noise
the men pull their guns in from the windows crouching as low as possible straining to see hear
the vibrations grow louder louder
an alien aircraft rips overhead
then another and another and another
all heading east
the image of their speed their power their other worldliness is overwhelming devastating
nantz stares relief flooding his face as the armada flies on
leaving them behind
suddenly mottolas radio blares
all stations this net urgent traffic
multiple enemy aircraft moving east
as the transmission rings out nantz looks up to see
one alien ship split from the armada turn back to the bus
its coming back
the children scream marines agitated
all hear a low vibration echoing off buildings heading their way
staring at the radio kill that radio
mottola turns off the radio
the alien aircraft stops
hovers a moment
theyre tracking our signals
all radios cell phones keep everything off
everyone stares silently tensely
a single beam of light suddenly shines from the alien craft
then the alien aircraft moves forward again
but still heading their way
its still coming
nantz grabs a portable radio
he looks around the bus sees the little girl kirsten ponytail in her hair
he leans down to her
could i have your uh hair thing
she stares wide eyed at this fearsome sweating marine
she pulls the pony tail holder from her hair hands it to nantz
heads to the front
anything happens lieutenant get the saws up front and take off with these kids
nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm
heading toward a gas station
nantz glances back sees
the alien aircraft searching the street below getting closer and closer to the bus as
amy and kirsten pressed under seats michele covering them up
hector closing his eyes in his dads arms
the marines duck low gripping their weapons
they hear the aircraft coming closer almost above them
light starts shining through the windows as
nantz almost to the gas station wraps the pony tail holder around the radio looks back to see
the alien aircraft stop hovering over the bus
shining lights into it scanning scanning
hectors eyes widen staring up at the light
michele pulls the girls in closer trying to calm them herself
its gonna be okay its gonna be okay its all gonna be okay
everyone freezes as the beam reflects off the walls filling the space with a horrible bright light exposing them as
nantz presses the push to talk button on the radio as
the alien craft suddenly turns in nantz direction
nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio keeping the button on it depressed so its sending a constant signal
he slides the radio toward one of the gas pumps
keeps moving diving behind a van across the street
nantz peers around it sees
the alien aircraft heading for the gas station descending
nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his m
the alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps its unearthly hum growing louder and louder as
the gas pump explodes
a massive fireball hits the alien nantz flattens himself to the street as
the alien aircraft trailing smoke and flames thunders out of control right over him
then crashes into a building
marines ducking civilians screaming as
debris from the alien ship blows over the bus burning pieces falling to the ground
nantz runs out from behind the van checks the remains of the burning alien aircraft rifle raised
no alien inside
the ship is a drone
nantz takes this in then starts back for the bus
nantz runs back onto the bus as stavrou pulls swiftly away
that ship was an unmanned drone lieutenant
and that alien we cut open had something in it receiving signals
they must have one helluva command and control center
martinez pulls his map out eyes nantz
that was some real john wayne shit sergeant
nantz tries to shrug it away
but martinez nails him
dont do it again
we work as a team sergeant
were clear lieutenant
nearby imlay whispers to mottola whos john wayne
martinez looks up from the map turns to stavrou
take the freeway corporal
cuts half the distance off our drive
we get on that freeway well be exposed
it doesnt seem like were much safer out here
weve got two shitty options im choosing the one that gets us there fastest
then quietly we dont want to be in this area when the bombs start to fall
the bus bangs past a few stalled cars cruising up a ramp onto the freeway
martinez and nantz crouch near the front keeping watch
from this elevated vantage point on the freeway the big picture emerges in the distance the battle front is moving east
a defensive line of tanks is visible blasting away at aliens
swarms of drone aircraft engage f jets flying at them
double time corporal
the bus barrels forward careening between cars knocking some out of the way
take the next exit
were two clicks from the fob
the bus drives onto the shoulder past the sea of abandoned cars heading to the off ramp
nantz appears uneasy
they are exposed on this freeway and he doesnt like it
he moves to the back peering out windows checking angles
michele looks up as he passes sees a gash on nantz head
your head sergeant
nantz touches his head looks at the blood
he wipes it on his pants
michele smiles at him softly
bet when you woke up this morning you didnt think your day would end up like this
thats a pretty safe bet
stavrou guns the bus backwards knocking abandoned cars out of the way
guess you were right sergeant
a projectile explodes next to the bus
sending cars flying
shrapnel tears a giant hole through the side of the bus
two nd squad marines are instantly killed blown clear out of the hole
stavrou hits the gas backing the bus up the best he can
an illumination heading toward them
another projectile destroys an overpass behind the bus
and aliens are streaming at them in the distance
stavrou works the shift grinding gears gunning the bus
behind a concrete divider close by the collapsed off ramp
the off ramp now dangles precariously a foot cliff face of missile scarred concrete and re bar
martinez looks over to nantz not sure what to do
to martinez low lets dismount set up a perimeter get the civilians down to the street
stavrou get down that ramp secure the street
kerns adukwu help get the civilians off the freeway
stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off ramp
harris imlay give us overwatch up on the roof
the rest of you push out meters set up a perimeter
and dont forget aim chest right
imlay joins harris smashing the skylight out of the bus roof climbing out taking position on the bus roof
the rest of the marines exit the bus
nantz grabs adukwu
stay here with the civilians
as soon as stavrou gives the sign get them down to the street
nantz starts off the bus
looks up at nantz are we gonna die
nantz turns back to hector
manages a smile
course not kid were the good guys
and nantz is off the bus
imlay and harris prone propped on their elbows imlay scanning through binoculars sees
alien fighters coming their way
i got about three dozen hostiles twelve oclock
nantz stands with martinez at the concrete barrier
nantz scans the marines positions
prepare to repel
this might get up close and personal
just a low clattering now the battle rattle of nantz and his men fixing bayonets to their rifles
nantz yells out
being vastly outnumbered provides a marine rifleman with what
a target rich environment sir
we stand here
let these bastards know who theyre fucking with
sporadic fire now as the marines fire on the advancing aliens still at a distance
stavrou descends down the collapsed off ramp negotiating the fractured angled slab of roadway
kerns covers him above from the freeway
stavrou hits the ground securing the area
he looks up at kerns and gives him the all clear sign
kerns takes off
adukwu stands in
the bus looking out to see kerns running back to them signalling
adukwu turns to the civilians crowded behind him
okay its clear
were gonna go
amy and kirsten terrified look up at michele
she hurries the girls to the door of the bus as kern runs up
ill be right behind you
adukwu picks up amy
kerns picks up kirsten
takes a breath telling them himself its gonna be scary but we can do it okay
an alien round flies through the bus shattering the back window
the girls scream
kerns and adukwu race away running with the girls
rincon grabs hector
he and michele follow
to the off ramp
it seems like a long way off
they run past correggio rocking a saw full auto
the fire is deafening
rincon and michele breathing ragged feet pounding look up
theyre getting closer and closer to the off ramp as
alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway
up ahead kerns and adukwu rush the girls to the edge of the ramp hurrying to get them down as
rincon and michele reach the off ramp now
kerns grabs hector helping him angle down the off ramp getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting stavrou as
rincon spins sees the marine drop screaming
rincon looks back at adukwu who is busy getting michele down the off ramp now
then rincon looks back to the freeway sees mottola writhing in agony
rincon runs to mottola kneeling next to him
mottola looks up at rincon fear in his eyes
its okay son
i got you
rincon starts to pull mottola toward the off ramp
struggling to get him to safety
mottolas body starts to convulse
rincon stops tries to control him
sees mottolas eyes rolling back in his head
then rincon is horrified when he looks up to see
aliens racing forward
heading his way
moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars
rincon redoubles his efforts pulling on the injured mottola
as he does he looks back up to see
the aliens are almost on top of him now as
the first alien is shot by
nantz suddenly there m poised
rincon looks from nantz to
more aliens coming at them
no choice rincon picks up the injured mottolas rifle
scared but resolute
he looks at nantz
what do i need to know
the slightest beat then
its set to fire in three round bursts
were low so dont waste your shots
rincon holds the m against his shoulder aiming
just sight down the barrel
and give em hell
rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at one alien in the distance
he squeezes the trigger
adukwu sees rincon and the wounded mottola now
he runs to them incoming rounds whizz by as
adukwu bends over mottola seeing that hes dead
adukwu closes mottolas eyes as
an alien appears from behind a car aiming straight at adukwu
it is about to fire as
rincon fires blowing the alien away
adukwu looks up realizing rincon just saved him
he meets eyes with rincon who stares back stunned a moment by his own actions
adukwu immediately shouts a
rincon snaps back turns to fire
a moment too late as
rincon is hit
adukwu grabs rincon sees the pain and fear in the civilians eyes
adukwu rips open packages of quickclot begins spreading the fast clotting powder on rincons wounds as
harris and imlay firing
from this height they can see the full expanse of freeway more waves of aliens coming using abandoned cars as cover
shit lieutenant were gonna be overrun
nantz and martinez exchange a desperate glance on this
looks around assessing the situation
gimme two of your smoke cannisters
martinez pops two canisters off hands them to nantz
take someone to cover you
nantz turns sees correggio
then he turns the other way sees kerns
im not worried about fightin next to you kerns
now lets go
a slight smile from kerns on this as he follows nantz
who sprints low scurrying between cars
yards closer to the enemy
nantz and kerns arrive at a large suv
kerns ducks low covering nantz
nantz crouches opens the gas tank
unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body tossing the canister aside
pulls the pin
flips the spoon off
get ready to move on my word
nantz holds the fuse over the open gas cap
nantz drops the fuse into the gas tank
they go running back toward the bus as
the suv explodes in a ball of flames
nantz and kerns dive behind another vehicle kerns crouching laying cover fire
nantz pulls a fuse
pops up fires ready
nantz drops the fuse they run
the car explodes in flames
nantz runs to another car making sure kerns is with him
harris and imlay see what nantz is doing
hes creating a wall of flame
funneling the enemy into one narrow corridor
forcing them through the opening between the cars on fire
damn sergeant sure as shits ninja
he just gave us a kill zone didnt he corporal
soon as they come through blow em back to hell
the first alien appears through the burning corridor
imlay blows it away
harris blows away the next
nantz and kerns fall back behind the bus next to martinez correggio and a nd squad marine
along with harris and imlay on the bus roof they are the only ones left holding the aliens off
all fire forward as
more and more aliens begin pouring through braving the flames
into the line of fire
many aliens go down
but because of their sheer numbers few start to make it through firing back at the marines
martinez sees the nd squad marine go down in front of him
martinez rushes to his side
martinez rises to shoot and
martinez is hit
he looks down blood running over his belt
shock on his face
hes been shot in the stomach
martinez looks around
the remaining aliens now only cars apart from them
two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured metal firing directly into the faces of their enemy
martinez pulls himself together struggling over to nantz
pull the men back
pull em all back now sergeant
im gonna stay and cover
nantz looks at martinez about to say something
sees the blood draining from his stomach down his legs
nantz grabs martinez pulling him up
we gotta get you outta here
no way were leavin you
i said i got it
im not leaving you here to die
thats not your call sergeant
now get your men outta here
he pushes nantz away looks around the chaos slowing down for him
he reaches into his vest
martinez hands the letter we saw earlier to nantz
a moment between them
nantz nods then spins moving yelling to the men
were pulling back
head to the lower street now
nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off ramp laying cover as the men head down
harris and imlay slide down off the roof of the bus joining the others running to the off ramp
martinez staying behind shooting at the aliens drawing their fire
what about the lieutenant
keep movin corporal
all the men climb down the off ramp
nantz turns to go back to get the lieutenant himself sees
martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus
martinez behind the back of the bus struggles to breath still drawing fire
grabs his radio
this is lieutenant bennie martinez u
aliens converge toward the back of the bus
twenty aliens heading for the signal
heading for martinez
st platoon nd battalion th marines
he turns sees nantz coming back for him
martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest
holds it up for nantz to see
then unscrews the fuse pops open the gas cap of the bus
nantz turns dives for cover as
martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank
a flash of fear across his face as
aliens are on him as
massive fire ball shooting feet into the sky
nantz raises his head debris raining down sees
his eyes wide at martinezs sacrifice the burden now on him hes in charge of the men the civilians
nantz gets to his feet
runs for the off ramp
nantz drops down the destroyed off ramp
runs to the marines and civilians behind the abandoned van
he sees adukwu working on rincon hector crying in micheles arms
rincon for transport
weve got to move
did you just leave lt
martinez back there
martinez stayed behind
he knew he was dying
so you left him
is that how it is with you
he sacrificed himself to save our asses
steps to correggio now you get your head straight corporal
this is my unit now
nantz looks at the men who stare back shaken
we need shelter
those bombs are gonna drop
a frantic dash through the street rubble and fires all over
marines carry the kids
hector in harris arms head swiveling eyes searching for his dad sees
imlay and adukwu carrying rincon who appears lifeless
a dark empty store
the marines burst in aiming rifles
tighten this place down
see if we can establish communications
hard line only
the marines move into position covering windows and doors
nantz turns to michele huddling with the kids
listen were out of the bomb zone
but when they fall we will definitely be rocked
make sure the kids are prepared for that
hector suddenly breaks free rushing forward
as imlay and adukwu enter with rincon setting him down
nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack covering rincon
as he does we see a glimpse of rincons blood soaked clothing
he is very pale
blood flecks his lips
hector stares into his fathers face eyes filling
rincon touches hectors face lightly
itll be okay
well get your dad fixed up
but when hector looks to nantz on this he cant meet the boys gaze
hector can see this isnt the truth
listen to me son
im not going to make it
a slight beat but you will
i dont want to go without you
but you have to
now wait with michele a minute
let me talk to the sergeant
reluctantly hector allows michele to lead him away
rincon we can take you and
rincon turns to nantz steel eyed
dont waste time sergeant
you and i both know whats going on here
i cant leave you
you cant take me
nantz is silent at a loss
imlay stares at a clock on the wall calls out four minutes and those bombs drop sergeant
nantz looks over at this
but his expression is blank
he turns back to rincon whos staring straight into him
i keep playing it over in my head
if id done things differently
maybe i could have gotten hector out earlier
you cant look back
you make the best decision you can
just promise youll get my son out of here sergeant
nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him
rincon holds out his hand
nantz takes it meeting his gaze
im trusting you with the only thing i have in this world
nantz stares nods
hard wire connection
nantz turns to see harris behind a counter at a computer an internet connection on its screen
the marines crowd around reading the ominous headline
global invasion alien creatures attack from oceans pictures of aliens racing through urban streets swarming over cars stuck in massive lines of traffic
underneath these pictures we see captions a litany of doom battle tokyo
battle cape town
battle los angeles
then a buddy list pops up on the screen an instant message baby is that you
damn thats cherise
harris quickly types back a response you ok
the message comes back no real scared
harris responds where are you
he hits send
but the message doesnt go through
he clicks the mouse
but the computer has frozen
then internet connection lost pops up on screen
harris stands walks from the computer
stavrou watches him go as
hector steps back to his dads side
rincons eyes open slowly
he looks at hector
manages a small smile
reaches out wipes a tear from his sons face
im very proud of you son
youre being so brave
hector throws his arms around his father hugging him tightly
i love you hector
his face peaceful
hector is silent tears rolling down his face
get away from the windows
get those kids behind cover
the marines back away from the windows into the center of the store hunkering down with the civilians
everyone stares at the clock on the wall as it ticks
fry those bastards
those bombs drop then everythings gonna change
get to the fob get some goddamn ammo
some goddamn food
some goddamn tanks
everyone stares as
the clock ticks to nine
fear grows on everyones faces
they shoulda dropped right

theyd feel it in nevada
maybe its good
maybe we turned the tide
yeah right imlay
cause we were kickin ass out there
whats happening sergeant
whats that mean
i dont know
adukwu quietly approaches nantz now voice low
rincon is dead
nantz turns staring off at hector sitting by his father
its all too much
nantz takes a deep breath his mind racing the world closing in on him
he turns to michele
listen our forward operating base is about a mile away
we have to go on foot
ill need your help with hector now
watches as nantz slowly walks to hector
nantz kneels by the boy
im sorry hector
didnt make it
hector sobbing overwhelmed by grief and fear looks up at nantz
i dont wanna be here
i want my dad back
i want it all to go back to the way it was before
stavrou eyes on the still street sees
two alien scouts appear
they crouch by a car
sergeant we got hostiles in front
all the marines stiffen the clatter of rifles being raised
but nantz tearing up himself just stays focused on hector
me too hector
i wish it could go back too
more aliens appear now moving toward the store
out of time sergeant
tries to lead hector away
we have to go hector
i want my dad
nantz lifts hector
we see hectors face stricken staring back at his father as hes carried off
the other marines gather up michele and the girls
and everyone is moving silently through the store as
the plate glass window is shattered as
an alien smashes through it
the alien is very still peering around
then it begins to creep forward as
a second alien then a third a fourth follows leaping into the store with sinewy power
nantz peers out a back door
they move out just as
more aliens leap in
they move in formation through the store as
the back door silently shuts
as nantz and the others slip out of the back
blow something up
as the others race away down the alley
stavrou takes his rifle butt smashes the window of a nearby car
jams the cars gear into
as the massive stavrou pushes the car against the stores harris pulls his ka bar fighting knife
slides under the car
punctures the gas tank
as harris rolls away from the flow of gasoline
stavrou lights it
both men run down the alley
dont think theyll be comin out that way
the car blocking the door goes up in flames
stavrou and harris fall behind a building with the others
nantz still holding hector looks off to a side street
he signals to kerns and correggio
check it out
the two marines run down the alley to the side street
nantz sets hector down
looks the boy in the face
this is the hardest thing youll ever have to do
michele arms around kirsten and amy watches nantz
but well get through it together
i promise hector
hector nods still crying
nantz exchanges a glance with michele who moves to hector comforting him
nantz steps away as kerns and correggio run up reporting looks good both directions
out of earshot of the civilians nantz spins to his men with fiery intensity
we are not losing one more of these civilians
am i making myself clear
the group jogs silently down the alley
nantz leads the group down the residential street tidy bungalows on either side
you okay bro
i hadnt a pushed cherise to get married shed still be in chicago
suddenly nantz stops fist raised
the squad halts as
a sound fades in a deep rumbling
the marines fall behind cars now pulling the civilians down with them as the rumbling continues to build
under the cars
the marines frantically shed their packs squirming under the cars with the civilians pulling the kids under as
rounds the corner in the distance thousandsof them filling the street from sidewalk to sidewalk
an army on the move
nantz drags hector under one car with him pulls the boy in close gets his legs under the car under cover just as
the mass of aliens swarm past the ground shaking rumbling
the humans huddle under the cars peering out to see the legs and arms of the aliens flying by
some bound over the cars which bounce up and down banging with the aliens weight
the rumbling ebbs as the aliens disappear into the distance
the squad moves in formation surrounding the civilians
little kirsten comes up behind correggio
hes surprised as she slips her hand into his
correggio looks down seeing how scared she is
he smiles grips her hand tightly
up ahead nantz leads map in hand
how far sergeant
one block over
imlay smiles at kerns
re gonna make it
dude were gonna make it
but as they approach a corner
nantz stops exchanges a glance with his corporals
whats the matter
an ominous beat
the squad moves down the dark street as
ash floats down here from the sky
like a beautiful early winter snow
we slowly move in tighter and tighter on nantz
until we are close on nantz face
a reddish glow is reflected there
nantz stops looking horrified
we reverse to see
a deep black column of smoke rising into the night sky from numerous fires that rage within the fence line of
as they approach the forward operating base the devastation is slowly revealed crashed f jets and cobra helicopters line the runways
bodies and smoldering marine vehicles litter the airfield
they wiped our forward operating base right off the map
now we know why those bombs never dropped
they took our jets out
this was a dug in marine corps position that had armor air and ground
maybe we got nothing left to fight with
michele meets eyes with nantz
his look tells us everything nantz turns spies an airport fire station by the runways
lets get under cover
the marines enter cautiously rifles up
then they hustle the civilians inside when it appears safe
lock this place down
the marines fan out securing doors checking windows as
nantz kneels by hector tries to comfort him
youre a brave kid
when this is over youre going to be a hero
people always say that
hes a hero
no one even knows what a hero is
your dad was a hero
hector just stares back
he saved pvt
adukwu up on that freeway
hector exchanges a glance with adukwu
something passes between them
one man died so another could live
you save a marine under fire you get a medal yknow
nantz pulls out a medallion the crest of the on it
this is our medallion
for your dad
youre now hector
hector takes the heavy medallion looks it over pointing to the motto on it whats that mean retreat hell
during world war i an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat
he said retreat
hell we just got here
nantz is happy to see a slow smile from hector now
harris calls out were secure sergeant
nantz stands on this addresses the marines listen up
we need ammo
kerns adukwu stay with the civilians
the rest of us lets move
nantz puts a hand on hectors shoulder
ill be right back
black plumes of smoke fill the night sky as nantz and his men head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens
the tarmac is a smoldering wasteland empty bombed out buildings on its outskirts burning aircraft and vehicles litter the runways
as they go the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of their fallen comrades pulling out any available ammo
imlay whispers a low heartfelt refrain to the dead marines he searches
he moves on to another fallen marine searching
across the runway nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead marine
then looking up he sees
nantz moves to it
a low whistle from him and the marines look up
they hustle to nantz
everyone gives the lav an excited once over
looks like it just rolled off the goddamn assembly line
good job sergeant
can you drive this thing
hell if its got an engine sergeant i can drive it
get it running
seems like vehicles are targets
a minivans a target correggio
a lav with a bushmaster chaingun
thats an asset
nantz motions to him starting off
nantz points to the control tower its windows blown out
we need to see the big picture
kerns has a tub of ice cream scooping bowls for the kids
my dads a fireman
they love their ice cream
used to visit the firehouse with my little brother they always had tons of it
the kids my brothers not much older than these guys
you dont look much older either
she gazes at the kids pain and anger washing over her
is this day ever going to end
maybe the sergeantll find a way outta here
whats with you guys anyway
doesnt anybody have a first name
lots of family back in nebraska though
hopefully theyre safe
she shakes the thought away
what about you guys
i came here to be a doctor
you should be a surgeon the way you cut into that thing
then his smile fades as he looks around
nantz enters with imlay
they look around
the windows have been blown open
the wind rustles papers through the ghostly space blowing them out into the night
on one desk a computer is flashing a slideshow happy pictures of someones family vacation
from this high vantage point they can see for miles
nantz looks out one end of the control tower sees all the way to the ocean
then he turns looks the other way dead east
a vista of explosions spreading into the distance
alien drone aircraft engage f s
one jet is blown up spiralling to the ground
look how far east theyve gotten
thats almost the whole city
nantz looks out through binoculars sees the hollywood sign ablaze in the hills
then pans to a mid city area
stops when he sees one quadrant of the city blocks wide shimmering an inky black
some kind of dark energy wave emanating from the ground
what the hells that
imlay peers out
theres zero activity there
and the area does seem completely devoid of activity no alien or human aircraft above it
like a dead zone
what are we gonna do sergeant
nantz panning with the binoculars sees a chopper taking off in the distance now
nantz grabs a map on the desk eyes roaming over it
then looks back to where he saw the chopper
that must be the alternate extraction site
maybe we can evacuate the civilians there
he turns to imlay
get them in the lav
ill radio for an evac helicopter
when i do theyll be coming so we have to move fast
think we can make it sergeant
were gonna give it one helluva try imlay
he reassures the young marine with each word were not dying here
the marines absent nantz surround the civilians protectively as they hustle them into the lav
nantz standing alone with a radio pack looking out into the black night wind blowing through the tower
the lav waits on the tarmac below engine running
nantz takes a deep breath
presses the button on the radio
any station this is foxtrot november
i have four civilians and seven marines were heading to alternate extraction point charlie
i say again this is foxtrot november heading to alternate extraction point charlie
nantz turns immediately hurrying out
nantz runs from the tower and climbs into the lav
nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the back amid gear and guns
he turns to stavrou behind the wheel
use the thermal sight
stavrou drives spins away as nantz climbs
he mans the m machine gun
imlay beside him on the mm headlights off running dark stavrou drives peering through the thermal sight
washed green the city a war zone massive destruction
an alien drone winging toward the airport as
the lav moves fast in total darkness down a car strewn street
santa monica airport fading behind them suddenly
bright burst of light
and the control tower explodes in a ball of fire
nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night
miles away the lav drives through a city street surrounded by tall buildings the area a desolate wasteland now
stavrou drives hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers carefully through wrecked abandoned cars
nantz eyes a nervous imlay
extract sites only a couple more miles imlay
imlay nods back
nantz peers down to
eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope
green wash of the city passing by
tall empty buildings all around
suddenly a big dark object in the street
stavrou slams the brakes
civilians and marines in the tight passenger compartment are thrown around
right in front of the lav
a massive crater
the streets impassable
we gotta go around
the lav backs up nantz scanning the sky gripping the m machine gun trying to see out into the darkness
then they turn a corner
and a view between two tall buildings is harrowing
four alien drone aircraft hovering
flying toward them
get ready imlay
here they come
stavrou looks out to see
a helicopter in the distance
think i see our ride sergeant
get us there
cause were about to get lit up
the alien drone ships are winging at them
they are only meters out when
see what that bushmaster can do imlay
imlay opens up on the mm bushmaster chain gun
come on you martian bastards
the bushmaster is a rapid firing cannon spewing rounds a minute each capable of destroying a light tank
for once the aliens are overmatched
the alien ships take heavy fire from the bushmaster
one goes down in flames the others peel off flying behind buildings
whered they go
whered they go
nantz is scanning the sky then
imlay on your six
imlay spins in the turret picking up
the three remaining alien aircraft coming back around
the lead alien ship fires
a car explodes next to the lav
imlay rocks in the turret
son of a
imlay targets fires the bushmaster
the lead alien ship is hit winging out of control into a second ship
the two ships explode into a building as
the final alien aircraft dodges the fireball flying straight at the lav
getting close imlay
i got it
imlay fires a burst
the last aircraft is hit
it pinwheels to the ground exploding into flaming wreckage which hurtles right at the lav
stand on it stavrou
stavrou pushes it trying to outrun the burning wreckage
which is almost on top of the lav as
stavrou spins around a corner escaping
the wreckage explodes into a building behind them as
thump thump thump
the sound of a uh medevac echoes
nantz looks out sees the chopper landing in the street
the lav screeches up amid the rubble and smoke
the marines rush the civilians out of the lav
nantz and imlay scrambling out last
pretty decent shooting imlay
goddamn you did it sergeant
were gonna get these people out
the marines begin loading the civilians in the old school crew chief hopping off to help the kids in
you are in the middle of the shit sergeant
everythings been pulled back
what are you talking about
weve lost most of our air assets
were abandoning los angeles
this citys done
to the pilot lets go
the chopper powers up nantz scrambles on with the others
the chopper begins to lift off
as it rises nantz gazes out at the cityscape
he sees fires wreckage everywhere
then he looks off to see
nantz watches the helicopter bank toward the black zone
but as it gets closer
the helicopter dips precipitously suddenly losing altitude
the kids scream
the marines hang on
nantz sees the pilot struggling with the controls
the helicopters gauges are going crazy
the pilot banks hard away from the area reversing course
and the helicopter stabilizes
what the hell happened
something there was playing hell with our power
nantz stares at this
then notices hector watching
he sees the medallion clutched tightly in hectors hand
sees the words retreat hell
nantz looks back at the mysterious black patch of cityscape
then he turns to the crew chief
set us back down
the other marines in nantz unit look over alarmed now
we need to recon that area
we cant land
may not have power to take off again
nantz looks out
spies a building with a flat open roof
he points to it
then well rope down
what the hell sergeant
whats going on
theres something over there
we could be the only ones left here to figure out what it is
to the others lets go marines
the marines look frightened confused
they start to pull themselves up
ropes are dropped from the chopper as it hovers over the building
the marines start to rappel down one after another as
nantz exchanges a glance with michele
theyll get you safe
he smiles at the girls
then turns nods at hector
puts a hand on his shoulder
see you soon buddy
what are you gonna do
were gonna fight
nantz turns grabs a rope drops out of the chopper
as the chopper hovers nantz drops to the roof hunkers down with the other marines
nantz watches the evac helicopter fly off to safety
then he turns to the marines who stare back hopelessly clearly at their lowest point
whyd we get off the chopper sergeant
cause we have a job to do
but we were getting out
you have some hunch and now were stuck out here in the shit
this fights not over
sergeants gonna get us killed
just like my brother
nantz eyes correggio
its laid open now
believe me correggio i grieved for every marine i ever lost
nantz looks around now from marine to marine
but we are in the fight of our lives right now
and our duty is to keep moving forward
thats how we honor men like your brother correggio
and hectors father who saved adukwus life
he wasnt trained for that
he just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done
if a civilian can do that
nantz contd well then i better square my shit away and do whatever i have to do to defeat this enemy
but i cant do it alone
the tension is palpable
i need you men
and maybe well die fighting today
not because were heroes
but because were goddamn united states marines and always will be
im willing to give my full measure for you
im hoping youll do the same for me
a beat glances exchanged
then all the marines rise as one
well follow you to hell and back
nantz smiles nods
cause thats where were going
the squad is moving in unison covering all around approaching the lav
they jump in
stavrou fires it up drives off as
nantz eyes the jumble of gear
he grabs his combat shotgun a portable radio which he makes sure is off
then an olive case marked gltd
he stuffs it in his pack
laser target sir
might have to get some cruise missiles in here
shit yes sergeant
nantz looks up to see
alien soldiers appearing on the street now
nantz goes back to stuffing his pack
just hit the gas corporal
we got plenty of armor
everyone looks up at this
then looks out to see
the aliens attacking firing on the lav as
stavrou floors it alien fire pinging off the lavs armor as
nantz looks out the back to see some aliens staggering away
aye aye sergeant
as he backs up mowing back over the remaining aliens
the marines cheer
the lav cruises slowly
nantz stares forward
the black dead zone looms ahead
as they get closer it seems like the whole area is absent of light
a black hole
nantz stares out about to answer when the lav lurches then lurches again
stavrou revs the engine
whats going on
losing power sergeant
gauges are dropping
the lav slows
the engine skips
then the lav dies
shes dead sergeant
nantz looks around warily
the streets are quiet deserted
all right dismount
grab anything you think we can use
the men nod and move out of the lav to
correggio and kerns on one side of the street stavrou and harris on the other
imlay with adukwu
nantz watches his men move forward covering each others advance
scanning the buildings searching for targets
then nantz halts them
they crouch together peering at
the middle of the dead zone just ahead of them
it is very dark
no lights are visible from any source
the men sweat
hot as hell here
my watch stopped
somethings generating heat
messing with our electronics
sucking up all the power
nantz scans the street
the sweat dripping into his eyes
where would you put a critical asset if you wanted to protect it
or hide it
nantz points to a subway entrance ahead
the squad runs to the subway entrance stopping just inside
harris adukwu stay here watch the street
harris and adukwu nod
taking position at the entrance
nantz motions to the others
nantz leads stavrou correggio kerns and imlay down the stopped escalator to the subway platform
nantz stands gazing around at the empty subway platform
a train is stopped
it is dark the only light bleeding in from the street above
he motions stavrou to guard against anything coming from above
then he moves forward with the others
a huge number of birds line the dark cavity above the train tracks taking cover themselves roosting quietly
nantz sees a door in the tunnel wall heads to it
he pulls his ka bar knife out sticks the blade into the door jam pops the door open
nantz turns to correggio and kerns
you two stay here watch our backs
imlay come with me
nantz and imlay slip through the doorway
nantz and imlay stand very still peering down the long dark hall looking for movement
nantz motions and they move forward silently guns ready
they turn a corner and stop
it is pitch black here
nantz clicks on his flashlight
they move forward
after only a few feet the flashlight dims and dies
imlay clicks on his flashlight
something is killing anything electronic we use
imlay clicks his flashlight off
but now we see
a dim light ahead
nantz and imlay creep forward very slowly
turn a corner see
a strange light at the end of the hallway
the light glows fiercely as if its shining through the floor
nantz silhouetted by the light signals imlay to stay put
nantz steps forward toward the strange glow of light
as he approaches he realizes its coming through
an iron grate in the floor
nantz moves to the grate kneels peering down into
fifty feet wide the dim tunnel has been further excavated
it is a huge cavern now extending off into the distance further than nantz can see
the huge space is illuminated by masses of alien machinery
an electric hum fills the air
tending the machinery dozens of aliens bigger than the others
one of the aliens turns focusing up right at nantz
nantz spins runs back into the darkness
calling to imlay run imlay
the iron grate flies into the air
nantz and imlay race along in the dark
they hear pounding footsteps of the alien pursuing him
a glimmer of light ahead
along the floor
it is a door
they burst through a door into
nantz follows imlay up the stairs as
the stairwell door below is smashed open
nantz spins swinging his shotgun
the blast illuminates the huge alien filling the stairwell with its horrible bulk
nantz backs up the stairs pumping the shotgun firing
each blast illuminates the alien in a strobe effect
the alien moves up the stares
nantz keeps firing
the noise is deafening in the enclosed space
then the shotgun runs dry
and were left in darkness
imlay clicks on his flashlight revealing
the alien at nantz feet its strange hand on his boot
nantz terrified aims at the alien waiting to see if it will move
nantz and imlay re enter running up to join the others
up the stairs by street level harris and adukwu keep watch
harris motions enemy troops
signals for all the marines to head down the stairs
the marines gather around nantz
to harris how many
hard to tell
i think i got their attention
he opens his pack pulls out the radio and the case marked gltd
theres something big down in the tunnels
its sucking up a lot of power could be a major command
nantz stares at his men
we need to destroy it
but we got no jets left right sergeant
hopefully they can still fire cruise missiles from pendleton or vandenburg
ill radio in a strike paint the target from the street
you know what that means
the man nod solemnly
we gotta hold em off long enough to paint the target
if we can get a transmission out before the radio dies
and the targeting laser lasts long enough for command to get a lock on the target
hell dyings easy ladies
everything else takes balls right
they all laugh softly
lets do it
he takes a deep breath raises the radio and transmits any station this is foxtrot november
priority fire mission
i have identified a major enemy command and control asset located grid
will be lasing
you have visual confirmation of this c c asset
we cant waste resources
theyre building a huge complex underground
i think its the head of the snake
i will be
alien fire explodes now rocking the station
nantz and the marines cover their heads as the station starts to come apart chunks of concrete fall
the walls crack
dust fills the air
nantz screams as a chunk of concrete falls across his ankle
then its over
all is silent
nantz grimacing in pain strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle
the marines rise
pale sweating nantz hobbles to his feet
he slings his rifle and carrying the gltd hurries on his bad ankle to the stairs
nantz looks up
rubble nearly fills the stairway
there is only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling
the men all unclip their web gear begin climbing
a chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance and nantz emerges rolling down the pile to the street
the other marines follow set up a perimeter as
nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble dropping down flattening himself to the ground
he sets the gltd laser designator up on top of the pile
nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser designator
here we go
nantz switches on the targeting laser
a red beam of light shoots from the designator to a fixed point in the center of the street
nantz looks up to see
the street fill with alien soldiers rushing out now
here they come
the marines form a perimeter around the laser opening up on the aliens as
the mass of aliens surges forward like a wave
hold them back
we have to keep the laser on target
an alien goes down
he picks another target and fires
the alien staggers keeps coming
three more rounds and the alien goes down
but the rest keep coming
nantz is picking his targets
turning finding targets reloading the aliens getting closer
then his rifle runs dry
nantz pulls his sidearm
he aim fires shooting a closing alien in its heart
rounds impact around nantz as he shoots another alien
then the next
then his sidearm is out of bullets as
an explosion rips near nantz
knocking the laser away
to the laser
re aiming it as
the marines are pushed into a small circle around the laser
fighting nearly back to back
kerns is hit
he is thrown to the ground but is back up arm bleeding firing
an alien rushes at correggio who spins just in time firing repeatedly until the alien goes down
stavrou swings his rifle butt smashing another alien
it staggers back
stavrou puts numerous rounds into it
an alien reaches adukwu knocking him to the ground about to blast him
harris runs the alien through with his bayonet twisting and firing his rifle at the same time
the alien falls
the marines are fighting as one
all focused on surrounding nantz
then the laser dies
imlay notices the laser beam is gone
did we get a lock
i dont know
an ear splitting noise
the marines look up see
nantz looks up at his men yelling incoming
nantz and his men begin backing away
firing as they do trying to hold off the aliens
nantz limping on his injured ankle goes down
correggio is there to help him up
think you just twisted your ankle
and through it all nantz still smiles at this
were too close to the impact point
the marines start running as
the first missile strikes
a piercing whistle sounds
nantz looks into the sky as
a pound laser guided artillery shell explodes into the ground
the ground heaves up
a massive explosion of fire and smoke erupting from beneath the surface
the marines are enveloped
buildings shatter cars are tossed flames erupt
then silence descends a moment
only the crackle of flames falling glass
the dust and ash settles in a grey haze
nothing could have survived this
a figure rises up out of the grey destruction
as one the men rise out of the ash standing tall
the marines fall in
a phalanx with nantz at its center
they move forward
fighting as one
the seven remaining marines pour fire on the mass of aliens
the drone ships fall from the sky exploding on the ground
the aliens in disarray are mowed down
the rest flee
and as the smoke drifts away there is silence again
nantz looks up to see
standing with smoking weapons ready for more
correggio staggers up covered in dust bloody
you know what sergeant
my brother said you were a bad ass
i had no idea
your brother was one helluva marine correggio
so are you
nantz sits in the rumbling chopper
surrounded by his marines
imlay stares out at the city below
man its quiet
theyre in full retreat throughout los angeles heading back into the ocean
units are mopping up
on this nantz turns to his squad
this has been a hell of a battle
plenty of other battles to go
everybody good with that
the marines dont hesitate
well uh actually sergeant
theres this girl i was supposed to meet up with tonight
im sure shell understand
nantz looks at his marines
i think you men earned the right to call yourselves marines today
im damn proud of every one of you
