written by mark neveldine brian taylor february extreme cu pacman from the old video game just a yellow ball with a mouth fills the screen in all its lo res
the camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor gobbling dots
extreme cu a red ghost follows in hot pursuit
extreme cu pacman gives it the slip cuts down and gobbles a big dot
extreme cu red ghost transforms into blue ghost changes direction and runs
but just before he catches up the blue ghost transforms back to red and changes direction again
pacman barely escapes
pacman flees but at every turn he is confronted by another ghost
the camera pulls out in a series of jump cuts to reveal that unlike the old arcade game this game screen goes e forever an infinite maze
and instead of the original on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides closing in
the sound of the game redoubles reverberates deafening
this scene plays out as a continuous pov shot right up until chevs face is revealed for the first time
chev chelios wakes up in his apartment to a ringing cell phone groggy vision doubled
from his pov we see him examine his hands which dont feel right dont want to move right
the cell phone coming from some other room plays the pacman theme in beeps bee dee dee deee dee deee dee dee dum
he tries to get out of bed hits the ground
plush rug ultra modern bed frame night stand high tech stereo the works
he crawls stumbles into
the living room decked out by kostabi paintings and glass furniture then into
the kitchen with a black marble island and hanging copper
he jams his head under the fossil sink and runs the water
he steadies himself against the matching black marble counter staring at his hands
tries to lift them and bang
hes back on the floor stunned
all the while we hear the faint sound of his heartbeat
he begins crawling back into
the living room toward the telephone where he spots a plain black vhs tape propped up in front of a plasma screen tv with police ribbon wrapped around it tied
in a bow like a present
barely comprehensible whathufuck
he grabs the thing fumbles to unwrap it shoves it into the vcr and pushes play
its ricky verona on the screen a young irritatingly slick eastern euro
little to no accent fast talking sarcastic a complete dick
we see him sitting on chevs bed
chev is visible in the frame unconscious behind verona
pale nicotine sunlight filters in through the blinds
there are hoods loitering around the room
it was apparently shot only hours before
the discernible sound of chevs heartbeat will subliminally increase in speed and volume throughout veronas monologue the cell phone continues to ring somewhere
whats shaking douchebag
thought id give you the heads up
on the tv verona points into the camera
yeah thats right you little bitch
if youre watching this tape it means that i somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal
opting instead to poison you in your sleep
yeah you heard me
we stay with chevs pov as he flashes a frantic glance around the room
the lubdub of the heartbeat is much louder and faster now we really begin to notice it
i fucking poisoned you in your sleep
how sick is that
for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you and theres nothing you can do about it
cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera chev is on his knees in front of the set looking around
we still dont see his face clearly
thats right youre on candid camera try not to embarrass yourself
cut back to chevs pov
he holds his head down over the carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth gagging
let me guess youre trying to puke the shit out right
the shit i gave you is some fucking high tech sci fi chinese synthetic shit that even i dont know exactly what the fuck it is
all i know is once it binds with your blood cells youre fucked baby
and believe me its done binded
by now youll be feeling your joints stiffen up
hard to breath
chev puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his heart
the beats of the heart grow louder still but the rhythm falters begins to slow
your heartbeat is slowing down like theres rust in your veins
youre like the tin man in the wizard of freaking oz
one of the thugs alex contributes from offscreen
amused by his own wit singing if he only had a brain
you get the point
you got maybe an hour max tough guy
the thugs are into it verona is rolling
one of them comes up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on chevs unconscious head
hey its been real
probably shouldve thought twice before you whacked don kim
experiencing a little hindsight
i thought so
have a nice death
finally the camera reverses to reveal chevs slack jawed face staring at the tv
chev is in his late s handsome in an offhanded way
all of the background noise the heartbeat the cell phone cuts to dead silence
and through the silence a single word asshole
a driving soundtrack kicks in
the opening titles play over the following
finding a drunken mans strength chev flips out
he rips the tv out of the stand tearing the wires from the guts of the wall
he launches it straight into the floorboards with a bone breaking crush
he kicks over the rest of the entertainment system jumps on it and heads out of the room
roller dolly follows him on a stumbling rampage through the apartment and down the hall
by the door in an ashtray with his car keys he finds it his god damned cell phone
of course it stops ringing just as he picks it up
he pockets it bangs open the front door and is out
roller dolly stays with him through the door and down the hall as a businesswoman peaks her head out the door then slams it shut terrified and then down the
stairs to the garage door
roller dolly still on chev
he jumps up on the hood of a moving red sportscar as it backs out of its parking spot walks right over it and hops off clicking the keyless lock
button on his chain in mid air
the door to his black audi pops open
he gets in
red sportscar guy is the sort of classic intolerable la asshole we love to hate platinum hair suspenders designer shades programming his blackberry while driving etc
this is a eighty thousand dollar ride cockwipe
chev backs out runs him right over
ch kunk ch kunk
chevs audi blasts out of the garage and down the street
sportscar guy holds his backwards leg in agony
screaming like a girl youre a dead man
the ever present heartbeat is pounding
chev whips out his cell phone and dials
a horn blasts
chev quickly looks up and yanks his steering wheel to swerve around oncoming traffic
the camera zooms in on chevs chest it becomes just slightly transparent
we see the movement of his beating heart speed up with the near miss
he heartbeat sound is amplified as we move in closer
we see an old school tape answering machine pick up at her place hey this is eve
this is apparently typical shes an answering machine girl in a cell phone world
he holds back his frustration as the message plays
im glad you called but im not here
can you leave me a message
unless youre trying to sell something because im absolutely not interested
but if youre not
chev begins to pound his head against the steering wheel
times up sound beeep
we hear chevs car squeal again
chev recovers from another near miss
he clicks off the cell
his eyes try to focus on the road
ote through it all the low beating of the heart from slow to fast sometimes barely audible sometimes mixed way out front clues us into the state of his adrenaline
he grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial
doctor miles office may i help you
let me talk to him
chocolate a too skinny cracked out black chick sits in front of a multi line phone in a broken down apartment
shes wearing a headset
she takes a long drag off her cigarette
a generic imitation of politeness im sorry the doctor isnt in the office at this time may i take where is he
i beg your pardon sir
where thefuck is he
in more screens within screens we see a welcome to las vegas sign then doctor miles reclining on a massage table with a bunch of hookers
i dont know sir this is his answering service would you like me to have him paged
exasperated fine yes please let the doctor know that chev chelios is a dead man if he cant call me back within the hour
c can you spell that for me sir
she searches the food and carton strewn tabletop for something to write with
d e a d
hev hangs up
chev finds himself nodding off in the car
the camera zooms back into his chest
this time it becomes completely transparent we see his heart beat slow down the camera swooshes down to chevs foot as he steps on the gas
then back up to the heart as the adrenaline cranks him up
the beating speeds up and the camera snaps back out to chevs face as he seems to come to his senses
chev takes the cell
one clicks and sticks the phone in the cigarette adapter
finally someone picks up
so where were you last night
kaylo is late s slightly plump hispanic with gelled back curly hair
the room is unkempt
a woman in a robe shuffles by vaguely in the background possibly his mother
h whats up chev
i said where were you last night
you wanna know what i was doing
you heard me
that son of a bitch ricky verona
more to himself who wouldve thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib
and yet here we are
where are we
im dead and youre simple
now listen you put the word out im looking for ricky verona
anyone sees him you call me
kaylo puts his hands up in the air dumbfounded
im going to get that little son of a bitch if its the last thing i do
it may actually be the last thing i do understand that
copy me on that
arriving at his destination chev clicks off simultaneously closing kaylos screen in a screen and shoves the phone into his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk
run down street in inglewood
the black sabbath clubhouse is a low lying pool hall bar with a crude hand painted sign reading beer pool darts
motorcycles are parked out front
oller dolly from alongside chevs car at high speed break off and follow inside as chev parks haphazardly rushes out and busts into the joint
the continuous roller dolly move takes us inside and keeps going
eight or ten brothers some wearing motorcycle leathers are scattered around the room shooting stick drinking etc
chev barges in drawing a glok
from his coat and goes straight at orlando black hip s better dressed than the others who is at the center of a group of efore anyone has time to
react chev has the gun pressed into orlandos forehead and is pushing him through the place into the bathroom
everyone scatters and takes cover at the site of the glok firearms appear
chev locks the door slams orlando against the far wall and starts circling around him with the gun beaded on orlandos forehead
out of his mind wheres verona
flipping out its cool its cool its cool
chev cocks the gun
what are we talking about
dont fuck with me
ok nobodys fucking with you just calm down
theres banging on the door
a biker yells from outside
o land o
calling back theres a white man with a gun in here i would prefer that he not cap my ass so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit
to chev now you see that
im trying to help you here
hev starts to chill out
look i got to find ricky verona
why would i know where
right i know you dont know where he is but youre going to tell me where he is or im going to blow your brains the door busts open and
a half dozen gun wielding brothers crowd into the tiny room
otal mad chaos ensues chev orlando and the brothers packed in like sardines everyone pointing guns at every one elses head shoving each other back and forth everyone screaming
the situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence
finally orlando cuts through the din with a booming voice
ilence just the sound of chevs heartbeat pumping
calmly can we all just get along
chevs gun is still trained on orlandos head
now chevy here has something he would like to discuss
so we are going to discuss it
in a civilized manner
i believe you had a question or some point you were trying to make
i am not affiliated with ricky verona
starting to lose it again you pulled the anselmo job together dont try to bullshit me
he presses closer to orlando
the brothers bristle
the situation is close to blowing up again
now things are beginning to clarify
you see how that works
how discussion can lead to clarity
hev is running out of patience
clearly you are operating under a false pretense
ricky verona and myself did not pull the anselmo job together
in fact ricky verona fucked me on the anselmo job
in fact ricky verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars
thats not how i heard it
but thats the way it is
thats the way it is
so you see i dont know where ricky verona is
because if i knew where he is i would probably be there right now beating his gucci ass down
chev holds the gun with an unsteady hand studying orlandos eyes evaluating
hen as much from exhaustion as from a sense that hes telling the truth he lets his gun hand drop
the room lets out a collective exhale
the brothers mutter amongst themselves damn right you better put that shit away crazy bitch ass mother
thats what im talking about
that resembles civility
chev begins to fade again
he slumps back looking as though he might pass out
one of the brothers catches him holds him up and shoves him away
shit dude whats the matter with you
i just gotta find ricky verona that little bitch
i understand that
youve made that point abundantly clear to all of us
he takes pity on him chev really looks like shit
a few of the brothers lose interest begin to filter out of the room
now what can i do to help you
look just give me some coke ok
you got any coke
orlando gives him the look
ok now youre insulting me
come on man i know you got coke
you think every brother is carrying is that it
come on i dont have time for this just give me something
im really dying here
i can see that
you dont understand im really fucking dying
if i dont
losing it again may i just have some coke please
so this is medicinal use coke thats what youre telling me
you got something for me or what
chev shoves his gun into his belt pulls out a wad of tens tosses it into the sink
hes visibly fading
orlando takes a quick look over the wad pulls a little plastic bag out of his vest pocket tosses it to chev
the bag hits chev square in the forehead hits sweat and sticks
chev reaches for it lamely it slides off and lands on the floor
his reflexes are not the best at this point
chev collapses to his knees breaks it open and snorts it right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees
the brothers find this hilarious
orlando shakes his head in disgust
come on man
we hear chevs heart rate start to build increase in volume
suddenly he pops up to his feet almost slips and falls steadies himself
a new man
ok thats good
oh thats good right
chev pounds rhythmically on chest keeping time with his beating heart
hy you looking for verona anyway
seems like some chinese assholes hired him to kill me
ah so this is about the don kim situation
what do you know about it
i know you pulled the trigger
flipping out of course i pulled the trigger
abruptly chevs heart stops
his eyes go wide he waits for it
and then it starts up again slow erratic
chev is ghost whoa chelios
you good man
his shits not working
beg your pardon
chev swoons close to blacking out
i think i know what i have to do
shrugging well a mans got to do what a mans got to do
what exactly is it that you got to do
chev snaps to his senses
got to kick
chev turns to the biggest meanest looking brother in the room pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way then without warning slams his head forward into the
brothers face knocking him backwards into the hallway sending all the other brothers sprawling like tenpins
there he goes again
chev has a pool cue in his hands
he moves out into the hallway eyes wild
ound chevs heartbeat starts to rev up
who wants white meat
all hell breaks loose
a calm exterior of the building single window bars over it single door closed
suddenly the window smashes outward the two arms of one of the brothers poke out through the bars as though hes been thrown into the window frame from inside
one hand holds a cue ball which drops and hits the sidewalk
a second later the door blows off its hinges as chev is tossed upside down through it to land on the cement in a jumble of glass and wood
the door falls on him
the brothers chase him out into the street shouting him down
speeding along weaving erratically through traffic sweating hard panting with adrenaline
chevs cell rings
he picks it right up
ey whats up doc
ude arent you dead yet
what the hell are you doing out there
im coming for you asshole believe me
look just thought youd like to know that im all about hooking up with that mystery girl youve been banging as soon as your ass is underground
i forgot to say so on that gay james bond tape i left for you
yeah yeah then youre going to rape my grandmother blah blah blah
what do you think carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did
your whole crew is history
chev checks the rearview mirror
under his breath great
throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster b more and more out of control
now a squad car has pulled up behind him cherry top flashing broadcasting a warning to pull over out of its intercom
hev goes evasive leading the cop on a high speed chase
thats funny i guess you didnt know
carlitos my boy now were tight
you havent been tight since your brother fucked you in rd grade
did you pretty good didnt i chelios
come on you can admit it
right right and the best part about it is
chevs phone beeps incoming call
sorry i must take this
see you later
i doubt it
hev pushes answer and picks up the new call
shit its about time
sorry baby i just got the message
ok forget it listen im dying
ive been poisoned with some kind of chinese synthetic shit
youve got to do something for me it feels so crazy like its in my blood
chev swerves wildly
throughout the conversation we are tight on chev and doc the only idea we have about the chase occurring outside the car comes from chevs wild steering the sound of
burning rubber and sirens and the few details flashing by in the background and reflected in the glass
alright slow down
you say youve been poisoned
can you describe the symptoms
like im slowing down
like im caught in a tar pit
pain in your chest
actually im feeling pretty good right now
what are you doing
we reveal that chevs car is blasting through the inside of a shopping mall screaming past frozen yogurt and big n tall shops missing terrified shoppers by inches
driving through a mall with five cops chasing me
behind his car we see two chps on motorcycles and three squad cars giving chase
partially to himself the flow of adrenaline is keeping you alive
im having a little trouble hearing you doc
listen chev you have to keep moving
if im right they gave you the beijing cocktail
works on your adrenal gland blocking your receptors
the only way to slow it down is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant
e hops out with cell phone to his ear and takes a ride to the second floor riding the smashed car up the escalator
meaning if you stop you die
if you stop you die
chev jumps off of the car and starts booking through the second level huffing it barking into the phone the whole time
thats what im trying to do
just keep moving
keep the blood pumping
every time i slow down its like my veins start to rust
have you taken anything
a couple grams of coke
well thats a start
look ill be back in la in an hour
ill call you as soon as i land
keep yourself pumped up
dont stop dont quit ill be there
hev gives the cops the slip and heads into a
mens clothing store
he bolts to the back looking for an exit
he heads into the dressing room no exit
turns back out into the store and then tries the employees only door
behind the door are two overweight employees in suits
he runs them both over and heads to the exit
chev gets to the exit first and bursts through the door
he runs down the sidewalk and manages to hail a cab
the inside of the cab has the east indian vibe
incense koran on the dash and farsi music over the radio
in a thick pakistani accent where we go
they zip through the stop sign and hit the traffic light
make a right
he cabbie pulls a california roller to the right the tires
three squad cars pass sirens and lights blaring heading the a opposite way
chev starts to drop off we hear his heart rate start to slow a down
ey crank the music
the cabbie turns to an fm country station playing billy ray cyrus achy breaky heart
no crank it
the cabbie blares it
chev starts to embarrassingly bang his head to the billy ray as if it was metallica in the late s
something catches his eye
come on right here
a can be seen through the side window
ok ill be back in one minute
dont go anywhere
chev jumps out of the cab and into the
we see him pull his gun from his pants as he enters
he goes right to the counter and sticks the place up
he grabs the man from behind the counter and in one move yanks him over the counter and slams him face down on the floor
you move you die
chev grabs a box of trash bags rips it open and takes one out
he opens the bag and starts dumping caffeine in jolt coke red bull starbucks frappuccinos
e dials a number on w his cell
it rings twice then hey this is eve
he yells and jumps up and down while heading to the counter
he grabs hundreds of the little ginseng capsules vivran and everything candy
the bags full
ne last look
he spots some shitty flowers in a bucket
the fastest double take in movie history with the grouchiest face then he grabs them
he hops back in the cab with the cheap flowers and the black santa bag
he opens the bag and starts slamming whatever he can get his hands on
where you want to go man
chev is guzzling red bull popping vitamins whatever
extreme cu of a fuente fuente opus x cigar rich tendril of smoke curling through the air
as the hand holding the cigar brings it up for a drag the camera pulls back revealing carlito an imposing lb
dominican in his late s
the camera continues its move back skimming over blue water revealing an elaborate pool area on the rooftop
carlito is sitting by the pool in a velvet robe
bodyguards roam the property and a beautiful rock hard black woman suns on the deck
still in the same shot pulling back carlito puts down the cigar stands up and dives into the pool
the camera drops down below the water level and carlito swims right up to it for a close up
carlitos pov we are under water swimming towards the edge of the pool
as we look up we see a water distorted figure above the water looking down into the pool
the classic shot made famous in the graduate and used a thousand times since
only this time the guy outside the pool jumps in
ts chev fully dressed
he meets carlito face to face underwater and points up with his index finger
we cut to carlitos reaction
he follows chev up
heir heads rise just above the water like heads on a platter
several jittery bodyguards stand at the edge of the pool guns drawn
with a simple motion of his hand carlito calms them
im surprised to see you
well something urgent has come up
so ive heard
then you know what happened
word travels fast
you amaze me my friend
what can i say
look carlito i need your help
i dont have much time
no not much
weve got to find an antidote or something
whats the matter
shrugs the shit they gave you
its the chinese shit
there is no antidote
i wish there was something i could do
what so thats it
honestly you should be dead already
its a miracle
we give that shit to horses
i cant believe it
c im sorry
ut to chev and carlitos legs treading water to keep their heads afloat
well you dont have to be so damn cool about it
what do you expect me to do
tell me youre going to find that punk verona and his whole fuckin crew and feed em to a cage of wolverines
cut to legs treading
what is this
are you boys now or something
thats just a small time punk
thats not to say there isnt an opportunity here
everyone knows the love i have for you chev
maybe this can even the score for the don kim hit which was perhaps ill advised
flabbergasted ill advised
the heat from hong kong has been more than we anticipated
thats outstanding carlito
im glad to know that my death can be of some use to you
dont be difficult
am i being difficult
is this what you call difficult
i dont know if you noticed but im having a difficult beat
re you disrespecting me chev
is that what youre doing
they stare each other down
orget it im out of here
chev climbs out of the pool
carlito narrows his eyes watching him leave
the bodyguard motions to follow carlito signals him off
chev passes a black helicopter sitting on a small hard rubbered heli pad
carlitos pov from a distance we see chev knocking over furniture and breaking glass on his way out
carlitos pov descends beneath the water his breath releases
the building opens onto the high rent section of sunset blvd
an outdoor cafe populated by the rich and trendy is next door
hev shakes himself off and bangs out of the revolving glass doors
a valet approaches him and chev gets in his face flashing murderous teeth and shoving him away hopping up and down to keep the heart pounding
he heads over to the cab waiting out front
the same arab cabbie is waiting inside
youre not getting into my cab wet
i just gave you dollars to wait for minutes
you are not getting into my car no way
chev goes to the driver side of the car pulls the cabbie out of the cab and tosses him into the road
the lunch crowd at the cafe passerbys etc
look on in bewilderment
chev points at the cabbie and starts screaming
everybody freaks out
a waiter dives under the a table expecting an explosion
chev grabs the cabbie by his lapels and tosses him right into the cafe smashing a table still pointing and screaming
he whole restaurant old ladies included dogpile the poor cabbie wildly protesting in a thick accent
i love america
i love bush
chev gets in the cab and drives off
chev is slamming frappucinos driving
its the cell phone
my flights delayed
i mean dont relax
listen to me
the shit they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline
science class type microscope footage of darting chemicals and protein globules
xcitement fear danger
it causes your body to manufacture a chemical called ephedrine
it binds with receptors in your blood to keep you alive what theyve done is introduce an inhibitor into your system
it blocks the receptors so your bodys ephedrine cant bind
and thats whats killing you
your only shot is to massively increase the level of ephedrine in your body
to force out the inhibitors
in english doc
youve got to get to an emergency room and get yourself some epinephrine
its artificial adrenaline
it comes in milligram syringes
the shits potent so dont overdo it
probably a fifth of an injection will do
chev tries to remember all this while zoning in and out of consciousness swerving slamming coffees and capsules
did you get all of that chev
chev bangs his head against the steering wheel
cell beeps i gotta go
ill call you chev clicks over
kaylo pops up in a mini screen
hes in a phonebooth downtown looking furtively over his shoulder as he talks
yeah what is it
chev hangs up
kaylo bewildered redials
chev answers says nothing
i just saw veronas brother going into charlie os
in a series of black and white stills we see alex the massive dude we saw in the background on veronas tape exiting a taxi and walking into charlie os
a big new york style s era steak and cocktail joint right in the heart of downtown l
downtown charlie os
i was just down here getting a taco
he went right in like minutes ago
where are you now
im across the street getting a taco
where are you
hev hits the gas pedal and blasts off
meet me on rd and flower
in fast motion we see the freeway exits flash by one after another
kaylo pays for his food at a leisurely pace hes at a little place across the street from charlie os and skulks out onto the street trying too hard to
meanwhile in the second screen chev is blasting along at high speed off the freeway through downtown and right to the corner of rd and flower where he leaves the
taxi idling in a red zone and gets out
as kaylo turns the corner the two split screens meet up he and chev run right into each other
hev pulls kaylo around the corner out of sight of the restaurant
motioning to the restaurant hes in there now
kaylo nods quickly freaked out
did anyone go in with him
kaylo shakes his head no
lright wait here
the camera stays with chev as he walks right across the street and up to the restaurant
alex is in his usual booth making lecherous smalltalk with a ish waitress in a short skirt and fishnet stockings as chev still drying hair all fucked up and walking
erratically enters the restaurant
everyone turns to look at the crazy man nervously
hev walks doggedly right by alex staring straight ahead not letting on that he knows hes there
alex watches him pass in disbelief
what was that
i just saw a ghost
chev disappears through the swinging doors to the kitchen
the mairtred has the phone in his hands ready to dial the cops but alex motions to him to chill
hell take care of it
he gets up and follows in chevs footsteps
alex enters the kitchen
the cooks all hustle by him they want no part of this
chev is nowhere to be seen
lex continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of caution everyones been afraid of the big man all his life drawing a gun from inside his coat as he
he passes a butcher block a hacked up roast a conspicuous turning a corner he notices the back door swinging slowly closed
the back door opens onto an alley
he comes up to it brings the gun up by his head shoulders up to the cracked door and tries to peer around it into the alley
just then behind him chev emerges from the kitchen with the efore alex can react chev lets swing with the knife and neatly cuts off alexs gun hand at the
the hand gun and all hits the ground
chev kicks alex out the door and into the alley
alex crumples in shock holding his abbreviated arm out in front of his face
he tries to talk or scream but all that comes out is a wheezing sound
chev follows him out into the alley brandishing the butcher knife heartrate slamming
how you like that one tough guy
how freaking awesome was that
e kicks him in the ribs knocking him over
you feel like talking to me
wheres your brother
anger gradually overcoming the shock doing your mother like an iraqi prisoner you bitch
wonder how many steaks i could get out of you
lex rolls onto his knees and with a burst of energy throws himself at chev
he smashes chev into the alley wall and lands on him with his full weight
chev is pinned
alex enraged attempts with some success to strangle him with his remaining hand
chev struggles in futility heart hammering
it seems hopeless
until kaylo appears behind alex with a rolling pin and brings it down on his skull with a loud crack
alex rises up staggering and advances on kaylo who drops the rolling pin and cowers amidst the trash cans
chev gets to his feet pulls out his gun puts it to the back of alexs head
chev pulls the trigger twice
he tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the restaurant as alex proceeds to beat kaylo down with a trashcan swinging it one handed
hev picks up alexs disconnected hand which is still clutching the gun and walks back over to the action
he uses alexs finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him away
alex hits the ground with a thud
he pries the gun from alexs cold dead fingers shoves it in his pocket and tosses the hand to a disgusted kaylo who tries to get away from it
you want to hold hands
and begins to rifle through alexs pockets
he finds a cellphone clicks through the menu and hits send
ricky verona answers
talk to me bro
impersonating alex hey ricky whadya think about sucking me off ya in the mood
maybe let me lick your ass or sumtink
verona is feeding his rottweiler some beef jerky
a hottie in a bathrobe walks by
who is this

you wanna guess how i got your brothers cell phone
verona is speechless furious
he knocks over a table and pushes the rots head away
i can tell you have it all figured out
looks like you shouldve cut me up when you had the chance
erona rubs his face
i cant hear you
experiencing some hindsight
losing it youre supposed to be dead
you know man i kind of like that shit you put in me

struggling to find a heinous enough threat ill
i know i know
hey whats this
chev spots a necklace around alexs neck yanks it off
on the chain a silver wwii era russian medallion engraved with the image of a mounted cossack
the name on the back is i
hev looks it over
you guys really are faggots arent you
you motherfucker my grandfather gave that medallion to my father and then to realizing hes said too much fuck you man shove that thing up your ass
no thanks but you know i believe ill hang onto it
looks like youll have to come find me after all

chev hangs up turns off the phone and pockets it
immediately hes on to the next thought
what was that
e shakes his head to clear it
im taking off
we hear sirens
id get out of here if i were you
he splits leaving kaylo with the body the hand etc
kaylo looks around tosses the hand and bolts off in the other direction
chevs cab is parked illegally
a meter maid is writing it up
the sliding doors to the er swoosh open as a gurney is wheeled in by paramedics
chev walks quickly in behind them a complete wreck ignoring all the activity seemingly lost in his own thoughts
he checks a sign on the wall for directions
an arrow points toward the pharmacy
he follows it
chev cuts off an old man with a walker making his way to the counter
he runs his hand through his freaked out hair trying to straighten it out
the pharmacist a cynical girl mid s with thick horn rimmed glasses regards him blankly
to the pharmacist im looking for something
starts with england
no im talking about some kind of artificial adrenaline
i have heart problems
you have it
i cant give you epinephrine
just a minute
she walks into the back
through the glass he sees her pick up a phone
come on what is that
a pimply faced teenager with greasy shoulder length brown hair has been watching the whole thing from the magazine rack
t nasal spray dude
e gestures to a counter display nas all little plastic bottles
its got epinephrine in it
get you tweaked man
chev looks from the kid to the display and back then through the glass window where the pharmacist is talking to someone on the telephone looking out at him suspiciously
he picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets out of there
the old man gives him a sour look chev makes him flinch with a sudden jerk toward him
chev wanders through the trauma ward trying to look inconspicuous avoiding eye contact knocking things over trying doors inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray tossing the empty bottles eyes
he rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks three cops are at the admissions counter
a nurse is gesturing in chevs direction
they look up toward him
he ducks back into the corridor finds a recovery room and slips in
the room is quiet save for the steady labored wheezing of an old man in the only bed
the old mans eyes stare vacantly at the ceiling chev cant tell if hes asleep or awake
he watches the old man for a stolen moment hypnotized
then glances over at the half open closet
the cops come up on the corridor where chev disappeared
they advance hands on weapons checking each room
hey reach chevs room
the door is slightly ajar
one of the cops pushes it open with his foot
the old man is there motionless
no sign of chev
the cops continue down the hall
behind them from the door they checked chev tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital johnnie tied in the back with his ass hanging out trying to blend in
one of the cops notices this
chev takes off walking faster around the corner
the cops head after him
he cops turn the corner
chev is still trying to play it off
finally chev breaks into a run and the cops give chase
chev busts into the stairwell and starts heading down
hes been holding his gun awkwardly in his armpit now he whips it out
a few flights above he hears the door bang open as the cops pick up the chase
he exits into the
the busy er is buzzing with activity
chev looks around desperately
the cops are right on his tail
suddenly the entrance doors burst open
a patient is wheeled in at a dead run by a small group of emergency techs all shouting instructions back and forth and barking at people to get out of
the way as they race toward the far corridor
the fat man on the gurney has his shirt open
hes pale glassy eyed and lathered in sweat
they have the defibrillator paddles out
ehind the gurney a resident pushes a crash cart along with them
the crash cart houses the defibrillator and various supplies
chev takes off after them bowling people over flashing the gun
i know you motherfuckers have epinephrine
the cops bang open the stairwell door guns drawn
chaos breaks out
hold it right there bro
the group is galloping down the long corridor toward the elevators that connect to the o
three docs the resident chev and the fat man on the gurney
the cops in hot pursuit trying to get a bead on chev
chev is holding his gun to the residents head while pushing him and the cart forward
the resident blubbers in panic
the docs in all the confusion havent noticed chev yet
youve got epinephrine on this cart
i want that shit
stand by to defibrillate
the gurney slows down and the cart shoved forward by chev crashes into it
bodies fly shit spills everywhere
the fat man lets out a groan makes eye contact with chev
chev spins around wildly and fires a few shots over the cops heads
they hit the deck
hat is this
what the hell do you think youre doing
this is a hospital
hev shoves the gun in his face
he doc shuts up
chev brandishes the gun toward the cops to keep them on the ground then motions c the resident
get me some
chev is pale as a ghost
his legs buckle
he steadies himself against the wall
haltingly you wanted
epinephrine is that right
chev nods weakly
the resident on his hands and knees starts digging through the supplies spilled all over the floor
the cops sensing weakness start to tense
chev snaps out of it momentarily
the resident approaches him cautiously on his knees holding out a handful of small white boxes
give me that
he snatches them cradling them against his stomach and backs up past the docs toward the elevator just as the chime sounds and the doors slide open
he tosses the boxes inside
the fat man lets out another agonized groan
chev points the gun at him
not going to tell you again
he grabs a defibrillator paddle out of tech s trembling hands and holds it to his chest
to the resident now juice me
weakly not much left i havent got all day just do it will you
the resident flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing begins to charge
chev holds the paddle to his chest with one hand the gun out with the other
chev flies backwards bouncing off the wall like a pinball
the cops leap forward trying to take advantage but chev pops back up wired and wild eyed
he fires another warning shot into the ceiling and leaps into the elevator as the doors close behind him
chev collapses on the floor of the elevator
he fumbles with the white boxes the resident handed him and comes up with a ok
needles hate needles
he rubs his arm feeling for a nice vein squirts a few drops from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in
pushes the plunger all the way plucks it out and tosses it in the corner
chev sits patiently against the wall staring blankly straight ahead
suddenly a curious look comes over him
how much of this stuff did he say to take
we hear chevs heartbeat start to speed volume up fast
his eyes widen
suddenly he jumps straight up in the air
he starts to hop around wildly like a monkey in an electrified cage
the bell chimes and the elevator doors open
chev blasts out of the elevator and out the front doors of the hospital like a ball out of a cannon
chev is hoofing it like forrest gump on speedball
we hear sirens
a group of squad cars flash by behind him heading toward the hospital
neither they nor chev see one another
he runs what seems like eight miles
we pick him up real time still running
he answers without slowing down
ready to explode yep
im in the air man
did you get the stuff i told you
you took it
you shot the whole thing didnt you
i said a fifth of a syringe you idiot
now youre dead for sure
chest is on fire
but youre cold
you got a steel hard on
let me check
getting into it thats the stimulation of the blood vessels
your urinary sphincter is tight as a knot
couldnt pee to save your life
the lady in the seat next to doc is aghast
maybe you can get a hold of some vicadin you still at the hospital
maybe some weed
i dont know
well that shit should be out of your system in a half hour or so if you live that long
this air phone is costing me a fortune
look ill be in la in twenty minutes
ill call you when i hit the ground
sincere youre a good kid chev
nice knowing you
ut doc miles is already a distant memory
chev lets the phone drop from his ear without hanging up
as he comes up on a department store window where a crowd has gathered to watch a wall of tvs all playing the same thing
he slows to a stop joining the crowd
he face on the tv is his more or less an exaggerated black and white police sketch simian browed and thick lipped
he looks like a serial rapist
police have declined to release the name of the west hollywood man they say is still at large on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead dozens injured
and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in its smoking bloody wake
however eyewitness news has learned that the suspect is a professional killer with ties to organized crime and an extensive police record
he is considered armed and highly dangerous
a guy standing next to chev glances sidelong at him
chev turns to meet his eyes
the guy regards him in a stupor then looks down chevs hospital johnnie is sticking straight out in front ass hanging out the back a gun in his left hand
cell phone in his right
he guy looks back up at chevs poker face gulps and turns back to the wall of screens
the broadcast cuts from tape back to the live anchor
we want to get you back to our regularly scheduled programming but keep it tuned right here to abc for continuing coverage of this bizarre story as it unfolds
over network graphic we now return you to dr
the tv cuts to a talk show in progress
rather than disperse the small crowd stays hypnotically glued to the tube
we see in their eyes that everyone is going into that tv alpha state thing
chev shakes his head snaps out of it
his heartbeat barely audible during the broadcast swells back to full volume beating like a jackrabbits
e looks around and spots a cop on a motorcycle waiting at a stoplight
with a last look at the tv drones he breaks from the crowd and goes into stealth mode darting from car to car in an exaggerated ninja crouch trying to
sneak up on the cop
he comes up behind him transfers his gun and cell phone to one hand and heart pounding reaches stealthily for the cops holster with the other
car horns blare as motorists attempt to warn the cop who flinches and whips around at the noise but its too late chev has the gun
he begins to hop around maniacally taunting the cop as everyone panics and tries to reverse out of the traffic snarl slamming into fenders driving up onto the sidewalk etc
tossing the gun up and catching it you want it
you want this
he cop jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him but jerks back when chev catches the gun
chev holds the gun up like a fetch stick gluing the cops eyes then flings it feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain
he cop starts after it then stops short as he sees chev dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle
he kicks up the stand and revs it
you son of a bitch
the cop makes a dive for chev grabbing him by the waist as the bike jerks forward
hev starts to burn the bike out as the cop hangs on dragging
smoke erupts black bits of rubber spray like buckshot pelting the cop
chev does a degree burnout kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control then jerking skidding blasts off
the cop hangs on cursing dragging boots smoking for a half block before he bails out
everybodys talking by harry nilsson begins
chev cruises in an out of traffic and people like a sunday drive ignoring traffic lights stop signs pedestrians
we speed ramp about to the beat of the song an undercrank of about fps
hes so jacked up and delusional he decides to try a bare from the rear pegs at about mph he jumps up to the gas tank feet first stands straight
up on the moving bike and puts his hands out to his sides in a jesus christ pose flashing a silhouette in the sun
his heart pounds as he flies by crowds of astonished bystanders
and crashes straight into a patio restaurant full of people
chev flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of overturned tables and busted dishes
a table spins like a coin at his feet
stunned silence hangs in the air a few food covered people wander around in dazed shock
chevs arm hand still clutching his cell phone sticks out from under a table
the phone starts to ring from under the table we see chevs eyes blink as he comes to his senses
he shakes off the debris struggles to his feet and clicks to answer the phone
did you try to call
chev lets his arm drop to his side stares blankly at nothing then brings it back up
a room suffused in amber filtered sunlight
eve a non traditionally adorable strawberry blond in her mid s yawn stretches with the phone cradled between ear and bare shoulder
youve been home all day
i was sleeping in
you were sleeping in thats great eve super great
you all rested now
holding it together well im glad to hear that
listen ive been fatally poisoned theres probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak but dont bother getting out of bed ill be there
in a flash
maybe you could fry me up a waffle or something kay
oblivious sure come on over ill be here
right youll be there ok
chev clicks off
ll the while hes been wrestling the wasted motorcycle from the wreckage
its smoking leaking oil
he shakes his head at a dumfounded waiter holding up the phone like can you believe this
then climbs on the sputtering bike and drives off
cu verona stares straight down at the camera
reverse veronas pov alexs severed hand frozen stiff in a trigger pulling position
verona looks up at his crew gathered nervously around the room lunatic schizo cycles through a half dozen emotions before arriving at something resembling off hand casual ill have the
super size with a diet coke
lets go get the bitch
eves pad is nothing like chevs
its all cats and incense warm natural light a scratchy van morrison lp playing on a real record player
ve in a cotton nightgown is in the kitchen attempting some bit of microwave programming punching random buttons and getting herself worked up
to the microwave i hate you
five bangs on the door barely distract her
just a minute
more bangs insistent
alright alright jesus
she gives up on the microwave goes to answer the door
calm down what the hell
hes dressed in a blue adidas jogging suit long sleeve jacket warm up pants with buttons down the side the works
he couldnt look more out of place in eves mellow apartment
hes bathed in sweat wild eyed hair slicked back like gordon gekko
he pulls her toward him and kisses her
she accepts the kiss gratefully enough with her mouth but holds both hands out to her sides as if touching the jogging suit would kill her
without making eye contact he breaks away and pushes into the apartment looking around everywhere paranoid
is this your new look or something
you into it
very you chev
he checks into the bedroom satisfies himself that its empty
are you looking for my other boyfriend
ignoring this you havent turned on the tv today right
didnt think so
listen weve got to get out of here
what are you talking about
dont be such a freak
chev goes to the window peaks through the curtains
actually im glad youre here
can you change the clock on the microwave
i never changed it back
i never changed it back
you know daylight savings time
i bought you some flowers but they got fucked up on the way over here
are you ok
you look like youre on drugs or something
you love me right
then i need you to do something for me
what is it
i need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now
ill change the clock on the microwave
confused she pads off to the bedroom to change
chev goes into the kitchen
he peeks out the kitchen window looks around nervously glances at the microwave walks up and punches two buttons
extreme cu in ultra slo motion the digital readout on the clock switches from to noon with a sound like an wheeler being dragged on its side through a cathedral
hevs vision starts to blur
he slumps forward head pressed against the microwave trying to hold himself up
we hear his heart skip hang for a long moment then thud again heavily
to himself that shits wearing off
calling to him oh darn
i forgot the waffle irons on if you want to make one
calling back great great
he lurches over to the other side of the kitchen
where an old fashioned style waffle iron sits plugged in and starting to smoke
he takes a deep breath opens the lid puts his hand in and ound a stomach churning sear and sizzle
e screams under his breath stomping on the kitchen floor in agony
but his heartbeat rockets up again
he pulls out his pink smoking hand and jams it under his armpit hopping up and down
youre so stressed out do you want some pot
fighting to get the words out yes
the waffle iron starts to spark from the plug
he yanks it out of the wall as eve walks in wearing a sun dress and a ribbon in her hair
whats the matter
holding it in nothing
burned my hand
she comes up to him tries to pry his hand out from under his arm
e oh my god are you ok
let me see
dont worry about it
lets get out of here
come on let me see
coldly that was just totally uncalled for
exasperated im sorry
look can we just
she turns grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a huff
hev is about to follow her when he notices something out the window double takes then parts the blinds to get a better look
a sedan has pulled up outside
two hoods hop out and split up one coming up the front way the other around back
each one has a right hand tucked into his blazer theyre under his breath shit
he flies out the door after eve the door swings shut behind him
chev comes up behind eve grabs her by the shoulders and turns her around
im parked out back
he glances over his shoulder
through the glass security door he sees hood coming up the front steps
eve stops suddenly in front of her door chev practically piles into her
she starts to dig through her purse for her keys
the hood tries the front door locked
unlocking the door the waffle thing
i forgot to turn it off
he opens the door and walks in
chev tries to speak coughs up some unintelligible stacato nonsense
the hood runs his fingers down the directory list to and then across to the keypad peel and stick labeled chev is slack jawed
inside the apartment the phone begins alright alright
chev shakes his head in disbelief steels himself then turns and walks quickly down the hall to the front door
flustered eve picks up the phone
the door slams open
the hood whirls to see chev grim as a motherfucker six inches from his face
he scrambles for his gun oo late
chevs hand flashes forward palm connecting with the bridge of the nose dropping him instantly
through the intercom hello
alright very funny
the hood drops to his knees eyes rolling back in his head blood rushing from his nose
chev glances quickly around for witnesses then backs into the hallway letting the door swing shut behind him
eve pops out
i hate that
chev is waiting by the door blocking her view of the front entrance smiling somewhat crazily
you trying to burn down the building
she gives him a look then turns and heads down the hall
chev hustles after her
whoa whoa whoa
he building opens out back into a small parking area
trash bins line the brick wall ready for pick up
chev and eve are leaving when chev sees the other hood coming around the corner less than ten feet away
chev grabs the back of eves purse and turns it upside down spilling the contents all over the concrete
she spins around just missing c sight of the hood
aww damn it im sorry baby
irritated nice one
she drops down to gather up her things as the hood comes fully around the corner and meets eyes with chev
ithout hesitation chev hurdles eve and catches the hoods wrist as he pulls out his gun
oblivious i swear to god chev i dont know what youre on these days but it is not working for you
chev wrestles himself around the hood keeping the gun at a distance with one hand his other hand cupped over the hoods mouth head locking him
their legs interlock jostling for leverage
he gun drifts down toward eve chev wrenches it up as the silencer
the shot whizzes over eves head and through a nearby window plink
a parakeet in a cage by the window disappears in a puff of feathers
from overhead the camera corkscrews clockwise as chev wrenches the hoods neck counterclockwise snapping it
you know i could use a little help here
chev shoves the hoods body into a dumpster just as eve turns
chev snatches up the first thing he sees a grime encrusted plastic shower cap and holds it up lamely
is this yours
eve rolls her eyes looks around
wheres your car
i took a cab
a police motorcycle is tipped over on a lawn coughing up black smoke spewing oil
a crowd of mexicans are gathered around gaping
lames start to shoot up from the motorcycle the crowd scatters ducking for cover
montage chinatown is bustling with activity
vendors haggle workers hustle down the sidewalk with baskets of chickens sides of meat
motorists argue and punch their horns
and the lunch hour crowd converges on a hundred eateries
e hear a million heartbeats old young
even fast ticking chicken heartbeats all overlapping blending together in a swelling din of live things
the voyeuristic camera picks chev and eve up through the crowd
chev is wearing dark glasses to go with his s hair and jogger
you know i didnt have a lot of time to pick this out
so why are we here
chev sits across from eve in a tiny restaurant
an equally tiny vietnamese woman brings them menus
chev pulls a little bottle of nas all out of his pocket and snorts the entire thing grotesquely at the table
it doesnt help much
he shakes out his head bangs his fist on the table and sits up in his chair
holding his fingers up to indicate quotation marks
this isnt going to be easy
as they say
eve flinches at the sight of his burned waffle patterned palm
he notices draws it back
alright here it is
i told you i was a video game programmer
that was a lie
chevs dialog continues over the flashback
chev is retrieving a hidden gun from the kitchen checking the clip the barrel the action and slipping out a side door into a red corridor past two chinese men
in black suits
i kill people
im a professional hitman
i freelance for a major west coast crime syndicate
don kim sits at the head of the table drinking alone
last night was a job like a hundred others
a high dollar hit
chev walks up behind him gun drawn to the back of kims head
cocks the hammer back
don kim spins around in shock the same reaction we saw in the scene flashback frozen hevs eyes steel
his finger tightens
and then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a
slug at close range
ilence hangs heavy in the room
chev holds the gun to don kims head paralyzed with indecision
what are you waiting for
with a last grimace like even he cant believe what hes doing chev lets his gun hand drop slowly to his side
did i win something
your life jackass
beat a hundred grand wants you dead so sooner or later its going to happen
but im not doing it
nstead youre going to do something for me
youre going to get out of town
i dont care where you go i dont care what you do so long as youre invisible for hours
thats all i ask
or if you prefer we can do it the other way the way where i go to work and you go meet buddah
chev leans back in his chair and slams one of the legs down onto his foot
see i quit
i quit the business
figure i call you that night
i tell you everything
we get on a plane together and leave all this shit behind
never come back
shrugs pretty crazy huh
you are so weird
are we going on a trip
chev stares at her blankly then shakes his head to clear it
i may be going on a trip but youre not coming with me
i dont understand
eve storms out of the restaurant letting the door slam behind her
chev follows staggering like a drunk man
he catches up to her and grabs her arm
she spins on him
mob hits chev
do you know how ridiculous you sound
if youre going to break up with me at least you can tell me the truth
you think it sounds crazy
how do you think i feel ive gotta live this shit
ust then the camera slams through chevs transparent chest his heart seems to grind down and stall mid pump as the poisons progress moves another clock tick forward
he camera pulls violently out of chevs chest cavity he looks like someone just fired a cannonball into his gut
face white as a dinner plate
its the worst weve seen him yet
oh my god chev
whats the matter with you
he looks around like a drowning man
people everywhere but starting to disperse as lunch hour dwindles
the world starts to spin
chev falls to his knees pulling her down with him
chev youre scaring me
getting a desperate idea wait a minute
do you trust me
make love to me
i think itll help
he starts grabbing at her
she pushes his hands away
are you kidding me
take your clothes off
you always say you want to be more spontaneous
youre like some adrenaline junkie with no soul
save me eve
save my life
chev starts feeling up eves ass
she slugs him in the mouth
his head snaps back he comes up holding his lip
oh my god chev
she reaches instinctively to comfort him and he lunges forward tearing at her dress
hey roll around on the ground scratching and clawing at one another
a curious crowd gathers round
eve starts to flip out screaming and pounding on him with her fists like a crazy woman
ext thing you know shes kissing and biting his mouth breathless still pounding with her fists
you filthy animal
she reaches down and starts fumbling with his pants
the onlookers eyes widen moms covering the kids faces
take me right here in front of everyone
chevs heartbeat starts to pick up
he lifts her dress and positions himself on top of her
eve is completely out of her head eyes closed legs up in the air like a porn star
come on put it in me
he thrusts again
eves eyes pop open
what are you waiting for
chev looks down at his equipment then up at eve helplessly
incredulously tell me youre joking
now you cant get it up
determined ill fucking get it up
with a surge of energy he lifts her off the ground drags her over to a newspaper machine on the street the crowd parts to let them through and bends
her over it
he tries again to enter her
god damn it chev
he starts to spank her
she responds with a moan
a certain portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause
chev picks up the pace
eve begins making primal cries
busload of japanese girls pulls up tourists in matching red uniforms gaping out the window with slack jawed amazement
ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped chev gets a shot of adrenaline and goes for broke
eve shrieks like a banshee as he enters her
chevs heartbeat is slamming hes really giving it to her making full eye contact with the busload of tourists the entire time
chev doubles his efforts desperately fighting for the climax when
what was that
chev reaches for the e phone
what are you doing
chev puts the phone up to his ear
cu of kaylos face
ive got verona
we see that kaylo is duct taped to an office chair in what appears to be an old warehouse knife to his neck held by unseen captors
hes been badly beaten up
chev is still going through the motions with eve but his attention has shifted to the voice on the phone
ive got verona man
chev yanks it out and pulls up his pants
where are you
kaylo sweats looks off camera
a hand presses the knife closer to his throat
don kims shirt factory
chev finishes zipping up
furious in disbelief whats the matter with you
to eve shh
to kaylo downtown
chevs demeanor changes to an icy slow burn
he holds eve back with one arm as she tries to get at him flipping out
listen to me
you dont let that motherfucker out of your sight
ill be there in ten minutes
you got that
close to breaking into tears ok chevy
kaylo looks up at his captors miserably as the phone clicks off
the camera instantly flashes down to a low wide angle looking straight up as a bag is thrown over kaylos head and two unidentifiable men close in on him lifting
the chair off the ground
then takes its time moving slowly down to reveal kaylos feet bicycling wildly then twitching finally just dangling
both in fishnet and high heeled pumps
one pump falls to the concrete as kaylo goes still
chev turns his attention back to eve
i have to go
i do not understand
chev spots a flash of blue cops making their way through the crowd
he breaks away running leaving eve stranded half naked in the street holding her torn dress up amidst a sea of gaping chinese
screaming after him shouting back voice trailing off ill call you
chev sits in the back fading
haitian cabbie s in a sleeveless black mesh t shirt
heavy accent hey
e adjusts the mirror to get a look at chev
chev looks like hell cold sweat woozy glass eyed
whats the matter with you
you a crackhead
just step on it alright
hey you not gonna die in my cab crackhead
the haitian cabbie opens up his glove compartment and takes something out
chevs eyes widen
i got something for you
as the cabbie turns around chev experiences a flash the cabbies face is painted like a psychedelic voodoo skull in glowing black light paint
he is grinning crazily
chev flinches in horror but just like that the cabbie is back to normal
he hands chev a vial of liquid
you drink this haitian shit crackhead
this right here is some hardcore shit
made from plant shit
irritated what are you laughing at
look at this
he flexes a huge bicep
you see that
thats what a man looks like crackhead
thats the power
now look at you
hev narrows his eyes at the cabbie then shakes his head
what the hell
he twists open the little vial and downs it in one gulp
grimacing tastes like ass
thats right devil
chev rolls his eyes and leans against the door face pressed against the window glass
raffic flashes by at high speed then cuts to slo mo the camera ramps down to f
s as a car rolls by chevs taxi
a little boy who could be younger version of chev himself rides in the back seat
they make eye contact as the cars cross paths
chev finds himself drifting into a dream state
hevs eyes are glazed staring through the window
he notices something strange in the cabs rear view mirror something red
chevs eyes widen
wide shot the cab cruises by
a low sound builds to a deafening roar
following the cab a giant red pacman ghost rumbles down the street animated two dimensional
chev jerks awake and back to his senses
chev focuses his eyes on the empty vial
whatd you say was in this stuff
i told you its hardcore
hey pull up to the sidewalk in front of a run down s era warehouse building at the outskirts of the la garment district
chev gets out
still shaking it off wow
five fifty five
chev digs through eves purse which hed been holding in his lap the whole time pulls out a fifty and hands it to the cabbie
the cabbie digs for change
its all you man
have a nice day devil
chev puts the purse over his shoulder turns to take a look at the building
high angle from an upper floor window someone is watching chev survey the building as the cab pulls away
chev walks toward the front door then stops short
to himself wait a minute wait a minute
he glances toward the upper windows
suddenly suspicious this is fucked
he changes direction heads around the side of the building
wheres he going
chev comes up on a loading platform
korean workers are loading boxes out of the building into the backs of trucks in the sweltering heat
he walks by them into the building without making eye contact with anyone
they barely notice
he skirts the packing floor and heads to a dilapidated freight elevator gets on starts up
the front and ceiling of the elevator are open exposing the shaft the cables and the passing floors he reaches the th floor heading up
hundreds of koreans sitting at sewing machines all running at once a mind numbing din
windows painted over black chipped and cracked in places with shards of light slicing through
slow turning ceiling fans and long rows of fluorescent light beating down on the tables
hev hops off and lets the elevator keep going
the camera follows chev through the room along the humming rows of sewing machines
he crosses from one side of the room to another where a single open window leading out to the fire escape streams sunlight
a supervisor korean skinny mid thirties stringy mustache is dozed off in a chair by the window
chev walks right by out the window and onto the fire escape
the camera stays with him
chev beats his head into the brick wall climbs up the fire escape skips the next floor up gets onto the roof
chev ducks behind a big ventilation duct
hood mid s stocky is leaning over the edge of the building on the opposite side looking for something presumably chev holding a cell phone up to his ear
his folded jacket and gun sit on the ledge beside him
we recognize the hood from carlitos place he was one of the men loitering around the pool
chev sneaks up
how the hell should i know
he went in where they load the boxes
e clicks off and chev is on him snatching up the hoods gun spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin
sarcastically hey what a coincidence you like this spot too
what the fuck is this you working for the chinese now
are you crazy
yeah i am
im sorry man
losing his patience ok ding times up
in one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the hoods legs hoists him up over the ledge and tips him off the side of the building then turns
and heads for the roof access door
falling you son of a
long seconds later a thud
the th floor is a little used storage level stacked boxes dusty file cabinets garbage everywhere
starkly lit with harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself
we recognize this as the room kaylo called from
more so because his limp body is still duct taped to the rolling office chair now lying on its side in the middle of the room
half dozen more hoods are gathered in front of the freight elevator when chev appears behind them taking everyone by surprise
es standing over kaylos body gun drawn eves beaded purse still slung over his shoulder pissing fire
alright where is that motherfucker
the hoods are completely taken by surprise they back away from chev spreading out
the hoods act almost guilty
its obvious everyone knows each other
what the fuck is this
chevy baby take it easy
chev points the gun at hood s head the others raise their guns at him
verona got nothing to do with this
don carlos wants you off the street
youve totally lost your shit dude
youre all over the tv
destroying property making unauthorized hits
youre causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment
chev gestures toward kaylo in disbelief
carlito ordered this
ignoring it look forget about verona
well take care of him
the best thing for you to do is to find a nice dark quiet place and just
chevs heartbeat starts to slow
the wooden elevator starts down
he looks around making eye contact with the other maybe youre right
then down to kaylos crumpled body
he sees the stocking feet the pumps
his heart starts to jitter thudub
his vision doubles
he starts to swoon rationalizing i mean we all gotta die sometime right
the others share a tense laugh
we all gotta die
chev stumbles props himself up with one hand
lets all die
chev brings up his gun in the blink of an eye draws a bead on hood and is about to set off a shooting gallery when the elevator bell chimes
and the door slides open
eve walks in
looks around and freezes
they all turn to look
chev affords himself about a second and a half of bug eyed shock before snapping out of it and dropping hood haos breaks out as the others dive for cover
and start blasting
chev yanks kaylos chair up and shoves it toward the hoods then makes a break for the elevator shaft grabbing eve as he goes
aylos body screens chev and eve as they run taking hits finally toppling over again
chev takes out another hood on the run nailing him right between the eyes
hev turns his back on the hoods covering eve as they make a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a bullet in the he spins and empties his
clip at the hoods who hit the deck
eve holds his ass as chev looks down the open elevator shaft
the elevator is half a floor down moving slow
he grabs eve then the cable
they jump for it
chev and eve hit the floor of the moving elevator with a crash and roll out onto the th floor
the workers are all in a panic standing by their sewing machines theyve obviously heard the shots
the supervisor is walking around shoving them back into their seats screaming at everyone in korean to keep working
the supervisor all of five feet walks right up to chev and eve and starts screaming at them in broken english
what you want
eve completely flips out and starts shouting down the little man
the door on the far end of the room busts open and hoods pour in from the stairwell
they spot him
chev and eve duck low and start hoofing it down the rows of machines toward the windows
the hoods fan out
they play cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and koreans while the supervisor oblivious continues screaming and forcing the workers back into their chairs
chev puts a finger to eves lips calming her momentarily
then comes up behind a youngish hood and shoves the hoods gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine at least fifty years old operated by a korean woman even
hev grabs the gun
they make for the fire escape
they reach the bottom of the ladder and are pinned down by gunfire from above
chev gives her a look that says it all
i had to see if you were telling the truth
oh and you have my purse
chev notices the purse still over his shoulder takes it off and hands it to her
with a quick upward glance he breaks cover and squeezes off shots nailing two hoods on the fire escape
she freezes one of the dead hoods lands with a thud in the spot she wouldve been ok now come on
eve is pale as a sheet
she steps over the body like she was avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit
chev grabs her hand and yanks her along
he spots eves car parked backwards across the street and they make a desperate run for it as more shots whiz and ricochet off the pavement
eve is rifling through her purse as they run
naturally chev assumes shes looking for the car keys
darn it i forgot to take my birth control pill
chev answers the gunfire with shots of his own buying them a few seconds then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out onto the ground
heres the keys
ve holds out her hand where shes had them all along
taking them cool
she looks like shes about to wander around gathering up her things when another volley of shots blows out the passenger window of the car
chev picks eve up like a sack of grain and throws her head first through the passenger window into the car then runs around the other side hops in and
eve gets herself turned upright and stares at chev hair full of windshield glass
you werent lying
welcome to my life
head over heels in love no i mean that you were going to give it all up for me
and the other part
yeah thats true too
e slams his fist against the wheel
how can we stop it
its the only thing that slows it down
getting it so
when we were in chinatown
a look of determination comes over her
she reaches for his crotch
what are you doing
his will get you going
come on lets finish what you started
chevs eyes flash to the rearview mirror and go wide
he grabs the back of eves head and pushes it down into his lap just as a bullet slices through the rear windshield and out the front
eves head stays down
chev is straining against the seat evasive driving as she goes down on him
oh yeah thats
thats really working for me
eves head pops up
e working him up you like that
shots whiz by
he pushes her head back down
chevs heart is pounding like a jackhammer
hes got himself arched into a crazy position making it happen
thats it thats it thats it
just a little
eves head quickly pops back up
she pushes away
flustered whats the matter
satisfied so you can fall asleep like you always do
i dont think so
chev loses his mind
he slams the brakes to put the car into a slide exposing his driver side to the pursuing sedan punches his gun hand out the window and blasts away
he nails the driver between the eyes
the window disintegrates
the sedan full of hoods skids into the sidewalk
steam pours from the radiator
chev gets out and walks directly up to the sedan one hand holding his gun straight out in front of him the other pulling up his jogging pants which are
bunched up around his knees
chev unloads the entire clip into the sedan before any of the hoods can react
e walks back to eves car cool as a cucumber gets in and pulls away
eves face has turned a distinct shade of pale green
chev looks at her like shes nuts
eve is overwhelmed
how can you
how can you do that
chev barely hears her hes become distracted flexing his left hand and feeling around his legs
i told you baby
he spots something hits the brakes
he jumps out
chev almost collapses when his feet hit the ground
it seems like the left half of his body has simply stopped working
he unsnaps the buttons of the warm up pants to reveal that his left leg has turned grey
hes half dead
whats the matter
pointing at her stay
theyve pulled up across the street from a hardware store
chev drags his carcass across the street oblivious to the traffic swerving and braking to avoid him and stumbles in
eve stays in the car for a few seconds looking lost then pulls herself together and gets out
she follows chevs path crossing the street through traffic
tore employees and customers start bailing out of the store in a panic as she approaches the front doors
she walks through them and inside
eve dream walks through the store past the registers following chevs trail of blood smeared footprints
a pimple faced stock clerk blows by her not looking back
hes got a gun
she turns the corner and theres chev hes propped up in the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of nails hammer in one hand
es already hammered six framing nails into his leg and is busy pounding in number seven
he looks up at her eyes wild
i cant feel my leg
eve is speechless
at first chev doesnt understand where the sound is coming from
he looks around as if a red ghost might glide around a random corner any second
then realizes his cell is in his pocket
he answers it
holy shit man ive been trying to reach you for a half hour
where are you
doc is calling from the broken down apartment we saw earlier
chocolate is kicking back on a worn brown imitation leather sofa in the background watching tv
im at my office
can you get here
sirens approach outside
chev meets eves eyes shakes his head unbelievable
sure why not
an iv bag bubbles a portable heart monitor beeps
the camera follows the drip down to chevs arm
hes lying on the brown sofa wheezing thickly
some kind of court tv show plays on the tube in the background
doc miles crouches beside chev examines the heart monitor shakes his head
i owe you again doc
youre my best customer
gesturing with his head at the what is this stuff
synthetic ephedrine diluted with saline
it feels sort of good
oh i also gave you a little meth
thats the endorphins rushing into to your brain that youre feeling
so im not
youre in such shit shape its stunning
ive never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking
you should be in a fucking medical journal or something
what are you going to do
doc just shrugs
the solution im giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor
meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical
its a temporary fix
look if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days but at some point youd almost certainly lapse into a coma
and now it hits chev for the first time this is really it
he seems like he might break down
cocking his head toward the next room does she know
eve and chocolate are sitting cross legged on the mattress staring blankly at the tv
no inflection i hate television
chocolate looks sideways at her the white girl is crazy
doc shakes his head no
chev broods silently
f you want i can load you up with something youll go out in a beautiful dream
flash cut a red ghost pulsing
gently can i do that for you chev
no thats not what i want
chevs moment of weakness passes
his face goes grim with vengeance as the mean bastard inside him kicks in
he looks doc miles in the eye
doc miles regards him blankly
i want one hour
ricky verona and his crew are in the back watching a noisy satellite feed on dual plasma tv screens
a japanese girl in a red blazer one of the tourists from the bus is being interviewed in japanese amidst a crowd of her semi identical friends
a translation is overdubbed
the girls giggle
verona rolls his eyes
give me a fucking break
the broadcast cuts to a montage the trashed restaurant the burning police motorcycle the car crashed into the mall escalator police sifting through wreckage finally the sketch of chevs face
and so the wild rampage that began at am this morning in west los angeles continues with the mysterious suspect still at large
maybe we shoulda give him more of that chinese shit
his cell phone rings
he checks it
shaking his head in disbelief its him
alright shut up
whats up corpse
hey douchebag thought you might be interested in a little deal
youre mental dude
i want the antidote
oh the antidote huh
verona makes eye contact with his crew covering the mouthpiece of the phone they all try to keep from breaking up
and what are you prepared to give me
how about the jewelry i got off your faggot brother you cocksucker
this stings verona
he pulls the phone away from his face looks at it like he wants to smash it into bits then pulls himself together and puts it back to his ear
holding back tight lipped hmmm
thinking about it
verona pantomimes jacking off for the boys
you like that deal
ill be at downtown standard in twenty minutes
you know the spot
dont be late or ill trade this thing to some whore for a hand job
cutting him off ill be there
he clicks off then sits there seething
to the boyz what the hell are you looking at
they turn back toward the plasma screens
verona takes a deep breath then speed dials a number on the cell phone
youre not going to believe the call i just got
montage to music more of l
the traffic flowing trains zapping by commuters commuting everything at a thousand miles an hour
its going to be alright baby
from a distance in a locked off telephoto frame we see chev walking toward the camera in slow motion f
dialog from an unseen conversation is layered over the image
but things have changed
theres an antidote
i can make a deal for it but ive got to go alone
hes well dressed in a sportcoat slacks button down shirt and tie flapping in the wind
sunglasses and look of brutal determination on his face
but youll be safe now
and ill be back
in a series of dissolves he comes straight at the camera til his face fills the frame
eve looks up into chevs eyes absolutely vulnerable absolutely stunning
pale sunlight punches through the half rolled blinds
do you promise
chev meets her gaze
chev bangs through the revolving glass doors to the hotel
the camera shifts to a rough handheld pov similar to the shot that starts the film
the music is replaced by the sound of chevs labored breathing and heartbeat
the pov doubles goes in and out of focus
n one continuous shot he approaches the standard hotel and walks past the valets into the retro mod lobby
the shot continues as chev moves through the lobby and makes a beeline for the restroom
scattered around are hard looking dudes pretending to read newspapers
he passes them by avoiding eye contact
the bathroom is empty
he walks into a stall shuts the door and opens his coat we see a pager sized device clipped to his belt a green led is illuminated
everse chev adjusts a tiny knob on the device
his face is shiny with perspiration
he pulls out his shirt tails
we see that a small tube runs from the device to a needle inserted in the base of spine taped up with white adhesive
hev tucks the shirt back carefully takes a series of deep breaths and leaves the stall
he bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three of the dudes who were about to go in
they let him pass trying to avoid attention
chev makes his way to the elevators hits the up button
the doors open he gets on
the dudes watch from the lobby
a japanese businessman early s compact and under five feet immaculately groomed hustles on as the doors slide shut
he stands opposite chev against the wall and stares at him expressionless
whats happening brother
chev takes a small bottle of pills from his coat pocket and swallows them dry
he closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady himself as the effect of the pills washes over him
n unexpected voice breaks the silence
where did i go wrong
chevs eyes snap open
the japanese businessman stares back impassively
weirded out did you say something
now the japanese businessman answers but when he moves his lips its the voice of a woman in her s
like talking to the wall
im amazed you remember you have a mother
chev shakes his head in disbelief tries to clear his eyes but the hallucination persists
you never call you never write
i havent seen you since you ran out at
falling right into it right with you popping valium like tic tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks
why wouldnt i stick around for entertainment like that
chev is an instant ball of regret
exasperated mom i got no time for this
the japanese businessman cuts him off this time the voice is orlandos
you got no time period
ou a persistent motherfucker chev chelios ill give you that
reacting this is weird
but you know this has got to stop sometime
what do you think you are michael myers
they pop you and you just keep gettin up
im the terminator
the japanese businessman does another transformation this time into alex
you was that maybe
but theres a new gun in town
dont tell me youre talking about your bro def lepard
he did you pretty good didnt he
yeah not so much
i dont get it why didnt you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance
verona said you was chev chelios a
death on two legs
he said you probably been a contract killer since grade school
s he speaks alexs voice transforms again this time into chevs
hes now talking to a mirror of himself
addicted to violence
probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill the big rush
cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like
like a gift
a warriors death
hell youd probably get off on it
did you rehearse this
no this was the best way for a guy like you a slow ticking clock
cutting him off who the hell are you anyway
dont you know
soberly i think im starting to figure it out
yeah well better late than never
conversational you know youre going to die up there
cold yeah maybe
he camera holds chevs gaze for a long moment unflinching
but im taking you with me
reverse cu the japanese businessman has transformed into a giant blue ghost pulsing silently
cut to wide angle two shot chev and the flat two dimensional computer animated ghost facing each other at opposite ends of the elevator
sound the chime sounds signalling theyve reached the top floor
hev glances at the lit floor number display then back
the japanese man stares back at him blank
under his breath some pills doc
the japanese man ignores him
when the doors open he hustles off
past two goons who are waiting there for they each take an arm
the goons lead chev through a posh dining area down a dark corridor
they frisk him finding the obvious
in the shoulder holster yank it out and push him into a smoking lounge
carlito and ricky verona sit side by side at the table
an iced bucket of champagne good cigars
goons chill in the corners
the whole floor has been cleared out theyve got the place all to themselves
smug whats up dead
looks like everyones here
chuckling despite himself chelios
what a fucking mess you are
why dont you sit down
wait a minute
gesturing to the goons by the door pat him down again
hes carrying something
the goons give him another look
this time they reach down his pants and produce a second small concealed handgun
then discover the pager like device
one of the goons rips the tube from chevs back chev winces in pain
his heartrate starts to slow almost immediately
let me see that
a goon tosses it to him
what is this an insulin pump
what the fuck is insulin
carlito shuts him up with a look
holding the device up ephedrine right
carlito places the device carefully on the table
bemused very resourceful
e reaches into his coat pocket produces a pair of black leather gloves and starts to put them on
to verona found a new master you little bitch is that it
im nobodys little bitch
egging him on well see what kind of a bitch you are when carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me
and you take it
youll probably throw boss a nice little reach around just to show what a good bitch you are
im nobodys little bitch you hear me
hell pay what i tell him to pay
i said thats enough
calmly its been a long day
but in the end you must agree it all works out quite nicely
don kim gets his bullet thanks to you
carlito unlatches a x beautifully crafted mahogany wood case sitting on the table in front of him
it contains several syringes and bottle of milky fluid
he removes one syringe from the box with a gloved hand
it almost glows in the soft light
c and hong kong gets a goat to take the fall
please understand chev its truly nothing personal
speak for yourself
carlito squirts a little of the milky liquid
is that what i think it is
the chinese shit
nods to the goons hold him down
in a flash chev whips out a gun everyone flinches
but no wait hes just holding out his fist pointing the stick em up finger right between carlitos eyes
not so fast motherfucker
for a beat no one knows quite how to react
verona chuckles nervously
dudes gone dipsy doodle
chev whips the finger toward verona shutting him down mid word
verona shrugs it off with less than confidence
the room exhales
im afraid the houdini act is over chelios
a goon makes a move for chev
but chev spins on him leveling the finger at the goons forehead and pulls the trigger
imitating a gunshot booosh
the goons head is rocked back a nickel sized hole popped right through the cranium
a glorious fountain of crimson arcs from the goons forehead across the table splashing into the ice bucket
freaking ourfather whoartinheaven hallowedbethy shut up verona
so this is how it is
don kim in a ralph lauren polo shirt and white slacks is standing at the entrance of the bar
hes got an asian gangster on each side one of them holding out a smoking silenced glock
more asian gangsters appear all around moving in taking position
the gangsters all look about years old dressed for a hot night at the florentine gardens
but their eyes are dead blank cold as hell
one of carlitos goons points an uzi at don kim
and is filled full of lead in the blink of an eye by a pair of asians on his blind side
who are cut to ribbons by another of carlitos men
and all hell breaks loose
carlito scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his goons using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the bar
the goon absorbs a hail of bullets
verona whips out a
magnum turns toward chev
ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass chev kicks the table forward pinning veronas legs to the bench the ice bucket slides into chevs lap
e snatches out a bottle of dom perignon and fastballs it at veronas gun hand
the bottle shatters
verona bobbles the
it hits the ground goes off and the four fingers of veronas right hand are vaporized
verona shrieks like a ten year old girl at a justin timberlake concert
behind the bar carlito quickly punches up his cell phone
get me out of here
a pilot is standing by in carlitos personal helicopter waiting on the roof
he fires her up lifts off
carlitos and don kims men have backed into opposite corners of the room and are firing back and forth
verona crawls along the floor gathering up whats left of his fingers
comes across a syringe and grabs it in his teeth like a pirates knife
don kim stands amidst the chaos completely unperturbed
from behind the bar ill kill you for this chelios
chev swoons almost passes out
catches sight of a gun and pries it from the hand of a dead goon
he spots veronas feet disappearing behind a wall takes a bead and fires blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers
an asian gangster runs up and lobs a grenade behind the bar
it bounces along and comes to rest next to carlito
carlito thinks quick grabbing one of his goons a pounder from behind
he body tackles the big man onto the floor right on top of the live grenade and brings his weight down on top of him
the big goons body absorbs the blast which picks them both up five feet in the air
carlito momentarily airborne pops up from behind the bar like a jack in the box then drops back down with a thud
ronnie james dio
the lounge opens into a daylight drenched pool area
carlitos helicopter drops down into view roiling up the water
carlito makes a break for it
oh no you dont
chev goes after him spinning and careening across the slick floor like a charlie chaplin drunk act dodging bullets and blasting away
police have surrounded the hotel and are pouring into the lobby in teams
squad cars cherry tops flashing swat vans pulled up on to the curb people roped off crowd control news vans the works
tv reporter is sending a live feed amidst the pandemonium
police have moved to surround the downtown standard hotel where the suspect
the unidentified madman
is believed to be holed up and making a desperate last stand
chev staggers out into the daylight as the windows to the restaurant shatter and is met by a swirling rush of wind as the helicopter attempts to set down amidst
the chaise lounges and futuristic plastic cabanas
carlito is climbing in as chev clambers up and grabs him from behind
carlito spins chev shoves the gun in his face
present from kaylo
but just as hes about to pull the trigger he freezes
and we see that verona has come up behind him and jammed chev drops to his knees
his heartbeat is deafening in a bloodthirsty rage now what
now say shit
shaken for once jesus man where the fuck where you
verona grabs the gun out of chevs hand and points it at he blows carlito away with three shots
the pilot starts to lift off in a blue panic
verona shoves chev aside and hops into the back seat pointing his gun at the pilots head
thats right motherfucker
verona whips the gun around as the bird rises intending to finish chev off from the air
and has the gun removed from his hand by chev who has climbed onto the landing skids hooking his dead arm inside the passenger space going up with them
don kim watches the helicopter rise as his men finish off the last of carlitos goons
do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from your friends forehead
gangster gives him a sidelong look
the door busts in and the place is crawling with s
chevs heartbeat is slamming as the bird rises high above the rooftop and the surrounding streets
he wrestles his way up into the back seat as verona tries desperately to push him out
news helicopters hover around the midair struggle like wasps shooting across at the action
live television broadcast an announcer babbles over phenomenal live video of chev and verona struggling in the helicopter
chev has verona locked up both men are fighting with just one hand
verona manages to work his up to chevs shoulder where the steel needle still pokes through
he slides it out and stabs at chevs face
chev catches his wrist in time to hold him off but his grip is slipping
the spaces between chevs heartbeats have grown longer and longer
hes obviously having a massive coronary
youre dead youre dead youre dead
hev swoons his eyes roll back in his head
he starts to go limp fall backwards
then with a final rush of adrenaline he grabs verona by the neck and pulls him along
the two men fall from the helicopter
chev continues to strangle verona in midair
i told you id kill you you son of a bitch
veronas eyes bulge in disbelief
chev continues to strangle him until verona goes limp glassy eyed
chev finally lets go
veronas body drifts away
now hes alone free falling
its almost peaceful up here
it occurs to him he still has his cell phone
he retrieves it from his coat pocket and clicks a speed dial
slow zoom in on eves answering machine as he talks
leave a message
looks like i let you down again
you were right about me
funny you really have time to reflect on things when you know youre going to die
seems like all my life ive just been going going going
i wish id taken more time to stop and smell the roses so to speak but well i guess its too late now
you were the greatest baby
still frame of a city street traffic sounds camera down on the ground
a homeless guy ambles along looks up hustles his ass out of the way
erona hits the ground smack
bounces flies out of frame
next is chev he slams off the canvas top of a moving convertible car bam
hev flies high out of frame then comes down hard smashing into a news stand right in front of the camera
trades and fish wraps rain over chev and the surrounding area
on each a different headline
bo sox break the curse
bush to swiss youre next
the screen cuts to black
a beat of silence
is that it
