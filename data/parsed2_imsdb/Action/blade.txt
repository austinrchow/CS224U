goyer darkness blood curdling screams
presentation credits roll as we its the summer of love and boom
entry doors swing open as paramedics wheel in a female bleeder vanessa s black nine months pregnant
shes deathly pale spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat a shock trauma team swarms over her inserting a vacutainer into an artery to draw blood wrapping a
blood pressure cuff around her arm with stethoscope shes not breathing
the respiratory therapist feeds an endotracheal tube down the womans ruined throat attaches that to an amblu bag blood pressures forty and falling the woman starts spasming violently
it takes three staff members just to hold her down
jesus her waters broken calling for help shes going into uterine contractions camera pushes in on the woman as she bolts upright screaming to wake the dead
we plunge into the darkness of her mouth and find ourselves the sound of a heart beating pounding as we whip snake through floating in amber plasma
erythrocytes leukocytes neutrophils and eosinophils
the rhythmic expansion of the artery walls pulsing with each successive surge of blood as the heart beats faster and faster taking us a child alive but unborn shifting in
a sea of amniotic fluid surrounded by the white protective substance known as vernix caseosa
the heartbeat races like a locomotive now
the unborn child shifts turns its head towards us and opens its eyes
cleaving the darkness radiant light slicing across gleaming damascus steel
words acid etched in the weapons fine tempered surface main credits end
a decaying no mans land populated by condemned buildings and hungry homeless
steam rises from manhole covers drifting across the litter lined streets
suddenly a black mercedes appears over the crest of a hill roaring past us stereo system belting out filter
raquel a wasp wasted woman sits behind the wheel
s rich sickeningly attractive
squirming around in the passenger seat is dennis a model actor boy toy with a sub zero iq and a fuck me sideways grin
so where we going
its a surprise
i likes surprises
raquel eyeballs dennis if looks could devour
what do you have down there little man
raquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh squeezes his groin
she pulls her hand away downshifts
the threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot brakes hard
raquel and dennis climb out
she leads him into industry never sleeps and certainly not this grisly facility
raquel leads dennis around the back of the plant where a host of workers are loading refrigerated trucks with product
what the fuck are we doing here
raquel just smiles heads on into the plant via a loading door
the workers ignore her
dennis follows raquel through the bowels of the plant catching glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart
through one partially open door we see what might be a line of bodybags being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain pulley system
but dennis doesnt have enough time to be disturbed by the vision because hes being pulled away by raquel led down we are in the basement now
at the end of the hall is a steel door with perhaps just the faintest hint of music heard coming from beyond
a peep hole slat opens and a black light shines into raquels eyes
a voice behind the door offers a verbal challenge speaking a language weve never heard laced with a devilish cadence
raquel responds in kind
the door opens
raquel gives dennis a knowing wink enters
raquel and dennis move past a hulking doorman making their way down a narrow stairway
dennis is suitably impressed
is elite underground an abattoir chic version of an old time juke joint with a greasy dangerous vibe
white tiled walls and floors for easy hosing chromed fittings run off gutters drains
writhe on the strobe lit dance floor
a heavy s m scene
wearing head mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on twin decks
music assaults us a beat so heavy it could jar the fillings from your teeth
brutal darkcore along the lines of prodigy or underground
raquel pulls dennis out onto the dance floor
a lupine featured gaultier girl with a streak of white running through her raven hair moves in behind dennis pressing up against him
rachel williams as the angel of death well call her mercury
mercury flicks her tongue against dennis ear its been pierced with a silver post which clicks against her teeth
tattooed across her back in black is a swirling tribal vortex
dennis is now sandwiched between raquel and mercury the three of them dry humping their way to every mans glory
the beat gets louder
the action heavier
the atmosphere more narcotic
people are stripping off their clothes sweating like fiends
its a virtual orgy
dennis laughs reveling in the hedonism
everything rises to a fever pitch over the music fuck i need a drink
raquel just smiles then dennis notices a drop of something spatter his hand
it looks like blood
dennis looks up concerned more blood droplets are falling
raquels face is sprinkled with them now
dennis stops dancing
what is this
some kind of fucked up performance art
raquel turns her face toward the ceiling as if washing herself in a summer shower now the other club goers are looking up too from sprinkler heads in the ceiling
drenching the dancers
the club goers love it thrusting their heads back mouths open wide to receive the crimson offering
horrified dennis recoils turning towards whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl
her canines extend tapering to razor sharp points
her tongue flicks lizard like as fingernails sharpen into claws
all this while the whites of her eyes bleed red pupils oscillating hypnotically
whats wrong baby
dennis screams pushes away from raquel only mercury has fangs now too
in fact everyone in the club does with the exception of poor dennis
thats because theyre all vampires
dennis tries to run but the burly doorman blocks his exit brutally smashing his fist into dennis face
dennis falls dazed
the club goers close in around him
they make a game of it shoving him from one person to another their pale faces leering like twisted jack o lanterns
the strobe lights quicken to a seizure inducing intensity
dennis spins tumbling into raquels arms
she shoves him forward dennis lands on the floor falling at someones boot clad feet
he looks up
a dark figure sits in the shadows unnoticed until this moment
the figure stands moves into the light as time screeches to a halt towers above dennis wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon
a face tempered by a lifetime of horror
his name is blade
blade whips open his long coat shrugging it off revealing an arsenal of high tech weapons strapped to his body point adjustable body armor a modified car assault rifle with
an ultra violet entry light two casull
revolvers a demon automatic cross bow a bandoleer of mahogany stakes an indian style katar punching dagger and last but certainly not least his namesake a silver sword which is
secured in a back scabbard
a gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun
the vampire club goers stare back
and then all hell breaks loose
with a snarl raquel charges at blade moving at superhuman speed practically a blur blade draws his casulls fires in multiple directions as a round roars through the air towards
a silver tipped dum dum bullet which explodes on contact
the round punches a fist sized hole through raquels chest continuing on into the vamp behind her
vampire blood fountains
both creatures tumble forward their bodies liquefying into puddles of black oil which go gurgling down the run off drains
blade continues firing then click
he holsters the casulls swings up his assault rifle calmly flicks on the uv entry light mounted above leaps twenty feet straight up into the air
weve never seen anything move so fast
she crashes through a glass skylight disappearing into the night just as a shaft of blinding uv sunlight cuts across the vampires
they rear back skin smoking from the lights corrosive effects
blade opens fire pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd vampire genocide
the strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts
some of the vampires try to flee scurrying up the stairs but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies then blades car jams
the remaining club goers see their opening surge forward en masse blade drops the rifle reaches over his shoulder and schinggg
unsheathes his sword with a double handed grip
four acid etched feet of blood soaked damascus steel
an edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two
blade moves like lightning hacking his way into two charging vampires
blade spins again cuts another vampire clean in half a latex clad vamp makes a break for it
blade flings his sword sending it spinning end over end thunk
the sword punches into the vampires heart
the hellish creature convulses dies
blade retrieves his sword then senses rising up behind him
in a flash blade swings his sword downward cutting off the vampires right hand at the elbow
the severed limb falls to the floor but it doesnt slow the hulking creature down
it slams into blade
blade flies backwards thirty feet tumbling over tables slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling
blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral faced six foot something nightmare named quinn
the vampire rears back its head jaws stretching wide
every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and maori like tribal tattoos
blade forces an elbow against quinns throat trying to keep him at bay
with his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer pulls out a stake crunch
blade shoves the stake through the vampires larynx
quinn gurgles clutches at his throat
blade rolls out from under unholsters the cross bow secured to his leg
with a flick of a switch the arms of the bow snap
open drawing the bow string taut
blade fires the bolt hits quinn in the shoulder throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall
as quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake blade fires again
a second bolt slams into quinns other arm effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board
mounted in one of the corners is a security camera
blade fires a cross bow bolt straight into the lens
blade strides over placing his sword against quinns chest
where is deacon frost
quinn glares trying to speak gagging on the stake still lodged in his trachea got something in your throat
blade yanks the stake free
the vampire laughs air whistling through his ruined larynx
fuck you day walker i aint saying shit frost
quinn responds with a slew of rapid fire vampire invectives
blade sees hes getting nowhere fast calmly sheathes his sword
he unclips a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness you wont stop him blade
the tides rising the sleepers gonna blade shoves the grenade in quinns mouth pulls the pin
quinn goes up like a roman candle
blade turns surveying his work ignoring the howling pyre behind him all evidence of the vampires is gone with the exception of a few oily black puddles
clothes jewelry its all been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures accelerated decomposition
dennis sits huddled in a corner having pissed his pants
as blade approaches he cringes back please dont blade simply grabs dennis by the jaw tilting his head upward rotating it from side to side looking for bite marks
there arent any
blade moves on leaving dennis alone amidst the carnage
as blade starts up the stairs he pauses in mid step scurries out from underfoot
blade adjusts his footfall sparing the roach
he continues on up the stairs disappearing in the smoky haze
camera follows a bagged corpse as its rolled into the autopsy room by an assistant
brought you a baked potato nice and crispy
still warm too
curtis webb the forensic pathologist s white bread a little on the smarmy side steps forward unzips the bag its quinn whats left of him anyway
burnt to a charcoal briquette limbs twisted horribly oozing fluids
curtis turns his head grimacing wafting the air
jesus thats rank curtis turns back makes note of the blackened stump where quinns arm used to be the ruined throat whats his story
paramedics said he was still screaming when they found him
looks like some joker had stapled him to a wall
of a slide mounted blood smear stained with wright stain blue ink
what we see is a collection of donut shaped pink things red blood cells intermingled with some small blue specks platelets and the occasional larger light blue blobs white blood
karen jansen s a fine featured hematologist with a social life in suspended animation sits back from the microscope stumped
next to her is julie whitaker a cheerful chemtech
you took this off a doa
curtis sits on a stool nearby slowly nodding
this isnt human blood
then what is it
i dont know re microscope look at this blood smear curtis takes a look for himself
the red blood cells are biconvex which is theoretically impossible
theyre hypochromic theres virtually no hemoglobin in them
shaking her head look at the pmns theyre binucleated they should be mononucleated
what about the chemistry panel
karen looks to julie who reaches for a computer print out
blood sugar level is three times the norm phosphorous and uric acid are off the scales
shrugs like the woman said impossible
karen removes her glasses rubbing the bridge of her nose
curtis its three in the morning
im really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes
insistent its not a joke
ive got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now look just come up and see him okay
five minutes thats all i ask
i thought you promised to give me some distance
this is purely professional curiosity karen i swear
karen rolls her eyes lets loose a tired sigh
five minutes not a second more
and i dont want to hear a word about us
the dead of night not a mouse in the house
curtis and karen each garbed in a mask stand on either side of quinns body which now rests on the autopsy table
a preliminary exploratory y incision has been made across the chest stretching from shoulder to shoulder then continuing on down the abdomen
ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart and lungs
you havent started in on the internal organs
just the blood sample from the pericardial sac
curtis pauses studying quinns disfigured face the features seem much less damaged now almost as if the corpse were healing itself
thats weird what
he looks different now burns are less extreme some of these wounds have closed up curtis pulls out a penlight flicks it on
he leans over quinn shining the light into one of his eyes
tell me something honestly you ever have second thoughts about us
grudgingly sometimes curtis looks up from the corpse grinning beneath his mask
but then i remember what an ass hole you were and im snapped back to reality
jesus karen youre breaking my heart here quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table sinking his fangs into curtis jugular
he snaps the mans neck in two for easier access sucking in blood like a living vacuum
karen stumbles backwards sending autopsy tools clattering
rises from the table flinging curtis twitching body aside
he curls his blood soaked lips back baring viper like fangs emitting a crazed by thirst more blood karen backs into the corpse drawers but quinn is upon her in
a half second wrapping a hand about her throat
his mouth opens morphs disturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole caustic saliva dripping from his canines karen tries to turn her head away but quinns grip is
she finds herself staring into his eyes pupils pulsing rapid fire opening and closing hypnotic as quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into karens carotid artery and starts to
a load of mahogany buckshot chews into quinns side
he howls in pain
another load catches him full in the face
he drops karen
she falls to the floor the sound of rushing blood pounding through her skull
she struggles to move turns her head finds herself eye to eye with curtis corpse
rising his face torn up smoking
whip pan to standing at the entrance to the morgue a streetsweeper auto shotgun in hand sizing quinn up
now dont we look dapper
quinn bellows with rage ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration doors from its hinges flinging it at blade like it was lawn furniture blade rolls to the side as
the door crashes against the wall
quinn runs moving through the morgue like a human tornado heading for the windows at the end of the room smash
out goes quinn taking half the wall with him
blade rushes to the decimated window looks down quinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below caving it in
he springs off loping across the tarmac on three limbs then screech
rolling up onto the hood of an oncoming car before disappearing into the night blade spins sees karen bleeding her life away on the floor
she reaches a hand out to him beseeching blade pulls away from her grasp takes a step towards the exit then hesitates
a flicker of doubt washes across blades face
he looks down at karen once more wrestling with his conscience finally making a decision
he kneels scoops karen up into his arms
just then rush into the morgue weapons drawn hold it ass hole
blade ignores them turning to face the window before him
its a good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building a parking structure and damned if blade doesnt seem to be considering the jump
the police close in agitated
blade crouches switches karen to a one handed grip i said hold it
blade clears the impossible distance almost
he snags the ledge of the adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as karen slips from the grasp of his right a last second save his fingers clamping
around her wrist is all that stands between karen and street pizza
she screams anyway dangling below him blade grunts swinging karen like a pendulum heaving her up and over the ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes
she lands on her shoulder clutching it in pain blade heaves himself up crouching beside her
gasping my shoulder dislocated blade places a hand on her shoulder another around her elbow and without any consideration to discomfort crack
brutally pops it back in place
karen screams again as he scoops her up once more and heads for which is parked nearby
the definitive high performance heavy metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to power an apollo rocket
blade sets karen down in the passenger seat climbs behind the wheel keys the ignition
the engine roars to life belching fumes through the dual exhaust
blade floors it burning serious rubber as the olds vanishes from sight
as the two policemen stare numbly in open mouthed astonishment
blade pilots the olds down the streets moving through a series of increasingly degenerating neighborhoods coming at last to the sprawling warehouse district
the olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility thats been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire
ultra violet floodlights illuminate the area while an army of security cameras keep a watchful eye
blade glances at karen cursing himself for giving into his emotions
he hits a remote secured to the sun visor a gate grinds open
we follow the olds as it cruises around the back of the building heading down a concrete loading ramp
at the bottom of the ramp a heavy iron door rises
blades olds disappears into the darkness
more uv lights flicker on
were in a massive loading elevator which hums as it ascends eventually reaching its destination with a booming clang
the doors at the rear glide open
blade guides the olds out
set up in an old ironworks the place looks like a cross between an auto junkyard and an armory
equipment is strewn everywhere lathes mills old furnaces gutted vehicles an ad hoc surgical theater all of it jerry rigged in a brutal oily tech
blade climbs out of the olds
he opens the passenger door and pulls karen out carries her in his arms
are we bringing home strays now
abraham whistler s hobbles out of the shadows leaning heavily on a cane
gimlet eyed bitter his right leg encased in a metal brace
though his face is lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray we sense he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age
shes been bitten
you shouldve killed her then
she hasnt turned yet
pointedly you can help her
blade and whistler stare each other down
finally whistler turns and heads over to the operating theater
you watch her close
she starts to turn you finish her off
blade nods lays karen down on the operating table
whistler turns on an overhead light
karen is sheathed in sweat ashen
shes lost a lot of blood
whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves probes the wound in karens neck with an antiseptic swab theres capillary damage around the perimeter of the wound the tissue looks
another hour and shed be well into the change
whistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under karens nose
as she starts to stir can you hear me woman
karens eyes open wide
shes scared disoriented what
youve been bitten by a vampire
weve got to try and burn out the venom just like a rattlesnake bite whistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic looking fluid
karen sees the syringe resists hold her
blade forces karen back
whistler readies the syringe
reading her name tag dr
listen close im going to inject you with an antidote made from allium setivum garlic
this is going to hurt
whistler sinks the needle into karens neck and depresses the plunger
hurt doesnt begin to describe what karen experiences next
imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid through your veins
karen shrieks her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms
the wound on her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous vampire venom
karen clutches at blades arms digging her nails in
she stares up at him with unflinching intensity like a child desperately searching for assurance
uncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid
hed like nothing more than to be done with this but the only thing he can do is hold karen while she rides out the seizures
growing darker by the moment
the last thing she sees is blade staring down at her then the night closes in
close on a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club massacre
blade turns and stares into the camera fires his cross bow
the screen cuts to static
moves into frame holding a remote
with a tap of a button the monitor goes dark
pull back to reveal a large minimalist conference room the house of erebus seat of the vampire races legislative assembly
gathered around a massive table are the twelve vampire elders representing a rainbow of racial colors names like pallintine von esper ashe bava
two of them the faustinas are identical twins lethal looking women with alabaster skin
chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table
from time to time a member will pour themselves a glass or perhaps help themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks
at the head of the table is gaetano dragonetti current vampire overlord
blood red eyes parchment skin stretched over skull like features
incalculably ancient but still deadly and virile as a viper
he uses the secret tongue the ancient vampire language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable of reproducing
once again our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade
he must be destroyed
in english youre wrong dragonetti
all heads turn
who would dare such impudence
a mere underlord in the vampire hierarchy steps forward
strikingly handsome younger less conservative than his superiors fueled with a passionate intensity
amongst the vampire community hes known as an agitator
hes also the vampire equivalent of a racial supremacist
the day walker represents a unique opportunity
wed be fools to waste it by killing him
subtitled taking umbrage deacon frost
you refuse to speak our language you insult the house of erebus by using the humans gutter tongue have you no respect for tradition
why should i respect something which has outlived its purpose
this causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires
frost might as well have slapped dragonetti in the face
simmering i see
and what would you have us do with this half breed
unlock the secrets of his dna
hes the key weve been looking for
he is an abomination
dragonetti slams his fist down toppling a carafe spilling blood across the tabletop
frost looks to the others why should we spend our lives cringing from the daylight when his blood offers us an alternative
its time we stepped out of the shadows
dragonetti looks apoplectic
elder pallintine a five hundred year old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy interjects
youre out of line frost
or am i just the first to say out loud what weve all been thinking
the fact that no one answers is telling
dragonetti glowers at the other elders sensing the tide turning
the shadows suit us frost
weve existed this way for thousands of years
who are you to challenge our ways
someone whos sick of living off scraps
the coming age belongs to us not the humans
to the others when the final war between our races comes who do you want leading the charge
frost stabs an accusing finger at the overlord
some withered up fossil ready to snap like a brittle bone at the first sign of change
dragonetti growls like an beast raking his claws across the tyro vampires face knocking him to the ground
frost picks himself up touches the gashes on his cheek
looks at his fingers licks the blood from them
careful old fang
you might wake up one day and find yourself extinct
frost smiles at dragonetti and calmly exits the room
on karen as she comes to
her wounds have been bandaged
she rises a little shaky takes in her surroundings shes in a spartan room like a monks cell
on the wall is a collection of knives and daggers
some of them wooden their hilts inscribed with bizarre looking runes
in the center of these weapons rests hanging like a cross in a chapel dominating all else
karen touches it
then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt by a tarnished chain
she reaches for it opens it the locket features a photo old and faded
its the black woman we saw in the prologue vanessa standing in the sunshine
karen moves towards the door cautious we hear voices now coming from beyond a series of black out curtains
karen pushes one aside and sees strapped into some kind of inquisition esque restraint chair
his shirt is off his body slick with sweat
whistler finishes strapping blade in then stands back holding up a gas powered pistol injector hesitant i had to increase the dose
youre building up a resistance to the serum impatient just do it old man
whistler nods fitting blade with a bite guard
then he presses the pistol injector against blades carotid artery
blade shakes violently grinding his teeth through the bite guard veins cording in his neck
he clutches whistlers hand holding it tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure
to his credit whistler never lets go
mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs its violent course
we understand that these shared moments oddly private in their horror are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together
finally blade slumps forward in his restraints exhausted
she draws back instinctively knowing that shes just witnessed something she shouldnt have
she looks for an exit sees another doorway
she makes for it a dusty darkened hole of a room no windows just shadows crumbling concrete rust stains and filled with swirling blood plasma choked with electrical leads and
something floats within suspended in the murky fluid a child two or three years of age drifting about like a medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde thump
the child slams up against the glass
karen backpedals startled
its eyes are open now pupils blown
it snarls revealing a mouthful of razored fangs trailing mouth slime across the glass as it futilely tries to chew its way through to karen
karen stifles a sob turning and running right into who now blocks the exit sword in hand
karen retreats a step wary you shouldnt be here
im sorry i wandered off the beaten path doctor
whistler has entered the room from a second doorway
karen looks from whistler to blade trapped between them who are you people
my name is abraham whistler
re blade this is blade
as for our little homunculus here whistler limps over to the tank rapping his cane against it
the creature snaps at it reflexively following the silver tip back and forth like a fish after a lure
hes a vampire
youre joking not at all
youre looking at a prime specimen of the homines nocturna
whistler toys with the feral creature engaging in a certain amount of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied
suddenly it surges towards the top of the tank clawing at the lid karen becomes alarmed but then a massive electrical jolt shocks the creature back into submission
if blade hadnt brought you here you wouldve wound up like him
karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck recalling the events of the previous night
she looks to blade
why did you help me
blade scowls his gaze flickering to whistler
appraising her maybe not
i did some checking shes a hematologist
knowledge like that might come in handy
its not worth the risk
we cant trust her
because youre tainted
the venoms still inside you
you could still turn on us
what happens then
blade looks to whistler as far as hes concerned the debates over
then i have to take you out just like any other bloodsucker
blade turns and exits
whistler and karen follow
beyond the grimy outer windows we can see that the day is closing long shadows amber light
karen lingers in the doorway reeling from information overload
blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt strapping on body armor loading ammunition
he strings the tarnished locket around his neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil then pauses to inspect a modified pistol sighting down the length
we hunt them moving from one city to the next tracking their migrations
theyre hard to kill
they tend to regenerate
blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber then checks his next weapon sarcastic so what do you use then
nodding some of the old wives tales are true theyre severely allergic to silver various types of wood
feed them garlic and theyll go into anaphylactic shock whistler picks up a customized rifle with a uv entry light flicking on the beam
and of course theres always sunlight ultra violet rays
karen shakes her head incredulous and you honestly expect me to believe all this
i dont care what you believe
i saved your life once i dont plan on making a habit of it
you want my advice youll be out of the city by nightfall
if youre stupid enough to stay thats your business
i cant just leave
i have a life here a career not anymore
youve seen one of them
you wont be allowed to live after that
karen stares at blade
whistler gestures to the windows theres a war going on out there
blade myself a few others weve tried to keep it from spilling over onto the streets
beat sometimes people like yourself get caught in the cross fire
as far as hes concerned theres nothing else to say
karen is still protesting though
i can go to the police
i have blood samples back at the hospital
i can show them
youll be dead before you can file the complaint
no ones that powerful
he doesnt suffer fools gladly
youre talking about a brotherhood that predates the catholic church by thousands of years
their survival depends on their ability to blend in
chances are youve encountered them and not even known it
on the subway in a bar blade slings his car onto his shoulder impatient
he starts towards the olds gesturing
whistler tosses a small metal canister to karen
consider it a parting gift
vampire mace silver nitrate essence of garlic
in disbelief so thats it
you guys just patch me up and send me on my way
there is one other thing
id buy yourself a gun if i were you
if you start becoming sensitive to the daylight if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much youve had to drink then i suggest you take that gun and use it
better that than the alternative
karen stares at whistler horrified as we we are deep in the narrow stacks of a sepulchral archive
exactly what and where this place is will become more clear later on
but for now the camera drifts through the warren of aisles
along the way we catch a glimpse of a hulking silhouette cowering behind a series of japanese shoji screens
later on we find tucked away in a carrel surrounded by books and scriptures with only the sickly glow of his laptop to provide light
what are you doing here
frost pauses seeing dragonetti emerge from the shadows
outraged these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus
you and the other elders wouldnt know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it
cryptically which of course they do
youre wasting your time frost
far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words
whatever secrets they hold have been lost
frost studies dragonetti a self satisfied grin on his face
if the act was intended to unnerve dragonetti it succeeded though the ancient vampire would never admit it
what are you up to frost
frost shuts the lid on his laptop rising drawing intimidatingly close to dragonetti
wouldnt you like to know old fang
a beat as the young turk stares his elder down
dragonetti is the first to lose his nerve
frost smiles and exits leaving the old vampire to lick his wounds
camera drifts back to the hulking silhouette which has been eavesdropping on the conversation
it quivers in fear
blade brings the car to a stop
karen looks at him
his eyes are hidden behind his glasses his expression stone
remember what we said
keep your eyes open
as karen climbs out blade swings the door shut behind her
the olds roars off down the quiet residential street
karen crosses the lobby stepping into an elevator
just as the doors are closing a woman and two men duck in alongside her
silence the uncomfortableness of an elevator ride magnified tenfold
karen can feel the eyes of her fellow passengers upon her
finally succumbing to paranoia she hazards a glance would she be able to tell if these people werent human
the woman turns to karen smiles karen surreptitiously fishes the vampire mace from her pocket clutching it and now one of the men turns to look at her nodding the
elevator doors open
karen hurries out heads left finds herself in a deserted hallway
she looks back then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out
as karen raises the canister of mace the trio turn and head down to the right
karen breathes a sigh of relief shakes her head
karen enters quickly bolting the door behind her
she picks up the phone dials i need the police
this is an emergency as karen waits to be connected she moves to the back entrance and checks the locks then the windows then the fire escape finally a voice
comes on the other end
my name is karen jansen i was with curtis webb at mid town hospital last night thats right i witnessed the attack listening aurora apartment g
yes ill wait here
karen hangs up the phone and turns streams in through a window
karen forces herself to look at it and winces shielding her eyes
again she brings a hand to the bandaged wound on her neck
she moves to the window pulling the shade down frightened
get a grip on yourself girl
she sinks down into a chair to wait setting whistlers vampire mace aside
then she shuts her eyes massaging her temples
we see quinn his mouth opening wide saliva dripping from his fangs
his pupils pulsating hypnotically
we rush into his gaping maw and wham
were back to reality
karen wakes with a start looks to the windows time has passed its getting dark outside and someone is knocking at the front door
karen reaches for the vampire mace then moves to the door
she looks through the peephole cautious who is it
a police officer stands in the hallway s handsome a knight in shining armor as far as shes concerned
im responding to a call
karen visibly relaxes
she opens the door and steps aside allowing gideon to enter
yes that was me im karen jansen gideon smiles takes a quick glance around the room then studies karens face the bandages on her neck
are you all right
off karens nod im glad you called ms
jansen weve been anxious to get a hold of you
you disappeared on us for a while
listen do you have any idea what happened to curtis the other doctor
matter of fact oh hes dead
but i wouldnt worry about that if i were you
gideons smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun
because youre dead too
she has a half second to act in which she triggers a spray of vampire mace into gideons face
gideon stumbles back blinded cursing rubbing the heel of his palm against his eyes karen expects pyrotechnics but the end result is little more than an annoyance
a second later gideon is simply blinking sniffing his fingers confused garlic
he said it would work against vampires gideon bursts out laughing
who said i was a vampire
gideon shakes his head still snickering
he forces karen against the wall placing the gun against her head thanks for the laugh
you can shut your eyes if you want to
the front door explodes open as blade comes flying through it
gideon tries to bring his pistol up but blade grips the mans hand and squeezes
gideon screams as his bones snap like kindling
the pistol falls from his grasp blade fires his fist into gideons gut again and again then flings the officer across the room sending him smashing into a glass cased
bleeding battered gideon struggles to stand blade is all over him kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he sinks to the floor in a half conscious haze
blade stands over gideons limp form fists clenched breathing heavily touching down after his adrenaline high
finally he looks to karen you okay
karen nods glances at gideon how did you know
figured theyd send someone after you
thought id wait around and see who showed up
you used me as bait
it worked didnt it
but he couldve he didnt
get over it
blade kneels next to gideon
he turns the mans head inspects the neck the skin behind the ear but hes a policeman hes a familiar
a human who works for the vampires
see this mark
blade pushes aside gideons hair revealing a tiny cryptic symbol tattooed into the mans scalp
thats a glyph kind of like a vampire cattle brand
that means officer friendly here is someones property
any of the other vampires try to bleed him theyll have to answer to friendlys owner studying the glyph this glyph belongs to deacon frost
weve been tracking him for a while now why in gods name would anyone want to work for them
because theyre vampire wanna bes
if theyre loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them
and thats a good thing
live forever never get old
the ultimate high
just then gideon moans
blade drags the man up so theyre eye to eye
how bout you officer
you a good little bloodhound
blade and karen are now standing by gideons police cruiser which is parked outside karens apartment
blade shoves gideon against the hood of the cruiser
he finds gideons keys moves to the trunk opens it a sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs
blade opens the unit coolant vapor hisses out
inside are plastic bags containing blood
looks like our friend was blood running
to gideon where were you headed
gideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth mphuck you wham
blade plants gideons face into the hood of the car
gideon groans coughs jesus brookner holliston clinic blade releases him then reaches for his casull
what are you doing
karen steps in front of blade shielding gideon
you cant do this hes human its murder
its war now get the fuck out of the way
karen grabs blades arm wrestling with him trying to push his hand away
as the two of them struggle gideon makes a break for it stumbling across the lawn
blade pushes karen aside takes aim but gideon ducks into an alley disappearing from sight
blade spins on karen enraged god damnit
do you have any idea what you just did
hell warn them
theyll be waiting
but karens defiant shes not backing down
you were going to kill him
what was i supposed to do
shut my eyes and pretend i didnt see what i saw
blade tears off his glasses
karen gasps arent human nor are they vampire
theyre something else emerald green laced with swirling flecks of red
let me set you straight on something doctor
what youve seen so far is nothing
the world you live ins just the sugar coated topping
theres another world beneath it the real world and its a fucking bloodbath
if you want to survive in it youd better pull your head out of your ass
blade slips his glasses back on leaving karen shocked into silence
he heads for his olds without looking back climbs in guns the engine
in seconds hes gone tearing off down the street in a cloud of exhaust
we are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline moving towards the edgewood towers whose windows reflect the blood red sinking sun
suffused lighting elegant tile work featuring evocative mosaics the quiet strains of classical music the lupine gaultier girl from the club glides beneath the water surfacing at the deep end
we see lounging in a chair studying a laptop which rests beside him
on the screen is a digitized image a page taken from an ancient manuscript written in a secret tongue
officer gideon waits nearby cradling his ruined hand his battered face cast downward like a boy whos been called into the principals office
look i know youre disappointed crestfallen
blade was waiting for me
there wasnt anything i could do
frost nods lapsing into brooding contemplation
tell me something gideon what blood type are you
is this a trick question
i dont really know take a wild stab
im interested in the antigens here the agglutination reaction gideon stammers as frost rises
in the blink of an eye frost lifts gideon from the floor dangling the officer over the deep end of the pool by his throat im going to guess ab
gideon gurgles as frosts fingernails pierce his flesh drawing blood
then frost releases him gideon plunges into the pool
mercury is on him in a heartbeat tearing him apart like a great white consuming a piece of chum
the water churns violently around them clouding with red
when its over mercury rises from the pool dripping wet covered from head to toe in a crimson sheen
she kisses frost hungrily letting gideons blood flow from her mouth to his
frost flicks a tongue over his lips
give the man a prize
below them gideons lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom his police badge twinkling like sunken treasure
blades olds cruises to a stop
were in a low end commercial district junky heaven
blade climbs out pulling an automatic rifle from the back seat then heading into an alleyway
blade makes his way down the alley cautious he sees mountains of trash boarded up windows overlapping layers of gang graffiti a rat crouching on a trash dumpster gnawing on
a dead pigeon then a sound behind blade the scuffle of feet blade whirls drawing his sword charging at an approaching shadow stopping mere millimeters from decapitating whos been backed up against the wall her eyes wide with fright
blades sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm having drawn just the slightest taste of blood
what the hell are you doing
i could have killed you
blade lowers his sword
karen remembers to breathe
she slumps tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with her body
i remembered the address
i followed you blade shakes his head amazed
do you have a death wish or are you just stupid
karen pushes away from the wall angry look if what you say is true if theres a chance i could turn into one of them then ive got no choice
i have to work with you
i need to learn everything i can about them
its the only way ill be able to find a cure for myself
there is no cure
defiant you dont know that
blade turns and moves to the end of the alley studying the graffiti covered wall intently what are you looking at
gesturing what do you see here
graffiti look closer
blade indicates a design amongst the various gang banger tags that looks something like a post modern hieroglyphic
this isnt a gang tag its a vampire marking
it means theres a safe house nearby
a place they can go if dawn is coming
blade points to a building across the street your basic inner city blood barter establishment where desperate transients parley their plasma into cash
recognizing it i know this place its a blood bank
owned by vampires
theres one of these in every major city and just like dominos they always deliver
looking to karen you telling me youre ready to walk through that door
blade continues to stare at her taking her measure theres a strength in this womans eyes she has the soul of a fighter and blade recognizes it
all right then listen up vampire anatomy
crosses and running water dont do dick so forget what youve seen in the movies
blade enumerates the following on his fingers you use the stake silver or sunlight got it
blade holds up one of his casulls
know how to use one of these
karen takes the weapon from him eyes all over it
blade takes the gun back snorting derisively
safetys off rounds already chambered cocking it silver hollow points filled with garlic
you aim for the heart or the head anything else is a one way ticket to a pine box
blade hand it to her again then starts across the street towards the clinic
karen follows blade enters swinging his rifle around for all to see
the potential donors scramble for the exit
behind the counter tanaka a male nurse reaches for an alarm button
blade vaults over the counter aiming his rifle
i know youre blood running
whos your sponsor
i dont know what youre pow
blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his teeth
karen flinches stepping forward what if youve made a mistake
blade pins tanakas head to the wall turning it to the side revealing the mans glyph
its different than gideons looking more like a japanese kanji character
blade grips tanaka by his collar shoving him through a doorway karen and blade see supply cabinets cots a number of locked refrigeration units
blade fires into the door handle of one of the units tears it open the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with plastic packets of blood
to karen still think we might be wrong
to tanaka how much are you shipping
blade opens fire sweeping his rifle around the room shooting everything in sight
glass cabinetry shatters ampoules and vacutainers go flying
tanaka cowers arms wrapped about his head
blade stops shooting
he leans down towards tanaka placing the end of his rifle against the mans forehead
tanaka looks like hes about to wet his pants
ive got a message for your masters the nights no longer safe for their kind
blade pulls back his rifle leaving a red indentation mark where the end of the rifle barrel pressed into tanakas skin
he starts towards the exit
blade and karen return to the olds
he keys the ignition lets the engine idle
theyre parked down the street from the blood clinic
karen looks to blade confused you let him go off blades nod an hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one didnt even talk
blade points tanaka rushes from the clinic climbing behind the wheel of a mustang parked nearby
he takes off blade follows the mustang clicking on a cell phone scanner mounted on the dash
numbers flash on the lcd screen as it searches for a signal then locks onto it
we hear a dial tone then a number being dialed filtered on scanner youve reached a number that is no longer in service
please consult your operator and try again
filtered on scanner its tanaka pin number sixteen zero zero nine a real voice comes on the line filtered on scanner yes
karen looks to blade impressed
tanaka speeds shouting into the speaker phone get me pearl
filtered on speaker pearl is feeding look im not fucking around here
that hunter frost has been talking about
he was just at the clinic
tore the goddamn place apart
a black edifice no windows secured parking no signage except for a purple neon scroll above the entrance a flashing kanji just like the glyph tattooed on tanakas neck
tanakas mustang pulls into the parking lot
he climbs out flagging away the valets heads inside blades olds stopping a few blocks down the street
blade kills the engine studying the black pearl
looks like we hit pay dirt
this place is crawling with them
pointing see the valets over there
so is the doorman
how can you tell
the way they move they way they smell blade continues to scan the area pointing out a few more likely candidates the whore on the corner shes one too
so are the two men standing under the streetlight
blade reaches into the back seat retrieves his sword and a satchel
he snaps open his shotgun loads it
karen continues to study the vampires blade identified
so many of them i still cant believe theyre real
there are worse things than vampires out there
pumping his shotgun like me
blade reaches for the door blade and karen climb out
he lets his shotgun fall within the folds of his longcoat and starts across the street only to be challenged by a hulking doorman at the entrance
im sorry sir do you have an invitation
the front door flies open as the doormans body sails through
blade enters karen at his heels the pearl is an all hours strip club cum casino catering exclusively to japanese zaibatsu clientele
dimly lit the air thick with cigarette smoke deafening music
go boards pachinko machines sexy little manga waifs in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks strippers writhe in the circular pit tables surrounded by howling grab ass men
but thats nothing compared to the main attraction whos doing a bump and grind down the runway shaking a body worthy of a schoolboys wet dream
a leather s m face mask nipple rings inch spikes and a pair of panties to hide her modesty
blade scans the room just in time to see tanaka ducking into a back hallway
blade pushes towards the rear of the club
as she catches sight of blade and freezes in mid routine
the stripper pulls off her hood
long black hair with a streak of white tumbles down her back its mercury
blade and karen head past the bathrooms
at the end of the hall is a door marked office
just then the mens door opens a drunk college kid steps out sees blade hey blade plants a hand over the kids face shoving him back into the bathroom as
he kicks open the office door tanaka spins around startled tries to throw a punch blade traps tanakas arm levering the man up and over
he crashes into a shelving unit taking the whole thing down with him
blade grabs a handful of tanakas hair yanks his head up wheres the entrance
i cant theyll kill me
blade rips off his glasses and gives tanaka an eyeful his irises pulse and glow
i got news for you butt boy
youre already dead
terrified oh god shit behind the bookcase blade drops tanaka moves to the bookcase
he searches the wall a moment then finds a trigger
hits it the bookcase slides aside revealing a hidden elevator
as blade moves to put his sunglasses back on we see tanaka behind him pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer swinging it up blade unholsters one of his
casulls faster than any gunslinger in history
he fires over his own shoulder blowing tanaka back against the wall
blade puts his sunglasses back on motions to the elevator then nods to karen after you
the elevator descends
then a tone chimes signaling the end of the ride
the doors hiss open blade and karen enter the narrow maze like stacks of the vampire archives weaving their way through shelves of climate controlled digitized records
what is this place
some kind of archive isnt this all a little high tech
i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins
youve been watching too much tv
theyve got their claws sunk into everything finance real estate politics
probably own half of downtown
blade pulls a cd rom from the shelves its spine labeled in indecipherable vampire glyphs
this must be where they keep their records he pauses hearing a distant whisper
blade signals quiet silently leading karen through the stacks towards a vestibule of sorts leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of rice paper shoji screens and tatami mats
candles glow within illuminating a monstrously obese shadow beyond the translucent rice paper walls
the shadow speaks in a tremulous bird like voice the secret tongue
as blade draws his sword the massive shadow freezes frightened lorca is that you
blade slides open the nearest shoji screen nothing karens seen up until this point could prepare her for the archives curator a nine hundred pound androgynous vampire of asian origin
lounging amidst pillowed rice mats wearing a communications headset
think of a cross between divine and jabba the hutt
skin the complexion of buttermilk so corpulent he can barely move so engorged with blood that hes actually sweating it from the pores of his skin
pearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have been affixed to counter balanced arms this way pearl can access information without leaving bed
lying next to pearl dwarfed by the vampires massive size is the chalk white body of a recently drained naked boy
at the sight of blade pearls eyes widen in fear into a speakerphone hes here
over speakerphone congratulations day walker
frost paces the length of his pool wearing a hands free communications headset grinning
in the flesh blade
i understand youve been looking for me
as blade listens pearl reaches for his trackball attempting to delete the document currently on his monitors but blade lunges forward sinking the tip of his sword into pearls fleshy
eyeballing pearl dont be
youre another notch on my sword hilt nothing else
frosts deep laughter drifts from the speakerphone
frost settles into his chair enjoying the cat and mouse
youre quick blade ill give you that
in the space of an hour youve crossed my familiar destroyed a blood bank beat now here you are in the heart of our archives terrorizing our curator
he has a knife to my throat frost
he cutting him off youre history pearl
have the good grace to die with some dignity
beat round one to you blade
click the line goes dead
blade tosses his satchel on the bed opens it
inside is a hand held uv lamp hooked up to a nine volt battery
pearl eyes the device fearful what is that
a sun lamp
were gonna play twenty questions
depending on your answers you might get to have yourself a tanning session
blade looks to pearls monitor and sees a digitized image the same manuscript deacon had been studying earlier
what were you in such a big hurry to delete just now
blade turns on the lamp
pearl howls as the harsh light falls upon him
blade flicks the light off
pearl cringes growling his face smoking profusely
exposure to the uv rays even for one short second has made his face blister like a plague victims
relenting its an epistle a letter frost has been translating it prophesizes lamagras return
and who is lamagra
pearl hesitates again blade turns on the lamp for a longer time
pearl thrashes covering his face
his hands blacken the skin sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath
karen has to avert her gaze blade turns off the lamp
pearl snarls his body quivering with poisonous rage
lamagra is the sleeper
blade leans in close so hes eye to eye with pearl
wheres the original pearl
you must have it around here somewhere
pearl sweats blood his flaking slug like lips quivering
the vault blade follows pearls eyes to an armored door then he stands back handing the uv rig to karen
if he moves cook him
blade approaches the vault door sizing up its locking mechanism
he pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the door arming it with a beep
please ill give you the combination youll damage the documents thats the point
enraged pearl lunges from his bed
karen triggers the uv rig flash frying him to a blackened crisp
pearl quivers his enormous body smoking like a piece of charred meat
blade looks back at karen with newfound respect
blade turns back to the vault setting off the charge
blade kicks the damaged door in knocking it clear off its hinges ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind borne leaves
blade and karen see a lucite encased document fragments of an ancient calligraphied papyrus
what are these
curiosity killed the cat
blade and karen spin mercury and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the vault
grins hola amigo
karen triggers the uv light but mercury ducks under it ripping it from her hands crushing it
in a split second the she demon has her claws around karens throat
as blade reaches for his rifle the vampires converge on him like quicksilver
they drag karen and blade out the vampires fling blade against the wall pinning him
you took my arm blade
but thats okay im growing a new one quinn lifts up his arm
a skeletal forearm has grown from the stump
its got cartilage sinew and muscle but no flesh yet
think ill ever play the piano again
shrugging you can slice him you can dice him and the man just keeps on coming
blade struggles violently but quinn is upon him pounding his fist into blade again and again and again giving him payback with compounded interest
when its over quinn steps back winded blades head hangs down
he gasps wincing every breath sending a red hot poker to his gut
quinn grabs a hold of blades jaw forcing his head up
stay with me sweetness im not through with you yet
quinn pulls blades jacket open sees the bandoleer of mahogany stakes
he tugs one out admiring it
to the others now heres a man who takes his job just a little too seriously dont you think
back to blade which reminds me blade think i owe you one quinn stabs the stake into blades shoulder
blade cries out tries to pull free
karen whos being held by mercury averts her gaze
actually if you want to get technical i owe you two
as quinn reaches for another stake blade starts to laugh
whats so funny bright eyes
im expecting some company
its then that quinn notices the micro ear coil radio receiver in blades ear
as we move in on it we hear a tiny voice squawking from it filtered get down
blade kicks his feet out sending quinn flying backwards
he tears free of the vamps holding him and dives forward knocking karen to the ground just as boom
the wall of pearls bedchamber explodes inward knocking quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet
stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be brandishing his cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other
he balances the rifle against his hip like an over the hill gunslinger and opens fire on the vampires
blade rolls snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown free from the vault
seconds later he and karen are fleeing after whistler retreating back through his newly created exit
the three of them find themselves ankle deep in a flooded sewer tunnel running parallel to the archives
whistler pauses wheezing from overexertion
christ im too old for this
somebody get me a goddamn wheelchair
blade leans against the tunnel wall grunting as he yanks the stake from his shoulder
he then pulls out a light stick snapping it illuminating the area in a green glow disturbing waves of meanwhile whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack and sets
it against the tunnel wall arming it
how did you find us
whistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear
we keep in radio contact
incredulous youve been listening in the whole time
you think id let him run loose without a chaperone
blade ferrets their rat holes out i map them
then we blow them all to kingdom come
whistler finishes arming the explosive device
he turns back to blade and karen referring to a handheld navigation device
theres a subway line due east of here
wed best make tracks
an explosion rips through the bedchamber mushrooming outward the explosion continues expanding sending tables drinks and zaibatsu clientele flying
as the group splashes through the water a fireball chases them down the tunnel
they duck into an alcove narrowly avoiding the flames
whistler whoops with excitement loving every minute of it
but his triumph is short lived for now we hear a deafening chorus of high pitched vampire war cries coming from behind
karen hazards a look back surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high octane
there must be a dozen of them now and quinn is right in the lead
our trio hustles along but whistler stumbles tumbling and sliding down a washout
the steep incline of the washout makes it virtually impossible for whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel
go on ill be fine
karen hesitates but blade yanks her down the tunnel he can take care of himself
they race through the twisting warren of tunnels taking one turn after another the vampires hot on their heels blade and karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel which
widens into a station stop up ahead
we can see the red tail lights of a train just pulling away from the platform blade and karen re double their efforts lungs burning legs pumping like mad
just as the train enters the next tunnel they leap dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear passenger car
blade smashes his fist through the emergency exit window then lifts karen up helping her climb through into the car but the vampires are still coming
crawling along the tunnel walls on all fours limbs a blur claws striking the concrete and spewing out sparks
springs forward snagging blades ankle with his good hand
the vampires weight threatens to haul blade down
blade reaches to his back scabbard unsheathes his sword thunk
blade brings the sword down on quinns good arm cutting it off at the wrist
quinn falls to the tracks tumbling head over heels back into the darkness which continues to clutch at blades ankle starts to melt
with a cry of disgust blade kicks the thing away
he turns and climbs through the window karen helps blade inside
he sinks to the floor of the otherwise deserted car exhausted
hes looking ashen now
the whites of his eyes are shot through with red
karen gets a good look at blades wounds the front of his jacket is soaked in blood
she reaches for him youre hurt nothing that wont heal by dawn
blade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small gas powered pistol injector we saw whistler inject him with earlier
he tries to load one of the ampoules into it but because of his wounds hes not having much luck frustrated i need help with this karen nods inserting the
ampoule into the gun
blade shrugs off his jacket holds out his arm
karen pauses what am i injecting you with
weakly serum its a human hemoglobin substitute
karen locates a vein presses the injector against it blade tenses grits his teeth fights to keep his body thrashing as the serum enters his bloodstream
he grips the wall behind him actually digs his nails into the metal surface the agony hes going through is excruciating like nothing we could imagine
when its over he slumps forward spent vulnerable flushed with sweat
karen stares at him youre one of them arent you
blade turns away from karen filled with self loathing
im a hybrid
half human half vampire
off karens surprised reaction we the loading elevator clangs to a stop
blade throws the gate open
karen helps him out
now that theyre safely back the last of blades strength seems to dissipate
is waiting for them sitting at a workbench
what took you so long
dont even start old man
blade throws his sword aside then moves off into the shadows disappearing beyond the curtains
karen looks to whistler why didnt you tell me the truth about him
we werent sure we could trust you
whistler sighs removing his glasses
blades mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant
ultimately she died but her unborn child lived
unfortunately hed undergone certain genetic changes while in the womb whistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes pulls one out
he thumbs a match fires up
takes a long drag i found blade when he was thirteen
hed been living on the streets feeding off the homeless
apparently the thirst manifested itself at puberty beat i took him for one of them at first almost killed him too
but then i realized what he was
frost stands at the window looking out at the glimmering cityscape before him
frost turns away from window
quinn mercury and the other vampires from the black pearl stand before him
quinn cradles his amputated stump with his newly grown arm
he took my fucking hand
you seem to be in the habit of losing them fairly often quinn
maybe the amputee lifestyle just suits you
the other vampires laugh
quinn stares them into silence
we need to find him tonight
frost claps a hand on quinns shoulder
blades not going anywhere
right now though weve more pressing business off mercurys look its time dragonetti paid the piper
whistler studies karen exhaling another lungful of smoke
blades unique you know
a one in a billion anomaly
he can withstand sunlight garlic even silver
but he still has the thirst
what happens if he doesnt take the serum
the thirst overcomes him just like the others
its not something he can control
sighs the problem is times running out
his bodys starting to reject the serum
and so far all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure no offense whistler but youre not exactly working with state of the art equipment here
you might have missed something
pointedly which is why youre here
we could use someone with your experience
a beat passes between them and karen knows where she stands now
in for a penny in for a pound
whistler reaches for blades sword
this used to be mine you know
its been passed down through the centuries from one hunter to the next whistler extends the sword sighting down the length of it
he takes a few practice parries its obvious he used to be quite skilled in the art of swordsmanship
why do you hunt them
habit mostly just like this
whistler gestures with his cigarette
he finally stubs it out his wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke
i had a family once a wife three daughters
then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening he killed them
he toyed with them first
he made me choose do you understand
which order they would die in karen stares at whistler horrified
how did you escape
he was cruel enough to let me live
slapping his brace even gave me a souvenir to remember him by
karen nods its all falling into place for her now
and now youre using blade to exact your revenge
pointedly frosts bodycount keeps rising and im not getting any younger am i
just then we hear a scream come from blades room sounding more like the cry of a beast than a man
karen takes a step towards blades room i wouldnt go in there if i were you
its best to leave him alone when hes like this
ill take my chances
its dark just a trace of moonlight
then karen sees him crouched in the corner of the room like some kind of nocturnal animal
its dark in here
you get used to the darkness
karen takes a step towards him
whistler told me about your mother
blade clutches the silver locket in his hand
it swings back and forth like a pendulum
i cant close my eyes without hearing her scream
those arent real memories
no one has that kind of recall
i remember from day one
people staring at me sensing i was different
watching the fear grow in their eyes knowing in their hearts i wasnt human
if youre not human then why do you bleed like us
ive seen vampire blood you dont have it running through your veins
blade looks at karen his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight
just get out of here
blade blade turns his eyes glowing with preternatural fury
i said get out
karen backs away startled by blades vehemence
she exits leaving him alone with his demons
he holds up one of his empty serum ampoules crushing it in his fist
rise and shine little wing
fade in on dragonetti his face covered with a black condemned mans hood frost stands before him grinning like the cheshire cat
hes dressed from head to toe in a black motorcycle suit boots gloves a visored helmet tucked under one arm
mercury and quinn are standing nearby similarly attired
were on a stretch of rocky coastline tucked away in a secluded cove
dragonetti has been stripped bare chained like prometheus to an ancient standing stone
straining what is this
where am i
frost steps forward pulling dragonettis hood off
dragonetti stares at his surroundings horrified
when was the last time you stopped to appreciate a sunrise dragonetti
three four hundred years
frost checks his watch then looks to the ocean
on the horizon a sliver of gold appears
how do you like that
right on time
snarling the other elders will never let you get away with this
just then the twelve vampire elders emerge behind frost forming a circle around dragonetti
all wear business suits gloves along with high tech sun masks to protect their faces from the lights lethal rays
they stare at dragonetti like a silent jury
his face darkens anger rising but theres a desperation in his eyes now too
he speaks in the secret tongue subtitled dont you see you fools
hell betray you too
hes planning on invoking lamagra himself
the vampires just smile and shake their heads
the wheel turns old fang
guess you just got a little too long in the tooth
dragonettis cries are cut short as frost forces the aging vampires mouth open ripping out his fangs with his bare hands
dragonetti gurgles and shrieks sounding like a dying animal
frost turns to face the twelve now his eyes bright with victory
he pulls on his motorcycle helmet as do mercury and quinn
behind them dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no avail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him channeled inward by the natural formation of the cove
dragonetti howls his skin beginning sizzle and smoke
then he catches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass
he thrashes about as his flesh starts to run from his body
watch impassive protected by their masks when suddenly twelve figures rise up behind them clad in bike helmets and black leather just like frost
the intruders grip each of the elders in a strangle hold ripping their masks off
dragonetti was right
you were fools to trust me
frost flips down the visor of his helmet even as rises in all its fiery glory
one by one the vampire elders heads catch fire skullflesh sizzling away burning down the line of them in successively building intensity until all twelve explode in a conflagration of
blinding frost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer intensity of the occult blast a blast which sends the skeletal bodies of the elders slamming into the rock wall
when its over frost picks himself back up
we see that the only thing left of dragonetti and the others are permanently etched onto the rocks surface just like the bombing victims of hiroshima
karen stands at a lab table with whistler preparing a number of blood sample vials
they are surrounded by host of new medical equipment from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond
blade emerges from his room looks to karen
as if by silent agreement last nights words go unacknowledged
he straps on his bandoleer of stakes secures his scabbard
i need more serum
re new equipment whats all this
i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment
sarcastic for your miracle cure
shes been making real progress blade
to karen show him karen looks to blade who shrugs
she opens a refrigerator removing a syringe filled with blue fluid
this is sodium citrate
its an anti coagulant
we use it to treat blood clots sometimes
vampire blood is thinner than humans though
watch what happens when i introduce some into a sample karen gestures to the microscope
blade takes a look vampire blood cells swirling about
karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells the reaction is immediate
the vampire blood turns black then begins violently bubbling
blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time the blood on the slide atomizes exploding outward in a fine mist which bursts apart the glass lens of
whistler laughs thrilled with the results
can you imagine what a dash of that would do on your sword
whistler claps his hand on karens shoulder in approval then limps away quickly busying himself with another project
blade moves to follow but karen stops him before you go id like to take a sample of your blood
blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve
as karen takes her sample blade looks to whistler
the older man brings a handkerchief to his lips coughing into it
is he sick
karen watches as blades blood flows into the vacutainer
she fills the first then inserts another
you care about him dont you
weve got a good arrangement thats all
whistler makes the weapons i use them the vampires die end of story
blade rolls up his sleeve
pointedly my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card
blade slips his casulls into a shoulder holster then shrugs into his leather jacket donning his sunglasses
id wish you luck doc but i never put much stock in optimism
he heads towards the elevator
blade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls passing merchants peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios butcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window tyro
gang bangers lounging at the entrance to a video arcade
even though the streets are crowded the people seem to make way for him avoiding eye contact
blade turns into a dark alley ducking into the doorway of a hole in the wall herbalist shop
a bell atop the door jingles announcing blades arrival
were in a dusty cave like room filled with baskets and bottle lined shelves featuring things like toad spleen extract and barking deer wine
joss sticks burn sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air
at the back of the shop an elderly chinese man in a cardigan sits in front of a battered television watching a boxing match
hes eating a bowl of litchi fruit
on the counter nearby a spider monkey watches attentively
hows it going kam
re calendar youre a week early
i was in the neighborhood
kam sets his fruit bowl aside leads blade through a curtain into a back room
kam hands blade a leather valise
he opens it its lined with tiny ampoules of scarlet colored serum
blade pulls one out holds it up to the light
whistler says im building up a resistance to it
i was afraid that might happen
maybe its time to start exploring other alternatives
theres only one alternative to the serum
they both know what that alternative is
blade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket
thinking one other thing
have you ever heard of a vampire called the sleeper
kam shakes his head
blade pulls out the parchment he took from pearl
i found this in there archives
i need to find someone who can read their language
kam studies the parchment
ive heard about a woman named miracia
some say shes a mayombero a santeria witch
supposedly she lives in that tent community down by the city dump
im told she only sees people at night
blade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains
blade emerges from the alley into the sunlight then hears his name whispered on the wind
blade spins scanning his surroundings did he really hear his name or was it just the wind
again the taunting voice calls him
blades gaze finally settles on sitting on a bench in the deep shade his face obscured by the chinese newspaper hes reading
theres a little girl sitting stiffly beside the man a look of pure terror written on her face
the man lowers his newspaper
its deacon frost
hes wearing sunglasses but otherwise hes seemingly unprotected by the sun
blade reaches for his
frosts hand rests on the back of the girls neck
we see his claws extend caressing the flesh beneath her chin
wouldnt want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton would we
blade reluctantly lowers his hand
he takes in a deep breath of air savoring it
beautiful day isnt it
confused how can you be out here
i dabble in pharmaceuticals medical research
weve developed a type of sun blocker using octyl salicylate a few others things
on closer examination we see that frost is wearing a translucent lotion on his face
he touches a finger to his cheek rubs some of the lotion between his fingers
its not very effective in direct sunlight but its a start
the goal of course is to be like you the day walker
i dont buy it
the future of our race runs through your bloodstream
youve got the best of both worlds blade
all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses
maybe i dont see it that way
oh so its back to pretending were human again is it
spare me the uncle tom routine
you cant keep denying what you are
youre one of us blade
you always have been
you think the humans will ever accept a half breed like you
theyre afraid of you
pointedly the humans fear us because were superior
they fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete
frost watches the marketers stream past sneering in contempt
look at them just an endless stream of cattle in a mad race to the slaughterhouse
frost lifts a silver flask to his mouth taking a swig of blood
he smacks his lips sighs contentedly the pause that refreshes offering it to blade care for some
smells good doesnt it
pungent with just an irrepressible hint of iron
you sure now
i bled a newborn for this
you wont find a drink thats sweeter
it takes every ounce of blades self control to keep from attacking frost and frost senses this pressing his sharp thumbnail against the childs jugular
tell me honestly do you really get the same rush from that pasteurized piss serum of yours
off blades look youre surprised i know about your serum
you shouldnt be
i know everything about you
frost leans forward grinning
you cant keep walking the razors edge blade
the day will come and soon when youll have to choose between our kind and theirs
if i were you id take care not to wind up on the wrong end of the fang
a bead of sweat runs down frosts neck washing away a minute amount of the sun blocking cream
the patch of exposed skin instantly blackens
frost gazes upwards at the sun
love to continue this chat but it appears im melting
frost rises taking the little girl by the hand
blade follows his hand resting on the butt of his casull
youre not going anywhere
growling watch me
frosts eyes flicker towards the street a city bus is rumbling by
in a heartbeat frost hurls the little girl forward out into the path of the oncoming bus
blade has a split second to act
its frost or the girl and for a moment we actually think hes going to go for frost but then he dives forward scooping the girl into his arms throwing
themselves out of the bus path
the bus misses them by a hair
by the time blade looks up again frost is gone
blade rises cursing scanning the street as market goers gather around him
someone sitting astride a motorcycle watching blade from the roof of an elevated parking garage
the rider is clad from head to toe in a helmet and black leather mercury
blades olds cruises into the gated grounds
it zips down the ramp way into the loading elevator
mercurys cycle rolls into frame
she picks up a radio handset and keys it
into radio this is mercury
tell deacon ive found their hiding place
blade enters through the loading elevator finding karen and whistler hard at work
she turns as he approaches sees him back lit by the sun
she looks pale the whites of her eyes are streaked with red
its been slow you dont look so good
im just tired thats all
weve been up all night
blade nods not buying her explanation
he shoots a glance to whistler which doesnt go unnoticed by karen
karen turns heading for the back of the workshop
karen enters a dingy bathroom turning on the overhead bulb
she studies her reflection in the mirror above the sink then grimaces as she peels the dressing from her wound the wound is clearly infected gangrenous
karen spins startled
blade stands behind her
he grips her jaw turning her head so he can better view the wound
youve got another day or two at most
karen nods shaken
as she moves to leave blade reaches for her arm stopping her
for what its worth im sorry
you make it sound like im already dead
blade just stares at her
finally she pulls away
close on karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows watching the sun go down an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her
blade stands on the perimeter of a sprawling cardboard and plywood squatters ghetto which has sprung up around the city dump
children and dogs forage for salvageable items while in the distance dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse
blade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and ashcan fires
a crowd quickly closes in around him suspicious
a brutish man steps forward challenging him extranjero
im here to see miracia
kam sent me
the man turns to his fellow squatters whispering
after a heated debate a gaunt woman steps forward motioning this way
whistler and karen sit at a work table
karen is looking at a blood smear slide through a microscope
all right lets start with the basics why do vampires need to drink blood
their own blood cant sustain hemoglobin
then vampirism is a genetic defect just like hemolytic anemia
so what about gene therapy
whistler looks intrigued
basically youd have to re write the victims dna alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin
with a retrovirus
its injected into the bone marrow cells it causes the hosts dna to mutate
theyve been using them to treat sickle cell anemia
whistler can hardly believe what hes hearing
you actually think this could work
karen pauses we can see in her expression that theres something shes been holding back
on me yes
on blade im not so sure gravely the problem is blade didnt contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did
he was born with it
the irony is i could probably cure every vampire but him
then were back to square one arent we
sooner or later the thirst always wins
at that moment the lights in the workshop flicker then go out
karen looks around the room alarmed
what happened to the power
concerned i dont know but the back up generator shouldve kicked in
a few seconds pass
the back up generator still hasnt activated
whistler moves to the window uv floodlights are down too
as whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of glass shattering coming from the other end of the workshop
whistler shines the flashlight in that direction
we hear more sounds now water draining glass tinkling
whistler raises a finger to his lips signaling silence
he edges towards the black out curtains karen falling in behind him
whistler and karen enter cautious containing the vampire child has been smashed open
its empty now with just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a widening pool and a trail of tiny bloody footprints leading back out into the main
karen scans the shadows eyes alert
we hear a whisper then a teasing childish giggle
whistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle shining the beam over every inch of the room
and just as hes about to complete his circuit leaps from where it had been hiding overhead
whistler is knocked to the floor the flashlight spinning from his hand the feral child lands atop whistler hissing like a cobra
its macrocephalic head seems to morph twisting into grotesque proportions
and just as its about to strike zzzzing
whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden inside his cane
he lunges forward whoosh
the child takes off like a blue streak sending test tubes and medical equipment crashing to the floor
it zips past karen get it
karen snatches up the flashlight chasing after it as whistler struggles to his feet karen sweeps the flashlight around catching only fleeting glimpses of the child as it darts through
she reaches a shelving unit where whistlers weapons are stored grabs one of the modified pistols karen tries to draw a bead on the creature
she fires misses fires again shes getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the creature is moving closer and suddenly its right in front of her flying through
the air fangs bared
the child knocks karen back against the wall
its at her throat sinking its claws into her neck
karen chokes forcing whistlers pistol under the monstrositys chin but then the creature morphs again transforming into a beatific little cherubim of a child and karen hesitates because the child
seems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous pulsing and hypnotic and suddenly whistler reaches in from behind yanking the vampire childs head back firing a pistol into its skull
the creature slumps karen cries out disgusted flinging the corpse away from her
as it continues to writhe thunk
whistler swings his cane rapier down on the creature brutally decapitating it
finishing the job
then he looks to karen winded
understand this they are monsters
hesitate for even a moment and youve lost
words to live by whistler
whistler spins eyes wide
he knows that voice
steps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight followed by mercury and quinn
its been a long time hasnt it old friend
blade is led to a plywood cabin crowded with candle lit altars garish pictures of saints and demons abound alongside bottles of roots and herbs steeped in alcohol human bones
sits on a sagging couch outside clutching a deck of well thumbed bicycle playing cards
shes ancient with a mouthful of gold capped teeth and cataract clouded eyes
is something wrong my friend
youre blind there are other ways to see
blade approaches uneasy
miracia deals out the playing cards on a rickety table setting them in nine piles which take on a cross formation
perhaps you have brought me something an offering for the orishas
blade tosses a handful of bills on the table
miracia nods then flips over the first card in the center pile a one eyed jack
she sighs grave hold out your hands
i didnt come here to get my palms read
i need something translated
blade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the table
miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper touching her fingertips to her lips
written in blood
she runs her hands over each line as if it were written in braille
some of the candles gutter then extinguish themselves as the wind around them rises
this is an old tongue from an old world
it concerns lamagra
who is lamagra
the vampire god
this speaks of his return
miracias fingers search the parchment again
there will come a day walker
reading his blood will call the sleeper from beyond the veil of tears
blade stares at miracia shaken
the old woman nods reaching for a smoldering cigarette
the day walkers blood is a disparador a trigger you see
for lamagras return
one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him
reading and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew cleansing the world in a tide of blood
recalling the phrase the blood tide
the vampire apocalypse
it is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the thirst
how do i stop it
miracia shrugs spreading her hands
the great wheel turns my friend
the dark is rising
how would you fight a shadow
miracia sits back slumping into her chair
the candles have burnt themselves down to nothing
i am tired
dawn is coming
but i just got here youve been here longer than you think
blade rises looking to the horizon
incredibly dawn is coming
as he stands there mystified the wind picks up sweeping the parchment fragment out of his hand
he tries to snatch it back but the fragment is quickly borne away
he watches it disappear into the sky then turns back miracia is gone
blade glances around him but shes nowhere to be found
isolating blade amidst the ghostly squalor
from our vantage point he looks like any other homeless phantom
blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop the place has been trashed
it looks like a tornado touched down in his absence
blade pulls out one of his
s cautious and then he stops dead in his tracks
has been strung up by his arms against the far wall tortured and left for dead
in response to blades voice a moan escapes the dying mans lips
blade rushes to the wall cutting whistler down with his sword gently lowering him to the floor
as he cradles the old man in his arms blade sees the primary wound two ragged puncture marks along whistlers throat
jesus whistler what did they do to you
whistler opens his eyes struggling to speak frost took her whistler spasms and coughs wincing from the pain
dont try to talk listen
you have to finish me off
you dont want me coming back
no we can treat the wounds but whistler is shaking his hand
too far gone you know that
blades at a complete loss
whistler i cant
whistler clutches at blades arm his eyes burning with conviction
yes you can
now get on with it
as much as hed like to deny it blade knows that whistler is right
he pulls a stake from his bandoleer hesitates
whistler i cutting him off more gentle now i know
forcing a smile just be quick about it will you
do it right
blade fights back tears
with a wretched moan he turns his head and drives the stake into whistlers chest
blade wraps his arms around the older man holding him tight as the life runs out of him rocking back and forth after a while the rocking stops and blade
lays whistler on the floor
then something catches his eye resting nearby labeled play me
blade reaches for the camcorder cues the tape frosts face appears on the tiny built in screen
by the time you watch this whistler will no doubt be winging his way to heaven thanks to your capable hands
if it makes any difference to you he put up quite a fight
frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek
now im sure youre wondering about ms
jansens well being
shes alive and kicking ambulatory as they like to say in the trade
whether or not she remains so is entirely up to you
beat ill make this as easy as possible for you blade
you can find us at the edgewood towers
well be waiting with baited breath
the tape cuts to static
blade throws the camcorder against the wall
it shatters into a dozen pieces
blade turns now his eyes falling on the medical equipment karen brought from the hospital
he moves to the refrigerator removing a canister labeled sodium citrate
then he draws his sword
we can practically see the wheels turning within his mind blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces heating his sword in the fire
he withdraws it its molten red
blade turns dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate canister
the refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat causing the sword to steam and hiss
when blade withdraws the smoking sword we see that the gleaming steel has changed colors taking on a bluish tinge just like the sodium citrate it was immersed in
blade smiles to himself satisfied
sparse decor in a neo japanese vein
the walls are glass
recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water cascading down them
karen is escorted into the room by mercury
she gestures to a chair at the end of a long table
leans forward out of the shadows resting his elbows on the table hands steepled together
well here we are doctor
a cigarette appears in frosts hand
in the blink of an eye the cigarette is lit burning
the movements are so quick we barely have time to register them
why havent you killed me yet
deacon likes to play with his food before he eats it
karen tries to keep calm
the longer she keeps them talking the longer she remains alive
how many of you are there
a few thousand scattered about the globe
in the past weve had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery
that wont be necessary after tonight
what happens then
the blood tide
our long prophesied holy war against the humans
theres a force you see a spirit that exists in our blood
ive discovered a way to invoke it
lamagra thats right
the answers were there all along of course scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind
waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them
my elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales
but i knew better
beat imagine my surprise when blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free
frost sits forward now impassioned
lamagra isnt a physical being
hes a spirit requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself
who better to usher in the blood tide
karen shakes her head protesting theres no need for any of this
your condition can be treated
whistler and i were working on a cure when what makes you think we want to be cured
blood is only part of the equation
the hunt the killing thats what the thirst is really about
but you use blood banks only as a last resort
preserved blood is inferior
theres no flavor left to it no life
rising from his seat fortunately ive found a way around that particular obstacle
frost moves to the end of the room
he pushes a button
with a hum the wall slides open revealing something karen wishes shed never seen living blood banks
have been hooked up to iv feeds which replenish various nutrients as their blood is drained from them
shunts have been implanted in their forearms which serve as taps
under these conditions i can keep a donor alive for years producing anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood
admiring his charges of course this is just a pilot program really
once the tide comes well need to expand production
so many more mouths to feed karen turns away overwhelmed by revulsion
youre a monster
because we live at another species expense
your people farm cattle and veal dont they
fattening them up with steroids
its called evolution doctor
survival of the fittest
frost stares at karen with an intense uncompromising gaze
i have a wake up call for the human race
youre no longer at the top of the food chain
a telephoto view of frosts penthouse
the windows are polarized blocking out the suns harsh rays
blade lowers a pair of binoculars
hes standing on the roof of a building across the street
he hefts an air launcher rifle up into firing position bang
an iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air between the two buildings sinking into the concrete facade of frosts penthouse
blade secures his end of the rope
he slips a pulley over the rope grabs hold of two handles and leaps off the roof ledge
blade slides towards frosts penthouse a good twenty stories above street level
a second before he reaches the windows blade lets go
momentum sends him crashing through in a shower of glass
an alarm is ringing
sunlight streams in through the broken window
two vampire guards who have been caught in the sudden swath of light are burning up before our eyes
blade climbs to his feet leaps at him
blade spins flipping the vampire over his shoulder sending him straight through one of the other windows the vampire tumbles earthward screaming as the suns rays ignite his body falling
like a human comet
blade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall to blades right is the inner chamber with the waterfall walls
as another vampire approaches blade readies his sword you think im afraid of that toothpick of yours
you should be
ive made some improvements
and with that blade thrusts his blackened sword forward right through the vampires chest
the creature shrieks and atomizes fwoosh
flying apart in a fine beaded spray of blood mist
up ahead are a set of steel doors with a time lock mechanism
blade draws a casull blasts away at the lock then shoulders the doors open we are in a windowless vault like room dominated by a series of high tech stainless
think of a hyperbaric coffin each unit possessing a small face plate window through which the sleeping subject can be viewed
blade unsheathes his sword
he grabs the lid of the first sarcophagus heaving upward
with a pneumatic hiss the lid rises belching out a cloud of condensation mist
as the mist clears revealing the occupant within blade raises his sword ready to plunge it downward only its not deacon frost who rests beneath him its blades mother
although some thirty years have passed since the events of our prologue vanessa looks exactly the same vibrant beautiful full of life
her eyes open
blade gasps uncomprehending
vanessa rises from the sarcophagus tears staining her cheeks
ive missed you so much jason
drawing closer you have no idea what ive been through how much ive wanted to see you blade falters his mind reeling
what hes seeing is incomprehensible his mother is dead
yet here she is in the flesh reaching out to him and flashing a mouthful of viper like fangs
she snarls and strikes brutally raking her claws across blades face knocking the sword from his grasp led by mercury step from the shadows where theyd been waiting all along
theyre armed with tasers which they fire en masse blade is hit by the taser darts from all sides
he writhes as electricity courses through him then collapses in a heap
he labors to lift his head looking up at vanessa but you died a hellish smile deacon brought me back
fight him as if on cue frost appears at vanessas side wrapping a proprietary arm about her waist kissing the nape of her neck
she leans into him an act of practiced intimacy
shes one of my thralls now
she has about as much free will as a puppet on a string
looking at vanessa you love me dont you vanessa
frost kisses vanessa hungrily
then he kneels and reaches into blades jacket retrieving a vial of blades serum
what do we have here
your precious serum
i dont think youll be needing this anymore
frost crushes the vial in his fist
blade struggles to reach frost stretching a palsied hand upwards please listen to your father jason
its going to be a better world
blade stares at vanessa uncomprehending
dont look so surprised blade
youve spent your life looking for the vampire who fathered you
well you can rest easy now youve found him
gripping blades chin daddys here
blades eyes widen in shock
frost simply laughs
its true blade
youve got my blood running through your veins
smiling thirty years ago
a moonlit street a woman on her way home alone
you were conceived the night i tore my fangs into your mothers flesh
frost swings his fist into blades skull
everything goes black
fade in as blade opens his eyes still groggy his face beaded with sweat
his hands have been bound tightly behind his back with manacles and chains
sits nearby watching him
from the steady rocking motion and the sounds of traffic outside its evident that they are in the back of a moving truck
are you all right
weakly ive been better how long have we been driving
shaking her head i dont know
i woke up just before you did as he struggles to sit up she crosses over to him
blade shuts his eyes for a moment fighting a wave of pain
is it bad
nodding we get out of this alive maybe ill take that miracle cure of yours
karen doesnt respond
instead she looks away
how in the world is she supposed to tell him this
quietly it wont work on you
what are you talking about
karen forces herself to meet his gaze
your conditions congenital the genetic mutations occurred in utero
all the other victims contracted vampirism after birth
blade stares at karen disbelieving
who could imagine a more horrifying irony
shes crying now
she cant help it
i cant cure you blade
i can cure myself but i cant cure you
beat im so sorry
blades head sinks the last vestiges of hope draining out of him
and then as if the final stake were being pounded in the truck lurches to a stop
we hear the engine being killed then footsteps approaching and then a series of bolts being shifted as the back of the truck is thrown open
frost stands there grinning flanked by mercury quinn vanessa and a half dozen other welcome home children
blade and karen are dragged from the back of the truck which is revealed now to be an armored car
rises up before them
a towering beaux arts edifice situated in the heart of the citys high priced financial district one of the many institutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave
frost starts up the marble steps towards a grand triple arched entrance flanked by corinthian columns
karen and blade are dragged along after him
frost leads his vampires into a high ceilinged atrium moving towards a bank of elevators one of the doors of which is outfitted with a high tech hand key id
frost places his palm on the id screen
the screen glows green acknowledging his identity
in response the doors hiss open
blade and karen are pulled inside the elevator
the control panel buttons have vampire glyphs rather than numbers
frost presses the bottom one
the doors close with a whoosh and the car descends down down down
frost glances over at karen smiling amiably
on its surface this building houses one of the citys oldest financial institutions and for over two hundred years its served our corporate needs
look beneath the surface however and youll discover another truth entirely the elevator chimes having arrived at its destination
the doors hiss open revealing a vast barrel vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches out before us an underground cathedral of sorts wrought from alabaster and marble
replete with dark splendor
as above so below
torches burn in wall sconces casting everything in a warm amber glow
frost takes in the beauty of the place
welcome to our hall of ancients doctor
we call it the temple of night
blade and karen are led to the middle of the room where a stone altar rises up from a dais
blade is roughly thrown to the ground
he kneels there eyes cast downward
his system being assaulted by the devastating effects of the thirst
quinn and mercury pick their way through blades discarded gear
quinn picks up the punching dagger admiring it
frost turns to mercury whos been holding blades scabbarded sword
lets see this sword of his
mercury draws the sword handing it to frost
he sights down the length of it testing its weight
with a flick of his wrist he lashes out slashing blades cheek open
still quite sharp i see
blade feebly struggles to rise
frost clubs him on the back of the neck with the sword pommel
karen tries to pull free but quinn holds her tight
blade youre wasting your breath woman
he cant hear you now
its the thirst you see
it already has him in its grip
frost reaches down dragging blades head up by his hair
karen watches on as frost continues to taunt him
how long has it been since you had your serum
you must be quite thirsty by now
he crouches down so hes eye to eye with blade
what does it feel like
is your blood on fire
are you burning up inside
give in to the thirst blade
embrace your true nature
blade shivers grits his teeth its like hes going through heroin withdrawal
go to hell frost smiles his eyes burning with an infernal glow
ive got news for you blade
were already here
frost turns to the others motioning
take him to the sanctuary
its time he was bled
the other vampires retreat dragging blade along with them
karen is left alone with frost and quinn
id let you watch the proceedings doctor but im afraid that privilege is reserved for members of my own race
dont worry though ive made alternate arrangements for you
frost motions and quinn drags karen towards some forty feet deep its lichen encrusted stone walls worn smooth over time
as frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them quinn forces karen towards the edge
we call this the bone pit
its where we keep our mistakes the ones who couldnt successfully make the transition from human to vampire
frost reaches out caressing karens neck puncturing the soft flesh beneath her chin with a razored fingernail
theyll feed on anything given the chance animals corpses even other vampires
karen struggles against quinn but its no good
in a manner of seconds shes falling making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below
she groans taking stock of her battered body
deacon watches from the lip of the pit amused
of course a strapping young woman like yourself well i think you just might be considered finger food
and with that hes gone stepping away from the pit
we are in a small elevated antechamber which is situated above the main vampire sanctuary
now weakened to the point of collapse is being lashed to a rack like device by iron chains
mercury and her cohorts move efficiently quickly securing him
when they are through the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of winch driven chains
with every turn of the winch crank the chains are drawn tighter causing blade to cry out until at last he is suspended in mid air spread eagle
approaches still carrying blades sword
its been a long road hasnt it
such a pity whistler led you so far astray
frost cocks his head to the side studying blades face
i dont blame you though
i want you to know that
even after all youve done
i understand blade i really do
its the human side of you which has corrupted your reasoning made you weak
but well take care of that wont we
blade struggles to lift his head forcing himself to match frosts gaze shaking with hatred
id kill myself before i turned into something like you
frost just smiles and shakes his head
no you wouldnt
im going to bleed you dry blade
all the poison that makes you human
drawing closer when the tide comes youll be begging me put you through the change
frost lifts up blades sword methodically slitting blades wrists one by one
he makes the cuts lengthwise opening up the cephalic and basilic veins with surgical precision
blood wells up from the fresh wounds running down blades forearms collecting in a cistern beneath his feet
frost watches the steady inexorable process then nods satisfied
he looks to the others who are gathered behind him watching on with silent reverence
we should ready ourselves for the ritual of invocation
frost leads mercury quinn and the others from the sanctuary
blade struggles futilely against his bonds crying out in frustration his body eventually sagging from exhaustion
theres no use fighting us jason
blade looks up focusing now on who has remained behind
blade stares at her
as terrible as his physical torment is his mothers betrayal is infinitely worse
how could you be a part of this
these are my people now
im one of them
you dont have to be
you dont understand
ive killed ive hunted and ive enjoyed it
she draws closer caressing her sons face
theres just a hint of creepy eroticism in her action a dash of incest
i wish you could see the world as i do
deacon opened my eyes
theres no turning back from that
i dont believe that
time is on our side
sooner or later the thirst always wins
vanessa turns away now
blade cries after her mother
vanessa pauses looking back smiling cruelly
your mother died the night you were born
and with that shes gone melting into the shadows
karen rises wary taking in her shadowed surroundings
are piled against the pit walls skulls rib cages femurs tibias all picked clean of flesh
some of the skulls have large canine like fangs the remnants no doubt of long deceased vampires
suddenly we hear a whisper of sorts the soft clinking of bone fragments grinding together karen spins trying to place the source of the sound
then she hears the sound again
behind her now closer
karennnnn karen looks up with a growing sense of dread
emerges from the darkness
pallid cadaverous shedding its desiccated flesh
lidless eyes like black marbles slick with vaseline
a mouth like a raw wound
i never thought id see you againnnnn
karen backs away realizing who shes standing before
what used to be curtis snarls knocking karen back into the drift pile of bones
it pins her to the ground kneeling above her gurgling through its gutted trachea
tell me karennn ever have second thoughts about us
karen screams trying to force the revenant away from her but it lunges closer lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a pathetic approximation of a french kiss
she fumbles behind her choking grabbing hold of a human femur blindly swinging it upward crack
the blow shatters the curtis things jaw
it rears back falling to the side
karen crawls out from under its weight swinging the femur again and again crack
karen pummels the howling horror driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half
the creatures head hangs at an awkward angle now its neck broken but still it advances dragging itself back up
sobbing karen retreats clutching the splintered femur like a makeshift dagger
curtis charges at her a blur of slashing claws
at the last moment karen ducks thrusting the bone dagger up into curtis chest curtis impales himself right through the heart
for one split second his eyes widen in surprise and then he goes into a death spasm vomiting up a spray of caustic vampire blood bile spattering karen
she sinks to her knees gasping as the thing that used to be curtis shrivels up melting away into burbling puddle
after a beat karen rises and moves to the pit wall running her hands over the lichen slick surface searching for a way out
the mortar between the brickwork is ancient crumbling
karen looks to the ground reaching for one of the splintered femurs
she pounds it into the mortar between two bricks and it holds working as a makeshift piton
karen reaches for another broken femur lodging it a foot above the first
she hauls her body up now suspending her weight from the two makeshift pitons
again they hold
trembling from exertion karen pulls the right piton free hanging solely from her left hand now
though her handhold is precarious she manages to swing the right hand up again pounding that piton another foot above the left
in this slow torturous manner karen begins to climb her way up out of the pit
blade hangs from his chains head slack eyes half lidded and lusterless
his skin has grown ashen as his lifes blood has been bled away
mercury appears before him accompanied by quinn
she bends in close to kiss blade lightly on the lips
it wont be long now lover
quinn draws alongside her hefting blades punching dagger
he places it against blades throat slowly applying pressure
at this point blades too weak to even resist
we should finish him off
shaking her head no
deacon wants him turned
quinn releases blade disgusted
fucking waste if you ask me
as mercury and quinn exit the camera drops down to the cistern beneath blades feet
we follow the blood which has collected there as it flows into a crude drain and emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below
the stream of blood is directed down the channels of a spiral column where it finally pools into a waiting chalice
the sanctuary in full
a large circular chamber the perimeter of which is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the vampire ancients set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive
stands in the center of the chamber allowing vanessa to clothe him in ceremonial regalia gleaming centuries old armor
he pauses kissing her hungrily
having finished suiting up he turns to face the vampires who have been faithful to his cause mercury quinn a host of others
a hush settles upon them
theres an excitement in the air a sense that something remarkable is about to happen
tonight is the night weve waited our entire lives for
tonight the blood dimmed tide is loosed upon the world
tonight the age of man comes to an end
the vampires bellow out a chorus of cheers their voices resonating off the stone walls like thunder
karens hands appear over the lip of the bone pit
she heaves herself up collapsing onto the floor but theres no time to rest
even now she can hear the vampires cheering
she drags herself to her feet letting the voices guide her
karen slips around a corner guarded searching
she sees blade strung up before her seemingly lifeless
karen studies the chains which bind blade following them back to their source at the winch
she releases the brake on the winch crank sending the chains rattling down through the overhead pulleys which suspend them
blade crumples to the floor lying still
karen is at his side in an instant whispering urgent blade
blades eyes flicker open fixing on her
hes shaking like an alcoholic going into delirium tremens
vanessa hands frost the chalice containing blades blood
he lifts it up for all to see
the vampires begin to chant en masse some long forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue
grinning to himself and what rough beast its hour come round at last slouches towards bethlehem to be born
frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink
blade tries to sit up gripping karens wrist get out of here im not leaving without you
you dont understand
the thirst he clutches his stomach experiencing phenomenal pain
gasping tearing me apart
take some of my blood
no its the only way
you know that
well never get out of here alive if you dont
blade suppresses a shudder
simply keeping himself from attacking her takes every ounce of his resolve
i cant i wont be able to stop yes you will
the human side of you is stronger
i know it is
karen matches blades gaze steeling herself
the truth is shes terrified
blade stares back at her
at this moment he wants what karen is offering more than anything hes ever desired
and so he rises frost continues drinking down the blood when suddenly a force seizes his body
he throws his head back eyes rolling to white flinging the chalice aside
and as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch we see the stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder as if some force within were trying to
break free karen turns her head to the side baring her neck offering herself to blade
blade opens his mouth
his canines elongate
he lowers his head and starts to feed
karen involuntarily stiffens as blades teeth puncture her skin and we frost shakes possessed by an unseen force
a wind picks up from nowhere swirling about the chamber accompanied by a strange suddenly one of the tombs bursts open
a wraith like spirit rushes outward in a fountain of light penetrating frosts body
then another tomb splits apart
then another and another until a torrent of spirit wraiths are surging into frost buffeting him about like a scarecrow in a cyclone
mercury vanessa and the other vampires back away apprehensive humbled by what theyre witnessing
blade moans sinking his teeth deeper
karens head rolls back
her eyes open glassy unseeing as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her
she shudders her breath quickening falling into a synchronous rhythm with blades
her fingers dig deep into his back clawing downward tearing into him shes not karen anymore shes a red blood cell an erythrocyte spinning in a river of plasma roaring
up blades femoral artery racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the deafening breath of god which blots all other sounds out of existence and were between frosts transformation and blades each of them growing stronger by the second caught in an ever increasing feedback loop of expanding energy until blade tears himself from karen his pulse racing as the invocation of lamagra reaches critical mass
frost is consumed by a hellish force unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit energy any longer
karen clawing at blade tears streaming down her cheeks
dont stop but blade grips her by her shoulders shoving her back
karen stares at blade wide eyed as if waking from a trance
she touches the raw wounds on her neck shaken my god blade rises to his full height
his strength has more than returned its been doubled by the infusion of real blood
and theres something else in his gaze now too an animal fury that was missing before
blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness
hesitant are you all right
blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists snapping them apart like toys
he flexes his hands fingernails lengthening to tapered points
and he smiles offering us a view of his canines which have elongated into fangs
near demonic never been better
smoke hangs heavy in the air occluding the area where frost had stood
as it dissipates mercury and the others creep forward apprehensive deacon
stands with his back to us his body trailing wisps of occult fumes
as he slowly turns we catch a glimpse of his eyes burning with an awesome inner fire
all heads turn stands at the balcony overhead karen at his side
he leaps from it somersaulting down to the floor below landing on his feet like a predatory cat
who dies first
growling to the others take him
quinn growls stepping forward armed with blades punching dagger
he offers his second new hand up for view
grew another hand for you sweetmeat tossing the dagger to his new hand and now im gonna kill you with it
blade meets the vampire head on dropping into a low kick and sweeping the vampires legs out from under him
he spins behind quinn lets see if you can grow a new one of these
blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket sleeve pulling out a retractable strangle wire which he twists around quinns throat
blade tightens the wire decapitating quinn
the headless body staggers about then drops to the cavern floor
blade scoops up his punching dagger next
mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse
blade launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamps face snapping its neck mercury has blades
she aims them at him have a taste of your own medicine
as she fires blade tucks and rolls knocking one of the guns from her hand
the guns spins across the floor where its scooped up by who takes aim at an approaching vamp blowing it away
meanwhile blade traps mercurys other hand disarming her flipping her over his shoulder
he hefts his casull blasting her into eternity a bloodbath ensues
blade moves like speed personified firing off one two three headshots with brain numbing accuracy cutting down the vampires where they stand
its an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and click ca ching click
blade and karen have spent their bullets and enough
blade turns to face whos advancing clutching blades own sword in his hand
he thrusts the sword forward blade presses the grip trigger on his punching dagger ching
the two side blades spread out
we hear the rasp and clang of metal on metal as blade manages to trap the sword point between two of the dagger blades for a moment both men are
eye to eye their weapons locked together then frost forces blade backwards what happens next is the most blindingly fast sword fight ever exposed to celluloid
both men fueled by super human speed lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves
frost lands a powerful blow on blades shoulder the sword edge biting deep into the flesh
frost withdraws the sword for another strike until blade sees an opening and takes it slicing frosts left arm off at the shoulder the severed arm releases blades sword but
the arm doesnt fall
to frost and blades mutual surprise the arm floats in mid air bleeding red quivering like zero g liquid then slurping back to frosts arm stump to re attach itself
undaunted blade slices the punching dagger into frosts mid section meeting only liquid like resistance
the moment blade withdraws his dagger frosts flesh seals itself up again
blade hesitates now uncertain and frost laughs understanding what has happened
youre too late blade
im already changing
dont you see
the sleeper has awakened
im not just frost anymore
im becoming a god now blood incarnate
even as frost utters the words his body begins to ripple and morph bleeding red taking on the characteristics of liquid
he doesnt walk so much now as flow
hes become a three dimensional creature of animated blood
a blood demon
as she watches frosts transformation wide eyed
she sees blades discarded sword reaches for it suddenly a shadow moves on the periphery of her vision rushes at karen in a near blur
the snarling hellion is upon karen in an eye blink slamming her down against the temple floor pinning her
did you think id forgotten you you little whore
who towers above blade swaying back and forth in his new liquid like form
you cant hurt me anymore
frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood howling with laughter then just as suddenly splashes back to earth spreading out in a widening pool
in the blink of an eye he streams through blades feet re solidifying behind blade
blade spins swings his dagger once again frost morphs into blood form
he races around blade in a series of spouting arcs turning from blood form to solid and back again in a series of split second transformations
blade whirls striking with his dagger and missing every time whoosh
frost suddenly dissipates splashing away into a million zero g blood bubbles vanishing
blade spins unnerved trying to pin point his foes next manifestation
where are you
frosts voice answers from all directions
spatters the floor at blades feet
blade looks up rains from above coalescing into frost as he sweeps down on blade like a giant bird of prey crushing him against the temple floor
you want my blood so much
frosts arms elongate and liquefy flowing into two snake like spouts of blood the rest of frost remains solid
the blood spouts twist around blades neck melding together completely encasing blades head in a bubble of blood
blade claws at the blood bubble as if it were a solid object that he could dislodge but his fingers just pass through it
as she wraps a hand around karens throat choking her
as karen struggles she frees a hand sliding it down to her hip pocket digging something out whistlers vampire mace canister
she forces it up between them triggering a jet of toxic mist into vanessas face vanessa recoils howling her head smoking as if it were doused with formic acid skin
sloughing off from her skull
karen lunges for blades sword blade is drowning in frosts blood
his eyes bulge
oxygen bubbles stream from his mouth
frost leans in close his face a twisted mask of insanity
i was wrong about you blade
you were never one of us
youre a traitor to your race
get away from him
frost looks up karen is wielding blades sword
she brings it down on frost severing the blood tendrils which envelope blade
the blood bubble dissolves instantly flowing away from blades face
he gasps chokes in air frost backs away horrified
his blood tendrils dont reform
instead the lay where they fell solidifying into crystalline powder
karen flings the sword at blade
spins end over end its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating pinwheels of candlelight as blade catches the weapon by its hilt
blade rises advancing on frost sword outstretched and frost retreats uncertain now
guess youre not quite as invulnerable as you thought
youre wrong a few minutes more and my transition will be complete
even your sword wont be able to affect me then
you dont have a few minutes frost
frost eyes blade warily then lunges towards vanessa sweeping behind her
blade follows but even as he raises his sword to strike frost spins vanessa around using her body as a shield
blade hesitates stopping the sword in mid strike catching his mothers gaze her face is monstrous now scarred by karens poisonous mace
frost smiles for hes found a final weakness of blades to exploit
laughing cruelly just as i thought
still chained to your mothers breast after all these years
in the same instant vanessas features morph taking on the angelic youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo
gloating youre too human blade
steeling himself its because im human that i can do this
frosts eyes widen in shock but he has no time to react for blade is already lunging forward driving the sword point through vanessas chest on into frosts heart
it strikes the stone behind them shattering and frost and vanessa howl as one their screams rising to an unendurable intensity as the two vampires go nova exploding into an
expanding ball of light and atomizing blood
blade is thrown back off his feet having to shield his eyes from the backlash of occult energy as a near tidal wave of blood surges over him every door
and window of the bank is blown outward from the force of the explosion
while along the street manhole covers flip from their moorings spinning up into the air like dimes being buoyed by geysers of blood
silence just the steady drip drip of liquid draining
the underworld temple gleams with a crimson sheen now
as he stirs
hes been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force of the blast soaked to the quick by blood
he rises to his feet retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon
at his feet lies in pieces
amidst them we find the singed remains of the locket vanessas face barely recognizable beneath the grime
blade stoops to pick it up
karen moves to him searching his eyes
which side of blades soul has won out
human or vampire
then she sees the tears rimming blades eyes the first hes shed in a lifetime
they embrace holding each other that way for a long long time
and we blade and karen stand on the rooftop watching as dawn slowly creeps across the silent city
i never imagined id be so happy to see the sun rise turning to him its over isnt it
but for me he lifts his face towards the rising sun letting its warmth wash over his upturned face
i feel like its finally beginning
and on that note we leave them two figures silhouetted against the new day
