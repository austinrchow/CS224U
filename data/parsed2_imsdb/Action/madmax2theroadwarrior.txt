written by terry hayes george miller brian hannant april flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move through an eerie barren land
the only sound is the howl of a rising wind
ahead something looms out of the storm
as we approach we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil pump
the wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old man
this is the narrator narrator v o the vision dims and all that remains are memories
they take me back back to the place where the black pump sucked guzzolene from the earth
another part of the wasteland
out of the dust storm emerges the ancient wreck of a prime mover and fuel tanker
it is partly charred its wheels and sides studded with metal crossbow bolts
narrator v a and i remember the terrible battle we fought the day we left that place forever
a warrior dressed in leather and steel stands on a hillcrest
this is max
behind him is a strange road vehicle two engines and a seat mounted on a chassis
narrator v o but most of all i remember the courage of a stranger a road warrior called max
to understand who he was you must go back to the last days of the old world
a mob of arab students storm a heavily fortified embassy and raise the iranian flag
on a beach in the persian gulf and fight their way across the sand
narrator v o when for reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior nations went to war
and then another
plumes of flame burst across the skyline
and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all
a line of cars
stretches for blocks until it finally reaches a gas station
an attendant pulls down a sign which reads and replaces it with another sign a group of angry motorists gather around yelling and pushing
the attendant produces a gun motioning them back
for without fuel they were nothing
they had built a house of straw
businessmen at a stock exchange
are yelling and shoving
torn up scrip litters the floor
the foyer of a huge corporation lj
the companys crest is chiselled on the wall
it is accompanied by the words fuelling the world on the floor below beyond the marble pillars we see the building is abandoned littered with broken furniture and piles of
we pass through a door designated a chief executive at the other end of the imposing room we see a businessman clearing out his vast desk
his name is pappagallo
on the wall behind him we see photo graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries
pappagallo takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase followed by a copy of whole earth catalogue and another book
the cover reads i
an anxious family is gathered in front of a television set
a politican addresses the nation
stage three of the national emergency is effective immediately
citizens are warned
the speech is cut short as static fills the screen
the family looks up at the lights as they flicker
in a factory
a giant machine grinds to a halt
in a city street
anxious faces look up as the street lights flick off
an industrial city scape
it is dark decaying silent
narrator v o people stopped in the stmeets and listened for the first time they heard the sound of silence
a city lane dark and deserted
a terrible scream
a young man runs down the street
a shot is fired
the young man falls dead
crushing the meat and eggs he has been clutching to his chest
narrator v o their world crumbled
in a deserted city street
bank notes blown by the wind flutter towards a store dummy lying smashed on the road
a rat emerges from the back of the mannequins skull and scurries away as we hear the roar of a big engine
the wide wheels of a big car crush the dummy
as the vehicle roars down the street it is followed by two big bikes
narrator v o and only those mobile enough to scavenge brutal enough to pillage would survive
a group of outlaw bikers
heap from a hillside onto the roof of a moving fuel tanker
they pass a hose into the tank
narrator v o at last the vermin had inherited the earth
a pack of bikers
swarm around a car and start to back it to pieces
a series of rapidly dissolving images
speeding cars speeding bikes crashing vans crashing police cars crashing bikes brawls smashed windows explosions
narrator v o and in this maelstrom of decay ordinary men were battered and crushed
max in police uniform
turns and smiles
narrator v o
men like the warrior max
with a woman jessie and their child
through a wheat field
he catches her
they tumble on the ground laughing
max embraces jessie
x narrator v o whointhe roar of an engine lost everything
on a highway
jessie carrying the child scrambles from her van and runs down the road
a gang of outlaw bikers run them down
the childs ball bounces down the road
max runs towards their bodies
silhouetted on a hillsid r graveyard
max stands looking down at two headstones
in front of a roaring fire
max fuels the blaze with the remnants of his past life childrens toys photo albums his police badge
max with his shotgun
turns to camera wild eyed
narrator v o and became a shell of a man
a burnt out desolate man a dead man running from the demons of his past
a man who wandered far away
out into the wasteland
the supercharger on the front of the vehicle dominates the foreground
narrator v a and it was out here in this blighted place that he learned to live again
we soar along the empty highway up and down its rises and around its curves until we are out in the vast wasteland
the black hole of the supercharger dominates the frame
behind the wheel we see max looking about his leathers years older
he is gaunt unkempt tattered and torn
the black on black pursuit car bearing the scars of numerous road duels cruises down the roller coaster highway
as max crests a hill he hits the brakes
his companion a mongrel dog sitting in a babys auto seat lifts its bead to look
the black on black slides to a stop
on a ridge close to the road silhouetted in a dust blown field is a strange assortment of warrio they are cannibalising a farm vehicle siphoning its fuel and loading
food and other loot into their bizarre vehicles
the dog growls
max looks further along the ridge
on the bor
zon we see a burning wooden s iack and three bodies strung from a gnarled dead tree
max looks back to the men
several of then having seen him are running to their vehicles
the first of them is a muscular man with a red mohawk haircut
he is heavily protected by a leather and metal chest plate shoulder pads and leggings
this is wez
he runs to where a golden youth sits on the pillion seat of a huge bike
wez is followed by two more mohawkers on bikes three gayboy berserkers in road racers and four smegma crazies in bizarre dune buggies
max guns the big motor
the black on black takes off
max hits the supercharger surging away
through the rear window we see wez lead the other nine vehicles down the hill giving chase
high angle helicopter shot of the chase
the marauders vehicles are strung down the highway
only the fastest led by wee can keep up with the black on black
the black od black surges around a wide curve revealing only three vehicles still in pursuit
the first machine is wezs big road bike the golden youth riding pillion
it is followed by a bizarre road racer and a strange dune buggy
as the black on black crests a rise max is confronted by a tangle of wrecked vehicles on the road ahead
he swerves slaloms through the wrecks and accelerates into a sweeping right hand curve
wez ramps his bike over the first wreck and corrects avoiding the other wrecks
the road racer ramps two wheels over the first wreck but cannot correct
it clips the second wreck sends it spinning then continues after the black on black
the dune buggy decides to avoid the wrecks altogether and veers off the road to the right
heads across open terrain aiming to intercept the black on black on the curve a light flashes on maxs dashboard an alarm whoops max looks down at the fuel gauge
close to empty he curses and flicks a switch cutting off the supercharger
the black on black slows
the dog whimpers crawls off its chair and under maxs seat
wez overhauls max on the passenger side he raises his forearm aiming his gauntlet style crossbow at maxs head
max barely has time to glimpse the road racer drawing alongside the drivers door
the passenger a gayboy berserker wields a brutal gas powered gun the heads of six metal arrows protrude from a big barrel
this weapon is the porta pak
max hits the brakes the road racer and the bike surge past the black car
just as the porta pak fires
two arrows thud into the black car three go astray and one hits wez in the arm
max throws the black car in behind the road racer
wez fighting to control the bike leaves the road
max changes down and hits the supercharger
the black car leaps forward ramming into the back of the road racer bullying it along
wheels and metal screaming the two cars approach an intersection littered with furniture and other debris
a road rig lies abandoned on the roadside
max eases back for a moment then flattens the accelerator
the black car slams into the back of the road racer
hurling it forward just as the dune buggy regains the highway
a t aruua
ld the driver of the road racer screams as his vehicle hits the dune buggy spinning it like a top sending it crashing into the side of the road rig
the road racer slides through a degrees rolls smashes through a road sign and hits a power pole
the pole thuds to the road as max throws a handbrake u turn and skids to a halt in the middle of the intersection
max carrying a jerry can gets out of the black car
he looks down the highway
wez is stopped on the crest of the road looking down on the intersection
the arrow is still in his arm
we see the golden youth clearly for the first time he is strikingly beautiful
max unfazed hurries to the wreck of the dune buggy crushed beneath the road rig
fuel streams from its ruptured tank
from inside the wreck we hear the moans of the injured driver
max puts the jerry can under the escaping fuel and tearing a bandana from his neck mops up the gasolene lying on the bitumen
suddenly there is a shrill whistle
max looks up at the crest of the road
wez grins as he pulls the arrow slowly out of his arm
his eyes never leave max
he holds up the arrow and mouths the words for you
with that he puts the arrow back into his quiver and guns the motor
the front wheel hangs there a moment then spins th bike around and roars back l
ai jill ln
max examines the road rig most of the tyres have been punctured with arrows the rear doors torn off and its contents pillaged
max taps the fuel tank empty
he reaches up to open the door of the cabin
there is an anguished scream max turns
the hand of the dying driver emerges from the twisted metal of the dune buggy
the fingernails score deeply into the paint work a rush of dark blood pours out of the wreck
max opens the cabin door
a figure drops down crashing onto his shoulders
as max struggles from its grasp we see that it is the bloated putrifying corpse of the rigs driver
two crossbow bolts are buried in its neck
max stoops and picks up a toy hurdy gurdy which has fallen from the dead mans hand
as he walks back towards the black on black he turns the handle playing the first few notes of happy birthday
he stops next to the vehicle in the middle of the intersection
he looks from one direction to another
and then sees the smashed road sign
he picks up a fragment which reads and throws it into the air
it lands at h s feet pointing north
he gets into the car and drives off in that direction
the black on black travels slowly through the shimmering desert
the only sounds are the rumble of the engine and the whistle of the wind
as the car crests a rise max looks ahead and sees a large kite in the shape of a mans grinning face hovering above a dune
max leaves the dog to guard the car
nd carrying a jerry can and a tyre iron cautiously makes his way across the sand
from the top of the dune max sees that the kite is tethered to an abandoned vehicle a primitive version of a gyrocopter little more than a motor a seat
and a rotor mounted on a chassis
a set of footprints leads from the gyrocopter dune and disappears into the distance
slowly max approaches the vehicle skirting around it looking for a trap
nothing moves except for the flurries of sand whirling across the dunes
carefully max reaches up and taps the gas tank empty
as he straightens up he hears a low hiss
only inches away a snake coiled around the vertical shaft of the gyro is poised to strike
they stare at each other
the snake strikes
catching it by the neck
he holds up the snake grinning about to kill it
the head and shaft of an arrow emerge from the sand behind him
it is followed by the frame of a crossbow and a mans face spitting sand a length of rubber hose clenched in his teeth
this is the gyro captain
dont hurt that snake
the captain emerges from his shallow grave motioning with the crossbow
put him back
max lays the snake on the rotor
sounded like a big v to me
i guess i got myself some guzzolene
he raises his bow aiming at maxs head preparing to fire
the cars booby trapped
touch those tanks and boom
youll blow yourself apart
the captain looks quickly in the direction of the black on black and back to max
he gestures with the crossbow
drop the weapons
now back up
max throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn off shotgun
the captain slings the gunbelt over his stoulder
max walks backwards towards his car
the captain tense crossbow trained on max follows him across the dune
youre quick ill give you that
never seen a man beat a snake
reflexes thats what youve got
ive got brains
he taps his head as they arrive at the black on black
now wheres this booby trap
max reaches under the car
his hand groping for a machete clipped to the chassis
his fingers wrap around the handle
a fella a quick fella might keep a weapon under there
he nuzzles the bow against the back of maxs head
then id have to pin his head to the panel
max slides his hand away disconnects a series of mechanical fuses and shows them to the captain
he moves to open the drivers door
the captain reacts quickly raising his bow motioning max back
theres one more
you dont play me the fool
the captain keeping the crossbow trained on maxs head opens the door
the dog flies out leaping for the captains throat
the crossbow discharges narrowly missing max as he hurls himself at the captain
the steel arrow buries r itself in the car door
max pins the captain to the ground and recovers his shotgun
max cocks the gun next to the captains head
thousands of gallons
as much as you want
max eases off the trigger
maybe twenty miles
pumping it they are
day and night
a huge tanker full
its there you betcha
tell you straight though its not self service
its under guard
too hard for me
but a man with your ingenuity
jesus i reckon
max rams the barrel against the captains head
me and youll never find out
max drags him to his feet and pushes him towards the black on black
f al a i
n v i
max is driving the black on black while the captain sits rigid in the passengers seat
the muzzle of the shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and the stock fastened to the top of the seat
a length of wire runs from the triggers across to the dog sitting in the rear of the car
the end of the wire is clasped firmly in its mouth
the captain not daring to take his eyes off the dog directs max along back roads to an area of high country
the dogs eyes dart out the window
he whimpers body twitching
the captain stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through the scrub
max smiles t himself
the dog settles back
a clifftop overlooking the compound
max moves towards the cliff edge
a column of smoke rises into the sky accompanied by a garble of distant sounds police sirens car horns men screaming war whoops and revving motors
the gyro captain manacled and guarded by the dog hobbles along behind max
from the top of the cliff max looks down on a battle raging on the plain below
a fortified encampment surrounded by a wide ditch and coils of barbed wire is under attack by a large gang of marauders mohawk bikers smegma crazies in dune buggies and
gayboy berserkers in road racers
they attack along a road which passes through an area outside the fortifications which is under cultivation
three wooden work huts a small barn and a corral containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a newly ploughed field
as the marauders vehicles come within range of the compound they stream around the perimeter firing crossbows at the defenders ranged along the battlements
i never said itd be easy
max unhooks an old pair of binoculars from the equipment belt around his waist
through the binoculars max sees a weird dune buggy charging towards the camp
he recognises the two bizarre occupants as members of the gang be encountered sacking the farmiet the day before
the dune buggy races along a causeway which spans the which blocks ditch heading for a yellowpaschool ssengeruin buggy the gate of the camp
fires a string of arrows from a multi barrel gas gun
a warrior woman on the battlement armed with a flame thrower hits the buggy with a stream of liquid fire
the blazing vehicle plunges into the ditch
it tumbles its into another wreck which met a similar fate tyres still smouldering
max pans his binoculars to the interior of the compound
he sees a large mechanical pump drawing the oil
from the ground and a primitive fractionating column used to refine it
a defender firing from the refinery tower is struck by an arrow
he falls over the guard rail where a dead companion hangs over the edge suspended by his foot
the sound of an amplified voice draws maxs attention he swings the binoculars around
a huge muscular man his face covered by a metal mask sits in a bizarre six wheeled vehicle
he uses a microphone to shout orders to the marauders directing the course of the battle
this man is the humungus
beside him is the mohawk biker called wez
he sits astride his bike the golden youth clinging to his waist
he speaks with humungus pointing sweeping his hand
the gyro captain is becoming more agitated
okay there it is
if anyone can get in i know its gonna be you
ive gotta feed the snakes
max drops the binoculars
the captain offers his wrists to be unmanacled
a man lives by his word i reckon
and ive kept mine
max gets to his feet and hauls the gyro captain to a nearby tree stump
we had a deal i show you the gas you let me go
max starts to chain him to the stump
the contract was wouldnt kill you
the gyro captain turns angry protesting
max pushes the shotgun close to his face
i reckon you got a bargain
the captain shuts up
max tests the chain
the sounds of the battle continue
max has settled in
he sits under a small camouflage canopy
his binoculars are fixed on a tripod fashioned from sticks
the dog lies nearby
further away the gyro captain is tethered to the tree stump on a short leash
the black car is covered by a camouflage net
max leans back from his binoculars takes a can of dog food from a pack and begins to open it
the dog pricks up his ears
a the gyro captain watches as max unwraps a velvet cloth to reveal a beautiful silver fork
the revving of engines wafts up from below max spooning the food into his mouth leans forward to his binoculars
the marauders have formed a bridge of car wrecks across the ditch near aless defended section of the compound
at wets signal three bikes ride at the bridge of wrecks
two of them are hit almost immediately but the third rides over the wrecks and attempts to ramp into the compound
the bike flies through the air
and bounces into the wire
the rider sails over the fence into the compound where he is set upon by three defenders
max wolfs down his meal
the gyro captain and the dog lick their lips in unison
max tosses the can and its remains to the dog
the captain groans as the dog buries its muzzle into the can
the captain inches over towards the dog
the dog snarls
from the clifftop we see the lights in the compound come on
a searchlight weaves across the wasteland
the only sound is the kachunk
of the huge oil pump
the battle has reached a stalemate
the defenders and the attackers watch each other across no mans land
smouldering wrecks and dead bodies litter the ditch
a the animals in the corral have been slaughtered
max is slumped against a rock
the dog is asleep
the gyro captain rings his finger around the dog food can and licks it clean
max sits up at the sound of a bugle
he looks down
the marauders kick over their engines fanning across the area under cultivation tearing up the ploughed field
as they pull back to the high ground surrounding the camp they set fire to the farm huts and drag off the carcasses of the dead animals
the fires blaze fiercely on the darkening plain
tracking close on max as he sleeps
the dog sitting next to him is on his feet growling at the sound of vehicles from the plain below
max wakes alert looking down
below three compound vehicles are fanning out across the plain
the marauders camped on the rise rouse themselves
climbing aboard their vehicles
the gyro captain tethered to the stump strains at his chain but cannot get close enough to the edge to see
b c ont
max ignores him concentrating on the situation below
the bulk of the marauders have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland
the humungus leads one of the groups
four marauders camped on a pinnacle keep watch on the camp suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards maxs clifftop
it passes out of sight around the back of the hill max hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop
max looks past the black on black to where the lone compound vehicle has achieved the bitumen
suddenly three mohawk bikes and a tow truck emerge from behind a rocky outcrop
led by wez they fire arrows into the tyres and smash the windscreen
the compound vehicle leaves the road rolling
as the gyro captain crawls to his side max raises his binoculars
the bloodied driver is being dragged from the wreck by two mohawkers
the others cannibalise the vehicle and siphon off its fuel
another occupant emerges from the twisted metal and tries to crawl away
i t is a young woman
the gyro captain sees her and fumbles urgently for something deep in the pockets of his great coat
he produces a large telescope which is attached to his waist by a leather cord
through the cracked lens of the telescope we see two of the mohawimrs dragging the woman to the roadside
max looks around to see the gyro captains telescope and grabs it
the gyro captain protesting picks up the less powerful binoculars
max lifts tae telescope
the golden youth is sitting on one of the bikes
the pov whip pans across the wreck where two mohawkers have pushed the badly injured driver up to the car panel wez fires an arrow into the mans shoulder pinning
it to the panel
methodically he reloads and fires another pin into the mans other shoulder
max pans the telescope to where the three mohawkers hold the struggling woman
at wezs signal they start to tear the womans clothes away
track in as the gyro captain and max watch through the binoculars and telescope
camera tightens further to the gyro captain
his face reacts to the horror below
max drops his head
his eyes closing momentarily
the noise of vehicles starting below breaks the moment
he lifts the telescope and pans to one side
the zelescope lens finds all the mohawkers except one back on their vehicles
they ride off led by wez
while max has the telescope trained on the departing vehicles the gyro captain has the binoculars on the jesus
hes gonna kill her
max whips his telescope around
the lens finds the remaining mohawker now standing back from the prostrate girl
he is loading his crossbow
the image blurrs
max has dropped the telescope and is on his feet running down to the black on black
the dog is at his heels
what about me
the black on black roars off
we track low past the dead girls face towards the back of the mohawker
he is sitting on a wheel pulling on his trousers close to his back the camera stops
he turns looking up
max carrying a pair of bolt cutters is hurrying towards him
the mohawker grabs for his crossbow
maxs foot stamps down pinning his wrist
the bolt cutters swing down
onto the mohawkers head
tears stream down the compound mans face
as max walks up to him we see that he is bleeding badly
his name is nathan
lets get this straight
im doing it cos i need fuel
as much as you want
take me back
dont let me die
max takes the bolt cutters and inserts them between the man and the panel
he cuts away the first arrow then the second
the supercharger screams as max races towards the compound
nathan is slipping into unconsciousness
max grabs him by the shoulder shaking him

g angle down on the plain
the black on black approaches the burnt out huts
a gayboy berserker stands up into frame in the extreme foreground
he is joined by two other marauders
the gayboy berserker grabs a hand mirror and flashes a signal across the wasteland
from a far hill we see the answering flash
crane down from a high angle on the black on black as it approaches the camp
as the camera achieves a smouldering but we see a small animal like figure stalking the vehicle
tracking closer we see that it is a wild looking child about years old
he is dressed in dog skins and carries a chrome boomerang
on one hand he wears what looks like a catchers mitt a leather glove reinforced with steel plates
this is the feral kid
before we get too close the boy scurries into a large rabbit warren
long low angle on the compound
its defenders wait on the barricades the cracking tower and the catwalk
the black car stops just outside crossbow range about twenty yards short of the compound
in extreme foreground the feral boys head pops up from another rabbit hole closer to the compound
he ducks down out of sight when the car door opens
high angle on max as he steps out of the car with nathan across his shoulders
max carries no weapons and as he steps up to camera he raises his arms high
a woman on the barricade begins screaming
her name is big rebecca sc cont
a man on the catwalk orders the gate to be openea
max hurries along the causeway
the feral kid comes out of the rabbit warren and begins to follow max
a trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the causeway
as max approaches the camp the old i ello
v school bus is pulled aside
the i a iri woman emerges crossbow read
keeping it trained on max
she is followed by another defender the mechanics assistant pulling a strange mechanised crane
suspended from the front of this machine is a paraplegic he is the mechanic
thny max heading for the car revealing big rlu cc
a distraught running towards him nathan
god have mercy
what a waste
si f wipe the mans face caressing him
as max walks on
she turns and looks straight at the camps leader pappagallo
he is standing at the gate surrounded by anxious defenders
look at your handiwork
they didnt have a chance
one of the group at the gate a nuggety old man called the curmudgeon plays to the crowd pointing you all heard me i warned him didnt i
madness i said
as the defenders part to let max through we see the group includes a teenage couple pismo and angie holding each other tight a woman butcher holding a knife and
a rabbit a middle aged man who looks like a farmer and a lusty young girl chewing her finger nails
pity your name wasnt pulled out the hat
we can escape take our petrol he said
get a prime mover he said
he points to nathan who is being carried to an old bread van
the rear door is open revealing two hospital style beds drip stands and shelves of medical supplies
an injured camp member occupies one of the beds
and theres the result
madness i said
pappagallo ignores him addressing max where did you find him
two three miles away
left for dead
next to his car
we made a deal
in the background the farmer starts to work the first arrow out of nathans chest
big rebecca comforts him
three other vehicles
did you see them
running hard to the south west
in heaps of trouble
listen he said if i brought him in youd give me gas
theres no time
an anxious young man pushes through the crowd talking over max
this is the quiet man
there was a woman
in the car
max looks straight at him
the man struggles to keep hold of his emotions
what did they do
it was quick
the quiet man bows his head and turns away
nathan groans angie has the clear plastic mask of an air viva device over nathans face pismo pumps air into his lungs
max turns to pappagallo i saw a man in trouble
i brought him in
and now i just want to get out of here
give me my gas
for all we know hes one of them
give him nothing
theres an ugly murmur of agreement
max keeping his temper talks to pappagallo we had a contract
the farmer succeeds in removing the first arrow
big rebecca relaxes nathan sputters
blood sprays into the plastic mask
big rebecca screams
the feral kid looks on as the farmer feels for a pulse nothing
pappagallo turns to max i dont know who you are or what happened
but if you had a contract it was with him
and it died with him
trns on his heel and walks through the crowd back towards his tent
the warrior woman puts a bow to maxs temple and shoves him towards the gate
the feral kid following max laughs
the dog snarls at the boy
as the crowd parts max sees that the black on black is being winched through the gate
the mechanic supervises the work
liax stiffens furious
warrior woman prods him with the bow be thankful youre still alive
she pushes him past the car
the dog trained to protect the vehicle begins to grow
the mechianic turns to max i gotta hand it to you
he holds up the detonators and fuse wire
wouldve been a shame to bloc it
the last of the pursuit spec ials
its history thats what it is
a piece of history
the me iia ic runs an affectionate hand along the bonnet of the car
the dog flies at him as he tour
hes the car
the dogs ja
s champ onto his u elessit sthreatening to topple him from t
the meciianics assistant turn wielding a tyre iron about to batter the doc to death
max grabs his arm wrenching the tyre iron from his hand other men raise their weapons
the head of a crossbow arrow cuts into maxs neck
the dog max and the camp people are frozen waiting for the next move warrior woman holding the other end of the bow motions him forward slowly max bends and
gathers up the dog
its ok dog
just do as they say
his words are lost in the wail of a siren
a guard perched in the watch tower shouts a warning
the yellow school bus roars across closing the entrance
the compound people run to their positions on the battlements
a pair of manacles are locked around maxs wrists
warrior woman climbs to a big crossbow mounted above the causeway
the butcher drops her knife and grabs her long bow
the rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety
pappagallo mans the flame thrower
others draw their bows
the feral kid follows the rabbit down a hole at the foot of the battlement
as max climbs to a position on the battlements near warrior woman and pappagallo he sees that the marauder horde has gathered in all its glory
the marauders rumble in formation over the rise at their head is the humungus machine surrounded by a guard consisting of wez and his golden youth on a bike a
tow truck with two skin heads a road racer with three gay boy berserkers and a dune buggy with as the advance guard approaches through the dust and heat haze we see that six near naked and bloodied people are lashed to the front of the vehicles
at the big crossbow the warrior woman aims at the humungus machine
one of the two victims tied to the front of the humungus machine is screaming above the awesome rumble of machines and sirens
hold your fire
he wants to talk
he comes in peace
hold your fire
the camp people moan as they recognise the victims
pappagallo holds up his hand stopping the warrior woman from firing
a the mechanic cranes himself up into view next to max poor mongrels
not one got through
big rebecca sobs
the quiet man puts a comforting hand on her shoulder
pismo and angie huddle closer together
the vanguard of vehicles stops on the causeway just out of range
max and wez look across no mans land recognising each other
wez grins a gold tooth flashing
the toadie a comically dressed marauder perched on the top of the humungus vehicle waves his arms
the marauders cut their motors
the toadie announces greetings from the lord humungus the warrior of the wasteland
the ayatollah of rock and roller
camera cranes up to the humungus as he rises in his seat
his voice is amplified by two loudspeakers mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle sc
i am told you wish to take the gasolene out of the wasteland
the second victim lashed onto the humungus vehicle shouts in defiance shoot
while youve got the chance
the toadie takes the wind out of him with an elbow to the stomach
the feral kid watches from a rabbit warren near a burnt out hut
the humungus continues
you set out this morning to find a vehicle
a vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas
suddently the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the barricade and out into the wasteland
wez whirls his arm around
the rabbit falls dead from a crossbow bolt
the feral kid eases back down into his hole
the toadie bellows you see
there is no escape
the humungus rules the wasteland
dont give them the gas
blow it up
wez leaps from his bike and head butts the man into unconsciousness the broken victim sobs uncontrollably
the feral boy runs from his hole screaming
he lets fly with the chrome boomerang
the projectile whistles past wezs head and returns to the kid
he reaches up and clunk
catches it in his steel plated mitten
the marauders roar with laughter
the feral kid throws the boomerang again
wez ducks and it buries itself into the head of the the marauders are dumbstruck
the mechanic grimaces
the rest of the defenders are silent
max is impressed
wez bends over the goldenyouth and pulls the weapon from his skull
he hurls it at the feral kid
the boomerang whistles across the ground
the kid throws himself down into the hole
the boomerang arcs and returns to wez
out of his reach
the toadie runs forward
i got it
i got it
he reaches up to catch it
then falls to his knees clutching his bleeding fingerless hand
the humungus and marauders roar with laughter
wez bellowing with rage leaps up dnto the humungus vehicle
he hits the ignition yelling theres been enough talk
im going in
powerful arms encircle him from behind
wez is lifted bodily from the seat
the humungus reaches over and cuts the ignition and the p
the camp people ease back on their weapons
max is concentrating on his manacles starting to use a small file to pick the lock
a maintaining his vicious hold on wez the humungus hisses soothingly in his ear
be still my dog of war
i understand your pain
weve all lost someone we love
but we do it my way
fear is our ally
later you can have your revenge
wez tries to break free but still he cannot move
the humungus reaches over and flicks on the p
there has been too much violence too much pain
none here i s without sin but i have an honourable compromise
give me the gasolene and ill spare your lives
just walk away
i will give you safe passage in the wasteland
walk away and there will be an end to the horror
he hits the ignition eases wez aside and turns the vehicle around
you have one full day to decide
the toadie jumps on board as the humungus leads the horde back over the rise
as the vehicles rumble away the feral boy retrieves his bloodied boomerang and scurries back into his hole
the quiet man fires his long bow at the departing marauders the arrow falls well short unnoticed
he yells after them well never walk away
big rebecca grabs him by the shoulder
dont be a fool
its our only chance
she turns to the other defenders its simple
we trade the gas for our lives
weve worked too hard
walk out there
theyd slaughter us
run us down for sport
big rebecca plays to the crcwd
dont listen to them
its bad enough the lunatics are running the asylum
dont let em throw away the key
while the camp people argue max sits forgotten the manacles unlocked now dangling from one wrist
he produces the hurdy gurdy he found on the bloated man and plays the first few notes of happy birthday
from the hole under max the feral kid appears wiping his boomerang
he is attracted by the noise
max plays the next few notes faster
the feral kid grins
more notes very fast
the feral kid laughs
several people at the back of the crowd including warrior woman turn around to look
max holds the manacles up so that she can see that hes free
she glares at him as he goes back to turning the hurdy gurdy
the argument continues
pismo and angie are quietly bickering
the curmudgeon pushes past them heading towards the gate
he has a gladstone bag in his hand and a collection of car parts and personal effects tucked under his arm
itll be alright
ill talk to this humungus
hed never hurt an asthmatic ol
the lusty girl is joining him
the mechanic turns to her
im sure theyll find a use for you
id rather be out there on my back alive than in here on my back dead
be promised us safe passage
fe gave his word
and just suppose he keeps it
the defenders turn to pappagallo standing on the and we walk out of here with our lives
do we wander the wasteland scavenging
wake up one morning and find were just like them savages
he points in the direction of the marauders
is that what you want
i came out here and i found that pump
i built that plant and ploughed that field why
because we are human beings
we must maintain our dignity
we are not barbarians
the crowd is silent
i made one mistake i waited too long
thinking we could survive here
but as frightened as we all are lets not forget one thing
he points to the tanker of fuel propped up next tc the cracking plant
that is more than just a tank of fuel
its our lifeline our passport to a place beyond the reach of men on machines
he talks over several protesting voices
i dont know how were gonna get there
but the first step is to defend that fuel
i wont surrender it to anyone
alone if i have to
youre going to die for a pi pedream
big rebecca moves over to join the curmudgeon and the lusty girl
were going to fight for a belief i stay
lusty looks straight at pappagallo sc
i really wished it had worked im sorry
the mechanics assistant starts to push tha mechanics contraption towsads the curmudgeons group but the
mechanic resists grabbing onto the catwalk
the assistant leaves him there
angie takes the assistants place and pushes the mechanics contraption over to pappagallos side
pismo is left hesitating in the middle
after a terrible moment of indecision he joins angie
the camp is now divided mostly against pappagallo
the two groups stare across at each other solemnly
a voice is heard from the battlements
two days ago i saw a vehicle thatd haul that tanker
all eyes turn to max
you wanna get out of here
you talk to me
max faces pappagallo across a desk littered with plans and equipment
warrior woman big rebecca the farmer and the mechanic listen in
so thats my offer
i deliver a prime mover in return you give me my black car and as much gasas i can carry
all i need right now is three jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum
they look at him quizzically
think of it as a down payment
thats the last well ever see of him
what have we got to lose
from the battlement pappagallo watches as max accompanied by the dog emerges from a hole in the wall
max has a pole across his shoulders supporting four jerry cans of fuel
maxs knee brace squeaks in the stillness
the mechanic throws him a small can
max squirts a stream of oil onto the metal and then moves off across the bridge of wrecks built by the mohawk bikers the day before
the feral kid watches with other camp people as max and the dog move out into the night
max emerges from the ditch the heavy load weighing him down
behind him the searchlight from the compound plays over the wilderness
ahead he sees the glow of the marauders campfires
he moves forward silently
near the mahaudl s cam k i hlj
picking his way carefully across rugged ground max skirts close to a large campfire
around it a group of marauders are carousing some are laughing loudly at a victim strung up to a beam by his wrists
a bottle passes among the marauders
in the shadows lit by the flickering flame a mohawk biker fondles two camp followers
closest to max a gayboy berserker hones his machete on a whetstone
max skirts round him not taking his eyes off him
suddenly maxs leg gives way caught in a rabbit hole
he pitches forward the ferry cans thumping together
the gayboy berserker pivots
max is spread eagled on the ground
the dog curls its lip
the gayboy berserker walks towards max his eyes searching the darkness
there is a loud barking
max looks up
on a rabbit warren close by the feral kid sits on his haunches howling like a wild dog
the gayboy berserker takes a rock and throws it curs ing all howling dogs and returns to the camp
the feral kid motions for max to follow
keeping low max limps forward
the feral kid stops at the edge of the gully and indicates the direction for max to take
he grins at max and runs off into the night back the way he came
max drops down into the gully heading away from the marauders camp
max climbs up to the spot where he left the gyro captain
just the canopy a dog food can and a freshly dug hole where the tree stump used to be
a clear trail gouged in the dirt leads back towards the sand dune country
the dog sniffs and lopes off
max and the dog crest a rise at the edge of the pan
about a hundred yards ahead out on the clay is the captain still dragging the tree stump behind him
t h e dog growls
the captain turns to see max he picks up the log and tries to run
the sun is much higher in the sky the captain has been freed from the tree stump and now carries the ferry cans coolie like across his shoulders
the three travellers stagger over the dune
tha gyro copter is intact though the kite now rests face dawn on the sand at the crest of the dune they sue the body of a lone marauder
foot and tyre prints tell the story
crossing the dunes in his buggy he happened across the gyrocopter
he left his buggy walked down to the abandoned gyrocopter and fell victim to the snake he staggered around in circles before slumping face down in the sand
the captain lets out a whoop as he and max half stumble half run towards the body
i knew it
i knew itd work
lethal those snakes
the snakes fangs my brains
lethal i the captain stops staring down at the body of the snake its head crushed quickly he picks it up and begins to skin it muttering sc
vu l t dont think youre gonna get any of this
cos youre not
it was my snake
i found it
i trained it
and im gonna eat it
keeping the gun trained on the captain max rummages through the marauders clothes
he finds a necklace of spark plugs bolts teeth and two old shotgun cartridges
max removes the two cartridges
one crumbles apart
the second although dog eared remains intact the gyro captain looks up as max cracks open the shotgun both barrels are empty
max shoves the dog eared cartridge into the barrel and snaps the shotgun shut
the gyro captain gasps you mean
all this time
jesus thats dishonest
max nudges the captain towards the gyrocopter
the captain stands fast eyeing the shotgun
how do we know that ones not a dud
theres only one way to find out
he lifts the barrel to the captains head
the captain moves off towards the gyrocopter
one jerry can lies discarded by the gyro
max with the dog on his lap is settled on the chassis the three remaining cans strapped on beside him
a flurry of sand whips back from the propellor
the gyro unaccustomed to the extra weight lumbers across the sand and slowly rises into the sky
the bloated fly blown corpse of the driver lies next to the abandoned road rig
the bonnet of the prime mover is up and max is working on the engine
a chain passes from the bull bar up into the cabin where the captain sits behind the wheel muttering into a handkerchief
the dog watches him carefully
max yanks on the chain
the gyro captain tests the motor nothing
after two more attempts it splutters to life
the prime mover disconnected from the rest of the rig stands in the middle of the road
max is in the cabin with the dog the engine running the gyro captain looks up at him rattling his chains
you cant just dump me
think of us as partners
max tosses him a set of keys shouting over the engire
its up to you
fly a kite or follow me back
maybe theyll throw some gas your max eases the prime mover down the road sc
the gyro captain struggling to unlock his manacles yells after him what sort of deals that
im running on empty
max hurls the prime mover down the long empty highway eating up the miles
theprime mover crests a bill
in the distance max can see the pinnacles surrounding the camp
he checks his shotgun on the seat beside him
max tramps the accelerator
the dog climbs under the seat
the back wheels burn rubber as the prime mover thunders down the road
suddenly the gyrocopter zooms over the rise behind him spluttering and coughing like hes running out of gas
in the marauders camp a mohawker is shaving wezs head
at the sound of the approaching prime mover wez leaps to his feet clambers over a tow truck on blocks and straddles his bike
other marauders follow as we track to a skinhead lying under the tow truck making noisy repairs
max burls the prime mover towards the rise above the compound
a dune buggy comes up alongside the rear passenger wheel
the smegma crazy riding shotgun fires a crossbow arrow into a tyre
wez appears on the road ahead as a road racer rockets from out of the scrub in front of the prime mover
max shunts it back off the road and into the rear of the tow truck on blocks
the tow truck crashes down pinning the skinhead beneath it
a rise abode rhe compound
the humungus his vehicle sitting in the middle of the road turns at the sound of the crash
the gyrocopter sputters along staying out of range of the marauders
the captain is shouting advice and instructions from watch your tyres
down over the captains shoulder we see wezs bike coming alongside the prime movers rear wheels on the drivers side
the road approaching the rise
wez lifts his feet onto the saddle steadies himself and leaps onto the back of the prime mover
as the vehicle crests the rise max sees the camp below
he yanks the air horn lanyard
j j l ll j lll v j w n i
i pappagallos people turn at the sound
from the cracking tower pappagallo shouts open the gate
the feral kid astride the pump is on his feet
big rebecca runs to the yellow school bus
the humungus raises the magnum
aiming directly at the oncoming prime mover
on seeing this max grabs the shotgun shoves it through the smashed front window of the truck and fires
the gun fizzes and pops the cartridge was a dud
max ducks and yanks down hard on the wheel
the humungus fires
the big gun kicks
the front of the prime mover bursts with steam and hot oil the big machine careers off the road and through a primitive tent
as the canvas rips away
we glimpse two startled marauders in the throes of hetereosexual love
max recovers the big machine keeps going rocketing down the hill yards from the causeway
suddenly a powerful arm bursts through the drivers window
and grabs max around the throat its the dog attacks wez clamping his jaw around his gauntlet
wez pulls the dog out the window and flicks his arm
the dog sails through the ai
t hil aky tualii tu a lauz w a
max rams his elbow into wezs ace
the big biker holds on tightening his grip
a dune buggy with a machine gun like crossbow the pak fires four bolts into the t yres
all but one tyre on the drivers side blow out
as the prime mover charges past we track with the lone wolf who drives a two engined assault car
he yells to other marauders behind the gates open
follow me in
a street car and a dune buggy surge up beside him
in the background we see the dog running along the road trying to catch up to the tanker
the gyro captain curses and screams
dont lose it now
we need the fuel
the captain grabs whatever he can find the two ferry cans and his chains and throws hem at the chase below
oacf to the c
sew l y
to of th a objects fall across thr path of the on rushing street car the third smashes into the vehicleti windscreen to no avail the vehicle continues in the
chase to the causeway
converging on the prime mover the pak dune buggy surges up to the drivers side wheels
the smegma craz e h s reloaded the crossbow and is taking aim on the critical last tyre
the gyro captain is reaching down into a sack
he pulls out two snakes
clamping their jaws shut he kisses them goodbye and hurls them down
the snakes land in the pak dune buggy one of them between the drivers legs
perplexed he reaches down for it
pulling it up to look
the snake has its fangs in his hand
the pak dune buggy swerves out of control
up and over the back of the prime mover
and onto the street car
locked together both vehicles tumble down into the ditch
i n th
cabin of the truck max smashes the butt of the shotgun into ezs face again and again
wez just grins
the prime mover thunders through the gate
pappagallo and warrior woman take their positions on the battlements
as soon as the prime mover clears the gate big rebecca plants her foot on the accelerator of the school bus gate
the lone wolf vehicle and the dune buggy just make it inside
the dog scampers through the rapidly closing gap
a road racer slides up to the gate
the driver looks up
to see pappagallo aiming the flame thrower down at him
he slams the vehicle into reverse
i hl a i ls h lii j lvvh l lvla ul l
pappagallo sends the torrent of flames down on the retreating vehicle
as humungus and the other marauders hover at the entrance of the causeway
the prime mover slides to a halt underneath a catwalk
as several camp people run towards him wez swings up onto the roof of the prime mover and onto the catwalk
the two marauder vehicles stop in the middle of the compound
max jumps out of the prime mover assessing the situation
in addition to wez there are four marauders inside the compound the lone wolf the lone wolfs passenger and two smegma crazies
undei the direction of the humungus half a dozen marauders come surging up the causeway on foot
pappagallo stands up on the very limit of the battle ment and scares them off with a burst of flame
a marauder fires an arrow
pappagallo is hit high up in the thigh
he tumbles backwards off the parapet and cre
shes to the ground below
up on the catwalk wez is shouting at the four the gate
max looks around as the lone wolf the lone wolf passenger and the two smegma crazies start to sprint across the compound towards the gate
the lone wolf passenger falls dead an arrow in his back
wez spins around to see the quiet man standing on the cooling tower reloading his bow
wez starts running towards him
with the help of the dog max tackles the first smegma crazy who is running towards the gate
they land at the foot of the pump
the feral boy bouncing up and down on top of the pump looks down gleefully as the farmer the butcher and the curmudgeon descend on the max is on his
feet running towards pappagallo as the second smegma crazy is hit by the mechanic flying on the end of his lattice arm contraption
angie and pismc manning the other end smile with satisfaction
wez confronts the quiet man who has his bow drawn the quiet man fires wez ducks missed
the quiet man is paralysed by indecision
wez is on him
head butts him once twice three times the quiet mans face is a torrent of blood as wez throws him of the cooling platform
the quiet mail lands groaning badly injured
the lone wolf has made it to the gate and smashes his way through the window clawing at big rebecca
she shoves a boot in his face as warrior woman drops onto him from the battlement above and buries a knife blade in his neck
max has picked up pappagallos flame thrower
pappagallo watches as he climbs the battlements a dozen marauders are charging up the causeway
max appears above them spraying fire
the marauders retreat
inside the compound
a wez grabs a cable and swings from the catwalk across the cracking tower to pappagallos dinosaur tent
he slides down the tent leaps onto some tyres onto a storage tank and then onto the tanker
he hesitates a moment looking for some way to get to the gate
the whole camp turns to confront him
he ducks the gyrocopter swoops down over his head and lands in the centre of the compound
an arrow flies past wez then the feral kids boomerang he decides to call it quits
running along the top of the tanker be leaps the barbed wire fence
wez lands in the ditch
he clambers over a wreck out of the ditch and out of range
the gyro captain is up on the tanker throwing a stick and shaking his fist at the marauders putting on a show for the jubilant compound people
several people shake hands with the gyro captain the feral kid watches puzzled intrigued by this strange ritual
the mechanic is already examining the damage to the prime mover pappagallo is propped up against the base of the battlement
big rebecca and the warrior woman tend his thigh wound
we leave tonight
the mechanic lifts his head out of the engine we got a hole through the radiator into the timing case
gonna take at least hours
youve got twelve
the crowd disperses
the quiet man is carried to the bread van medical centre the bodies are removed camp members load vehicles men are working on the tanker
warrior woman climbs onto the battlement
the marauders have regrouped on the rise
max is watching them the flame thrower in his hands as the warrior woman approaches him i want you to know
that was a very brave thing you did
he doesnt reply just hands her the flame thrower and descends the ladder
big rebecca has just pulled the arrow out of pappagallos leg as max moves into view
pappagallo watches him walk towards the black on black its nose poking out of the pyramid workshop as max passes the gyrocopter we see the gyro captain in conversation with
and tell me son this machine of yours it takes two does it
the gyro captain glances over the curmudgeons shoulder at lusty who is admiring the gyrocopter
the feral kid steps forward holding his hand out stiffly to max
max hesitates then shakes it briefly
the kid laughs be finds this hand shaking business hilarious
as max moves on to the pyramid workshop the feral kid follows in his footsteps mimicing his squeaky stiff legged gait
through the maze of pipes in the peak of the pyramid we have a high angle down on max working on the black on black below
the feral kid comes into view in the foreground climbing along the pipes
the kid is softly humming a tune approximating the first few notes of happy birthday
on the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfer ring fuel from a gallon drum into the black on blacks fuel tanks
max is re arming the booby traps connecting a string of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps
his utility belt and jacket are off and he has laid his personal
effects on a nearby work bench
in the background through the arched doorway we see sc
the mechanic and his team working on the truck with arc welders lights and so on
max looks up the curmudgeon is leading pappagallointo the workshop
i told ya
i said he was leaving
high up in the pyramid the feral kid starts to swing down the pipes towards the bench where max has laid his jacket and utility belt
on the floor pappagallo i dont have time for thanks
you know what you did out there and what it means to us
come with us max
drive the tanker
continues to work muffling the four exhausts by plugging them with rags
we had a contract
i did my job i got my car and i got my gas
end of story
it doesnt have to be well make a new contract
i can offer you a chance to rebuild your life i can offer you a future
the curmudgeon breaks in excited
you gotta come
he produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which bears the heading
the feral kids arm sneaks across the work bench reaching out for the hurdy gurdy
maxs hand snaps out and clamps around the kids wrist
the feral kid drops the hurdy gurdy
as max releases his grip the kid retreats into the shadows
the curmudgeon unravels the postcard pictures in front of maxs face
this is where were going
two thousand miles away
plenty of sunshine
nothing to do but breed
max starts to go back to his work
pappagallo takes him by the shoulder
what are you looking for out there
how long do you expect to survive scavenging day to day
youre no different than them
he points in the direction of the marauders
dont you see
there is a better way
max flares at him angry yeah
i tried it once
now forget it cos i never get involved
i leave tonight
pappagallo is about to reply when a scream echoes through the camp
they all turn to look the men working on the prime mover are running towards the battlement an ominous drumming begins in the marauders camp
pappagallo climbs onto part of the refinerys cat walk which is close to the workshop area
several other camp members including the gyro captain and lusty are already there looking across no mans land
the marauders are raising two tall poles
two of the camp members captured that morning are nailed to the poles screaming
pappagallo turns to max who is still down at the black on black
thats the alternative
men feeding on men
max goes back to work
the gyro captain slips his arm around lustys shoulder
i know youre afraid darlin
but ill let you into a secret sweetheart
im afraid too
he squeezes her tight
she caresses his hand
silhouetted against a large fire near the two poles a group of twelve
marauders of various breeds beat out a tattoo on the panels of their cars
the humungus watches as two more victims are raised on poles
the beat becomes more frenzied pouring with sweat max tears up the first of a series of metal plates which form the floor of the workshop area
he drags it
across the compound passing the mechanics team working in a shower of sparks on the prime mover
the mechanic looks up go on
just another mercenary
max ignores him dragging the plate past pappagallos tent
it is crowded with camp people laying their plans for escape
they fall silent turning to watch max
the black on black waits next to the fence near the place where the mohawkers attempted to build the bridge of cars across the ditch
max has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is manouevrin the metal plate on top of the first car starting to build a ramp from thw compound over
the top of the cars and onto the far side of the ditch
the humungus has stepped up his theatrics of terror
his voice booms across the night reciting dark poetic descriptions of death and hell
the camp people gathered in pappagallos tent watch as the gyro captain walks towards the spot where max is working
pappagallo sits at his desk flicki
ng an egg timer the sand trickling from one end to the other
fs max who is locking the last metal plate into position looks up at the gyro captain
i just want you to know that i dont agree with them he indicates the people in pappagallos tent
i dont think youre a coward
a bit stupid but not a coward where else you gonna find what we ve got here
max goes back to work putting the finishing touches to the ramp
men too if thats your inclination
all weve got to do is get away from that humungus
with you driving the tanker we can do it
i know you can
i saw you out there
stay with us max
drive the tanker
max gets up snaking his head
i havent got time to explain
just believe me ive got everything i want
the captain starts to interrupt but max cuts him short
good luck tomorrow
i hope you make it
max puts out his hand
a the captain a little surprised shakes hands with him
thanks a lot
the captain walks back towards the group watching from pappagallos tent
he shrugs his shoulders
max opens the door of the black on black
max eases the black car onto the metal plates
the wide wheels rumble slowly across the makeshift bridge
max revs the motor to get over the last hump the plugs in the exhausts muffling the sound of the big engine
the humunguss bizarre ravings continue to boom across the wasteland
the black on black eases away from the compound
the dog is edgy growling
max takes hold of his shotgun there is a thump
something lands on the roof
the dog flies at the window snarling
max jams the barrel against the roof
a face appears leaning over the windscreen peering in at max
its the feral kid he grins and tumbles through the passengers window
he grabs hold of maxs hand shaking it
the feral kid laughs settling in to the seat
the car continues to roll forward
the feral kid looks at him puzzled then throws his head back howling
max stops the car looking round nervous
the first light of dawn appears on the horizon
max turns to the feral kid youre a fine kid but you cant come
youve gotta learn dont get close to people
it can churn you up
the kid cant understand a word so just grins
max thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces the hurdy gurdy
he shoves it into the feral kids hands opens the door and pushes him out
as the feral kid gets to his feet the black on black accelerates away surging up the rise towards the humungus encampment
the rapid burst of power fires the four plugs out of the exhausts
the big engine roars
wez springs to his feet
his face covered in a white war paint
his eyes searching out the darkness
he starts running
towards the humungus machine
a gayboy berserker is running with him
as they climb into the vehicle the humungus sitting on a rock near the victims on the poles gets to his feet he bellows with rage as wez drives the
vehicle off in pursuit of max
the two victims still strapped to the front lift their heads
the humungus machine
from the humungus machine wez sees six other vehicles stream across the landscape in pursuit of the black on black
one tow truck two dune buggies two street cars and a bike
the toadie emerges bewildered from where he has been sleeping under the fuel tanks of the humungus machine
the black on black achieves the road
the dog is looking back through the passenger window as we see the first of the pursuing vehicles rumble onto the road
max hits the supercharger switch
the big engine whines up
once again the dog climbs down under the seat
the humungus machine rockets onto the road
and begins to overtake the other six marauder vehicles one by one
max is giving the black on black all its got
in the humungus machine wez the gayboy berserker and the toadie have left the rest of the marauders well behind
the big machine seems to be encroaching on the black on black
i i t rvaa a
wez shouts instructions to the gayboy berserker who comes to his side
the gayboy berserker slides behind the wheel as wez clambers forward onto the front of the vehicle
the gayboy berserker reaches down
his hand rests on a toggle switch next to three gas bottles marked at the front of the vehicle wez grabs a huge exhaust pipe jutting into the air
in spite of the heat he tears the pipe off the mounting
he signals to the gayboy the gayboy berserker flicks down the toggle switch there is a mighty roar matched by a massive surge of power in the humungus machine
the two victims on the front scream
max is bewildered by the massive acceleration
the humungus machine leaps alongside the black on black
wez swings the chrome pipe down through the front windscreen into maxs face
the black on black takes out a guide post and leases the road
rolling over and over
inside the car max his face bloodied and the dog are slammed around in the cabin of the black on black
it continues rolling over and over again into a gully
what is left of the car comes to rest upside down among the boulders of a dry creek bed
max is slumped dangling in his harness his face and body bloodied and broken
its the dog pulling himself out of the wreckage
he licks and paws at maxs face
one eye flickers open
wez stands looking down into the gully
another vehicle has arrived
two gayboy berserkers and the toadie scramble down towards the wreck carrying jerry cans
dont waste him
if hes alive i want him
by an enormous force of will max frees himself from the harness and as the sound of the marauders approaches pulls himself through the window of the wreck
he falls to the ground dragging his crippled body into the shadow of a large boulder hiding there
the dog confronts the marauders snarling standing between them and the wreck
one of the gayboy berserkers raises his crossbow
max watches grim faced as the dog falls dead
the three marauders run to the vehicle
while the toadie prepares to siphon off the gas the other two peer into the crushed cabin
perplexed they examine the wreck more closely looking for max
one of them sees the drag marks leading down the creek bed
he signals to the other marauder
max prepares to defend himself
the toadie prises the cap off the black cars fuel tank
the booby trap explodes
the petrol ignites
the three marauders are engulfed by a giant fireball
max looks pa t the flames staring up at wez not taking his eyes off him
wez and the other marauders watch the great pillar of smoke rise up into the sky
they return to their vehicles
the gyro captain helps the lusty girl dismantle one of the small tents
in the background we see the camp vehicles standing ready fully loaded
the mechanics team are still working on the prime mover
as pismo shows from the tower the gyro captain looks up to see the smoke from the wreck rising into the sky
captain mutters an oath and sprints towards is machine
foot by foot max drags himself alor g the creekbed heading for the compound
blood seeps from wounds on his head and face
his legs are useless his hands heavily bandaged with strips from his leather jacket
behind him in the distance we see the still smouldering wreck of the black on black
max struggles on the pain growing the sun climbing the temperature soaring
his mind becomes more feverish the wasteland dissolves into the heat haze the buzz of the flies around his face becomes the steady drone of an engine
the gyrocopter appears above him
max strapped to the chassis of the gyrocopter drifts back to consciousness
he sees the compound surging towards them as they come in to land
he drifts back into unconsciousness the images distorting dissolving
maxs eyes flicker open to a slow distorted version of as he fights to make sense of his surroundings we see that his wounds have been stitched and dressed
he lifts his head looking through the back door of the bread van
t f t
is sitting on the roof of the van playing the hurdy then beyond the kid coming into clear focus he sees the prime mover attached to the tanker
the tanker now sports a cow catcher on the front armour plating on the bonnet steel aprons on the wheels and a barbed wire net along each side
maxs vision clears
he sees pappagallo on the catwalk addressing the camp people
max drops his bead back and looks to one side a bloated faces stares back at him
the quiet man is lying unconscious on a stretcher next to him
max lifts his head urgently and looks around
he realises that he is in the bread van
the canopy has been removed and his stretcher is supported by a collection of gallon drums
pappagallo paces the catwalk as he gives final instructions to the camp people gathered below
were going to use the tanker and the two assault vehicles to punch our way out of here
if im right theyll all go after the tanker
thatll give the rest of you a chance
max is sitting up binding his leg tight with bandages clipping on his metal knee brace
pappagallo v o split up
go as hard as you can
two hundred miles north theres a bridge
at powder river
if we make it thats our rendezvous
as max struggles to haul himself out of the bread van the feral kid hands him his equipment belt
au l i l pappagallo v a its defensible we can refuel there
max grim faced starts to walk towards the tanker
blood seeps through the bandage on his leg
pappagallo v o but
only give us til sunset
if we havent made it by then keep going
pappagallo swings down off the catwalk heading for the cabin of the tanker
the meeting breaks up the camp people moving to take up their positions on the various vehicles
ill drive the tanker
everybody stops turning to look at him
max is staring at pappagallo swaying slightly hands clenched until youre clear of trouble
the curmudgeon breaks in hes gotta be joking
look at you
but im still the best youve got
pappagallo thinks for a long moment
youll need these
he tosses max his sawn off shotgun and a bandolier containing six cartridges
the tanker stands at the far end of the compound
behind it the gyro captain is spinning the rotor of his machine
a dune buggy and the lone wolfs car armour plated since being captured by the camp wait on either side of the tanker
beyond the gate the marauders have formed an arc of vehicles just out of crossbow range
the hiunungus machine stands at its centre
max sits in the tanker checking out the controls familiarising himself with the machine
warrior woman stands on the running board
she turns as the mechanic clambers on board
he glares at her daring her to stop him i sweated blood on this mother
and no bastards gonna make me go in no lousy bread van
max kicks over the big engine
oiy idh the cum uunv
wez stands on the back of a tow truck beyond him we see the arc of vehicles engines gunning straining at the leash
the humungus vehicle eases forward into frame
the two victims on the front of his vehicle have their heads hooded
max is revving the engine higher and higher
warrior woman climbs up to the top of the tanker
pappagallo starts the assault vehicle
warrior woman finds the feral ki
d crouched down in her position behind the protective plate
holding the kid by his arm she passes him down to max who passes him down to the ground
pappagallo yells for someone to come and take him
the lusty girl runs forward
the feral kid avoids her
max engages the engine
the tanker rumbles forward gathering speed as it runs the length of the compound
big rebecca at the wheel of the school bus draws the vehicle aside revealing the burnt out wreck of the road racer on the causeway and the marauders beyond
the humungus has opened his gun case and removes the magnum
the remaining bullets have been placed in the revolving chamber
the dune buggy and the lone wolf machine follow close behind the tanker
the feral kid leaps onto the back of pappagallos vehicle
the warrior woman and the mechanic lie low as the tanker roars out the gate ploughing through the burnt out wreck knocking it into the ditch
the humungus raises his gun calmly taking aim at the oncoming tanker
as the tanker accelerates towards him the gyrocopter swoops out of the compound and over the marauders
the gyro captain drops three burning molotov cocktails
they fall in and around a road racer at one end of the arc
the road racer bursts into flames
the gyro captain whoops with delight
with the lone wolf machine and the dune buggy close alongside max steers the tanker towards the burning road racer
the humungus fires
the bullet dents the protective plate mounted on the front of the tanker but does no further damage
two more dents the tanker keeps going crashing through the burning wreck
breaking the marauders cordon
the gyro captain has banked around and is swooping low
having swung around the gyro captain swoops down taking aim on the humungus machine with another fistful
of lighted bottles
the humungus looks up
he swings the revolver up taking aim at the approaching gyrocopter
the bullet hits piercing the right rudder peddle
dropping his bottles the gyro captain screams and looks down blood pours from what is left of his right foot
i jax jl vv i jill if l lubllv l
max glances up to see the gyrocopter flying ezaatically swoop over and bank away towards the horizon
on top of the tanker warrior woman and the mechanic prepare to fire their weapons
behind them the humungus and his horde power over the rise pursuing the tanker
suddenly three of the marauder vehicles skid to a halt they start to turn back towards the compound where the remaining camp vehicles are making their bid for freedom
the bread van and three other vehicles have followed the yellow school bus out onto the causeway
they skirt round the back of the compound and head off across country
the humungus screams at his men through the amplifier the tanker
all on the tanker
as the three marauder vehicles turn to rejoin the tanker chase
a massive flash fills the sky
the camp erupts in flame followed by a series of rolling explosions
the camp people have destroyed what they cannot take
as the tanker surges towards us we see the dune buggy the lone wolf machine and the pursuing marauders surrounding it
max grimaces as he changes gears
his leg is bleeding freely now
he looks to the passenger side the dune buggy driven by the blacksmith and manned by pismo leaps onto the road in front of the tanker
a tow truck manned by skinheads converges on it from the drivers side
on the back of the dune buggy pismo lifts his crossbow
unaware that behind him wezs convertible tow truck a is approaching fast
the first of the two skinheads on the back of the tow truck fires his crossbow
the arrow sails past pismos ear
he hits the first skinhead but the arrow bounces off the skinheads protective armour
the skinhead grins
pismo hurries to reload
the second skinhead raises his bow aiming at pismo
an arrow hits the second skinhead in the back of the head
pismo looks up to see warrior woman reloading her longbow
pismo grins at her
behind him wets arm reaches down and hooks the jib chain around the roll bar of the dune buggy
the tow truck accelerates
the chain tightens
pismo screams as he is thrown through the air
wezs tow truck drags the dune buggy askew
it rolls in front of the tanker
max has no choice
the cow catcher shunts the dune buggy aside sending it tumbling off the road
max struggles with the wheel
managing to keep the vehicle on the road
he looks down in the side mirror two road racers and a dune buggy followed by the humungus machine surge up behind the tanker
from behind protective plates on top of the tanker the mechanic hurls a molotov cocktail
the farmer stationed at the rear of the tanker does the same
the two bottles smash into the first road racer
it bursts into flames
swerves in front of the other road racer ramps off the road and plunges into a marauders dune buggy
pappagallo who has been forced off the road narrowly avoids the wreck
the skinhead tow truck draws alongside the tanker near max s door
the second skinhead twirling a grappling hook lets it fly
it trails out towards the tanker cabin
flies through the drivers window
and lands virtually in maxs lap
as the tow truck swerves away from the tanker the cable tightens
the grappling hook drags across maxs arm tearing away part of the sleeve and hooks onto the door
the tow truck brakes
maxs door is ripped off its hinges
a smegma crazy riding in the cabin of the tow truck is encouraged by this success
he begins twirling his grappling hook as the vehicle approaches the back of the tanker
the farmer pops up from behind a protective plate and fires his crossbow
the arrow misses the tow truck flies through the caged window of a road racer armed with a pak and lodges in the drivers helmet
the driver pulls off his helmet
the arrow has barely creased his scalp
the s egma crazy hurls his grappling hook
it caches the farmer by the leg and hooks on to the lip of the back protective plate
the cable snaps taut the farmer screams
max feels the sudden tug on the tanker he changes down
the tow truck is dragged along veering out of control
the strain pops the rivets off the tankers back plate
it comes away in one piece
carrying away the farmer and the steel aprons protecting the rear wheels
the tow truck tumbles and rolls
on top of the tanker the mechanic has lit another molotov cocktail
he swings back to throw
the road racer armed with the pakswings alongside and fires
three arrows rat a tat against the protective plates
the fourth hits the mechanics upraised arm
the bottle drops
and smashes on top of the tanker
the humungus accelerates hard towards the now undefended rear of the tanker
he pulls a rope whipping the hoods off the heads of the two victims lashed to the front
they scream as the back of the tanker looms in front of them
max looks in the passenger side mirror
wezs convertible tow truck is drawing alongside the left rear wheels of the prime mover
wez fires an arrow into the first tyre
flailing cable and rubber
as wez reloads another mohawker wearing two bizarre bear claws on his crossbow gauntlets steadies himself on the back of the tow truck
ready to jump aboard the tanker
pappagallos lone wolf machine appears in the background
warrior woman turns to see that the mechanic is losing the battle with the flames
in vain he tries to stop his clothes catching alight
rising to her feet warrior woman fires an arrow at the bear claw biker
hitting him in his protective pads throwing him off balance
as warrior woman scrambles along the top of the tanker towards the mechanic two marauders fire at her sc
she is hit once in the protective plate around her kidneys and once in the thigh
from the lone wolf vehicle pappagallo and the feral kid watch as she staggers forward
in the tow truck wez has reloaded and fires at warrior woman
the arrow hits her in the back
she buckles and falls into the barbed wire
max watches helplessly in the rear vision mirror as she struggles in the wire
as wez reloads his crossbow the lone wolf machine accelerates alongside the tow truck
the kid throws his steel boomerang
yiitting wezs crossbow gauntlet preventing him from aiming
the masked mohawker driving the tow truck turns to see
pappagallo firing his gauntlet crossbow
the masked mohawker screams as the arrow passes through his neck
the convertible tow truck swerves in and bounces off the tanker
wez is thrown off balance
the bear claw biker grabs the barbed wire on the side of the tanker for support
the tow truck swerves away out of control leaving the bear claw biker clinging to the wire wez scrambles over into the drivers seat bringing the vehicle back under control
warrior woman caught in the wire by her clothing struggles to remain conscious as she slips closer to the tankers wheels
the mechanic who has managed to extinguish the flames crawls towards her
her clothing tearing
his hand reaches out
and grabs her
a road racer draws alongside them
max yells as he sees the driver a gayboy berserker fire another arrow into the mechanic
the mechanic shudders the warrior woman slips her weight dragging them both off the tanker
max enraged tears off the sling which supports his wrist
he grabs the shotgun off the seat next to him
he swings the gun around then pumps both barrels into the road racer the first blast shatters the windscreen the second blows off the bonnet
the gayboy berserker is unharmed
max hauls down hard on the wheel
the tanker swerves into the road racer taking it through a guide post and into the rough
the tanker barrels over the road racer rolling it tumbling it into another marauders vehicle
max changes down and hurls the tanker back onto the highway
the bear claw biker hangs on desperately
max grabs two of the four remaining cartridges and quickly reloads the shotgun
the humungus machine draws up behind the undefended tanker
a gayboy berserker clambers to the front of the humungus vehicle between the two victims and leaps onto the back of the tanker
further along the tanker a mohawk biker with pillion rider has drawn alongside
the pillion rider helps the bear claw biker swing up above the wire
once he is on top the bear claw biker hauls the pillion rider on board
the mohawk biker accelerates alongside the leading set of wheels one of which has already been blown apart
he raises his bow taking aim
the flying steel belt of the shreaded tyre lashes around his arm dragging him and his bike beneath the rig
the giant wheels trample the man and machine spitting them out the back
beneath the wheels of the humungus machine
on its way through the bike has ruptured a small hose underneath the tanker
we see something trickling out of the tank
streaming down the road
on board the tanker the gayboy berserker scrambles towards the cabin leaping the gap between the tank and the prime mover
max looks up at the thump overhead
the gayboy berserker braces himself taking aim through the roof
the arrow rips through the metal and buries itself in the seat between maxs legs
the gayboy berserker prepares to reload
the humungus tailgating him isnt quick enough
the front of his vehicle smacks one corner of the tanker crushing the broken man strapped to the front
the gayboy berserker on the roof pitches forward falling past the windscreen and out of sight over the front of the tanker
the pillion rider and bear claw biker scramble and fall
the bear claw biker catches hold of an outlet valve and steadies himself
the pillion rider totters
and grabs the chromed exhaust stacks
he screams as the pipe scorches his hand
tumbling over the side
on the crest of a hill about yards ahead max sees another vehicle
the gyrocopter stands in the middle of the road facing away from the chase
the gyro captain has bandaged his foot and is trying to repair the right rudder peddle
as the chase looms up behind him he turns
we see that the gayboy berserker is clinging to the cow catcher on the front of the tanker
furiously the gyro captain starts spinning the rotor by hand turning over the motor
as the tanker bears down on him he takes off so steeply that he almost stalls
once he is airborne he looks down
down below we see pappagallos lone wolf vehicle draw alongside wezs convertible tow truck
wez looks over his shoulder
pappagallo comes alongside
the feral kid standing on the back of the machine hands him a crossobw
wez wrenches down hard on the wheel
shunting into the lone wolf vehicle
sending pappagallos arrow astray
the feral kid loses his footing tumbling off the side of the vehicle
pappagallo turns in dismay
as wez comes in to shunt him again
a bike with a side car accelerates alongside the tanker
the sidecar rider fires and takes out another tyre
the bear claw biker signals calling for a weapon
the side car rider throws him a large powerful crossbow
the bear claw biker catches it and starts to haul himself onto the roof of the cabin
the side car rider leaps onto the tanker
at the rear of the tanker a smegma crazy leaps off the front of the humungus vehicle and ontc the ladder which leads to the top of the tanker
the feral kid staggers to his feet as wezs tow truck and pappagallos lone wolf vehicle continue their shunting
the kid turns
a street car and a bike are roaring towards him
the kid starts running
in the scrub ahead over wezs shoulder we see an erosion ditch looming up
wez brakes and turns the wheel
the tow truck and the lone wolf machine go into a slide
wez manages to avoid the ditch and keep going but the lone wolf machines wheels plunge into the ditch bringing the vehicle to an abrupt halt
as max looks back a hand comes over the front bull bar of the tanker followed by the gayboy berserkers bead
he sees the bear claw biker and signals for the crossbow
the bear claw biker throws it
the crossbow lands on the bonnet
max turns sees him
and raises the shotgun
the gayboy berserker ducks
the bear claw biker works his way to maxs window
the smegma crazy jumps from the tanker onto the cabin roof
max looks up as the mans feet thump on t he metal above his head
the passengers window shatters the side car rider clings there raising his crossbow
j i pappagallo spins the back wheels of the lone wolf machine
frantically trying to pull it out of the it begins to move
the feral kid runs
wez streams in behind the marauders in the bike and street car
they are bearing down fast
when a rope drops from above swinging past the kid the kid grabs it and is hauled up just as the veh
s pass under him the gyrocopter banks away
the feral kid flies through the air a gayboy berserker in a road racer looks tip to see the gyrocopter and the kid
he swings a pak around on its axis and fires
three of the four arrows hit the gyrocopter in its under belly
the aircraft makes a terrible noise and dips radically dropping down towards the tanker
the kid clings desperately to the rope
looking up and then down at the rapidly approaching tanker
max struggles to free himself from the bear claws and reload the gun
the gayboy berserker scrambles over the bull
bar reaching for the crossbow
max lets go of the wheel and grabs the rear view mirror tearing it free and throwing it at the gayboy berserker
he slips back behind the bull bar
while the gyro captain struggles to keep his machine in the air the kid reaches out trying to grab bold of the tankers exhaust stacks
he cant reach
the gyro drops a
the kid grabs the barbed wire but cant bold it
max is struggling to pull the bear claw out of his shoulder when he sees the feral kid fly past the missing drivers door
max throws his arm out as far as it will go
grabbing hold of the kid hauling him into the tanker
max and the kid look out as the gyrocopter bucks wildly and crashes into the ground
azaa or nr
as the marauders swarm around the tanker a smegma crazy shoots out yet another tyre
a mohawk biker fires
exploding another tyre
max shouts at the feral kid
indicating the cartridges rolling around on the floor
the kid recovers the cartridges max hands him the gun
the gayboy berserker has crawled back onto the bonnet and is reaching for the crossbow
the kid tries to insert the first cartridge upside down
the other way
the kid slips in the first cartridge then the second
he snaps the gun shut and tries to aim it at the gayboy berserker
but cant find the trigger
the gayboy berserker raises the crossbow
max grabs the gun and fires
the gayboy berserker disappears over the side
max rams the barrel into the left arm pit of the he fires
the bear claw biker falls away
leaving his arm and crossbow gauntlet embedded in maxs shoulder
bellowing through his loudspeakers the humungus organises the destruction of the tanker
the pak street car surges forward and discharges its arrows
two more tyres shred away
a the tanker shudders
the feral kid looks out of the passenger window
max struggles to control the tanker
kid climbs through the smashed windscreen and onto the bonnet
max watches as he picks up the crossbow lying on the bonnet
the kid doesnt understand
he clambers onto the roof before max can grab him
the tanker shudders again as another tyre is blown out
max watches through the rear window as the kid jumps from the cabin to the top of the tanker and then disappears from view
top of thi tanker
the kid tries to load the crossbow as he clambers along the top of the tanker
the bow string is too powerful for him to draw
rear of the tanker
a another tyre is shot
one bogie falls down on the wheel rims
the tanker lurches
the kid slips down into the wire
the crossbow clatters onto the road
pappagallo has got the lone wolf machine back onto the road
starting to overhaul the pack heading for the rightand side of the tanker
up ahead on the left we see wezs tow truck drawing alongside the tanker
pieces of tyre are flailing everywhere
the tanker is down on one side
the kid is trying to climb back onto the top of the tanker
wezs tow truck comes into view
the kid is pinned by his dogskins to the side of the tank
he tries to free himself
he tears his dogskin off the arrow and reaches up once more to the top of the tanker
wez fires again
the arrow pierces the kids arm pinning him to the tank
max is fighting to bring the crippled tanker under control
he changes down wrestling with the wheel
stewing across the road
pappagallo draws alongside his doorway yelling jump
max turns around looking for the kid
the tanker leaves the road and ramps up on the embankment rolling to a stop
cr af runt iou
as the marauders swarm on top of the tanker pappagallo guns the engine
spraying dust max leaps the arm of the bear claw biker still
embedded in he grabs the rear roll bar of the lone wolf machine fighting to swing his feet clear
and finds a foothold as the vehicle roars away
the humungus draws up to the crippled tanker
wez and a second mohawker are on top
wez pulls open a hatch
the second mohawker plunges in his hand and lets out an he h e pulls out a handful of sand
below the htjmungus has opened the outlet hose
sand pours out onto the road
above him the kid is hanging by his arm
despite the pain
all this and no guzzolene
wez pale with fury speaks softly i know where theres guzzolene wez whirls around and fires his crossbow
the arrow buries itself in the humunguss mask
the big man crumbles to the ground dead
the rest of the horde are arriving
as their vehicles screech to a halt two smegma crazies and two gayboy berserkers leap out waving their jerry cans in the air
wez the second mohawker and two others open fire
the four marauders crumple
lu nl ii oa
max makes his way over the back engine of the speeding vehicle towards pappagallo he tears the bear claw arm out of his shoulder
through the screaming motor we hear pappagallo laughing almost hysterical
as max eases himself down into the cockpit
weve done it
i thought itd be impossible
but weve done it
what about the kid
dont you see
the fuel was with the others
its already at powder river
max reaches across and cuts the engine
the vehicle rolls to a stop
max g abs pappagallo
what happened to the boy
weve gotta keep going
its our only chance
max raises the bear claw arm to pappagallos face
we see that the crossbow strapped to the forearm is still loaded
i had to leave him
he was pinned to the rig
you left him there
there was nothing i could do
max throws pappagallo out of the vehicle and takes the drivers seat
pappagallo is left standing in the dust as max swings the lone wolf machine around
wez is sitting at the wheel of the humungus machine
he and the three other marauders all on
bikes accelerate away from the tanker
dead bodies litter the ground
wez urges the other three on pursuing the lone wolf machine
as the humungus machine winds around the bends we see the lone wolf vehicle approaching over a distant hillcrest
max guns the vehicle over the rise
over his shoulder we see the humungus machine yards away approaching at terrific speed
max steels himself
the two vehicles are on direct collision course
the two victims have been taken from the front of the humungus machine and something else is in their place
max sees that it is the feral kid lashed there upside down
he throws the wheel sending the vehicle into a slide spinning clear of the humungus machine
the lone wolf vehicle spins around
into the bikes of two marauders flanking wez
the third a mohawk biker follows wez as soon as max has the lone wolf machine under control he guns the two engines un s is off after wez
he hits as the vehicle approaches we see the kid his head inches off the bitumen
wez looks back to see max overtaking the mohawk biker
as max overtakes the mohawk biker he twitches the wheel
the big car swipes the bike
sending the mohawker sailing off the road
the lone wolf surges away catching up to the humungus machine
wez looks back at the approaching machine
he floors the accelerator red lining the engine
as the humungus machine surges into camera we do a track in zoom on the feral kids face turning the camera through degrees
we are upside down as we rocket along the curving undulating highway through a flock of birds
towards a puddle of water
as the water splashes on the lens
the humungus vehicle as it roars through the water passing a startled pappagallo walking along the road
sax rockets past moments later
max raises the bear claw arm as he closes in on wez drawing alongside the humungus machine
huniunu a machi
wez reaches down
to the toggle switch next to the nitrous oxide bottles
waiting for the right moment
he flicks the switch
he is thrown back by the massive acceleration
the humungus machine surges away from camera
max doesnt have time to aim the crossbow still attached to the bear claw arm
he fires the arrow disappearing in a blurr
the humungus machine thunders away rocketing along the open highway
eating up the white line
upside down the feral kid is terror struck the humungus machine roars straight into a wide curve leaving the road continuing out into the wasteland
the humungus machine charges through the salt bush
over maxs shoulder we see that the vehicle is slowing
max follows i out into the wasteland
the vehicle comes to a halt
cautiously max draws alongside wez sits stock still looking out at the desert beyond
it is not until max is alongside his face that we see the tip of the arrow protruding from his left eye
on the front of the vehicle the feral kid starts to sob
max stands on a hilltop overlooking powder river
a below him the convoy led by the yellow school bus moves out across the plain
a dust trail appears on the horizon racing to intercept the convoy
max lifts his broken binoculars its the gyro captain bumping along in the twisted wreck of the gyrocopter its rotors gone engine screaming
max shakes his head and walks back to the lone wolf machine on the top of the hill
once again we hear the old mans voice narrator v o that was the last we ever saw of him
we see pappagallo face set with determination driving the yellow school bus
narrator v o as for the rest of us
pappagallo led us north
to safety to a place in the sun
in the tenth year nurturing his vision of a new world he died felling timber
the lusty girl rolls her eyes and sighs as the gyro captain draws alongside her window
narrator v o the captain and the girl waged war for years
together they raised eight children
and as for me
the feral kid sitting in the back of the bus turrs to face us
his bright yellow eyes stare directly into camera
narrator v o in the fullness of time i became the leader the chief of the great northern tribe
for the first time we see the narrators eyes they are bright yellow
