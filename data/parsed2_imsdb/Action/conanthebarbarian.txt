howard october in the darkness we hear the solitary sound of a heartbeat resounding like a drum
in between the years when the oceans drank atlantis and the rise of the sons of aryas there was an age undreamed of when shining kingdoms lay spread across the
world like blue mantles under the stars
hither came conan the cimmerian a thief a slayer a king born of battle
muffled sounds as if underwater echo clanging swords the guttural cries of combat
eyes closed floating at peace within red glow of the womb
suddenly a flash of steel as a sword pierces the womb its tip not an inch from the babys head
as the sword is ripped out light streams in from outside we travel with it into the din of battle
a blonde haired armored aesir raider withdraws the bloody sword from the stomach of islene a wild maned cimmerian beauty many months pregnant now clutching her bloody stomach
across a muddy battlefield the air a maelstrom of falling snowflakes and embers from trees aflame the powerfully built corin rallies his fellow cimmerians until he spots islene
wielding a broadsword runes etched into its surface corin cuts a bloody path through his enemies his eyes never leaving islene
the aesir standing over islene laughs as she claws at the earth behind her trying to pull herself away
now now little whore
did i get you or your little one
islenes hand reaches back once again and it finds a fallen warriors sword
in one fluid motion she swings the sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the aesirs armor at his groin
id ask you the same
the aesir howls in agony raising his sword to deliver the killing blow when another sword pierces his chest
the aesir falls revealing corin standing behind him
corin throws aside his horned helmet and falls to his knees beside islene checking her wound
when he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood
their eyes meet
they both know
she pulls a knife from the folds of her pelts puts it in his hand
take your child
islene looks to her naked belly
the baby inside presses against its womb a visible impression on her flesh
there is no time husband
i would see my childs face
islenes eyes flutter as she struggles
corin lowers the knife
islenes eyes lock with corins as he puts the knife to use
never once does she scream
a moment later corin lifts the crying blood covered boy up through the falling snowflakes to islenes lap
he will be strong
a warrior with no equal
do not speak love
you have never been able to still my tongue and you will not this day
he will be wild corin
you must temper him
she shares one kiss with her child its first taste not of mothers milk but of her blood
his name is conan
the boys eyes are as deep and blue as the eastern sea
a small cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it
round wooden huts surround a stone lined pit where young cimmerian boys ages stand
pollen drifts through the air giving it an ethereal haze
at the center of the pit uran an elder cimmerian warrior speaks
a cimmerian warrior is like any other man
a cimmerian warrior feels hunger
he feels cold
like other men he may lie and cheat
stares the boys down but when a cimmerian warrior hungers he hungers only for the blood of his enemy
when he feels cold it is the cold steel of his sword
when he lies he lies in wait for his enemy
and when he cheats he cheats death itself
uran stops at the end of the line where a boy stands a good two heads smaller than the rest
he is no more than eight but his face is as stoic driven
you are too young to be here
conan determined doesnt move an inch
the largest teen menacingly steps up to the smaller boy
he said leave motherless whelp
the hulking teen goes to shove conan but conan pulls his arm towards him lashing out with his other hand punching the teen in the throat
the large boy goes down hard hands and knees gasping for air
a smattering of laughs erupt from the boys quickly silenced by urans stare
uran hands out river stones to each boy ending with conan
the boys know what to do they put the large stones in their mouths
in the black crag in the high pass stands a wooden training sword
the one who claims it with stone still in his mouth will have earned the right to train with the warriors
the boys look at each other sizing up the competition
what are you waiting for
and off they run
they knock each other down punching the others stomachs each trying to force the other to expel their stones
one or two succeed
most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high into the mountains
but a few head right for the sheer cliff face
conan follows the ones headed to the cliff
and when the cimmerian boys climb it is a sight to behold
they find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock face as though it were a ladder
the hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as conan trying to knock him off
conan swings with one hand and finds another path
in moments he is ahead
conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top the bigger boys right behind him
they race through the forest heading uphill when conan spots movement ahead
and the largest teen elbows past conan into the lead
the boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet an axe lodged squarely in his forehead
all the boys stop
out of the dense forest come covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand axes the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their waist
the boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and yell
they turn and run in the opposite direction
only conan doesnt move even as another boy pulls at him
but conan simply pulls the axe from his large boys skull
he turns to face the picts his eyes burning
the picts laugh and charge conan
corin arrives with uran and other armed cimmerian warriors
they get a brief glimpse of a single pict escaping in the other direction
one of the cimmerians takes off in pursuit
corin desperately searches for his son
conan steps forward from out of a thicket his body covered in pict blood
three picts lie massacred the bodies hacked to pieces
what have you done boy
conan walks past the other stunned cimmerians up to his father
conan spits out the bloody stone from his mouth
they killed one
i killed three
i am a warrior now
uran and the other cimmerian men exchange worried glances
looking at the carved up bodies of the picts they are aghast
conan looks confused
why arent they happy
what you have done a jackal would do
never a warrior
they would have done the same as i said jackals
he is not ready
i will forge him myself
conan is tested under corins watchful eye forced to sleep in the snow while his father keeps warm inside
a heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on wet river rocks
climbing a cliff face his bare hands leaving blood behind on the jagged rocks
flames reflect in the blue eyes of conan as he works the bellows of the forge
sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he stokes the blaze
corin sharpens a sword perfecting it
conan cannot take his eyes off it stepping away from the bellows
stoke your fire boy
conan slams the bellows closed anger rising
stoke your fire chop your wood
i have slept where wolves dare not
i have balanced a thousand river stones
when will you teach me the sword
corin stares his son in the eyes
think youre ready
then tell me what is a swords purpose
to slay ones enemies
that is what it does
its purpose is why you use it
he tosses conan two lumps of ore
tell me which makes the best sword
conan takes the two lumps testing them
he hands his father back one
the stronger ore eh
then we shall make a sword of it and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields
with a setting sun silhouetting the two conan attacks corin
conan attacks with fury
corin defends with grace
until the boy overextends and corin slashes down a counterattack that corin simply turns and walks away leaving conan to puzzle what happened
corin lowers his sword and walks away leaving conan to puzzle what happened
conan works the bellows putting his back into it
corin places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt
why did it break
because it had no life
sparks fly as corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword with hammer
corin nods at conan who sprinkles the glowing blade with ash
the strongest blade isnt made of the hardest steel boy
the hardest ore is what a man will die for
it is strong and unyielding
it neither cowers nor concedes
but without the softer ore it can be shattered like glass
steam rises as corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack tub only to place it right back into the flames
the softer ore is what a man lives for
it is flexible and lasting
it survives even against the greatest of foes
but too much of the soft ore the blade will not cut deep enough when it must
corin fashions the blades hilt engraving the guard and pommel
it is a work of art
a sword must be tempered the two ores united through fire and ice
through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death
corin hands conan the sword
now tell me what is this swords purpose
conan furrows his brow trying to puzzle the answer
corins disappointment shows
he takes the sword from conans hands
this one is not ready yet
blood rushes to conans face but he says nothing
he rushes out
frustrated conan slashes through a field of reeds cutting everything within reach of him expending his rage
behind him something moves in the forest
we catch just a glimpse of the pict the same one that escaped conan in the earlier scene
conans instincts cause him to spin around but then theres nothing there
built into the side of a huge tree fifty feet up this wooden structure houses two cimmerian sentries
a bird cries in the woods causing one of the sentries to investigate
he suddenly stands up straight unmoving
the one still sitting in the structure notices
the standing sentry falls backwards revealing an arrow piercing his right eye
shocked the remaining sentry reaches for the warning horn mounted on the wall
but as he reaches for it his shadow becomes three dimensional morphing into a thin feral humanoid bodies covered in tattoos from the deepest jungles of zingara
the scout lashes out with his black sword and cuts straight across the sentrys throat
this shadow scouts name is remo
remo exits and stares down at cheren a blind archer clad in lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat
cheren has an arrow notched and ready but somehow he knows not to fire
cheren lowers his bow and lets out a bird whistle
and the forest comes alive
the forces are an odd combination massive kushite tribesmen dark skinned savages from the savannahs of kush and a legion of aquilonian mercenaries heavily armored knights drawn from the cities
their leaders respectively are the six foot five kushite chief ukafa gold toothed his body painted for battle and the handsome silver armored aquilonian lucius
thats the last of their guard towers
all this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians
this lowly tribe of barbarians have buried every warrior ever to set foot on this land lucius
khalar singh a warlord atop a black horse rides through the fog shrouded trees
he bears a nomadic visage with tanned skin and almond shaped eyes
while his voice is calm his eyes burn with malice
that is only because they have never faced my legion
khalar regards lucius with amusement
then show us
but should you fail remember the plan
lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to khalar singh
corin walks out of the forge looking around for conan
various other cimmerians go about the daily routine but conan is nowhere to be seen
corin looks to the ridge above the village noticing a thick fog creeping in
the fog curls and eddies something is out there
suddenly lucius and his legion of silver armored warriors burst out of the fog attacking with speed and strength
but the cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed
in seconds they are armed and they counter the charge with a furious charge of their own
sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash into each other
and the battle devolves into one on ones where the barbarians have the upper hand
uran and corin lead the main push of battle frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords extending their reach advantage over the aquilonians shorter weapons
and quickly the aquilonians numbers are cut in half
corin squares off against lucius himself
lucius is sweating
it wasnt supposed to be this hard
as a unit the aquilonians race back into the woods
in seconds the cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit
hold your ground
but its too late nearly half the cimmerian warriors are gone on the chase
lucius and the aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face
nowhere left to run
they turn to see the cimmerians gathering in front of them
death is in the air invaders
can you taste it
i savor it
uran notices something is wrong
his eyes go skyward
atop the cliff stand cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers bows at the ready with flaming arrows
they let the arrows fly streaking balls of flame heading right for the cimmerians
but they do not hit them
they hit the tree trunks beside them
and for a moment the cimmerians look relieved until they notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows
the flames lick at the substance kaboom
the forest erupts into flames as the cimmerian warriors are burned alive
conan spins started by the sound of the explosion
he sees flames rising above the treetops beyond
he races back home
corin sees the flames in the distance as well
suddenly ukafa and his kushite warriors erupt out of the forest
armed with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining cimmerians savage against savage
but the kushites are not alone
from behind the cimmerians comes akhun a massive four hundred pounds of flesh wearing loops of chains like armor leads his turbaned turanian horsemen into the village
the cimmerian women arm themselves but the horsemen attack with nine tailed whips pulling their swords from their hands and dragging them to the ground
the horsemen quickly gather up the women while ukafa and his men keep the cimmerian warriors all too occupied
conan rushes through a river now tinged red with blood and reaches the far end of the village
huts burn women are chained only a handful of cimmerians still stand
lucius and his aquilonian mercenaries are helping the spearmen slay the wounded
conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest aquilonian and runs him through
a zingaran spots him and rushes him with his spear
conan readies himself for the
when the zingaran loses his head lopped off by corins blade
corin sporting a deep gash to his abdomen pulls a reluctant conan from the battle back toward the forge
the flames of the forge still burn as corin pushes conan into the room
he bolts the door behind him
do we need more weapons
corin drops his sword then struggles to lift a heavy grating in the dirt floor
beneath it a trough of cooling water leads under the hut and away from the village
there is a hunting lodge in the north pass with provisions
i will fight
corin grabs conan by his tunic pulling him up to his face
corins eyes are half crazed
this fight is over but yours has just begun
you wanted to be a warrior of the tribe conan now you must be its last
father i am not afraid to die
make your death have purpose
something slams at the door
it does not budge
again a shadow appears under the door sliding into the forge and materializing into the form of remo
remo quickly slides away the bolt
in rush enter lucius and ukafa
corin and conan face their attackers fighting in close quarters
lucius rushes at conan only for conan to duck under his attack and throw him in the fiery forge
lucius screams in agony rising up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a crisp
corin fights ukafa to a standstill until remo emerges from the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his back
corin falls to his knees
lucius delivers a massive backhand sending conan flying backwards and demolishing one of the forges main support beams
half of the forge comes crashing down on top of conan pinning his bleeding form to the ground just a few feet from his fallen father
enraged lucius turns his anger to corin raising his sword to deliver the killing blow
i said i wanted a word with him
lucius stays his hand as khalar singh steps into the forge
beside him stands the pict who escaped from conan earlier grinning from ear to ear
khalar singh hands him a bag of gold
strange dialect their heads
you promised me their heads
all you wish once we are gone
the pict nods and heads off drawing his knife
khalar singh stares down at corin sizing him up
corin lifts up into a sitting position back to the forge
i take no pleasure in this day barbarian
your people are fierce warriors deserving of every story told of them
but now you must choose the story for yourself
i am khalar singh
my army is handpicked from the best hyboria
my second ukafa and his kushite horde
remo and his shadow scouts from the jungles of zingara
and countless others
they all had a day like this one
they all chose a way forward
into the forge walks cherin and akhun
the lieutenants stand behind corin eyeing corin with malice
corin catches a glimpse of conan buried but staring back at him unable to move
corin quickly turns away careful not to give his son away
what is it you want
i seek neither gold nor steel but flesh and blood
the last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years
royalty in cimmeria
each man is free here
but i seek a woman
khalar looks outside the door of the forge
the cimmerians women are being herded by the slavers
a queen in hiding
point her out and youll spare the lives of your own
perhaps even your wife
my wife was killed long ago by swine such as you
khalar nods understanding
then our stories began in the same place cimmerian
i too lost my wife to marauders
how many men in how many lands have suffered so
the only answer is power strength unfettered the kind of which can unite all hyboria under a single crown
that is the legacy i seek
will you join me
its a powerful convincing speech
but corin holds his tongue unmoved
then death will be your story
your men will die
and your women too when i am done with them
none will survive to carry your name forth and over time even your enemies will forget you ever were
you will be wiped from the pages of history
to his men take your blood but leave the kill
one by one the lieutenants beat and stab corin taking pleasure in his pain
conan struggles trying to move to yell to do anything other than lie there
but a huge timber lies upon his back pinning him to the ground
entering the wrecked forge is fariq the six year old son to khalar singh
he stares at corins bleeding form with the dispassion of a sociopath
khalar picks up the sword corin and conan had forged together the one corin took away
he admires it then hands it to his son
he keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for his son to lift alone
he instructs his son as if teaching him multiplication
before you lies our enemy
his tribe waits for him in the beyond
what would you do
i would cut out his eyes father so that he will not find them
so he will wander the afterlife forever
show me your strength fariq
without it you will never rule
with it you will never be forgotten
fariq drives the sword into corins eye
corin doesnt make a sound
once fariq has ripped out corins eyes khalar runs corin through
you have your desire
death has found you
corin spits out his last words also meant for conan
soon it comes for you
conan glimpses around the faces of khalar and his men each image seared into his memory as if ablaze
burn this place
it no longer exists
the forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches thrown onto its roof and inside its windows
khalar and the other watch as the building roars into flame
smoke fills the air
conan struggles still unable to move
he coughs dying
but then the fire collapses more of the forge and the falling beams shatter the one that pins conan to the ground
slowly painfully conan drags himself into the cooling trough that runs beneath the hut
conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning
the bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the landscape
until he hears a strange chopping conan spots the pict who is decapitating a dead cimmerian warrior adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed waist
the pict doesnt notice as conan slips up behind him then as the wide eyed pict dies conan takes the sword and cuts a notch into his arm
where there was once a single notch there are now five such notches on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another powerful looking arm
a raucous bar on the argossean waterfront
out the window we see a port lined with shemish galleys and junks from kush
the bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of those ships and those who desire to part them from their hard earned money zamoran thieves hyborean mercenaries and
most of them watch the arm wrestling match taking place at the back of the bar
a pair of city guards short swords sheathed at their sides enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the harried barkeep
hes back there
the barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers
whats this one done
whats he done
what hasnt he done
hes bedded six of my whores and finished off three casks of mead and he hasnt paid so much as a silver piece for it
so have your men deal with him
behind the bar six men each hold down two hulking men yelling in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped back into place
sounds like a real problem
too bad we have other places to be right now
the barkeep shakes his head knowing the routine
he slips a pair of silver pieces into the soldiers hand
just get that behemoth out of here
the two city guards make their way to the back of the bar
his back to them the drunken man theyre after struggles to pin his opponent cobras beneath each of their wrists ready to strike at the loser
a pair of voluptuous whores watch caressing the drunken mans sinewy back
the drunken man yells in fury as he slams the other mans hand down upon the cobra which immediately bites its prey
as the soldiers arrive the drunken victor throws his tankard of ale at the barkeep whos now back behind the bar
youll serve my friends and i your best barman or youll taste steel
time to leave northerner
the drunken man turns as the city guard puts a hand on his shoulder
the gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully built man broad shouldered with sun browned skin lined with battle scars
only the piercing blue eyes and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last saw
conan stands to his full height looming over the smaller city guards who instinctively take a step back
no my small friends
its time to die
now conan sways
the room spins
he falls on his face
whos first conan unconscious is dragged down the street by the two city guards
by the gods hes as heavy as a horse
even a dead horse smells better than this
the city guards drag conan into a broad prison yard
many of the inmates are shackled together hacking with picks at the rock walls on their work detail
those in no condition to break rock are left in their own filth to rot
some are even dead already the rats gnawing at the remains
the two city guards drag conan into the guardhouse where a lieutenant sits eating his dinner
the lieutenant doesnt even bother to look up from his meal
whats the charge
another damn hill ape who cant handle his liquor
is that so boy
how do you plead
conan yawns in response
one of the city guards slaps conan hard across the face
conan slowly opens his eyes
wheres the captain of the guard
screams of pain come from down the hall past a locked door
in the cells interrogating a prisoner
and youll get the same if you dont answer
youre accused of public drunkenness
how do you plead
in truth ive been guilty of much
jewels stolen from the crowns of kings mens heads split in battle for the price of a nights drink
but through that ive searched and waited and hunted my prey
suddenly conan shifts upright looking more sober than he did a moment ago
havent had a drop all night
the guards holding conan up by his arms suddenly find those arms wrapped around their heads
he breaks both their necks in an instant
the lieutenant is horrified
he goes for his sword
conan bats it out of his hand slamming his head against the back wall
the key to the cells
i dont have it
theres a guard inside the door
only he can open it
conan picks up the lieutenants sword
you cant kill me
hell only open the door for me
a flash of steel as conan delivers a blow
a guard sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door
behind him the captain of the guard beats a chained one eyed prisoner to a pulpy mess
theres a knock at the door
what is it
need to see the captain
the guard exhales frustrated
he stands up getting his keys out
opens the small eyehole to see into the other room
the lieutenant stares back at him
he opens the door only to see conan standing there holding the decapitated head of the lieutenant
the shocked guard goes for his sword
conan swings the lieutenants head smashing it into the guards jaw and putting him down for the count
thats when the captain of the guard turns around
and we recognize him
hes lucius the disfigured aquilionian who was one of khalar singhs lieutenants
from around a corner come five more guards drawing their weapons
lucius draws his as well
youve made a huge mistake ape
youll never make it out of this place
i came for you lucius
lucius nods to the guards who advance on conan
you talk as though you know me ape
and i am no ape
i am cimmerian
as recognition crosses lucius face conan springs into action
he kicks the table at the men sending the knives and other torture implements flying right into the first guard
the second guard tries leaping over the falling table
conan just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the iron bands of the prisoner cells
lucius lunges at conan conan steps in on him grabbing his sword hand
in a show of strength he twists lucius own sword until points down at the floor then thrusts it through lucius bellows in pain pinned to the spot
the next three guards rush forward forcing conan to deal with three weapons attacks at once
the first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around conans sword and he tries to yank it free from conans grip
instead conan pulls him in a wide circle sending him flying into a wall mounted torch
the guard burns like dry kindling
the second to strike hits conan on his sword hand carving a deep gash and causing him to drop his sword
conan turns to face him eyes filled with rage
the guards face goes pale
conan head butts him with all his might and the guard goes down bleeding from mouth nose and ears
however the last guard is upon conan before he can react
the powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift conan off his feet and back against the far wall pinned by the neck
conan struggles to breathe the polearm shaft driving his throat into the wall
the thickness of the cimmerians neck gives him time to reach into his bracer pulling out a hidden knife which he buries into the guardsmans eye
lucius screams in pain as conan pours water on the burning guard and lifts the table back onto its legs
then he pulls the sword out of the floor a thick plume of blood rising out of lucius now liberated foot
conan takes lucius face and smashes it against the table
lucius looks aghast as conan takes his injured hand and places it over the torch flame searing the wound closed
the cimmerian never even bats an eye
what do you want
who are you
conan turns his face to the burnt side
im the one who made you pretty
conan shows lucius the five scars running down his forearm
i am death
and i came a long way for you
conan lifts the sword
i can tell you where the rest are
the end of the earth
you kill me and youll never find them
who are you offering
who do you think
all of them
ukafa remo cheren akhun and khalar singh himself
but you have to swear you wont kill me
conan thinks about it
you have my word
you tell me where i will find khalar singh and i will not kill you
conan lets lucius go
lucius hobbles to his chair
he is in a city called on the edge of the eastern sea
on the edge of hyboria
conan looks him in his eyes sizing him up
he likes what he sees
in a flash conan grabs lucius head again yanking it back exposing his throat
you gave your word
conan rips a small key from a large keyring
he drops it in lucius throat
the big man chokes instantly
a second later conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well
lucius swallows the key gasping for breath as conan releases him
what are you doing
toasting to our deal
conan swings his sword and cuts the one eyed prisoner from the wall
you are free
one eye looks at his wrists and ankles still hobbled by shackles
i wont get far like this
conan hands him a fallen guardsmens sword
the key to your shackles sits in the captains gut
the one eyed prisoner grins with malice
as he closes in on the terrified lucius conan heads for the door
i had your word
you said you would spare my life
i said i wouldnt kill you
we hear lucius screams of pain as conan walks out into the night cutting another notch into his arm
khalar singh looks older
he squints as he stares into a howling sandstorm
ukafa trudges through the deep sand to reach him
the sandstorm is so blinding we dont see him until he is less than five feet away
khalar singh weve lost half our cavalry legion and still fariq presses on
we must turn back
he says the queen is here
he leads us in circles
he knows nothing of leading an army take care ukafa
you hold a special place in my kingdom but blood you are not
my apologies khalar singh
i am simply concerned for your army
and i would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the queen
and in that respect fariq has my confidence
he knows more of the legends of acheron than anyone
suddenly two forms race at them from the blinding sand
remo and fariq
no longer a child fariq is now a man in his twenties but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is
his frame is slight his eyes beady
father they are here
the hidden oasis just as it was written
khalar singh looks to remo for confirmation
the misshapen and shadowy remo nods
remo and fariq lead khalar and ukafa into a natural tunnel carved out of rock
inside the sandstorm no longer rages
and on the other side of the tunnel a protected rock oasis heavy vegetation crawling up the encircling cliff walls herds of sheep grazing on fields of grass
at its far end beyond a deep blue pond lies a greek influenced monastery and several tiled roof mud brick houses
and moving between the pools are men and women going about their simple chores
they wear long flowing white linen robes and turbans
the air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of the oasis
but beyond it the sandstorm rages all around sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air swirling around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
hurricane protected by an unseen force
a row of robed young women kneel in front of one of the reflecting pools quietly reading from prayer books and softly striking their right breast with a left hands
wrapped in thorns
one girl ilira mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl next to her with her thorn
the girl tamara squeals in pain angry her prayer was interrupted
ilira is the fun loving dilettante of the relationship
tamara the studious good girl
im trying to pray
then hit yourself
tamara hits ilira back with her thorn
ilira squeals then hits a grinning tamara back
tamara grabs her but as they is that how one shows penitence
both girls instantly stop as fassir appears behind them
fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery
he shakes his head both out of fondness and disappointment
i expect more from a queen
im sorry fassir
i just tire of saying the same prayer every day
then you should be able to translate it from its original acheronian
iliras face scrunches unsure
tamara steps in to help ilira save face
of course she can
she even taught it to me
never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world
never again will innocents suffer for others power
never again will the queen suffer so acheron may rise
very good tamara
you must have taught her very well indeed ilira
a smile on fassirs face confirms he knows the truth
suddenly the monasterys bell rings out
a moment later a temple explodes in flames
pouring out from the swirling sands come khalar singhs army
cheren and his archers stand atop khalars a massive siege engine atop which cheren and his archers fire flaming arrows
the arrows arc down and explode as they impact the tiled roofs
sitting at the highest point of the man of war khalar singh likes what he sees
the monks scatter in every direction but wherever they turn more troops burst out of the swirling sand
a small handful of armed monks display acrobatic martial arts prowess as they battle with khalars heavily armed forces but they are vastly outnumbered
fassir grabs tamara
the queen must not be captured
take her out the north gate
tamara grabs ilira and pulls her through the flaming battleground
zingaran warriors cut down the monks while turanian horsemen concentrate on the women
we cant leave them
if you are caught everything we live for is lost
a whip encircles iliras waist
a massive turanian pulls her to him
tamara grabs the whip pulling ilira the other way
but she is no match for the huge slaver
he yanks on the whip pulling both of them to him
only then does he notice tamaras unsheathed knife which she plunges into his throat
she frees ilira and they run
a thin alleyway at the rear of the monastery leading away from the din of battle towards a rear gate of the oasis
tamara and ilira run for the gate only for the shadows of the alleyway to move and shift remo and three of his shadow scouts
they advance on the women drawing dark shortswords
khalar needs them alive
good to know
tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife but when she strikes she hits nothing but shadow
it reforms behind her and grabs her
another grabs ilira
tamara launches her body into the air executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout
a quick knife strike and he goes down
and with one continuous motion she vaults over the shadow scout holding tamara cutting his throat as well
remo and the remaining scout give chase blending in and out of shadows
but each time they strike tamara defends ilira
they near the far end of the alleyway the north gate looming ahead with the desert beyond
remo blends into another shadow remo materializes out of a shadow atop the man of war next to cheren the archer
the north gate
cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at the end of the passage
they fire a volley of fiery arrows
tamara and ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead when the flaming arrows land before them
well die if we stay
she locks eyes with ilira who nods
together they run right for the arrows
but at the last minute ilira falters
she falls to the ground
tamara turns to see ilira lying in the gateway a moment too late
the arrows explode causing a cave in that closes the gateway
tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her
she looks back only to see that ilira didnt make it
khalar singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north tunnel
there one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm
who was guarding that gate
it was i lord
take four legions
before i hunt you
tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland the plumes of the oasis sandstorm now off in the distance behind her
the sun mercilessly beats down upon her face her lips are already chapped
she falls to her knees unable to go on
she looks up as the heat streams off the desert floor creating a swirling mirage
through which the silhouette of a rider appears followed by others
the horse drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron bars and behind the bars are a bevy of young women mostly looking worse for wear
the head slaver rides ahead and walks up to the heap of white cloth that is tamara
water please he lifts her barely conscious head eyeing her features a greasy paw examining her body
the gods are good
to the other slavers chain this one in my cage
shell be the prize of the auction in khor kalba
the man of war dominates the center of the oasis its torches illuminating the scene before it
akhun and the turanians hold chains connected to the twenty women monks kneeling with their wrists chained to their neck collars
in front of them kneels fassir beaten and bloodied
khalar singh fariq and ukafa step down from the man of war
fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings on it
all these years searching the ends of the earth
and here you are
just a two day ride from khor kalba
i can scarcely believe it
in acheronian to monks say nothing
maybe he doesnt know who we are
maybe hes not looking for the queen
several of the women look up at him shocked
thats right my brethren you have been lied to all your lives
told you must hide yourselves told you were alone
i want you to look at me and see me for what i am
i have come not to hurt you but liberate you
you come for your own dark purposes to raise acheron
i come to resurrect the greatest empire hyboria has ever known
an empire of evil soaked in blood sacrifice and the blackest of magic
khalar singh becomes infuriated eyes blazing
have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see
blood magic death it is everywhere
acheron is no different than any other kingdom but for its glory
and in place of that glory you offer shame
i knew shame but that was before i was shown my true lineage
khalar draws closer to the women looking them each in the eye
when i was but a child raiders destroyed my village cut our fathers to ribbons and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods
those few who survived we ran for our lives chased into caves at the edge of the eastern sea left with nothing to live for
but then we discovered it
the temple that spawned an empire
we learned that we were not broken goat herders on a desolate coastline
we were the sons and daughters of kings
stares in iliras eyes and queens
he motions to fariq who brings the iron box forward
for thirty years i have searched for you
in that time i built both an army and empire but they are nothing compared to what we can create together
we can raise acheron again
never again will we hide like rats
never again will we watch as our loved ones are slaughtered
i call forth the queen
stand and join me and this day will have a joyous end
no one moves
you would have all the world suffer as you have suffered
we will die before we help you
he nods to his son
he paces in front of the female monks the box in front of them
the caves beneath khor khalba contain all manner of creature many altered by centuries of blood magic
but one in particular has developed a special connection to the blood
it is said that only the queen of acheron itself can resist its embrace
he stops one woman away from ilira
so what say you
will you be the lucky one or will you tell me who is
a tear falls down her face but she stays silent
theres the sound of slithering as fariq opens the box
she stares down inside the box she awakens to the screaming of a whipped slave girl
tamaras eyes are met by a dozen others slaves of every color chained together with her in a caged wagon
the slave trader swings his whip twice more hitting the cowering women in the cage
wake up slags
a new owner approaches
tamara makes eye contact with the slave trader
let me go
i promise youll be rewarded
the trader just laughs leering at her
and i would sample that reward fair one but you wear white
tell me have the stars aligned and delivered a virgin slave into my care
he eyes her lasciviously
tamara turns away and does not answer
ill know soon enough
good day sir
a lone rider in a desolate land
the perfect customer for what i sell
rides out of the sun his massive form silhouetted by the bright desert sky
he stares at the slave wagons
your gold can free me from this hole
i can bring you the slave trader immediately whips her incensed
the slaver goes to whip her again but before the blow can fall conan grabs his arm
the slave trader looks furious but conans size holds him back
this is the road to khor kalba
past the great wall
the slaver nods to the east and conan releases his arm
the slaver continues whipping the slave
conan just rides on not his problem
but as conan passes tamara for a brief moment their eyes meet
something about her
conan stares a moment then spurs his horse on
just then the ground around them rumbles
horses rear the women scream
conan turns and looks up
his eyes go wide
coming thundering down the hills on all sides
the slavers see them a moment to late
several of the horses and carts are smashed by the rolling boulders
conan kicks his horse trying to outrace the boulders
but when the wagon next to him is hit its axle spears his horse in its side and conan goes down
pissed he draws his sword
the slavers scramble around the broken wagons in chaos
only a pair of wagons still stands
one of them holds tamara
use your whips on the horses legs
the slavers are confused
then they notice racing down the hill behind the boulders
as the riders bear down upon the slavers the slavers do as theyre told entangling the legs of the first wave of horses throwing their riders
more than a few riders snap their necks as theyre driven into the desert floor
the remainder fight hand to hand and are cut down by either conans blade or the slavers tulwars
but their victory is short lived as a second wave of riders comes thundering towards them before the slavers can re establish their perimeter
the riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand
conan lodges his sword in a still rolling boulder
as it rolls it pulls him up on top of it
from this height conan launches himself down at the horsemen below
he knocks a rider off his horse conan landing square in the saddle
he kicks the horse straight at the other riders
they dont see him coming until its too late
he cuts them down where they sit
the last remaining caravan driver whips his horse team trying to pull his wagon out of the fight
conan spins to see a flash of steel and the riders neck plumes in blood as hes decapitated
which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the wagon
the explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver morphs into remo the spindly shadow scout
he takes the reins stopping the wagon
conan spots him recognition in his eyes
theres a scream
conan turns to see the other two shadow scouts already hacking their way through the slaves on one of the caged wagons
a shadow scout gets to tamara only to have her fight back
tamara kicks the first scout in the face slamming his head into the bars
however the second one clubs her unconscious from behind
leaps from his horse launching his body at remo
remo dives and rolls away
small and misshapen he is nonetheless very fast
conan strikes again
again remo dodges out of the way
the shadow scouts draw swords but remo waves them off speaking in the broken language of a savage
bring her to khalar
conan launches an all out attack
remo leaps over his sword and vaults conan landing on his back
he draws his sword preparing to cut conans throat when conan hurls his body backwards into one of the huge rolling boulders
the impact crushes remo and he loses his grip
conan spins to strike again only to see remo melt into the conan turns his attention towards the other two shadow scouts as they drag the unconscious tamara away
conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards the scouts
they see him coming and let go of tamara
they dazed she struggles to her feet
conan appears beside her his dagger out
tamara gasps in fear but conan only reaches out and breaks the lock on her chains
who are you
i am nobody
he cuts the bonds on her feet
tamara rises up the battle scene revealed to her
dead bodies of the slavers and turanian horsemen lie sprawled in every direction
tamara takes in the gruesome sight shocked
many died to capture nobody
motions to his horse get up
and if i dont wish to ride with you
conan rides his horse tamara trailing on foot wrists tethered to conans saddle by a long rope
tamara looks exhausted
they reach a gallery of broken columns spires of fossilized coral that juts out of the desert
i want water
conan just keeps riding
perhaps the slavers took your orders
i never knew men could be so cruel
now i wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you
you speak of animals as if they were less than men
but animals dont stab their brothers in the back or steal their mothers only possession
and they never lie
i havent lied
conan get off his horse unties tamara and gives her a water sack
tamara greedily drinks down the water
give me your name
i am tamara amelia karushan
i am conan
what more names do i need
conan then grabs tamara around her waist putting her atop his horse
he then mounts behind her their bodies close
conans mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks
there is only one truth i need from you tamara amelia karushan
why does khalar singh want you
tamara looks away but doesnt respond
then lets hope its for your cooking
a campfire amidst several large boulders a line of windmills on the horizon
tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze
conan comes over and smells the pot his face scrunches from the odor
trying to poison me
tamara steps back and gets down on her knees her hands clasped
what are you doing
before we eat i must pray
what would you pray for
that a bone may not get stuck in your throat
no words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you
then you have no faith
and i am sorry for you
i need no pity
but you do
you live in a world that is harsh and short
where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke
i live in a world with a purpose that guides me where faith sustains me
suddenly conan kicks dirt past tamara onto the fire
the fire goes out plunging everything into darkness
why did you suddenly theres the sound of fighting
grunting blows being interchanged then a loud snap as bones are broken
a moment later the flames of the fire are stoked up again revealing conan standing over the groaning remo
the other two shadow scouts are dead
tamara instinctively jumps back
his back is broken
he wont be slinking away this time
as tamara gapes at remo conan simply pulls the cooking pot off the fire
now lets eat
but what about him
remo groans in pain
i enjoy a little music with my meal
across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into steep and unforgiving mountains
far off we hear a pair of thunderous booms almost like the sound of a heartbeat
cresting over a set of peaks a gorge is revealed below and a city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous gorge
hundred foot towers rise up their pinnacles crafted to depict angry god like faces
as we pass one of the faces again we hear the sound of a thunderous heartbeat now closer
we glide down past hundred foot high pillars of flames towards the growing sounds of screaming and wailing
the streets of acheron are lined with thousands of slaves young and old chained together toiling under the lash of their cruel masters the towering over the slaves the warriors
are a fearsome sight
their armor crafted from the bones of their defeated enemies rises to a mask which covers much of their features
only the red irises of their eyes peer through
that and their pitch black skin
the slaves hobble down the main boulevard their naked feet splashing in streams of blood which flow from the up ahead looms a colossal pyramid surrounded in a semi circle
by five massive statues
as we grow closer the grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer one hewn from cracked bone and empty sockets
the thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now
thump the three hundred foot high edifice is made entirely of thousands of human skulls
many of the skulls still drip with blood pouring down from the pyramids crest where stands images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are carved in bas relief into
the thrones surface
standing before the throne surrounded by black robed priests are a man and woman mere shadows in the silhouette of torches
the head priest and his acolyte approach with two crowns
one is made of gold the other of iron
the gold crown goes on the head of the man
for the woman the iron crown is placed on her head
and suddenly thump thump
iron spikes shoot out of the iron blood streams down the womans face as she turns toward the torchlight
tamara leaps up startled
her face is covered in sweat her eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream
nearby we hear screaming of another type
we pull out of remos wide mouth stuffed with cloth trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony
a hand comes in and pulls out the cloth
you are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it
your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are
we pull out revealing that remo arms are spread eagle attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs
conan nudges him with the point of his sword
remo screams in agony then speaks in his savage broken dialect
i know how make you rich
you hear name khalar singh
you have what he want
the girl yes
khalar give you anything for her
why would he
remo pauses not wanting to answer
conan put the blade back to remos neck
she could be the one
conans mind races remembering khalars words from long ago
a queen in hiding
i sent to find her
he wait for me now at great wall
he pay you anything
so i should ransom her to your master
not exactly loyal but still a good idea
conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from remos tunic
youll help me deliver it
torchlight dots the heights of a fifty foot high stone wall erected between giant rock formations an impassable barrier that runs countless miles
the wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before the wall
an aging catapult looks down upon the wall below
slowly it begins to turn
conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the great wall
we hear muffled screams and find remo tied to a boulder cradled in the catapult
conan pulls the gag out of remos mouth
i help you
i do anything you wish
conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth
he takes out his sword and cuts another notch into his arm
he then cuts the rope and whoosh
the catapult fires tossing remo and the rock hes tied to high into the night sky
patrolling soldiers are crushed beneath the massive rock as it reduces a section of wall to rubble
stares down at remos broken body
ukafa and fariq stand beside him
he brought a message
ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment
khalar reads it
gold for the girl
a ransom for me to deliver in person
ill find them and come back with their heads
you let the girl escape once ukafa
what makes you think you can do better now
i did what
i found the monastery
it was my understanding that you were in charge of its capture ukafas anger grows
we will take no chances
we will pay this thief what he wants and more
conan returns from the nearby hills carrying a pair of rabbits hes hunted and skinned
he looks around surprised not to find tamara
he hears a yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the clearing
shes tied up and gagged and shes wormed her way this far muddying and scraping herself all along the way
she lets out a frustrated grunt as conan simply picks her back up and carries her back to the outcropping
he pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at her feet
tamara squirms away from the carcass disgusted
couldnt you at least cook it first
fire draws attention
conan tears into his rabbit chewing on the raw meat
does it bother you blood on your hands
the only blood on these hands i claimed with my own sword
what does that mean
clean hands mean nothing
kings and queens claim more lives than i will ever meet and not a drop is spilled in their presence
what are you talking about
ive done no harm to you
ive done no harm to anyone
conan confronts her enraged
you are the very reason my people are dead
are you mad
i never met your people
but khalar singh has
he destroyed my people looking for you
suddenly tamara understands
the one who came for us
his name is khalar singh
you know this
we did not know who sought us only that we were sought
you hid from him
and while you did others died in your place
if we did not hide countless more would have been killed
you do not know what purpose he has for our queen
and i do not care for he will not live to see it bear fruit
tamara is shocked
wait you seek to kill this khalar
we have the same aim
he takes my queen to khor kalba
i have sworn an oath to protect her
i can help you
conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands
conan watches the great wall silently absently playing with a dagger in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along the wall
the barrels of oil
he feels eyes upon him and looks down at tamara still bound and gagged her eyes burning holes in his forehead
conan pulls out her gag
you will keep quiet
what use is talking
you wont believe a word i speak
i only want to know this how will you kill khalar
you are too big to play the assassin
you will be the lure that will draw me close
then i will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands
and the archers and cavalry
they will be napping
they will not be a problem
tamara thinks about it
not good enough
conan is shocked by her brazen response
did i ask
should you fail ill be left without a weapon helpless in my enemies hands
let me help conan
conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth
i will not fail
but still tamara glares at him and we can see the hint of conans resolve bending
khalar singh stands atop the wall awaiting conan
fariq draws close
let me take care of this thief father
hes beneath your notice
he killed remo likely his cavalry legion as well
whatever he is he is more than a mere thief
then off in the distance at the far edge of the desert clearing two figures step out from amongst the boulders
conan holds a squirming but bound tamara
conan thrusts tamara in khalars direction
yelling to khalar i have what you want
wheres my gold
khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins
triple your price
come and claim it
the gates open and khalar strides out into the clearing
stand a hundred feet ahead
send her to me
send the gold
khalar singh throws the gold sack
it lands halfway between them
he sends tamara ahead her mouth gagged
but the moment tamara reaches the gold from out underneath the sand four horsemen rise up out of the desert floor
they each bear weighted nets and spiked lances and they surround conan
the first rider gallops towards conan who simply lops off the horses front legs
as the beast collapses conan crushes the riders skull with his broadsword
the next two riders attack together but conan dodges their nets and rips away one of their spears only to lodge it into the other riders chest
he dives at and tackles the first rider toppling him along with his horse
he snaps the second riders neck
the last rider comes at conan who horizontally slashes right through the horses neck and then the riders neck
both human and animal head tumble to the desert floor
all four riders are dead in a matter of seconds
hes got tamara by the neck
but are you fast enough
conans eyes go to the top of the wall where cheren and his archer prepare to fire
conan rushes forward as the flaming arrows stream toward him
explosions rip through the air where conan was throwing up a huge dust cloud
conan bursts out of the dust cloud lunging in an attack
but khalar singh is not there
he has withdrawn inside the gates
baring his teeth conan runs at the wall itself
cheren and the archers let loose another volley at conan who evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword
explosions fill the air but none of them scorch conan as he conan hits the base of the wall at full stride like a mountain lion
reaching out he launches himself up taking half the vertical of the wall in a single leap
digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams he stops only to vault up again taking the forty foot wall in two upward bounds
conan leaps upon wall walk the passageway atop the great wall
tries to hide his surprise
even as he draws his sword conan takes out the four soldiers in his way
you should have run while you could
conan looks at the sword
it strikes a chord in him
it is the sword his father forged
enraged conan charges the slight fariq
fariq partially parries the attack
hes obviously well trained but hes no match for conan
the tip of conan blade cuts a large gash in fariqs cheek
khalar singh arrives grabbing his son by his collar and flinging him away from the barbarian
fariq struggles to stand trying in vain to hide his embarrassment
conan and khalar singh size each other up on the narrow wall walk
i was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering
i wasnt cowering
i was studying
youre quite gifted with a sword but its not from schooling
your speed and power makes up for a lack of finesse
ive seen such fighting before cimmerian
enraged conan charges khalar singh
he swings down on khalar singhs head only when the sword reaches it it finds nothing but air
khalar is fast
cimmerian it is
now it makes sense
you came for blood not gold
conan responds by lunging in swinging his broadsword in a broad arc with all his might
even in the small space khalars lateral speed is dizzying
he sidesteps conans attack and backhands conans face with the flat of his tulwar
conans resolve wavers momentarily knowing khalar could have just as easily sliced his throat
your people barely afforded me a challenge
youre little more than beasts
conan comes at khalar with twice as much fury smashing entire posts as he hacks at the warlord who simply evades the attack
down the wall walk they move conan attacking while khalar seems complacent enough just to defend
youve come a long way barbarian only to fail
khalar ducks conans last wild swing and gashes conan twice both deeply in his midsection
khalar then kicks conan sending the cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet
conan lands directly on his back his sword clattering away from him
khalars men back away into a circle
conan struggles to get on all fours
khalar kicks conan in his shattered chest lifting conan off the ground with his might
he follows up with a devastating punch to conans face one which lands like a piledriver
conan can only bleed as khalar looms over him
so much for vengeance
to his soldiers get me oil and a torch
soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch
is that really the best you could do
is that as far as you could think ahead
just rush in and kill me
behind khalar singh conan spots tamara being brought up her hands bound
her eyes show an intense fear but resolve as well
between the bonds she slips down a blade
its conans dagger
she quickly cuts her bonds
with all the attention focused on conan no one is quick enough to stop her as grabs the torch from the soldier cheren spins around sees the flames reaching his
but its far too late
tamara hits the floor beside conan
the blast sends parts of cheren flying in every direction
ukafa fariq and the wall guards are flattened by the concussion
khalar singh who was standing closer to the explosion is the warlord slowly rises his head pounding from the explosion
he looks up
the entire parapet is on fire
he grits his teeth and climbs the wall
a thick wall of flame rages before khalar
conan and tamara are gone
he looks over the far side of the wall where two figures on horseback ride off into the distance tamara holding conan atop the horse
ukafa and fariq rise and see what khalar singh sees
ukafa you will take half our forces north to the sea
i will take the rest south
what of me father
you will return to khor kalba
you will feed the women to the beast until you find our queen
i will not
i will track the barbarian with you enraged khalar singh grabs him by the back of his head pulling him in close
you think i care what you wish
you want to play warrior
it is not in you
one day you will be king but warlord never
let me prove it to you
you will not risk your life again
you are my line my successor
you will not throw away all that i have worked for
a smile creeps up on ukafas face watching fariqs embarrassment
he withdraws hastily all eyes on him
without looking at ukafa if i find you smiling before you bring me the girl i will take every tooth i see
ukafa buries the smile as khalar turns to the wall of flames left in conans wake
the flames become the blaze of the forge
more wood boy
we must test the steel with our fire
conan a young boy again kneels beside the woodpile pulling
but when he hands them to his father he notices his father is covered with sword wounds cut and bleeding
what are you waiting for
the fire is dying
conan turns back to the wood pile
instead of wood the pile is full of the bodies of those he recently killed lucius remo etc
the young conan struggles to push the first body onto the forge
still the fire diminishes
conan turns and there is no more wood
and no more bodies
its not enough
ive failed you father
it will never be enough conan
i dont understand he spins
behind him tamara stands a look of sadness on her face
through suffering you will learn your purpose boy
and you have not begun to suffer yet
conans eyes pop open
he inhales sharply gripped by the dream
the room is dark surrounded by thick draperies
conan lies on a straw bed with white sheets soaked through with his sweat
he looks to his wounds all bandaged
he rises a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed
i wouldnt move so fast
i bound your wounds as best i could but im no healer
conan looks over to discover tamara sitting nearby
where am i
on the wasp
you told me where it laid just before you passed out
though i cant say as i feel much safer here
conans response is to rise again his face contorting in pain
dont embarrass me with thanks i only saved your life
you were adequate
conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround his bed
behind it lies a staircase which he ascends
conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty foot djunk traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river
look what we have here
a hill ape in over his head
conan spins to see the rough brightly dressed zamoran pirate artus leaping down from the quarterdeck his sword out
the other zamoran pirates draw near as well
tamara sees the scene suddenly uncomfortable
i was just wondering what that smell was
sniffs near artus now i know
we take no stowaways
only paying passengers
youve best be laden with gold
if its metal you seek perhaps youd settle for steel
in a flash conans sword lunges forward
it meets artuss sparking as they collide
still fast artus
fast deadly charming rakishly handsome
to the pirates all hail conan
all hail conan
artus slaps his hand on conans back and conan winces in pain
looks like youve had a rough road
it wont get easier
khalar singh lives
hell be coming for me and the girl
were scrapping for a fight these days
this one may be more than you wish
i need you to get me close to khor kalba
artus rubs his beard
well get you there
conan withdraws to his room
conan collapses on the bed as tamara follows him inside
we go to khor kalba
conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes
just leave me to sleep
but tamara doesnt leave forcing conan to respond
you would risk your life for royalty
tamara pauses realizing she must trust conan to gain his help
because she represent freedom not just ours but all hyborias
what do you know of acheron
a tall tale
meant to scare children
it is no fable
its my peoples history
acheron was an empire that swallowed all of hyboria led by the king and his legion of demon warriors
but still it had one weakness
for the true power of acheron laid not with its king but the queen
every twenty years a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron
spikes would pierce her slowly drain her precious blood and through her suffering acheron would remain invincible
until one of my ancestors an acheronian himself put a stop to this tyranny
he and others spirited the new queen away hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again
what care i for queens and empires
conan turns to head back to his bed
tamara grabs him incensed
didnt you hear me
this evil faces us all
all of civilization will fall if the army of acheron is raised again
only i would happily put all of your civilization to the torch myself
but you owe me a debt you thankless oaf
my only debt is to my people
and it still lies unpaid
the enormous siege vessel lies before a burning port city
a sailor crying grovels on his knees before khalar and his men
it was a pirate ship
they left as soon as the girl and the large one boarded
which way did they sail
khalar is surprised
are you certain
yes please im telling you the truth
khalar nods to one of his men who slits the sailors throat
khalar turns to his falconer with the huge bird of prey on his arm
send word to ukafa
they come to him by sea
the falconer nods and heads off
khalar looks to his soldiers
find me a warship
the ship sails like a ghost over black water the stars lit up impossibly bright
artus finds tamara sitting near the bow
he hands her a steaming bowl of food
try not to taste it going down would be my advice
youve known conan long
we sailed with him for a while
i would like to say i know the man
he is a riddle to me
aye hes that too
we have the same goal
why will he not trust me
why would he
hes a stranger in every land he trods
a man with no home no people none but the company of ghosts
and he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day
that is no way to live
he doesnt live
ive seen in him great mirth only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy
he owes a blood debt and he can entertain no other joy no other cause until it is fulfilled
and yet you call him friend and risk death to help him
let me tell you something of conan
he will never lie
he will never break a trust once given
and he will never ever give up
hes a stubborn ass
he is that lass
he is that
akhun and his turanian slavers lead the female monks into a large circular chamber lit by many torches
before them lies a pit dark and foreboding with a bamboo grid placed atop it
fariq enters an aide holding the iron box he used earlier
fariq has a bandage on his face where conan struck him and he looks even more angry and malevolent than before
here we stand again
will the queen reveal herself or must another innocent suffer
fariq walks past the row of women each recoiling
he slaps one
then another his rage only building
my father he tires of your charade
he grows impatient
but i have no such haste
i enjoy watching you squirm
fariq passes ilira slowing his pace
he closes in on the youngest female monk a true innocent with terrified eyes
perhaps youd like to see the end your sisters faced back at the monastery
fariq slowly opens the box before her
in the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque tentacle
the tentacle is severed but still alive thirsting for blood
terrified as she is the young monk says nothing
fariq closes the box
your fear is not enough yet
lets try harder
fariq nods to the slavers who unchain her from the rest
ive read all there is to know of mighty acheron
why would true acheronians protect a traitor to their own
you once held the entire world in your grasp now you hide and cower like pitiful mice
he pushes the girl
she falls to the grid the sound echoing down into the pit
an inhuman growl emits from the darkness
the girl looks below
and mice are meant to be swallowed whole
suddenly a massive tentacle ten times the size of the one in the box comes hurtling up through the grid
it grabs the young monk its barbs ripping into her dragging her into the darkness below
her screams echo
what was in the box could only drink from you one at a time
but the beast of acheron it will claim four of you this night
who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen
not a single woman moves resolved
ilira catches herself but also stays silent
she looks up to see fariq staring at her
her pupils widen in fear as fariqs cold stare bores into her
i am here swine
fariq turns only it is another female monk that glares at him
i am the one you seek
but of course you wouldnt expect me to take your word would you
as the fariq reaches for her tamara awakens with a scream her body resting against the curved hull of the ship
tamara looks around with a panicked look until she realizes where she is
i hope i awoke with less clamor
their roles reversed now it is tamaras turn to see conan sitting nearby drinking from a flask of mead
you were near death this time yesterday
is there a better reason to drink
tamara actually manages to laugh
do you think i could try some of that
im curious of its taste
youve never tasted mead
tamara shrugs embarrassed
conan hands her flask
she takes a deep swallow some spilling out over her cheeks
but she doesnt cough and smiles brightly afterwards
conan reaches for the flask but tamara ignores him taking another swig
it quickly loosens her tongue
let me ask you something
once youve killed khalar and claimed your vengeance then what
you will be free from your ghosts
what of your future conan
i have no future
it died with my people as i should have
so your life is penance
for what for living
and when you too die what do you believe happens then
conan just shrugs taking back the mead
tamara her tongue loosened by drink laughs
i couldnt live without some kind of belief in the world after this
i believe in the cold of steel the warmth of flesh
all else is fairy tales
but i still die with faith in my heart belief in something greater than ones self
what will you die with
i die with purpose
tamara steps out onto the deck grabbing her pounding head
her first hangover
she hears a thumping sound followed by another and walks towards the side of the deck
tamara looks overboard to the water below
the river is filled with bodies
bloated they float in blood red water as flies buzz around them
one of them hits the hull of the boat
tamara blinks unsure if the vision is real but then shes joined by other pirates who gape at the bodies below
tamara turns and up ahead spies the larger warship cuts through the water manned by a legion of rowers
on the deck of the warship ukafa and his spearmen stand
the sailors get the most out of the billowing black sails
the ship gains fast
conan exits his room sees the danger
artus appears at his side
what do you think
they have us outnumbered but we might beat their speed
that is what they wish
they drive us to another force approaching from the south
then we fight
we give them what they think they want
to the pirates about ship
the pirates leap into action tacking and turning the galley with great speed and efficiency
ukafa smiles his gold teeth shining
the ships captain stands beside him
theyre turning to run
we only need stay close
is turned around now fleeing
archers from the warship fire arrows that barely reach the galley
the pirates dodge the few that land on deck
tamara reaches conan and artus
shes worried to say the least
let us show them why she is called the wasp
he was hoping conan would say that
why is she called the wasp
load the stinger
the pirates rush to the back of the ship
the captain stares ahead confused
they are doing something
sure enough the stern of the ship begins to part revealing mounted with a barbed harpoon fifteen feet long
they fire the weapon
the harpoon races for the bow of the warship a thick rope trailing it
it smashes into the wood ripping through it like it was paper
rip her apart
the pirates grab the heavy rope and run pulling the rope and the harpoon back towards the wasp
as its pulled out the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole in the warship
the captain and crew are in a panic
men rush to patch the gaping hole in the hull
were taking on water
hard to port
let them fire again
we will sink
ukafa guts the captain with his spear
so be it
to his spearmen get below
the pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second time
it fires smashing again into the wooden hull of the warship
the harpoon lodges deep inside the hull where ukafa and his spearmen wait
they rush forward and grab onto the harpoon
bring her back
again the pirates pull the harpoon back out
it falls into the water as they pull on the rope tied to it
they do not notice ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the very same rope as its pulled toward the galley
artus looks at the warship
its foundering and sinking quickly
shes dead in the water
a cheer goes up among the pirates and then one pirate takes a spear through the chest
all eyes turn to the side of the wasp where ukafa and his men climb aboard
conans eyes alight with fury
i was growing weary with boredom
conan motions to a pair of pirates
hide her below
the spearmen rush to the attack
the pirates spring to the defense of the ship countering the spearmen with cutlass and dagger
ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages
find the girl
the spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the galley throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard
conan grabs the nearby jib swings over and plants both feet in the face of one of the spearmen knocking him over the side
the sea captain proves dangerous in his own right grabbing the head of one of the spearmen and violently pulling it down to the gunwale of the ship impaling the
spearmans eye on a handspike
the massive warrior shows incredible speed as well dodging one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another pirate
the cimmerian cuts through a spearman his gaze focused on ukafa
ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of pirates
finally the two warriors stand only feet apart
the two warriors eye each other with satisfaction
ukafas frightening sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles
we are each the last of our tribe cimmerian
yours dies this day
conan responds by lunging forward swinging his sword in a broad arc
ukafa is just as quick stepping back and allowing his spear to block the swing
ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles forcing conan to parry stepping back beyond the spears reach
the two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth neither able to gain the advantage
your head will top my spear today but know khalars pig son will soon share your fate
ukafa tries to spear conan through the chest and conan decides to drop his sword grabbing the spear as it passes by him
conan then pulls on the spear throwing ukafa off his balance towards conan
conan then kicks the warrior in the chest hurtling ukafa backwards
now conan turns the spear on its master
ukafa unarmed is forced to backpedal as conan thrusts the spear at him
a pair of close misses leaves ukafa with gashes on his chest and arm but he manages to knock the spear from conans hands
the battle goes to hand to hand
its primal each of them covered in blood
ukafa bear hugs conan then resorts to using his teeth to bite into conans shoulder
conan yells in pain butting ukafas head and knocking him back
conan falls to the stern of the ship his back against the harpoon crossbow
ukafa shakes off the head butt and sees his spear nearby
he picks it up
now finally you die
he raises up to hurl the spear through conan only to see conan manning the harpoon now turned to face ukafa
the crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole through ukafa its momentum throwing him off the galley into the sea beyond
she hides inside a small compartment of the ship
she hears footsteps walking past then returning
an arm suddenly reaches in and grabs her
as shes pulled out tamara screams right in conans face
he doesnt even flinch
time to go
the battle ended the pirates toss the dead spearmen into the sea and prepare to make sail again
meanwhile conan lashes his sword to his back standing by the gunwales with tamara and artus a small dinghy waiting below
i could get you closer
another half day along the coast i need you head west to draw off our pursuers
ill find another path to khor kalba
so be it
swift wind at your backs
conan rows away from the galley with powerful strokes
so you are taking me with you to khor kalba
i never said that
but i wont leave a virgin onboard a pirate ship alone
i but who said i was a virgin
conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large colossus head the fallen remains of an enormous statue lying agape on the shoreline
conan pulls off his jerkin revealing a torso rippling with muscles
well rest here until morning
will i awake alone
do you intend to leave me
i would do you a kindness
khor kalba will bring only death
artus told me of how you lost your tribe
i too had to watch as my people were taken from me
conan ignores her gathering wood for a fire
all i ask is that you let me travel with you
i too have a purpose
i must get to the queen
i would rather you kill me here than fail her again
conan continues collecting infuriating tamara
i was wrong about you
you are no fearless warrior
your heart is closed to all but fear and hate
conan draws flint starting the fire
only once his task is complete does he answer tamara
we leave at dawn
i will not break stride for you
i will get you into khor kalba
beyond that i have my purpose and you yours
tamara offers a thankful nod her anger subsiding
does it mean youll actually cook the meat this time
khalar looks at the destruction of ukafas warship the bodies filling the water
khalar spots ukafas dead body floating there harpoon still lodged in his chest
the ships captain approaches
the pirate ship sailed to the west
even under full sail itll be no easy task to overtake her
just then a falcon approaches
the falconer retrieves it a parchment tied to its talon
he passes it on to khalar singh
khalar singh reads it a smile creeping upon his face
fariq has done well
to the captain head east back to khor kalba
but our chase points the other way
the chase is over
they come to me now
tamara watches conan from a distance
he silently stalks prey with nothing more than a knife
its ears listen intently aware
suddenly it bolts
is just as quick racing through the forest on a intercepting course with the great beast
he leaps over a fallen log throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm
the boar goes down the blade through its jugular
conan walks up to the struggling beast showing no satisfaction as he mercifully snaps its neck
the great haunches of the beast roast over the fire
conan turns the meat
behind him tamara approaches
she has cleaned herself up her white robe translucent in light of the fire her wet hair glistening
conan cant help but notice her supple skin her curves
he stops chewing
embarrassed she turns so that he can only see her side
conan returns to his food
what were the women of your tribe like conan
they fought beside the men
so they were equals
and your mother
she died in battle even as i was born
so you never knew her
it was the same with me
ive always known being a mother was somehow not my fate
but tamara falters unsure
but conans quiet eases her
you said earlier khor kalba will bring only death
were you trying to scare me or do you really believe our end lies there
i dont lie
tamara nods having heard as much about conan
she turns back to face him no longer hiding her body
then we dont have much time
your mother perished too young but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared
tamara steps closer to conan
so do you care conan
conan rises to her his broad form looming over her slight build
but conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe and pulls her naked body into his their mouths meeting in a desperate kiss
conan lies atop tamara by the fire their sinewy limbs intertwined fingers locked together
he thrusts into her causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain
the fire grows brighter as tamara rolls on top undulating as their pace quickens
tamara cries out in ecstasy
tamara stares into the fire her body wrapped around conans
she gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm
ive only ever heard you speak of what youd die for conan
what would you live for
conan his eyes closed keeps them shut
do you ever tire of talking
let me rest woman
tamara reaches down between conans legs
his eyes open
i thought that may work
conan growls and pulls himself atop tamara
looking down at her face her hair loose and wild shes beautiful in the soft glow of the firelight
i see you clearly now finally after all this time
she kisses him deeply i would be that which you live for conan if you would have me
you may have faith in nothing conan but i have faith in you
conan lowers himself back down upon her
conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge spotting down in the vista below surrounded on three sides by the coastline the stone fortress of khalar singh
rests on a plateau overlooking a bustling tented city below
conan spots a long caravan of packed camels working their way towards town driven by desert traders from shem
well slip in along with those traders
but youll need a change of clothes those monks robes will draw attention
tamara looks down at her loose fitting robes
what will i wear
the caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city guarded by khalars troops
blended in amongst the others conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of shemish traders obscuring all but his eyes
tamara is dressed like a shemish serving girl her taut body barely covered by silken drapings
she glares at conan miserable
i dont understand why i couldnt be dressed as you are
i look like a whore
and what better disguise for a monk
conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster
the camel brays and rears
conan yanks harder and the camel flies forward its eyes wide
conan meets its eye
do not test me beast
is there not a living thing you can be at peace with
they ride into the city past the troops
conan and tamara walk through the towns teeming market a otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices veiled faces and not a hint of morality
a figure his form hidden beneath a cloak spots conan and tamara as they enter and begins to follow them
the city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the plateau
there stands a wooden platform that is lowered by a massive winch unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back up to the fortress above
its probably only way into khalars fortress
im sure it is heavily guarded at all times day and night
so we must try to scale the cliff
and dodge arrows as we do so
conan motions up to the winch
standing beside it are a half dozen of the four armed archers
during the day wed easily be spotted on the climb
and it would be useless to even attempt at night
no we must find another way
as conan continues around the base of the mesa the figure following conan is joined by two others
conan and tamara reach a less crowded area of the village when a voice rings out behind them
conan spins sword at the ready
from out of the shadows comes a pair of men their beady eyes fixed on tamara
youll regret finding me
i think not
from out of the shadows steps the one eyed thief the same one who conan saved from lucius beatings
he smiles at conan lifting a key from a rope around his neck it took longer than you think to cut this out of lucius stomach
after all that work i figured id keep it for old times sake
a rundown hall built beneath the city
wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead
and within the hall a gathering of thieves and rogues
theyre a flinty collection many of them missing fingers or even hands evidence of khalars cruel justice
they eat and drink sharing tales and tips wenches and serving women their cautious eyes following the cimmerian outsider
the one eyed thief takes them to an open table and immediately three of the serving women descend upon conan caressing him
tamara watches this jaw dropped and manages a cough even as a serving girl delivers mead to the table
conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women their breasts practically framing his face
do you wish to join in
conan cleans mead from his face scowling at tamara as the one eyed thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress
so you were right about the platform
youll be long dead before you make it top
same with scaling the cliff
theres no known way to break into the fortress
so thats it
i didnt say that
i just said theres no known way in because no one has ever tried to
but breaking out thats another story
its not much easier but its possible
the one eyed thief offers the same gap toothed grin
you just need to find someone crazy enough to show you the way
tamara is the last to follow conan the one eyed thief and the three thieves from before down a short ladder
below lies a darkened catacomb lit only by their torches
these catacombs run underneath the entire city even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon
tamaras foot drops into knee high water
she immediately grabs her nose
you mean sewers
piss and shit are the last things you need to worry about down here
tamara eyes the muddy water nothing visible beneath its murky surface
the group wades through the water single file
conan notices hieroglyphics and carvings on the wall of the catacomb
massive creatures of the sea dark sorcery ritual sacrifice
what is it
these catacombs are connected to the sea
it says that the beasts of acheron protect its secrets
not from me
conan presses on into the darkness
the catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern its walls rising up high into the darkness
as the torches bring light to the space we see hundreds of dead rotting bodies
as conan and tamara walk forward the one eyed thief and the other stop at the entrance
we stop here
weve heard too much about what lies within to go any further
conan simply nods and the thieves depart
conan raises his torch illuminating the near wall
conan heads off one direction leaving tamara to navigate the other half
her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead
she inhales deeply and takes her first step
following the slick wall he passes many dead bodies but only one catches his eye
he stops before it
nothing more than a skeleton picked clean by the rats
but he still bears his leather armor and a horned helmet that resembles his fathers own
conan takes the helmet and places it on his head
it fits perfectly
tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within
tamara leaps up swinging the torch down towards the water
conan nearby unsheathes his sword
something touched me
conan walks over the torchlight revealing something on tamaras leg
its a slug which he flicks off
stop wasting time
but when conan steps forward something roils the water right before him
he spots a huge tentacle just before its submerges back into the water
then tamara screams as another tentacle rises up from the water wrapping around her waist
tamara grabs hold of the wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater
conan immediately slashes the tentacle pulling tamara away
the squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood everywhere the knee high water seems to come alive with roiling intensity
conan spins finding a circular stone staircase tiled into the far cistern wall
as they work their way up the circular stairwell towards a thin shaft of firelight up ahead
carved out of solid black rock both sides of the broad corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors leading to prison cells
conan and tamara emerge from a sewer drain pushing their way to the floor of the hallway
the heavy darkness presses in on conans torch like a sentient animate thing
the floor of the corridor is lined with dead bodies in varying states of decay
there are buckets filled with entrails and feces upended
tamara put her hand over her mouth
conan continues down the hallway
he and tamara begin to hear the sound of eerie chanting
what is that
up ahead the torch lined dungeon plunges into darkness as the torches end
conan holds up his own torch struggling to peer into the black void
conan takes a step forward when suddenly a powerful wind blows out his torch
a moment later theres the sound of a in the darkness comes a deep earthy chuckle
a host of oil lights suddenly come up revealing that the gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a vast cage built around a massive pit
the same pit where fariq sacrificed the female monk only now a half dozen combatants stand on the grid above the void
hanging high above the pit in baskets lie other prisoners including tamaras fellow female monks
several of them yell out tamaras name as they see her
and watching everything from an amphitheater above the cage is the massive akhun and several of his slavers
which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl lives
the combatants all close in on conan and tamara each taking a different plank way to get to them
stay behind me
tamara steps behind conan who blocks the others path to her
who dies first
the first two combatants attack as one the first wielding a short sword the other a pike
the pikeman thrusts first conan deftly stepping aside then pulling the pike sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss
the prisoner with the short sword doesnt fare much better as conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow
tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage
she begins scaling the cage her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks
three more combatants step in to replace the fallen duo
conan readies himself as the first one steps up only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a enormous tentacle much like the one conan cut through earlier
up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster a gigantic octopus like behemoth with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth
the creature reaches out and grabs another screaming combatants lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw
the creature reaches for conan who ducks underneath the tentacle the slices it off
he immediately turns back to check on tamara and he discovers shes not there
he looks up to see tamara scaling the cage now nearly fifty feet directly above him
the massive warrior spots tamara getting close to the prisoner baskets and motions to his two jailers
shes reached the base of the chain supporting one of the baskets when she spots the two jailers closing in climbing towards her from either side
spotting tamara overhead conan tries to keep beneath her evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety planks
shes scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first jailer reaches out to grab her
she reacts by gashing his eyes and as he instinctively grabs them he falls towards conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen jailer smashes through the plank
he was on forcing conan to jump to another
just then another combatant comes swinging for the cimmerian forcing him to defend while still not balanced
the next jailer grabs her pulling her off the cage
he struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she bites the jailer drops tamara who screams as she falls
conan spots tamara plunging towards him
in one swift move he slashes his opponent ducks underneath a writhing tentacle and reaches out to grab tamara by the arm as she falls
his shoulder nearly pops out but he manages to hold onto tamara
she swings above the chasm the gnashing teeth of the monster below her
only a single splintering plank holds her and conan aloft
with a grunt he swings tamara and throws her to safety at the edge of the pit
but as he gets to his feet he spots the massive akhun entering the arena
the giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as conan
he thrusts his thunderous legs down causing the plank to bend and warp
conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank but his training in cimmeria serves him well
akhun smiles and step closer again thrusting down with his legs
conans balance is thrown but theres no other plank close enough for him to jump to
youll make a nice meal
akhun steps down on the plank one last time but this time conan uses the momentum to springboard up into air
conan soars into the air his cat like reflexes keeping him focused as he lands right before the stunned akhun
with one great slash of his blade conan eviscerates akhun
akhuns innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the abyss only to be snapped up by the massive beast
conan lowers down the last of the baskets
tamara use a sword to smash open the lock freeing the prisoners inside
tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock
the women look worn but unbroken
where is ilira
she was taken away by fariq
then im too late
one of the stronger looking women an elder monk steps forward
she was just taken this morning
its not yet midnight and khalar still must bring her to the cave of acheron
tamara nods and the women begin to arm themselves
conan shakes his head at the rag tag group
youre going to fight khalars troops
the elder monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly about her body clearly well versed in it use
cimmerians arent the only women who know how to fight
and to kill
tamara looks at the other monks
our duty was to keep the queen safe
but if khalar brings her to acheron it will rise again and all our peoples sacrifice is for nothing
so if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight she must be already dead
the other monks nod and they start to head off
tamara is the last to head off her eyes burning into conans
you want my help again
you kept your word ill keep mine
i pray you fulfill your debt
tamara kisses conans cheek one last time and heads off
the monk travel in single file the elder monk leading the way
suddenly she stops motioning to an entranceway ahead
dont kill him
we need to find out which way ilira was taken
the elder monk nods and slips up ahead
we hear a smash
the stunned guard lies before the assembled monks
tamara glares down at him
tell us where the last girl was taken
the guard just laughs at them through bloody teeth
let me ask
the guards face drops as conan steps out from the darkness
will be where your queen is
she knows it is a half truth
as conan and the monks enter the throne room is empty scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber
ilira sits on the throne crown on her slumped head
tamara runs over to her
she raises iliras head only to discover lifeless eyes
tamara cradles her best friends face
before the monks can react arrows streak out from the darkness killing them all
only conan is quick enough to dodge his arrow by diving aside
when he comes up khalar has tamara his sword at her neck
several archers stand behind him at the ready
its only begun
because that one was not the heir to acheron
khalar smiles down at tamara
slowly what hes saying dawns on her
it cant be secretive the traitors of acheron
it wasnt easy but fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl
that poor innocent was forced to live a lie even as the truth was kept from the queen herself
and you did the rest barbarian
my thanks for delivering the queen to me
suddenly a trap door opens beneath conan and drops down in the darkness landing with a heavy thud
conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade sizzling as it hits the cooling vat
but this is no dream of his fathers forge as he looks up to see fariq holding a sword its tip still red hot the flames of the fortresss forge
conans thrusts forward only to find his armed chained around a heavy mortar and stone pillar
fariq strokes his newly acquired scar
at last you awaken cimmerian
its been hours youve made me wait for my fun
conan says nothing but his eyes scan the room taking in everything
you made me lose face in front of my father
that wasnt wise
but what should i expect from a cimmerian
a swift end
conan strains at the chain ripping the skin beneath his shackles but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the pillar
but that is a difference between you and me
a swift end would be a mercy i do not intend to grant
no you must suffer for your transgressions
you must beg for your suffering to end
just as your people did
he waves the glowing sword tip in front of conans face
i was there
my father never uttered a sound
fariq laughs amused
you were there
what were you doing warrior
watching your father die without saying a sound
taking your eyes will be justice indeed coward
fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against conans skin
conans face reddens with pain but he doesnt utter a sound
but as conan pulls on his chains more mortar falls
as fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge conan notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is i saw my father die
slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees
fariq turns his eyes blazing
he glances over at the two guards by the door who try not to listen
ive killed many in battle cur
then why did your father not let you face me before when i had sword in hand
he thought you unequal to the task
fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against conans chest
conan just yells back at him
prove your strength
again fariq pushes the hot blade against conans skin
take my eyes coward if you can
fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at conans head
conan lifts his manacles forcing the blade up into the brick holding his chain
then conan pulls on the chains with all his might loosening the heavy brick which falls to the ground
in one powerful movement conan begins swinging the chain with the mortar block on the end a homemade ball and chain
the two guards come forward sword drawn only to meet with a crunching blow by conans weapon
both their heads get caved in
fariq rushes conan getting in too close for conans wide swings
conan simply meets fariqs sword with the heavy chains then encircles fariqs neck with the steel bonds
fariq chokes falling to the ground gasping for air
but conan doesnt kill him yet
a vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge
conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out
conan kicks him onto his back
fariqs last vision is that of conan tipping the cauldron the hot iron descending toward his eyes
conan reaches down and picks up fariqs sword
the sword by torchlight khalar singh leads his black armored personal guard two dozen men strong across a rocky peninsula jutting out into the sea
on the back of khalars horse bound rides the helpless tamara
as they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe inspiring sight
a massive skull seemingly a natural rock formation rises over the peninsula
as they ride closer we can make out one more detail the mouth of the skull is actually a massive door at least sixty feet high and seemingly made up
of jagged bone
it has the appearance of teeth completing the skull illusion
it takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous doors
khalar singh rides in
moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness
faces of demonic warrior statues
at their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons too numerous to count
this is no empire only a graveyard
you see only with your eyes
khalar nods to his men
two guardsmen take their torches and light other torches set in the walls
it sets off a chain reaction
as far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing the true scope of this place
an enormous cave the walls lined with monumental columns that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin
and at the far of the cave an altar sits beneath a raised throne surrounded by a sacrificial pool
the pool is empty
khalar turns to his guards
close the gates and stay here
send my son to me when he arrives
motioning to two of them you two come with me
khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar carved of out of purple shaded rock
around its edges are deep channels for the blood of its victims
and on its four corners shackles of bone
the acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance dont you think
for one to ascend to royalty another must fall
with the flick of a wrist khalar cuts tamaras bonds
tamara head butts him struggling to escape but khalar absorbs the blow effortlessly
he throws tamara upon the altar his two guards shackling her in place
for a hundred generations the kings of acheron were crowned and the queens were sacrificed
khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately carved box made of bone laying it before the altar
like a chinese puzzle box khalar manipulates the carvings of skulls sacrifices and creatures until the box unlatches
and from the box he lifts two items
a crown of gold and a crown of iron
the crown of gold is magnificent ornately detailed gold that glows in the firelight
but the crown of iron is terrifying
huge rough spikes extend from it in every direction
it looks more like a weapon than a crown
what a day for you
this morning you were a handmaiden
tonight you are a queen giving birth to an empire
bloodied and weary conan approaches the skull rock
he has nothing more than his sword his loincloth and a small burlap sack tied to his hip
he stumbles falling to his knees
his wounds have taken a grave toll
still he stands and presses on
he pushes on the doors
they do not budge in the least
he puts his shoulder to the doors his every muscle straining to their utmost
again no movement
conan backs away taking stock of the surroundings
he climbs up the side of the rock
khalar singh chants in acheronian
ancient harsh words as he lifts the two crowns overhead offering them to the statues of dark gods all around
you dont know what you are about to do
but i do
for thirty years i have dreamed of this day
the day our people rise from the ashes
khalar singh continues his chant and places the gold crown upon his head
as he does so the light from the moon reflects off the crown bathing the sacrificial pool in an unnatural glow
a deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout the cave shaking everything like an earthquake
it sounds like the heartbeat of a giant
khalar next places the iron crown around tamaras head
she thrashes and struggles but to no avail
once the crown is around her head thump thump
the spikes around the iron crown grow shorter as the spikes drive themselves into her head
she screams in agony
blood drips from beneath the crown flowing into channels around the edges of the altar
you give birth to an empire
conan climbs muscles straining slipping hanging on by one hand and climbing again
the statuary shakes indeed the whole earth does
conan nearly slips but keeps his grip
he reaches the eye of the skull
with the moon over his shoulder conan stares down at the unholy sight before him
we pull back revealing tamara her blood draining from her body
tamara her face pale from blood loss begins to pray in pained whispers
its good that you pray
gods will be here soon
tamara struggles to speak her body wracked with pain
hell be here sooner
khalar turns to see the outline of conan framed by the moonlight looking down at khalar from atop of one the warrior statues
a thick vine dangles nearby conans route down from the cave roof above
conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before the altar
it is a killing floor
the two guardsmen leap for him but conan dispatches them with a pair of strikes
both fall down dead
conan meets tamaras eyes a look of determination assurance
he starts toward the altar
i will say this for you barbarian
you are hard to kill
let her go
youve faced me before and lost
what do you think has changed now
conan lunges for khalar their swords meeting with a flash of sparks
they fight to a brief standstill when thump
tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her head
more blood pours forth
the blood in the channels speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the sacrificial pool
conan makes another movement toward the altar but khalar nimbly blocks his path
you are strong cimmerian but we both know you are not my equal
conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off
once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength
now let me teach you
conan tosses out what is inside
it falls to the ground rolling to khalar singhs feet
khalar looks down at the ground at the head of his beloved son his eyes gone replaced by molten metal
khalar trembles in shock and rage
khalar reaches for the severed head giving conan a brief window to rush to tamaras side
conan tries to lift her off the altar but the bone shackles still pin her down
enraged khalar charges conan throwing all his skill and force into an all out attack
conan simply sidesteps it then shatters the bone shackle holding one of tamaras wrists
before he can shatter the other khalar charges again
khalar swings conan spins his blade catching khalars just inches from his face
conan throws khalar off him knocking the warlord back ten feet
khalars attack is feral uncontrolled
hes lost his balance
spinning and striking blindly conan smashes the second shackle on her wrist
he continues his motion bringing his sword around to meet khalars next strike
now khalar looks like the enraged amateur and conan the more polished warrior
their battle takes them away from the altar
with her hands free tamara struggles to pull the spikes out and remove the crown
conan repels another khalar attack this time striking khalars chest and drawing blood
the guardsmen arrive from the other side of the cave drawing their swords
khalar waves them off his fury aimed at the cimmerian
in agony tamara pulls one of the spikes out then another
she pushes with all her might lifting the crown of iron off her bloodied head when the guardsmen charge her pin her down and force the crown back on
the crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper as tamara screams
the blood now fills the channels of the altar
we follow the trail of blood down the side of the altar in a spiral channel around the leg and in a wide circle around the altar until reaching the
channels end pool
it boils instantly multiplying itself exponentially bubbling forth and filling the entire pool
and all hell breaks loose
a massive earthquake jolts the entire cave
as khalar singh and conan battle the ground beneath them on the wide cave floor cracks and splinters
the earthquake intensifies and the entire floor of the cave gives way tumbling into an incredible abyss
conan and khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can reach to prevent them from falling further
conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the cave
khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred pool
their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow
they look below searching for the source of the glow
another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of ancient acheron
the cave is but a forechamber the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of acheron
and as they stare down into the ancient city the shadows there move
is it a trick of the light
whatever the dark forms are they are coming this way climbing the tallest demonic spires and leaping impossibly far to climb up after conan and khalar singh
khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes
beyond my dreams tamara her bodys blood nearly drained is still shackled to the altar which now teeters over the edge of chasm poised to fall into the fiery depths
on the other side of the abyss conan spots her and scales the cave wall up to a tiered plateau
he moves quickly trying to get to tamara
khalar watches entranced as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit
they climb the walls like insects clinging to the walls their heads swiveling like a praying mantis
the look like the statues above a hybrid part human part demon
their skin is a perfect black armor carved of black bone faces once human but now demonic with blood red eyes and gnashing teeth
they advance on khalar singh who is furthest down now that conan climbs upward towards tamara
i am khalar singh king of acheron
i command you to kneel
and this demonic horde advances right for him their razor sharp teeth bared
unsure khalar grips his tulwars tight
the demonic creatures draw close and they kneel
they climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads before khalar singh
out of the corner of his eye khalar spots conan drawing near
show him the might of the army of acheron
but they do not rush to follow the order
one of them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at khalars guardsmen
first we feed
its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss
take your fill
i will kill him myself
conan is on an intercept course with tamara leaping across chasms from statue to statue
just below him the first wave of acheronian warriors reach the khalars remaining guardsmen
khalars guardsmen who have been watching the events with mouths agape realize the danger too late
the horde of acheronian warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues between the demonic warriors and the soldiers
his climbing is dizzying reminiscent of his youth scaling the cliffs of cimmeria
intercepts conan just below the altar his tulwars at the ready
your story ends here
the two warriors square off fighting even as they cling to the statues
the demon warriors not only slay khalars guardsmen but rip their still living bodies apart dousing themselves in the blood of their victims
it is a violent ritual both bacchantic and gruesome
launches himself at conan his tulwars sparking off the stone statuary
conan leaps to another statue parrying the blows
khalar overextends himself and conans sword just barely misses his throat
khalar pulls back tries to settle himself
conans eyes narrow he knows what khalar is doing
like a woman fariq cried and begged me to spare him
khalar roars in rage launching an all out offensive
conan backs up slowly waiting for his moment
and it comes quickly
conan ducks below the tulwars and cuts khalar across the stomach
khalar loses his balance and falls one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm dangling over the abyss
conan raises his sword to finish the job
conan glances down
the acheronian commander drank his fill and now moves to the altar itself his claw stroking tamaras body
with one touch the shackles open
he and the acheronian warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss
khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth
they take her to a place you can never follow
who will you fail cimmerian
your father or your woman
conan leaps down to the altar
the acheronian warriors attack
standing atop the altar conan cuts down all comers cutting his way through the enemy working his way to tamara
they leap on conan impossibly fast
they stab him
they cut him
but he does not stop
even wounded he throws them into the abyss
and he reaches tamara just before the commander drags her below
he grabs her arm
the commander grabs her other arm baring his shark like teeth
conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and the commander falls into the abyss
the bloody conan pulls tamara up into his arms
only for tamara to scream
conan spins just in time as khalar strikes
khalars tulwar narrowly misses and conan counters
his fathers sword runs khalar singh through
khalars body falls into the abyss
but the acheronian warriors surround them
thousands climb out of the abyss teeth bared closing in on the wounded conan
tamara badly weakened herself grabs conan
conan you know what you must do
it is the only way to end this
my death gives others life
your parents both understood that purpose
now it is yours
a tear falls from tamaras face
the demonic warriors prepare to strike
conan drives his sword into tamaras heart
the crown spikes retract and it falls from her head tumbling into the abyss
a seismic explosion shakes everything an unearthly gust of wind pulling the acheronian warriors back down into the abyss
the cave begins to fall massive sections of the roof dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below
conan pulls tamaras body away even as the world descends into dust and debris
khalars horse stands near the entrance
conan puts tamaras body carefully atop the horse then mounts it himself
he positions her in front of him his arms encircling her
conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss her blood staining his lips red as his mothers did as a child
a blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains
conan holds a single torch in his hand
his look is hard
we pull back to reveal a funeral pyre tamaras body atop it
conan places the torch to the pyre
it quickly spreads
we move in closer and closer upon conans ice blue eyes a blazing fire erupting in them
a fire that will never be extinguished
