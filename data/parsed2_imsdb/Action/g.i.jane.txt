by david twohy august blinding in their white uniforms naval flag officers sit in the audience showing their support for theodore hayes a year old civilian
this is his confirmation hearing
reading from prepared material last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service particularly in the land based maritime specialties
whats more the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on whoa whoa whoa
land based maritime specialties
gimme a second here to de euphemize that
at the center of a dais lillian dehaven leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room
her plaque card reads chairperson senate arms committee
dehaven is a tough hided old southern belle scarlett ohara at
in her arsenal she carries conversational hand grenades and shes apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim
would that be anything like typing
restocking the cupboards
that sort of thing mr
chuckles from the packed gallery
the flag officers go stone faced
hayes forces a smile
hardly the case senator
well im just an old dame without much time left so youll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood type
i am deeply concerned over the navys seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military
case in point
on cue aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais
hayes gets a copy too
and it jars him
the lark report
this is an internal document of the u
i must seriously question whether to others on panel the navys conclusion regarding the crash of an f aboard an aircraft carrier
female aviator it just so happens
to hayes youre familiar with this report and its conclusion am i right
i was one member of the investigating commission
yes i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone elses
and your conclusion was pilot error hmm
im really not prepared for any kind of in depth review of id like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything mr
a humorless smile
shes roasting his nuts over an open fire and everyone knows it
the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier
that aside for the moment im struck by the tenor the ill spirit of your report
the degrading remarks by other aviators
innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations
even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior
closing report in my seven years on this committee ive never seen a downed aviator treated like this
im deeply disturbed by this report mr
not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well
heading for her office dehaven is escorted by a small a full percent of all jobs in the u
military are still to this day off limits to women
and thats simply gotta change
what about those who say women arent suited for all jobs
that theyre physically weaker
they have less stamina
and were gonna hog the bathroom too
dehavens aide catches up pulls her aside
white house boys want a private meeting
ill act surprised
shoes dumped on her desk dehaven changes out knee high stockings while devoting one ear to
to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of mr
hayes to guide the navy into the next century
the task as the administration sees it is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values
dehaven looks between the two white house boys young and eager older and cagier
ten minutes nothin on the table
sweetcakes you best go back to the president and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin for his next nominee
white house looks spanked
taking over pops a briefcase
an inch think report appears before dehaven
administrations plan for percent integration
if female candidates measure up in a series of test cases the president will support full integration within three years time
surprised maybe even startled dehaven flips through the report absorbing by osmosis
its your gender blind navy senator
surely youre not going to balk now
well its just that askin you all to integrate the navy is like sending a man to do a womans job
a beat how do you propose to handle the combat exclusion laws
keep narrowing the definitions
we got around it in saudi arabia
by calling women honorary men
cmon senator presidents pitchin right down the center of your plate
if women measure up to men theyve got the job
you going to take a swing
or step out of the box
dehaven riffles the edges of the report thinking it over
thinking light years ahead
buttoning up topcoats the white house boys move down marble steps to reach a pair of limousines
hayes and two flag officers wait
shaking hand congratulations mr
inside the moving car so she picks the women we pick the programs
id go special reconnaissance
every bit as tough and we have a percent drop out rate among the men
then i suggest we start there
doesnt matter who she picks
no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course
and i dont care who it is
winterscape dotted with ice floes the potomac wends through the capitol city banks iridescent with snow morning water calm
theres an almost hallowed beauty to it all
soon we pick out
a spot of day glo
coming out of the mouth of morning
overtaking the floes
closer on jordan oneil
she pushes her flat water kayak downriver paddling hard and clean making good time
gliding through the graceful arches of the arlington bridge she passes
grid locked by snow conditions
in seconds jordan paddles clear leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the washington monument
something burrs from a life vest pocket
she rips through velcro to free a cell phone
gotta situation here
where are you
stuck in traffic
checking dive watch not due in for minutes sir
all right stand by were going to switch over to comsat
a tactical officer reroutes the call via defense satellite cryptography flashing on terminals
lieutenant commander robert royce joins other intel officers at a conference table
theyre pouring over weather charts navigation logs high altitude nro video
voice system now secure
into speaker okay fresh stuff lost a nato plane over the sea of japan
elb signals leads us to believe the pilot is alive and has made his way to the north korean shore near a fishing village tamyung
do we know its him using the beacon
not a decoy
signals received only sparingly in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries
chances of recovery
youre the analyst for east china oneil
riding the current jordan blows a troubled sigh as she accesses the file of her brain
drifting past the jefferson memorial north korean beaches are the best protected most heavily monitored in the world
the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system
extraction team has to be small and silent id go with seals over delta force
problem is dont want to hold a conventional sub off shore for target practice
wheres the polk
halfway round the world
so thats the problem we can get the team in just not out
an inspired beat unless you whiskey run
blank faces here oneil
quick hit technique used by capone
rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles
all his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride
check the files dprk i doped it out as a contingency plan seal team infiltrates picks up the package links up with recovery sub
but dont waste time opening and closing hatches
they just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters
a dubious beat
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare back
is that correct oneil
only four minutes to neutral waters sir
silence on the radio theyre discussing her scenario privately
during jordans kayak reaches the junction of the potomac and the anacostia rivers
on the far bank lies
naval intel center n
bristling with communication antennae
jordan stares at the complex waiting for a response
all right sending the recommendation across the river
the phone goes dead
no thank you sir
bundled in topcoat and scarves military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside
presently jordan appears wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head
she flashes a photo badge and double times inside
jordan exits a locker room
smoothing out her khaki uniform she heads down a broad corridor with cipher lock doors
falling in step that was good headwork lieutenant
thank you sir
we hear back from the pentagon
scoffing probably hear back from cnn first
hate this part
just sweating it out on the sidelines
intel has its own glory lieutenant no matter how subtle
now they reach
a circular chamber
dominating the ground floor is the bullpen a hive of cubicles an computer stations
on the second floor are executive offices ringing the bullpen
by the way ill need that option paper by hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover
and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here
with a look is this my glory sir
on the upper walkway a frazzled n
she spots royce and jordan below
excuse me but i have senator dehaven on the line for you
jesus god what now
he bounds up the stairs toward his office
im sorry sir no she asked to speak with lieutenant oneil
royce turns back and gives jordan a hall of fame look
into phone so everyone i talk to says youre top drawer with silk stockings inside
thank you maam
um may i ask what this is regarding
reading file high school pentathlete
rotc scholarship graduated with honors
top marks in basic training
and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of virginia
oh the things ill do for one extra vote
on the phone jordan glances around
co workers mull within earshot
those out of earshot post e mail memos on jordans computer moving up in life
i want a full report
dont tell her who you really voted for
lieutenant oneil i am prepared to nominate you for the navys special reconnaissance program
should you accept youll ship out to coronado next week and join in the big testosterone festival
complete the course and youll have a fast ticket to any assignment you want
thats my personal promise to you
a beat as jordans mind catches up to her ears
now interrcutting the two coronado
i know that sir
its just that
beggin your pardon senator but
do you understand that this involves combat training
this is just a test case oneil
but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navys official policy on women in combat
or actually its official non policy
now whos your immediate superior there
my office will fill him in and help expedite
look forward to meeting you at the proper time
jumping off now
uh question maam
would i be the only one
the only woman
therell be more to follow but yes dear right now youre the pick of a very large litter
and your success would mean a lot
the line goes dead
jordan hangs up catatonically
well shit a doodle do
a small gunkhole harbor up the potomac
snow falls thick and silent on overturned canoes stored for the winter
beyond stands a clapboard rental house
its not so much furnished as equipped scuba gear and wetsuits in the mud room life vests on coat racks a training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living
in the kitchen we find
a naked man
hes steeping tea
well i survived basic training and three brothers so i know how to fight
what scares me are the sexual politics
i dont want to be turned into some poster girl for womens rights
camera follows as the naked man carries a steaming mug through the house
and sets it down beside jordan languishing in a tub
snow builds on a window sill
facing jordan the man slides into the tub
so whyre you even considering it
just like you would be
those guys are world class warriors
and they will not want you there jordan
i take it you dont either
dutifully royce massages her feet
well youre doin shit hot at intel
were the same age we started the same time and now youre sitting in the upperdecks while im still down in the bullpen
what does that tell you about the navy
shaking head shes haze grey and underway
you need operational duty to really advance
you need combat training to go operational
yet combat training is off limits to people with tits
im topped out at intel
forget the glass ceiling im beating my head on a big brass ceiling
so dump on me
this has nothing to do with you
getting out well guess i dont even need to be here
get your dick back here
it has everything to do with you
youre such a ball breaker sometimes
especially at night
but after our days
a thoughtful sip so if i try this thing
if i ship out to coronado
what happens here
ill try to keep the door open
if you wash out i make it so that wai wait
what happens if it works
four months of training three years of operational duty
blowing a sigh i dont feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life jordan
maybe we should just let it happen
which is guy speak for
conceding sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth
but im trying to be honest okay
three years is a long time
dont ask me to predict how ill feel then jordan because i dont know
and either do you
you know right up until you said that i thought i did know
wounded she gets out
thank you royce
it was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy
really thank you so much
she punches into a robe and leaves
royce considers drowning himself in the tub
jordan drives a top down mustang across the sweeping coronado bridge cityscape behind her naval base ahead
a flock of pelicans pace jordan alongside the bridge
suddenly two navy helos blast overhead scattering the pelicans
on base jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt courtyard
the is the grinder reminiscent of a gladiators arena
she notices at one end
a silver ships bell
excuse me lieutenant
i was told this is where i check in
a duty officer looks up to find jordan across a counter
in no particular hurry the duty officer makes his way over to check jordans orders
looking up so youre the one
hearing other workers look up
among them is a female ensign kathy blondell no makeup no nail polish no concession to her sex
throughout shell watch jordan with more than passing interest
still dont have my bearings yet
direct me to the officers quarters
the duty officer stamps her paperwork returns it with room assignment and keys
youll proceed directly to the infirmary for eye tests blood tests urinalysis pregnancy test
uniform issue adjacent
then youre to report to the base commander
hed like a word with you
and the officers quarters
s office can supply you with directions
enjoy your visit lieutenant
its a nasty little barb one that jordan decides to let slide
jordan turns for the door
blondell catches up with a base map
take a starboard tack out the door
thank you ensign
no problem lieutenant
a soft knocking
a yeoman opens the door
behind him is jordan
oneil reporting sir
for a beat commanding officer c
turrentine takes stock of the female in his doorway sizing her up like a fighter across the ring
then he stubs out a perfectly good cigar rises with an amiable face and touches the back of a chair stopping just short of pulling it out for her
yes of course
please have a seat lieutenant
thank you sir
would you care for a beverage
im fine sir
were still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the spec recon training
it may not always be smooth but were trying to make it as painless as possible for you
thank you sir
but i expect a certain amount of pain
more stock taking
is he looking at her hair
barber was my next stop sir
wouldve had it regulation sooner only dont worry about it
if its off your collar and out of your eyes thats all im going to ask
really i have no problem with im not out to change your sex lieutenant
youll have separate beds separate heads
if you have specific medical needs inform the infirmary
if a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner please inform me immediately so i can deal with it immediately
none at this time sir
then thats all i have to say
another smile another phantom gesture on the back of her chair
if jordan was expecting a fight the bell never sounded
she rises salutes then turns back at the door
sir i just want you to know
im not here to make a statement
i dont want to make men look foolish
all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else i suspect
if you were like everyone else lieutenant i suspect we wouldnt be making statements about not making statements would we
a beat take your leave
the spec recon trainees loiter outside their open rooms pumping weights hosing down dive gear trading walkman tapes
this is the last day of liberty theyll have for a long time
what am i scannin here
other eyes quickly lock in on
across a grass courtyard she walks the ground floor of an identical building trying to match key number to room number
every door is open every room empty
soon she feels the presence of
theyre disgorging from their rooms ten twenty thirty of them all buffed and cut
these guys are what hitler saw in his dreams
jordan picks up her pace
where the hell is her room
on all three levels of their building the men shadow jordan en masse
jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building shes got the entire floor to herself
with a last look over her shoulder jordan vanishes inside
here you will be trained to infiltrate hostile territory
to be the real time eyes on the ground
to recover assigned targets and if need be to fight your way out under adverse conditions
camera surveys faces of the trainees miller mccool well get to know them later
dressed in navy greens they stand in formation ten rows ten deep helmets in hand
pacing before them that is all that will be said about the special nature of this class by us or by you
many of you have waited years for admission to this program
opportunities like this are rare and those who seize upon them are rarer still
he approaches jordan
we can tell what shes thinking
just keep moving
dont single me out
other than that there is little to be said but good luck gentleman
now i turn you over to the chief training officer
he has earned six naval commendations the purple heart and the navy cross for heroism and valor
i give you master chief john james urgayle
taking over the chief stands before the class a moment sizing them up while giving them get an eyeload of him too his body is years old his face his
an ageless warrior
somewhere the blood of ulysses runs in this guys veins
the chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo and its anything but the kick ass rant the class is expecting the sun and moon
the ebb and flow of the pacific tides
the very angle of the earth upon its axis
these are just some of the things i control in my world
trainees swap private looks
darth vader reads poetry
we are so fucked
start on boots crashing through shallow surf spraying water
we assume this is a routine beach run until view rises to reveal
telephone poles on their shoulder
working in groups of trainees labor under pound poles
jordan six inches shorter than most looks like atlas carrying the weight of the world
but shes doing it
one two three four
one two three four
an ambulance shadows the class
perched on the front bumper like an hood ornament the chief keeps working his bullhorn you may think that you are the brightest the best the strongest
i assure you that is a total delusion on your part
it is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be
percent of you will not finish this course
how do i know
because that is an historical fact
its also intimidating shit
the earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp sand
approaching on foot the chief loads fresh batteries into his bullhorn
he does it like a man thumbing rounds into a shotgun
now for the bad new i always like to get one quitter on the first day
and until i do the first day does not end
so look around right now go on do it
i wonder who its gonna be
he passes right by jordan never meeting her eyes
instructor pyro steps up
hes the chiefs bulldog
down to bvds
the guys strip down to boxers
jordan settles for boxers and jog bra
now face the pacific
and take a stroll
the class wades in
the first wave takes jordans breath away its february and the water is cold
when they move out of instructors earshot what is it with the damn phone poles
we sign up for spec recon or just trying to thin the herd
thats all they want to do right now
some of the guys are glancing jordans way cashing in on a cheap wet t shirt contest
jordan covers herself instinctively and hates the instinct
modesty isnt going to get her through this
doesnt she know its rude to point
you see that girl
i got eyes newberry
just one night in my room shed forget all about playin commando
tone that shit down slutnik
you heard with they said
out of the water
the class breaks for the beach
now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me
the trainees hit their bellies and roll
indeed they look like sugar cookies
collect those poles gentlemen
still a lotta beachfront you havent seen
groaning the trainees grab poles
jordans pole wet slips from their collective grasp
and bangs stamms ankle
he howls through his teeth
we better get a medic over no goddamnit
stamm swallows the pain
poles go back on shoulders
looking like drunk centipedes the class staggers off down the beach
wallowing in mud the class does belly busters atomic sit ups and the sadistic reverse push up where trainees lie of their backs place hands under shoulder blades and push
their crotches skyward
pain is your friend
it will keep you awake in times of emergency
it will tell you when you are seriously injured
it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home
but you know the best thing about pain
it lets you know that you arent dead yet
instructors roam rasping orders kicking students into proper position
jordan struggles with the reverses
go regulation if you cant do the reverses oneil
she looks around
a lot of the guys are having trouble with the reverses not just her
thank you sir
but i like these just fine
not doin them very fine oneil
ill try anyway sir
youll try what we tell you to try oneil
she switches to standard push ups her face disappearing into the ooze with every downstroke
soon the chiefs boots slosh into frame
hes still looking for his human sacrifice
whos it gonna be
i just wonder who is it gonna be
on your belly
on your back
on your feet
on your belly
on your back
on your feet
silhouetted against a lowering sun the students flop around like docked fish
blondell is ending her shift
she shoulders a purse and pauses at a window seeing
the trainees shuffling into formation like the living dead
jordan is still among them
you have noticed a ships bell hanging at the west side of this courtyard
if at any time you feel you cannot continue with your training that bell is your salvation
strike it three times and the ordeal is over
nervous eyes flick to the bell
yes it is a long walk
so ill make it as easy as i can
he turns his back to the class
now you dont have to watch me watching you break rank
because i know someone here wants to do it
camera searches their faces
there isnt one trainee here who hasnt thought about it
now i know what youre thinking
low im thinkin we could jump him right now
can i really take weeks of this bubonic asshole
if you dont know the answer to that question the answer is no you cannot
and that is another historical fact
so do it
admit you dont have what it takes
admit you are out of your depth or were all heading back to the beach right now
waiting a beat instructors
following the chiefs lead instructors lift their dive watches
to class the time is now hundred
the sun is shining brightly
plenty of daylight left for another phone pole run
groans behind him
the groans give way to the sound of boots breaking rank
blondells pov of a lone figure crossing to the bell
quick closeups of miller slutnik wickwire turning to watch someone cross the grinder
at least we know who it isnt
close on the chief as the bell rings three times
he turns around to find
stamm at the bell
for the first time the chief looks dead bang at jordan
was he expecting her
leave your helmet there stamm
back to the barracks
stamm drops his helmet and limps away
the rest of you should remember one thing
the only easy day was today
turning it over to you
cuh lass face right
they march off
dead ass tired jordan slides her tray down the line piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories
she heads for
a table of trainees one spot open
seeing her coming the guys shift position
suddenly the table is full
better look elsewhere oneil
none of them meet her eyes
she wheels around and now all eyes are on her watching her ass walk away
feature slutnik the walking sperm bank
half a night lord just gimme half a night to set her straight
jordan tries another table
this one too becomes abruptly full
as jordan leaves hold on miller
hes a human eclipse six three the perfect commando physique
instructors wish they could clone him
average woman is percent body fat
thats one quarter fat man
think about that
nice distribution though
no way does she makes this program
after wandering the mess hall like a homeless person jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards
they look at her with blank faces
jordan walks in a bathrobe toweling her hair dry
she fishes for keys at her door
its not so much that they hate you
someone is sitting on an outdoor table smoking
he leans into the light so she can see his face
its wickwire the mid s lieutenant who doubles as class officer
hes dangerously handsome
theyre more afraid of you
well now i feel so much better
it was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide
cant say anything good so they dont say much at all
to your face anyway
whose orders were those
it was made clear
getting up anyway stay ballsy
first weeks hell then it levels out
thats hell and a half
and how do you know that
made it to week last time
i didnt know they let you try again
especially at your age
youre kind of a surprise yourself
a faint grin from wickwire before he shadows back across the courtyard that separates the two b
back across no mans land
a desk a chair a mirror
all overwhelmingly dull
jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body
both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone pole run
her back and thighs are sand burned
mirror cuts abound
shes already a mess
jordan uncaps some cologne
its a vestige of her old life shes not going to surrender
looks back in the mirror
and breaks out laughing
its like dropping a rose in a cesspool
a photographer stands near a car parked just outside the base
hes peering through a mm lens
photographers pov focusing through cyclone fencing
panning past the sand dunes
and finding green clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course
an explosion of sand england and wickwire belly flop into a sand pit and speed crawl under barbed wire
clear they gain their feet and blitz toward
the rolling logs
they balance beam their way to
the rope climb
racing to the top they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto
the high poles
they land awkwardly losing their wind and their grip tumbling into the sand pit below before
racing for the finish
the chief thumbs a stopwatch
youre good to go for the slide for life
wickwire roll back till you get south of
whod you kiss to get back in here anyway
wickwire dusts off and starts back for
the starting line
stepping up next is cortez the human fighting cock
jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle and eight foot sheer wall
hang on here
he grabs something off a truck and positions it at the base of the wall
its a little two step platform
snickers moans from the guys
cortez can barely contain his disgust
aw what is this
dont have to use it oneil but its gotta go out
calling out five
i can make this wall without two
cortez blurs away
jordan starts a step late
cortez takes the wall clean
eschewing the two step jordan jumps right over it but jumps too far out because of it
she takes the wall awkwardly
intercut the others as they break rank to follow eager to see cortez blow her off the course
lesgo cortez lesgo go go
cortez belly flops into the sand pit and snags going under the barbed wire
shit of a saint
catching up jordan clears the wire without a hitch and leads going into
the rolling logs
they both tight rope across nimbly and bound on toward
jordan starts up at a decent clip but cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar doubling her speed
take her take her here cortez
lookit that monkey man go
hoo yah hoo yah
cortez reaches the top platform
now hes faced with
the high poles
hes seen others land sideways and pay the price
trying another way cortez takes a flying leap
and whumps down with legs astraddle
he tried to cushion the landing with his hands and failed magnificently
his balls took the brunt
jordan whumps down beside him with legs astraddle and shoots cortez a hey no problem look
she rolls off the poles
and drops to the pit below
cortez lands right behind
now its a flat out sprint for
the finish line
he takes her at the tape
cortez do a little rescue recovery on your gonads and line up again
heading back to the starting line jordan wheels around
say again sir
you heard me
aw this is such bullshit
others grumble in commiseration
jordan flushes with anger
chief sir i dont understand why educate her pyro
automatic five second deduction which slips you under the wire
its called gender norming oneil standard procedure for all females in physical training courses
where you been the last few years
what all females
if im the only twice now i have said the words move on
he turns his back leaving no possibility of discussion
jordan stares after
cant live with them cant kill them
whats the point
somebody throw a tent over this circus
low to jordan just let it go
if its in your favor just shut the hell up and take it
dressed in bathrobe jordan reaches her door
she pauses to check
the outdoor table
no visitors tonight
jordan pushes inside and stops when she sees the little two step platform
that awful crutch
someone has put it beside her bed
jordan wheels around to check
the men building
slutnik and a few others loiter on a balcony mirroring her stare
hastily dressed jordan marches across the base
her march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking lots
and finally reaches
an on base bungalow
jordan bangs on the front door until the c
s scowling face appears
pardon the hour sir
but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way
didnt take long
he waves her inside
all right lieutenant give me a name and specifics ill have the x
file an action first thing in the morning
waits a name
its you sir
and it started the day i came here
jolted oh really
its this double standard the separate quarters the deferential treatment
its how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met
because i was civil now youre complaining
i cant afford civility sir
how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when youve got me set up as an outsider
even if i make it under these rules i still lose because therell always be a flag in my file yeah she made it but
i mean really why didnt you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base
did you just have a brain fart
did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander
if so i regard that as a bonafide brain fart and i resent it when people fart inside my home
i think youve resented me from the start sir
now finally her opponent steps into the ring
and hes a bare knuckle brawler
building what i resent lieutenant is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment
what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men
the day care center i have to build where an officers lounge used to be
and the ob gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears
drawing close but most of all lieutenant i resent your perfume however subtle it may be competing with the aroma of my fine three dollar and fifty nine cent cigar
which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities
no sir what
the shape doesnt bother me
its just that goddamn rotten stench
a dangerous beat before the c
least now were talking the same language
a beat so one standard
is that what youre after
same rules for everyone sir
across the board sir
and if you just happen to wash out i wont have to contend with you bitchin to some hairy chested female senator
and please note i did not identify any one in particular
wouldnt dream of it sir
a deciding beat
then good night
so ill get a fair shot
youll get everything you want oneil
lets see if you want what youre gonna get
jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length
its over in seconds
jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders
blondell scans the paperwork with deepening concern
this some kind of joke
jordan tosses her belongings into a laundry bag
she slings the bag over her shoulder boots aside the hated two step on her way out
marches across the no mans land
and bangs open a door
slutnik sits up on his bed
well who the shit you think you are
comin in here like that
your new roommate
slutniks face curdles
jordan dumps her bag on an open bunk and starts unpacking
anybody usin these drawers here
hey hey hey
you cant stay in here
you cant sleep right next to me
funny the c
says i can
she slaps orders on his chest continues to unpack
aw lookit this lookit this shes bringin tampax in here
cmon you got nothin but rooms over there
that your desk
ill take this one
whirling on him listen sex ape
im here to stay
and if you dont want me for a roommate or classmate you got two options move out or ring out
end of file
slutnik stalks out
jordan fires a look at the innocent bystander here mccool
he was studying at his desk when the fireworks began
what about you mccool
any problem with the room assignment
mccool an imperturbable black lieutenant just goes back to his manuals
its not a job its an adventure
start on flares igniting overhead
follow the flares as they parachute down into the surf to illuminate
the class standing in one long line arms linked
as black waves knock out their legs were reminded of show girls kicking their way through some macabre review
firing flare guns and working their bullhorns degrees this morning
thats not a bad water temp really if youre standing where we are
slurred speech lack of proper motor control short term amnesia all early signs of hypothermia
advanced hypothermia is easy to detect in a classmate
hell look like hes dead
in situations of extreme cold you can always count on body heat to keep you alive and i do not mean your own
we will break you of the cultural barriers that dictate you should not invade another mans space
are any of you in a situation of extreme cold right now
intercutting trainees and instructors yes sir
then why arent you all over the man next to you
the class pivots degrees and starts to close rank
behind jordan montgomery a
flea hesitates hes a bantam weight from georgia his manners bred into the bone
he just cant find a delicate way to grab jordan without mounting her
just do it okay
if you cant feel the other guys pecker you aint in tight enough
i want nuts to butts
come on montgomery
why is there a break in that line
finally jordan grabs flea by the neck pushes him ahead and mounts him
the class closes down into a long human snake
in his ear montgomery why do they call you flea
its really f
lee montgomery but that gets whittled down to just flea
for short maam
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
well flea i appreciate the respect you just showed me
but i dont need it and dont want it not that kind of respect anyway
its just gonna hurt us both okay
ill work on it maam
to the chief time
check your watch pyro
camera polls the grim blue lipped faces in the water
jordan feels flea starting to shake
you okay flea
two bodies ahead its the big bruiser miller whos shuddering
jordan feels him shaking through flea
jesus my hands
they arent workin right
how long izis for
sposed to be minute intervals no more
swear each times gettin longer
this where you bailed last time wick
huh uh but wasnt middla february last time either
how you doin miller
on shore minutes
ignoring the chief lifts his bullhorn remember all this is completely voluntary
for any of you who dont want to continue instructor johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance
a portable light comes on
indeed an instructor is setting up coffee service
hes the fuckin antichrist
they really got donuts over there
or just somea last nights dinner rolls
look like donuts to me
in disbelief whatre you guys doing
just askin what you gonna give it all up for a maple twist
how dumb you gotta be
thats exactly what they suddenly the line rips apart
its miller breaking for shore
soon the dyke is bursting everywhere four others break rank following millers lead
the deserters stagger onto the beach
medics close in quick draping them with blankets shining flashlights in their faces asking brain check question
tell me what day this is
look at me now
what city are you from sailor
here look right here
a medic nods to the chief
you want another minute to think about this
no response to miller directly do any of you want to reconsider
avoiding his eyes miller wags his head
get em out of my scan
its a death sentence
as the quitters slouch for the coffee truck
by my watch
which of course appears to be broken
theyve been in minutes without the benefit of protective gear
tight on the chief
scanning the remaining trainees
thinking about holding out out for one more
tight on jordan
knowing who hes waiting for
wondering if she can outlast him
into bullhorn everybody out
with a shivering cheer the trainees stampede ashore grabbing blankets trading body bumps and high fives
jordan gets swept up in the esprit theyve conquered a common enemy
but when she tries to get high fived
the guys turn their backs
its a cold rebuff worse then any water
hold tight on jordan
watching the guys drift away
way to gut it out
the instructors are shuffling muster lists reorganizing the class
the bell tolls again and again
shaking head miller
thought the guy was made of depleted uranium
really didnt expect to lose him
every class has its surprises pyro
this onell be no different
blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign tall and striking
passing the bell blondell checks on
the helmets lined up beneath
a dozen already
cadence call then led by wickwire trainees double time into the grinder uniforms drenched from a beach run
among them still is jordan
it brings a mona lisa smile to blondells face
change those clothes be back here in six minutes
and i am timing you
the class scatters
slutnik hits the brakes when he sees blondell and her friend
and i only got three minutes apiece
jerking him away barkin up the wrong dress slutnik
you aint their type
overhearing jordan snaps a look at blondell only now realizing
their eyes meet
whatre you gawking at
last week at coronado
the woman identity unknown is believed to be the first female candidate for the elite special reconnaissance program
her presence could signal a shift in the navys long standing policy that excludes women from combat positions
flak drops the newspaper on the c
its the san diego tribune
under the headline g
jane a photo shows a chesty sailor running the obstacle course
im asking again
where is she
inbound now sir
had to pull her out of the dive bell
i have interview requests from two local tv stations
and a sociologist from u
san diego called wanted to know if she could examine the interaction between g
jane and the men
kill the interviews
i dont need civilians nosin around in matters that are supposed to be covert in nature
just kill em before this whole thing gets outta con senator dehaven calling sir
gets an instant headache
base commander turrentine speaking
in the senate barber shop dehaven is having her hair colored
she holds a fax of the tribune article in one hand a cell phone in the other
hitting like a scud commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill
these were supposed to have been discreet test cases senator they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses and now i got reporters from toadsquat iowa calling my
office and askin what i know about this g
nothing i can do about it unless youre suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties which id happily do if youll just trim a little fat off the constitution
are you truly mouthin off to a senior member of the senate arms committee
i mean ill give you points for style just nothin for smarts
double takes as jordan enters shes sun burned wind burned sand burned chapped and chaffed bloody and soggy
her dive suit leaks onto the floor
see me sir
you makin friends with the press lieutenant
he tosses her the paper
jordan scans the article as dehaven continues over speakerphone well seeins how this thing is out you let me handle the r
from this point forward i want all press matters coordinated via my office
ill be god damned if im gonna watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one
him or the president
aside to beautician this my shade
cuz im comin dangerously close to lookin like ronald reagan here
your prerogative senator
hows our girl doin anyway
standing right here in my office
how are they treating you
s eyes cant complain maam
maybe ill ask when i see you in person
gonna be visiting that all womans americas cup team in a few weeks if i were a gambler id say dennis oconners days are numbered
but theyre in san diego so i thought id take a quick promenade of the base
we arent sure who dreads the idea more the c
security arrangements generally take some time senator
what the hell you talkin about
your base isnt secure
of course but theres more then set out the good plates well all have lunch
my office will follow up with details
jumping off now
phone goes dead
gives jordan a look one might reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed ebola upon the world
sir i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this
not this article not well all have lunch
oh and lets be sure to invite this sociologist too just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game sir
secretary hayes calling
s headache becomes a migraine
backing out permission to leave sir
permission to evaporate oneil
dehaven hands the phone to her aide
hes set up a portable office in the next barber chair
think i overplayed it
congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing
theyll never know whose leak it is
pound rubber boats zodiacs litter the beach
the class is breaking down into six man crews
boat five wickwire cozad vinyl intagliata ayers and wise
lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer
follow his orders to your death
get it up
crew five finds their zodiac hoists it onto their heads
boat six england oneil mccool montgomery cortez and slutnik
lieutenant england is your senior officer
jordan rolls her eyes at least two of the guys in her crew are blue ribbon misogynists
cortez and slutnik dont like it any better
looking up somebody got a problem with the muster
fine by me sir
no problem sir
full of joy here sir
exchanging looks across their zodiac jordan and her new crewmates lift the boat overhead
with battle cries boat crews charge into the teeth of the pounding surf
some lose their boat to the first wave others clear the surf and scramble aboard
into bullhorn first crew to finish gets hot food and warm racks for the night
rest of you are digging hide sites and eating earthworms tonight
beyond the breakers the zodiacs run parallel to shore crews paddling furiously racing the wind the sun the other crews
instructors shadow in power boats stopwatches running
mccool dont wanna be pickin no sandcrabs outta my ass tonight
so shutup and stroke mccool
flea checks on jordan
she paddles hard really digging in
flea grins on some level he has to admire this women
jordan catches the grin gives one back
ahead buoys mark the finish line
and just when it seems victory is at hand
something hits boat six
suddenly its losing air
jordan torques around to see
the chief on a nearby boat speargun in hand
your boat just hit razor coral
what do you do now
patch and pump
whose ass is on the kit
i say keep paddlin
were almost forget it mccool
pri one is to save the boat not win a race
so lets get on it
they flail to save their sinking boat
boat five noses past stealing the lead
wickwire tosses jordan a passing look
up and down the dunes crews are digging hide sites six man holes that will be their homes tonight
cortez and slutnik are uprooting shrubs collecting camouflage material
four years i petition to get into this program
finally get here and now its co ed
now im gettin hammered just cuz shes on our crew
least you dont have to sleep with her every goddamn night
tellin you id rather be the last class with balls than the first one with chicks
jordan and flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of their hide site
england and mccool shovel back to back
had a grandaddy who wanted to be a navy man
wanted to fire them big guns on a big ass battleship
but navy said to him oh no
you can only do one thing on a battleship
well whats that
cook they said
now this aint years ago im talkin united states navy middla world war ii
and you know the reason they gave him
you know why they tol my grandaddy he couldnt fight for his country
he talked too much
negroes cant see at night
bad night vision
youre kiddin me
jordan jumps in the hole ready to take over shoveling
see you just the new nigger on the block oneil
and maybe you moved in too early
he climbs out
hold on jordan looking off down the dunes seeing the other crews covering up and going underground for the night
how the hell did she wind up here
so far from home
a jeep speeds along the public highway carrying the c
back to base
when the jeep tops a rise what in gods name
ahead a half dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder
all cameras are trained on the base
camera finds navy dress blues laid out on a bed
topcoat draped on a chair back
cnn on a television
is denying that it is considering changing its long held policy of exclusion but it isnt denying the presence of at least one female in a heretofore all male program
jane by the media this woman is now undergoing commando training at the special warfare command center in san diego
half shaven royce leans out of the bathroom in time to catch
footage from coronado a woman in navy greens is on a beach run loaded down with backpack and m
the news footage zooms in freeze frames with the indelible image that will be used over and over in coming weeks woman cradling rifle
madonna for the st century
my poster girl
senator dehavens office still has not released the identity of the woman but dehaven is confirming that g
jane has outlasted many of her male counter parts in the program said to be one of the most grueling anywhere
joining us now on washington tonight for the feminist perspective is gloria allred live from royce snaps it off
he cant take anymore
beneath the coffered ceiling of a great beau art hall one of washingtons power tribes is celebrating
we find gowned women tuxedoed men gold braided naval officers a swing band and
secretary hayes newly confirmed
he beams as he dances with his wife
compliments and friendly barbs come from all directions congratulations mr
say hello to the president for me
maybe now you can change that carpet in your office teddy
so what was the deal you made with dehaven
or was it the devil
always get them confused
didnt you hear
effective immediately all navy vessels can no longer be referred to as she
brays of laughter
royce excusing his way through the crowd fixating on the bar leading his dial a date winner by the hand
conversations drift into earshot women are child bearers
now were going to make them killers
just dont have the upper body strength
how strong do you need to be to launch a rocket
to push a button or pull a trigger
royce cant get away from it
are we going to dance
not right now
just yards from the bar a pentagon e ringer snags royces elbow
hows life across the river
little slow sir
whens the pentagon going to send me a good crisis
ill check my out basket in the morning
say do you know
the e ringer turns to make introductions but finds his circle of friends embroiled in the topic du jour but men have trained as athletes for years
women have been at it for what couple of decades
do we really know the limits of their strength
or their endurance
you know years ago women marathoners were minutes off the pace of the men
now the womens time is probably only minutes off
but what do female soldiers really contribute
i mean why is this g
jane there instead of a man
eyes drift to royce inviting him into the fray
to dial a date you wait right here
ill get the drinks
heading upstairs with an iceless rum
royce finds a calm and secluded place to get drunk in peace and quiet
take my word for it
its just not going to happen
not now not anytime soon
youre guaranteeing that
royce frowns he thought he was alone
he tracks the voices to a forced air vent beside the chaise
i have it on unorthodox but reliable authority that combat positions will remain off limits
despite whats happening with our babe in boyland
alarms go off in royces head
he moves quickly to a railing looks down
royces pov of two naval officers on the floor below
they stand beside a matching vent
its impossible to see faces from this angle but one man has a distinct bald spot
well isnt that what these test cases are supposed to decide
thinking unless of course youre suggesting that g
jane is on her way to becoming jane doe
all im saying is that we wont be integrating despite the rhetoric coming off capitol hill despite whats happening in coronado
and you did not hear it from me
a conspiratorial handshake
the men split up
royce flashes down the stairs
hitting main floor he looks around and then bumps into
there you are
can we please dance now
over her shoulder royce spies bald spot heading for the cloak room
royce commandeers the nearest j
take a dance
royce bobs and weaves through the crowd trying to keep sight of
pushing through the exit doors
only steps behind royce shoulders through the doors
and blasts outside intending to shake some answers out of bald spot
but here royce finds
a dozen naval officers waiting for their cars
all of them now wear caps
royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men
but it could have been anyone
a high speed transport seafox is slamming over swells
lashed to one side is a rubber life boat
in that order
five second intervals
englands crew lines up for cast and recover drills one by one they speed roll off the transport
and drop into the life boat
after quickly stabilizing they roll off the life boat
and disappear underwater like human bullets
england is last to cast off
treading water she scans for
it makes a hard turn in the water and starts back
the recovery rig a big flexible loop is lowered into position
still hauling ass seafox picks up the trainees in reverse order england slutnik cortez
they each stab an arm through the passing loop
and vault back aboard slick as hell
bettern sex in a car crash
but now theyre bearing down fast on
she braces as best she can
as seafox thunders past she stabs for the loop
and snags it with her hand
but only her hand
hanging on grimly jordan drags face down in torrential water
her mouth gropes for clean air but cant find it
if she doesnt let go soon shell drown
at the stern the chief spots jordan bobbing up in the boats wake
to pilot next recovery
keep goin keep goin
coughing up water jordan watches seafox speed on toward mccool and flea
they make textbook recoveries
shes the only one who couldnt cut it
head hung jordan showers alone
you know the israelis
christ how long has he been there
just standing in the doorway
they tried women in the war
with forced calm jordan squeaks off the water and finds a towel
permission to get dressed sir
it seems the men couldnt get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs
israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission often endangering their own lives
they dont use women anymore
moving closer sir someone mentioned you received the navy cross
may i ask what you got it for
for pulling a pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia
so when a man tries to rescue another man hes a hero
but when he tries to rescue a woman hes gone soft
could you have pulled that pound man clear lieutenant
she cant say yes
she wants to but cant
females in combat situations impact unit cohesion
men fight better without women around
and that is an historical fact
it also seems like a problem with the mens attitude sir
so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead
she shoulders past
the chief gives her a few steps before dropping his bomb england went out with a stress fracture
that puts you in charge lieutenant
off balance mccools that same rank
were both j
you were commissioned one month earlier which makes you the senior officer
passing her on his way out remember
there are no bad crews only bad leaders
trainees are getting familiar with m machine guns firing short burst at downfield targets
pissed no operational experience and now shes callin the shots
suppose shell wanna eat with us now
jordan overhears them bitching
she steps up to an open slot and proceeds to wail away with her m tracer rounds blazing
her target vaporized she keeps wailing madly taking out slutniks target
finally she stops
one burst one body oneil
what the fuck you trying to do
spell your name
to class you are not infantry
your firepower is limited
excessive killing only risks compromise
reloading jordan tosses a look at slutnik and cortez
aint nobody bitchin now
training coming up
eating at a table with other women jordan turns to see blondell setting down her tray
they take you away to san clemente island
half the guys quit when they come back
supposed to be just hell and a half
thats what i hear
can i ask you somethin lieutenant
how come youre doing this
i mean were kinda curious
just some of the women
walking across the base i dont know if theres any single reason
but my father was navy
and he had this old time recruiting poster in his den
it showed a girl trying on a sailors uniform while saying gee i wish i were a man
id join the navy
was maybe years old when i first saw it and even then it felt wrong
made me mad
and i dont think a month has gone by that i havent thought about that poster
gee i wish i were a man
ive been accused of that wish
the woman i saw you with
just a friend
we have friends too you know
but are there
i mean how many
more than youd guess
its just that we dont hold coffee klatches
if more then three of us get together at any one time the guys think its some kind of uprising
sounds funny now but its really not
we have to be careful
the navy still knows how to put on a witch hunt
reaching the quarterdeck they scan a message board
jordan finds a half dozen phone slips for her
into phone ive been trying you for five days
dont they give you messages
its hard to find time to sleep royce
much less keep up with my phone life
how hard they making it on you
jordan sighs and slumps against the phone kiosk
where to start
i feel like theres men here theres women here then theres men
but hey whatd i expect
intercutting jordan and royce well not this
i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago
got some fresh stuff about you
you may be in a hostile camp
i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn
dont you know
how theyre talking about you
i saw an article
i cant walk two blocks in washington without hearing about g
youre all over the place and whether you wanted it or not the feminists are sizing you up for that poster
jordans face sours with an errant thought
so why are you telling me this
big symbols make big targets jordan
i think someones gunning for you
you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too
im only trying to warn you in case well let me warm you im going though with this
the more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish
so dont expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay
thats not what i want jordan
it is and it isnt
still cant make up your mind huh
gotta go royce
you watch your ass
ill join the crowd
a helo warms up on its pad
crew six approaches garbed in black wetsuits loaded down with weapons and rucksacks
jordan is at the lead
the helo is airborne
sitting on rucksacks trainees slather their faces with green camouflage paint
over the infiltrate
establish your hide site
record any movement of troops vehicles patrols any activity inside your scan
if you are compromised you have two options
newberry is the new sixth man
hes young enough to still have a hyperactive adams apple
evasive maneuvers or radio for emergency extraction sir
if you are extracting be damn sure to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training
a helo cannot extract you from a wooded area
you must bring it down in a clearing
whats the minimum clearance for an mh black hawk mccool
feet six inches sir
you will be penalized for early extraction but you will be penalized more for capture trust me far more
welcome to the helo swoops low over the water moon silhouetting
black figures helo cast into the ocean
last out jordan is poised to follow when
dont back down
jordan looks back
what the hell does that mean
offering no elaboration pyro signals go
jordan springs clear
and knifes into black water
the helo patters away
an inky stillness overtakes the world
jordan activates a red light beacon sweeps it around revealing her position to
five black faces regroup around her
feel right at home mccool
they secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks
jordan checks a heat bearing compass
nodding direction south southeast
and i dont want to hear another word till were underground
pushing rucksacks ahead of them they start swimming towards
a moonlit shoreline
half mile ahead
jordans crew reaches shallow water
they deflate their vests and rucksacks
jordan trades her face mask for night vision goggles
night vision pov sweeping the rocks
nothing at first
then two hostiles appear patrolling the rocks
jordan motions down
six faces sink from sight
night vision underwater pov of the hostile patrol moving on
on jordans cue the crew sheds flippers and begins scaling rocks
theyve made landfall
montage racing the coming sun jordans crew builds their hide site
filling sand bags
telescoping open a roof pole fanning out spars
laying canvas roof panels into place
camouflaging the panels
sprinkling sanitizing powder around the perimeter to ward off animals
a snake slithering across the ground
as it nears the hide site
a knife whacks its head off
slutnik picks up the carcass kicks dirt over the severed head
camera pans the island awash in morning light
woodlands lie distant
a road is the only man made feature until in foreground we find a spotting scope poking from the ground
scope pov of the road
fast attack vehicles approach
peering into scope got two favs moving south
four banditos aboard carrying
h machine guns
jordan repeats the info into a digital tape recorder adds the time
newberry get a photo
entering my scan now
scope pov of the favs disappearing down the road
everyone relaxes as much as six people can in a hole five feet wide
mccool opens up mres meals ready to eat slutnik guts his snake
im trying to eat here
so am i
cortez finishes pissing into a tin pot
he transfers the waste to a zip lock baggy offers the pot
he looks at jordan
she eyes the pot tempted and nettled at the same time
dont wanna evacuate cuz someone came down with uric poisoning el tee
abruptly jordan unzips drops her pants sticks the pot under her
it raises eyebrows its a far cry from when she was covering up in cold water
didnt even bitch about the seat did i
wide view as a lone figure appears on foot
got an unknown here
yards north northeast
they pile up at mccools scope
jordan bulls her way through
scope pov its a women
dressed in civilian clothes she collects firewood
and shes coming this way
she part of the training
i dont know
theres another one
mccool takes a second look
scope pov of the women drawing closer
and finally looking dead bang at us
she does an about face and walks away
think were had
i aint gonna shoot her
lemme do it
pushing him away hey
aint your call man
he looks to jordan
pri one is to protect the mission
if she represents a real threat we have to do it
pleased cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel
to mccool but did she see us
do you know for a fact that we are compromised
not for sure
if not firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area
now how smart is that
a beat mighta been civilian
they got regular peeps on this island dont they
the asphalt road shimmers with midday heat
suddenly a troop carrier roars over a rise
scope pov of the troop carrier braking hard
hostiles spill out the rear and fan out all around us
at scope banditos on the east perimeter
shit she was part of it
whats the word el tee
were about one minute from a major take down here
hold on jordan heart skipping
did she really make the wrong call
all right fire and evade maneuvers
drop everything but weapons and the prc radio were gonna be high speed low drag all the way to the link up site
now she wants to shoot
they come out of the hide site like atomic locusts splintering into three groups and laying down suppressive fire as they blitz for
hostiles fire and pursue
flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath him
he goes down like a doped race horse
suddenly exposed another crew scrambles into daylight flea ran right over their hide site
slutnik yanks flea out gets him back on his feet
breathing like asthmatics jordans crew regroups at the link up site just inside the woods
flea comes in hobbling
this aint workin right
whats our go to shit plan oneil
this aint even workin wrong
a beat as jordan deliberates
she doesnt want to go out like this
really dont wanna be captured el tee
heard some bad things
snatching the radio basher basher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction
stand by for a prc fix
as a helo pirouettes in midair
jordans crew lopes through the woods searching for a place to bring the helo down
right on their heels
artillery simulators thump thump thump illumination grenades pop and flare
this may not be war but itll do until the real thing comes along
pilots pov buzzing treetops searching
on the run feet six inches
im lookin im lookin
finally they break into a clearing
is it big enough
doesnt care smoke it
jordan chucks a smoke grenade
pilots pov yellow smoke rises from the woods
we swoop toward it
whirling smoke the helo descends
jordans crew breaks early trying to get there the instant it touches down
but before they can
an fav crashes through the underbrush m s barking in the helos direction
the helo bounds away
jordans crew tries to retreat but a second fav cuts them off
pilots pov of the action below growing smaller and smaller jordans crew
laying down weapons
jordans pov brush slapping her face
crew six is being hauled through the woods hands tied back boots around their necks pulled along by
we assume theyre instructors in camouflage paint but were moving so fast its impossible to be sure
camp disturbingly authentic
a dozen trainees are already here held in pens of bamboo and barbed wire
flea mccool slutnik cortez newberry all five get tossed into a pen
jordan is pulled away
where are you
where are you taking her
jordan is thrown to the ground
her eyes go wide when she sees a row of steel boxes nearby
theyre scarcely larger then coffins
hands push jordan inside the box
she has to curl up fetally just to fit
no answer please how long
the lid bangs closed
a lock ratchets footsteps retreat
daylight sheets in through ventilation slats
when her eyes adjust jordan finds markings on the lid and walls
scratchings made with a nail
the memoirs of previous tenants
dont know how much i can take
a little taste of death
save the nail
then the real kick in the teeth its been three days now
as hostiles pull flea out of the pen
a banging wakes jordan
are they coming for her
but footsteps leave
a groan from the adjacent box
who is it
a beat you know i had an apartment about this size once
they got your crew too
intagliata was out chasing breakfast
they found his tracks
you really came back for more
when i was sittin behind a desk in washington it made sense somehow
blame it on my big brother
he was spec recon
and the stories he used to tell
if you got a good one wick
anything to get her mind off this box
out of this box
now intercut jordan and wickwire lying like fraternal twins in their wombs of steel one time he was doing a rekkie of the libyan coastline
this is like right before we bombed khadaffi into the past tense
so his crew does a nighttime infil maps all the big artillery placements and stuff then turns around to get the hell gone
but between them and the water are five libyan guards all armed to the nuts
they had to kill em
nah they were dead ass asleep
but on every guards chest they left one marlboro cigarette
just a little calling card to say theyd been there and could come back any time they wanted
thats a good story
so the shit you gotta go through
to get from here to there
brother said it was worth it
worth the training
worth the divorce
he was married
you got anybody wick
it hurts to think about it
the gunkhole harbor
howd you make it last time wick
howd you get through this part
a beat last time i didnt
jarred lets keep talkin wick
just keep talkin to me
royce stops for a newspaper
as he pays something else catches his eye
he picks up
a people magazine
the grainy image of g
jane fills the cover
a photo inset much clearer shows a beaming dehaven
behind every great woman
shaking head suitable for framing
got time for a brain pick
reading as he walks a former cia spook looks up to find royce in lockstep
it surprises him not many people here talk to him unless theyre in trouble
the spook is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be right at home on easter island this is a man whos seen most of the worlds ills and
thought you two were file closed
you knew about us
thought you knew i knew
royce and the spook enter
the vault like door closes emphatically
ensuring their privacy computer no transcription no com link no data link
shut down sequence niner mark
all around screens go blank phone lights extinguish
they sit at the conference table
just two guys doing headwork
so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way
the e ringers
full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time when congress is already swinging the axe
agreeing congress cuts military bleeds
but pentagons a big place
lets narrow the sights
theyve made it clear they dont want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for womens heads
whats it gonna cost to make a fleet of tridents co ed
sabotage born of economics
wouldnt be a first
but is hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure
just to spite dehaven
lets aim higher
the white house
if jordan wins dehaven wins in spades
well its been said that the only man the president fears aint no man
the first female president
dont for a second think she didnt leak this story
jane gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all
if you were the president wouldnt that put a little piss in your shoes
i dont know
this aint about some little soldier girl sloggin her way through commando school
the implications go way beyond
christ i dont want to see her take a fall
she thinks i do but
i take it this file is still open
shaping his words even tough i dont talk to her every day i still talk to her every day
know what i mean
nodding okay so now work it from the other end
think about california and how things might be handled there
scoffing what someone on base
this is what you get for brain picking an old cia spook
but if i needed to control the outcome of this test case thats how id do it
a man in place
makes everything very controllable
jordans pov the box opening
daylight assaulting us blowing out our eyes
disembodied hands pulling us out
legs hobbled uniform soiled jordan is led past a row of huts
she looks like she got hit by a train and got back up
jordans pov vision still blown out
but inside the pen we make out trainees now
one guy wrings out a sock and drinks from it
jordan moves past huts
volatile voices spill out as trainees get interrogated
jordans pov outside one hut we see flea
at least we think its him strapped face down to a table sobbing quietly he wears a slinky dress and whores makeup
they broke him and its an ugly ugly sight
what is your fathers name
prowling the hut is her interrogator
her chaperon through hell
simple question lieutenant
no reason not to answer
what is your fathers name
dick jane and spot
are you hungry
whats your favorite food
well try to get it for you
green eggs and ham
youre not going to get anywhere
you might as well put me in the cage
you are in the cage oneil
right here right now
should i be afraid
right down to your worthless womb and ill tell you why
this is my island
and here i can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world
take another scan of my little joy boy outside
if i can do that to a navy seal whats gonna happen to you
it makes jordan think and yes it makes her afraid
continuing the psychological strip search why didnt you shoot the woman oneil
wasnt deemed a threat
she led us right to you
thats no threat
jordan rubs her head
so long ago
how did the call come down
would you have shot if it was a man
i mean depends on the others already told me oneil
they wanted to shoot but you wouldnt let them
because you went soft on another women thats not right
thats what your crew said
are they lying
or are you
i think youre the liar
im not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage
you wear the bars you made the call and you got your whole crew we didnt know we were compromised
firing would onlyve given away our position
you think we should go easy on women oneil
she stares a beat knowing its a loaded question
im so glad we agree
with stunning ferocity he grabs her by the neck pushes her out the door
and throws her onto a table
in the pens all faces turn to watch
even instructors stop what theyre doing as
the chief pushes jordans head down and jams up behind her
didnt you know youd be raped if you were captured
didnt you even think about that
just like your men do
i think we oughtta practice it just so you know what to expect
he flips her over rips off her belt starts tearing open her pants
should i practice bleeding too sir
would that make me a better soldier
he covers her mouth her whole face with one hand
to the men any of you can stop this
just give me the location of one more hide site and it ends right here
in the pen wide eyed someones trippin out here
the chief jerks jordan up whirls her around like a dead dance partner slams her face first into the pen to give the guys a good look at whats happening
to that pretty face
three crews are still on this island somewhere
who knows where
the men trade itchy looks
some do know
dont do it dont do it
the chief throws her down like garbage
whos gonna tell me
whos gonna be chivalrous and stop this abuse
what you want to see her get mauled
is that it
the men shift anxiously
should they talk
behind the chief jordan staggers to her feet
dont tell him shi the chief whirls decks her a crescent kick
instructors lurch forward instinctively
waving them back shes fine
squatting beside when i put you down oneil take the hint and stay down
she licks her bloody teeth and considers kicking his balls into his brainpan
instead she makes a move to get up
he grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm
for her ears only i am saving your life oneil
you may not know it but i do
youre an inferior soldier a bad officer and i dont want you learning that inconvenient truth when youre stuck in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy lines and dont know
how the fuck to get out
you get out now oneil
seek life elsewhere
and if you cant do it in front of me do it behind my back
pinning her down with just his eyes he rises and starts away
behind him jordan struggles to rise
an anxious murmur races through the men they dont want to see this
they dont want to see her crucified
hearing the chief turns back to see
jordan wobbling to her feet
fuck you and the boat you rode in on
tight on the faces of her crewmates slutnik cortez mccool
in their eyes a new respect
the chief see it
instructors see it
to instructors were done here
beaten he walks right out of camp
wordless instructors open the pens unlock the boxes
wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight
but this time he made it
a medic tries to help jordan but she pushes him away walking drunkenly for
she begins wiping the makeup from his face
make you a deal flea
never tell me how i look and ill never tell you
the chief chucks gear onto a transport boat
he knows its pyro
you dont think shed be raped if she were captured
you dont think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men
you broke a dozen training rules back there before i lost count
ive had it
just because they pay me like a baby sitter doesnt mean im gonna be one
shes a trainee just like the others
why are you coming down so hard
shes an officer
theres a higher standard
shes a women and thats why youre ridin her bareback
of course it is
and im gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal rights thing that real lives are gonna be lost
maybe mine maybe yours
i oughtta report you
i think you probably would if you didnt know i was right
as a limo moves heads for the capitol building
dehaven snags a buzzing phone
anxious did you hear
she made it through s
got a call this morning from not that
the white house just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would in one stroke void all remaining elements of the combat exclusion laws
the phone suddenly weights a ton dehaven dumps it on the seat beside her
hold on her disbelieving face
hand carrying a report flag officer hurries down a corridor pushes through a door
hold on the door marker secretary of the navy
without telling us they do this
with absolutely no lead time
at his desk hayes scans the report with a deepening frown
to hayes mr
secretary if this bill passes
forget our three year plan
theyre rushing the cadence
well be forced to reorganize the navy from top to bottom overnight
what the hell is the president trying to do
steal dehavens thunder
i think its more important sir to decide what were going to do since its apparent this issue is not going away quietly
and which one of you told me she wouldnt last a week
the flags squirm
shaking his head hayes moves to a window that offers a stunning view of arlington national cemetery
years in the pentagon i finally rate an office with a window and it looks out over the worlds largest graveyard
think its a sign
it reflects the moon
tilt down to reveal a new batch of helmets the casualties of s
a graveyard of its own
jordan exits with purchases
her face is still bruised from s
with a minute to kill she peruses a bulletin board casually
but a raised voice leads her eyes to
at a phone kiosk he hangs up emphatically
he looks flustered when he spots jordan
sorry didnt mean to thats okay
just an ex girlfriend
and know i remember why
first big night of liberty and no date
youre pathetic wickwire
maybe ill just head over to mcps with the others have a drink or four
dont wanna come do you
touching bruises i cant go out
not like this
i think you look beautiful
thanks for lying
but youre the class officer wick and itd just be weird if we hook up
catching up blondell exits the exchange
forgot i needed oregano and
she sees wickwire
an awkward beat for them all
do you uh know
were going over to her place to make salad and pasta
just you know nothing special
thought id ask
jordan and blondell head for the parking lot
hold on wickwire looking after them
thinking it through
charts are being passed around the room
every trainee takes one including jordan
underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers and as such they are subject to variances due to water temperature
thats why when clearing mines we always use two timers
the charts now being passed out contain calculations you must memorize before
a military cop fills the classroom doorway
frowning johns joins the cop for a private discussion
youre wanted at the c
the yeomans desk is unattended
noticing the x
s door open jordan peers inside to find
she looks scared out of her mind
before she and jordan can speak the yeoman materializes
this way lieutenant
theyre expecting you
see me sir
are both here
uncomfortable i dont know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so i wont try
claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization of the same sex variety
specifically that you were
seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming
a beat laughing in relief sir if someone is suggesting that im a lesbian theyre wrong
s face remains grim
he isnt relieved
theyre very wrong
and id like to know where you got this information
on the c
s nod the x
opens an adjoining office
hes stiff as a groom on a wedding cake
im sorry oneil
but as class officer its my obligation to report all violations
this is insane
youve got no proof
from report you were seen leaving ensign blondells apartment at approximately whereupon physical affections were exchanged in public
in addition you have been seen frequenting the base exchange the mess hall the because the men didnt want me eating with them
jesus christ lets get this right
to wickwire rejoin your class lieutenant
only to jordan i wish i didnt have to do this jordan
sir i just want you to know that this is either a gross mistake or someones vindictive bullshit
in no way did anything happen between ensign blondell and myself
were just friends
so youre saying the charges have no validity whatsoever
jordan opens her mouth to confirm and hesitates realizing where this might be headed
what the collateral damage might be
im saying were just friends
i find this as distasteful as you lieutenant
but if its on my desk its on my shoulders
theres going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty
you should prepare yourself
if theres any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud
i dont see how oneil
jordan moves to the door
again she makes eye contact with blondell
now we understand why shes so scared theres a witch hunt brewing
turning back sir
i was not under your command
would the inquiry still go forward
im not sure what would you have the discretion to end it right then and there
shes offering her own head on a silver platter and the c
actually hesitates before answering
i believe so
mccool and flea exit a classroom with other trainees
they spot jordan approaching
so whatd he want
she passes them robotically
flea realizes where shes going
no no no no
they lurch after her grabbing her stepping in her way
mccool and flea jerk to a stop the chief has emerged from the instructors office
helpless they watch as
jordan mounts the stairs to the bell
takes up the baton
and hits the bell like a tyko drummer
ring one on the pained faces of her crewmates
ring two on the chief
taking no joy in it
just accepting it as inevitable
ring three on wickwire as he walks across the base
his regrets are obvious
the ice floes are gone
the river banks are budding green
soon camera finds a power boat making its way upriver
a lone figure sits on the prow
dressed in civvies gunnysack between her legs shes back in virginia with nothing more than what she left with
around a river bend appears
the gunkhole harbor
the boat docks
jordan springs clear waves a worn out thanks starts up the dock
but now she comes to a stop seeing
stepping out of the house
extremely wide river shimmering behind them they meet on the dock
a charged stand off where do they pick up
can they pick up
then jordan drops her gunnysack and steps into his wide spread arms
royce wraps her up as if to never let go
for the first time in this whole ordeal jordan begins crying sobbing uncontrollably
in her ear i want to kill them
i want to kill the guys who made you cry like this
an hour later
sharing a quiet moment jordan and royce cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that overlooks the potomac and a fiery sunset
all i wanted was an honest chance
and if i couldnt get it i couldnt stay
and this class officer
you think he was just trying to get even
striking back for
though it didnt seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it
a beat did i say he was class officer
almost like someone put him up to it
no shortage of suspects
or maybe even turrentine
she looks at him sidelong
tell me you didnt keep a file on me
close on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase
one contains clippings g
jane photos editorials political cartoons
another holds records of coronado personnel jordans crewmates instructors the base brass
somebody was yankin your stings jordan maybe from miles away
i wanted to know who
i still do
she shakes her head resisting
do the headwork with me
its done with royce
let it go
someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and youre not gonna fight back
im tired of fighting back
i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay
well before you crawl off to die jordan give me five minutes of good headwork
agitated she walks away
a phone rings until the machine picks up
pulling a file john james urgayle
what about him
instructors typically pull three year assignments
this guys in and out in one year your year
that sound right
sounds like an amazing coincidence
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy
i dont know i dont care
well pardon me if i do
now who else
who couldve leveraged a class officer like that
cmon jordan keep your head in the game
under dialog we hear some of the incoming call just got word today
the senator wants you to know that shes disturbed by the matter and shell be looking into it carefully to make sure you were treated fairly
if you need to reach us were here in washington
a hang up
something stirs in jordans memory
wickwire said he was dry docked in washington between stints at coronado
we can see her mind gathering speed
royce switches files quickly
wickwire thomas dane
second run at coronado
and correct they had him stashed in the appropriation liaison office whatever that is
you dont crap out of spec recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country
a revelation hes got a sea daddy somewhere
id sure like to know who
answering a phone administration ensign blondell
dont say my name
brightening lieuten or rank
but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order
you didnt have to do what you did
not for me
appreciative wickwire thomas dane
see what you can find
file in hand blondell returns to the phone
who signed as his sponsoring officer
dont see it
theres no signature
but hang on theres a note to see addendum
she finds a crisp sheet of stationary out of place among the smeared government forms
whatd you find kathy
close on the stationary
it bears an image of the capitol dome
the real capitol dome
a flag is being raised over the senate wing
a car parks at barricades
jordan and royce emerge both in uniforms
dont even dream about leaving that vehicle there
government car tow it if you want
just point us to dehavens office first
not waiting for directions jordan takes the capitol steps two at a time
weve seen this look on her face before and last time she nearly knocked the grinder bell into orbit
jordan and royce move quickly down a corridor eyes hunting passing capitol guides and their tourists
soon they find
a navy captain exits with paperwork
the captain moves on
royce holds in the doorway a beat memory nagging him
again he looks at
he has a distinct bald spot
to jordan get started here
ill catch up
picking up where he left off a few weeks ago royce follows bald spot around a corner
down a private staircase
and through a door marked naval appropriation liaison office
its not seconds from dehavens door
your name again
in a side office dehavens aide overhears
he rises quickly and enters the foyer
yes of course
im douglas champeau
unfortunately the senator is in chamber right now
how can i help you
which way is that
i mean shes on the floor of the senate
okay which way
she really cant be disturbed
but if you care to wait ill find you an office with a phone
it might be several hours but a tourist pokes in
scuse me but im here to pick up gallery tickets
see the secretary please
over the aides shoulder jordan watches as
the tourist claims tickets
hold on the bureau near the secretarys desk where the tickets are stored
on the chamber floor senators mull about consulting aides polling party mates
pages place microphones and fill the ceremonial snuff boxes readying the room for session
among the activity we find
caucusing with another democrat
dehaven looks behind her
now she looks up to behold
jordan standing in the gallery
staring down on dehaven as she is its hard to read anything into her expression but open disdain
drawn by jordans voice a capitol guard hurries down the gallery steps
royce runs interference
we can talk here or we can talk outside senator
you tell me
on the floor half the u
senate stops what its doing and looks up
in the gallery the guard is thrown off balance by the naval uniforms do royce and jordan belong here or not
confused he looks for guidance from
she notes c span cameras swinging jordans way
summoning a page cloak room
ill meet her there
towering doors swing open
dehaven appears face pleasant but harried
i always hoped wed get together though just now im gearing up for a child care vote that lieutenant thomas wickwire
about to hug jordan dehaven stops awkwardly
you know him
you nominated him for spec recon just three days after you nominated me
might we do this over lunch tomorrow
i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely did you set me up
did you set me up just to see me fail
dehaven glances back at the doors to the senate chamber the open doors
walking jordan a few steps away wickwire was there to help
to be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot
at least that was the intent
should probably ask him that
if i have to ask again senator ill be asking in front of cameras
its a threat dehaven doesnt appreciate
the senate doorkeeper appears
your esteemed colleagues are requesting two seconds walter
answering jordan in the supreme court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions
the court cited the combat exclusion laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible
that decision held for all these years until the white house days ago moved to have the exclusion laws voided
to demolish that legal foundation
isnt the president jumping on your bandwagon
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire
because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harms way
you dont know that
in face i do roper harris gallop they all come back the same
what are you saying
that a womens life is more valuable than a mans
that a womens death hurts a family more
im saying its not going to happen
not when the president is set to turn this into a third rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him
he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags
jordan shakes her head in disbelief
she has met the enemy and she is us
you were never going to let women serve in combat
you always had a safety net
or thought you did
i dont expect you to fully understand this but sometimes theres more to be gained from the fight than the victory
so the rhetoric gets you headlines
but the reality gets you in trouble
the reality is this we send far too many men off to war
i dont need to compound the problem with women
off jordans look can you honestly tell me you wanted that life
squat pissing in some third world jungle with i wanted the choice
the chance to prove myself my skills my work me
thats how it shouldve been
madam senator once again i must just hold the goddamn clock walter
not happy about it the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions
he enters the chamber
and moves behind the rostrum
holding the broom by the bristles the doorkeeper stands on tip toes
and uses the broom handle to turn back the senate clock by three minutes
its an old trick played by senior members and they all hate it when it happens to them
i once promised you a fast ticket jordan and i always meant to make good on that
come work for me
i can always use a hard charger on my team
you promise wickwire a fast ticket too
ive had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began
and thats quite verifiable
im sure it is
youll think about my offer
you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it
if i spoke with him
well i spoke with mr
hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off
no more test cases
he was only too happy to oblige
dangerously low dont play politics with me little darlin
youd be up way past your bedtime
distraught madam senator please
ill call you in a few days
she flashes a winning smile and turns away
as the chamber doors start to close behind her so i wonder what the president would think
the last image we have of dehaven is her whirling back startled
the doors boom closed in her face
through a window we see the c
with a phone pressed to his ear
he stands at attention even though wearing a bathrobe
half audible through the glass yes sir
no im not saying it would be impossible sir just
i can appreciate that sir
good night sir
hangs up and looks to jordan heretofore unseen
she waits anxiously
well if you had to go over my head lieutenant thats the way to do it
christ nothin like a call from the commander and chief to get the bowels movin
what did he say
basically he asked me if i could unring a bell
start on the helmet graveyard
hands enter frame to reclaim one helmet in particular
tilt up on jordan back in the grinder back in navy greens
the spec recon class is here
crewmates gawk like stone idiots as jordan takes her old place in the line up
to class one of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about
someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming
someone who knows i would hope what he must now do
close on wickwire
feeling the heat
wondering if they really know who it is
now the c
parks himself right in wickwires face
and unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next seconds i will make certain he faces action under the uniform code of military justice
wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell
he slows when reaching jordan considering an apology he knows would be inadequate
just walk away and never stop
as wickwire rings out it seems we have an opening for class officer
eyes swing to jordan
way ahead of them all those in favor
a chorus of ayes
jordan puddles up
chief urgayle turning it back over to you
on his way to the front the chief stops to check in with jordan
well im trying to figure out if youre stupid unlucky gluttonous or some new alloy of all three
good to see you again too sir
so youve impressed all the others
now try me
the morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the coronado bridge
in silhouette pelicans circle some dive bombing into the bay below
suddenly a helo howls across the sun scattering the birds as it heads off shore
setting watch four
flea mccool slutnik cortez newberry jordan
inside the airborne helo they synchronize their dive watches
each crew will be dropped miles out
between you and the shore is a network of mines and underwater obstacles
you will clear the obstacles you will tag the mines with your crew number
you have until hundred to make landfall
as the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck
the trainees double check wet gear and survival vests
on jordans nod they push an inflatable life boat ilb to the helo door
its rolled up into a rubber log
the one thing you can count on in any mission is that anything mechanical will fail
if you get stuck out here do not call me for you will no longer be in my class
try the coast guard
the helo pilot slows to five knots
the chief gives jordan the go ahead nod
to her crew one second intervals
the ilb splashes down into the ocean
jordans crew helo casts in after it
from the door of the circling helo the chief watches as
jordans crew swims to the ilb bobbing in the swells
flea turns a handle on the co tank meant to inflate the boat
cortez tries to help
the handle spins in his grip
this tanks not gonna cut it el tee
jordan looks skyward
feet overhead the chief gives her a parting salute as the helo lifts away
i just wonder how that happened
cortez see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear
try a wrench on that thing
the helo turns into the morning sun
pilot and co pilot drop visors
pilots pov of dots in the sun
what the hell are try
something hits the windscreen splattering red and brown
he starts to bank clear but not fast enough
more birds pepper shot the helo one shreds through the main rotor another through the tail rotor
another bird gets sucked right into
the main turbine
a sharp bang
a wicked shimmy
and now they whole helo loses power
as the pilot wrestles controls the co pilot rigs for auto gyration
but the bank they started is working against them the helo is coming down badly circling like a huge steel feather
braced the chief looks out the side door and sees ocean rushing up at him
what the shit is
shes just in time to witness
the helo hitting the water
in seconds its gone
a stunned beat
we never knew the ocean could be this quiet
when the anesthetic of shock wears off you dont suppose this is just part of
mark it mark it
what the hell you waiting for
cortez torques his wrench hard co flows into the ilb inflating it
the crew scrambles aboard
jordan digs like a dog to find a radio
base this is crew leader six
we have a downed helo miles west south west of base with three aboard
repeat we have a downed helo with three aboard
slutnik yanks a starter cord their outboard motor roars to life
the boat does a donut in the water and blasts away
the ilb powers over swells
flea is perched on the bow nose to the wind like a hunting dog
slutnik motors down
close as i can get el tee
flea cool cortez newman take your minis hit the water
they grab masks and mini tanks and dive in like dolphins
jordan snaps up the radio
base this is crew leader six
what is your e
on that rescue helo
crew leader we have a medevac rerouting from long beach but no other helos prepped at this time
seafox one and two are launching now
base dont think you copied me
we are miles out
seafox tops out at knots which makes it a no show for minutes
you copied right crew leader
were looking for options ourselves
maybe we should call the coast guard
shut your hole slutnik
visibility drops dead at feet
if theyre deeper than that
the others surface and swim in
nobodys comin outta that crash el tee
a grim beat and then a crackle on the radio
with a voice seemingly from the far side of the moon base this is basher one
ive got a small problem here
do you copy
into radio basher one this is oneil
we are barely reading you
what is your situation
feet down the helo lies canted on a reef shelf
wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment we find the chief operating out of an air pocket near the windscreen
the pilot is dead impaled on his cyclic stick head submerged
the co pilot is still alive barely
the chief struggles to keep the mans head up as he keys a survival radio
got one other heartbeat here looks touch and go
ive got a questionable leg
managed to activate the elb
if you just radio base and let them know theyll fix on that
oh and make sure they send a helo with a winch doors blocked by a reef
chief sir rescue team wont be here for minutes
whats your air situation
how many micks
the chief sizes up his air pocket
into radio that
may not be adequate
if we could just fix on him
beacons a no go for us
into radio chief did i see a flare box aboard
and can you get at it
the chief props up the co pilots head
ducks underwater to grope through wreckage
only now do we see that questionable leg he was talking about its snapped at mid calf blood rivering out
into radio show us where you are chief
again the chief goes below water
he finds a small breach in the fuselage
sticks the flare launcher through
and pulls the trigger
with a magnesium flash the flare launches
streaks toward the surface
and arcs into daylight yards behind the ilb
spotted you chief
pri one is to slip you some air so were coming down with a tank just something until the a team shows
an ominous beat
theres no air in your main tanks
they scramble to check their main dive tanks
even through the gauges show full theyre dead empty
all of them
into radio this mission wasnt about tagging mines
it was to see how you coped with mechanical failures
pretty fuckin ironic huh
its the bleakest laugh imaginable
hes circlin the drain el tee
jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard the stuff she can count on
mental turbos kicking in so we got two full mini tanks three minutes each
how much air in yours
grab an oar find a way to weight it down were gonna need it
cortez help him
you take one of the two full minis and just follow my lead
what were gonna pry em out with paddles
grabbing her oneil
our airs gonna crap out as soon as we get down there
you know that dont you
so i guess we get one shot at it
swimming in his own blood the chief starts to fade away losing consciousness
but then through the cockpit windscreen
a hazy orb of light above him
the orb grows and grows until it resolves into a flare carried by his would be savior
whyd it have to be her
reaching the downed helo mccool and cortez wedge their oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until
an opening appears
jordan and flea swim into the breach
and surface inside the wreckage
still with me
unbuckling co pilot take him first
once hes clear come back with sir let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what i say because thats the only way were all getting out
now hows your vest check out
mccools air craps out
he abandons his oar and swims for the surface
that leaves only
cortez struggling mightily to keep the escape route open
he knows his mini tank is running on empty and it scares the bejeezus out of him
flea take the pilot up slow feed him air
chief sir you and i are gonna take the express elevator outta here
remember to let your air out
twin transports seafox one and two pound across the water
instructors sweep binoculars trying to spot
newberry pops a flare skyward as slutnik downloads info over the radio
cortezs air goes dead
he gives it three more seconds eyes riveted on the underside of the helo knowing they have to come out
now jordan appears with the chief
flea is at their heels with the co pilot
cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims for the sky
the helo booms back down onto the reef
jordan yanks the cord on the chiefs vest
it inflates instantly
one arm raised jordan streaks for the surface
and supermans into daylight with the chief
they covered feet in four seconds
doing a jordan spots
seafox one coming their way
jordan waves like a shipwreck victim
not slowing seafox lowers a recovery rig into place theyre wasting no time on the pick up
remembering the last time she tried this jordan gets a death grip on the chiefs vest
shut up sir
the recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring
seafox thunders past
jordan plunges her free arm through the loop
and suddenly theyre gone whisked away by the boat
throwing a rooster tail a mile long seafox pivots on the water and heads back to base
go go go go
just like we always practice it
limousine leading a parade of vehicles reaches the base entrance
a man exits the limo to expedite matters with the base guard
senator dehaven is here for the graduation ceremonies
what are all these other vehicles
just a small press corps
and that pickup truck at the end
that would be the all woman americas cup team
into microphone special reconnaissance class you may now stand down
all buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites the former trainees erupt with one great hoo yah
what began as a class of now ends with just
sitting among the families and friends we find royce smiling through his fears
not far away sits blondell
no one claps louder
jordan trades high fives and fierce hugs with crewmates
pyro finally manages to take her aside
i was asked to give you this
its a small case
jordan opens it to find a medal of bronze and blue enamel
the navy cross
i believe he earned it for saving a mans life in saudi arabia
he wanted you to have it
he was very clear on that point
i was looking for him earlier but
the chief was granted early retirement as of hundred yesterday
by hundred he was gone
out of the navy
knowing better just a coincidence
maybe its not my place to speculate on his private thoughts
but i think the chief knew that his way his world had come and gone
jordan nods understanding
shes holding a press conference trying to turn piss into wine and doing a pretty good job of course we always prefer peace to war
but if were going to war give women a piece
give them the choice to defend their country
and if the president doesnt like that idea if he wants to continue to deny women their equal rights then ill be happy to step out back with him any
spotting her the press pleads for a photo op with both women
letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn jordan walks right past dehaven
and joins royce
together they turn and leave
senator perhaps this would be a good time for that lunch
will the americas cup team be joining us
jordan and royce walk hand in hand strolling the same beach she trained on
so here we are again
staring three years of operational duty in the face
its not like youd be completely out of reach
and maybe we could call in a few favors get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado
there are ways of dealing with these things i mean if people are so inclined
warily which is guy speak for
yes jordan ill wait for you no matter how long
finally the right answer
start tight on jordans face
even beneath the camouflage paint we can see her exhilaration
pull back to find her in a line of commandos boarding an idling c shes embarking on her first mission
keep pulling back until weve lost her completely until shes just one soldier among many indistinguishable from the rest
