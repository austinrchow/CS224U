written by andy hurst ross helford a perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless diamonds glinting in the morning sun
tounted on crushed velvet the identical diamonds are on a glass covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast marble museum hall
the stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman whos admiring them
marie cliffords creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds
she reaches out tentatively towards the glass case
not to touch the diamonds but to run her fingers over a picture thats mounted in the case below the priceless jewels
its of a mother cradling her baby daughter
todays the day mom
you here again marie
marie spins round sees the bespectacled curator s standing behind her
marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case
marie fires up her powerful bmw parked right outside the austere museum building
the powerful stereo blasts sending the birds fluttering skywards
credits appear over
ariel footage of a narrow highway maries bmw streaking through the endless tract of florida wetlands
in the water gators warm themselves in the early morning sun
moving over the vast tracts of swampland flocks of tropical birds stretch their majestic wings locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening airboats
through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing and into the town of blue bay where the nip tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off
at the local country club
marie steers her bmw into the showroom like parking lot of blue bay high school
marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot when
she slams on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car
almost gives her a heart attack throwing her forward flailing arms crashing into the stereo then snapped back by her seatbelt
she sits stock still for a second then looks up out of her windshield at the young woman scouring at her only inches from the front bumper of the bmw
the sudden jolt has changed the radio station
a newscaster rambles on
operation aimed at finally capturing the black widow suspect after a six month trail of embezzlement and fraud once again failed to snare its subject
elena sandoval stands defiantly in front of the bmw her dont fuck with me stare in direct contrast with her come fuck me clothes
blue bay police detective michael morrison was able to recover over in stolen money but the suspect described as female between eighteen and thirty remains at large
marie reaches out with a trembling hand turns off the stereo then leans out of the car window
elena smiles wryly
you will be
and she means it
the auditorium is packed with the blue bay high student body
the natural order is clear the pastel flock at the front the meat headed jocks in the center and the rejects at the back
marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends but shes still shocked by what happened out in the parking lot
handing over a present happy birthday babe
they aint diamonds but youre just gonna have to wait for those
marie tentatively opens the gift sees a pair of opal earrings
unconvincing thank you
thank you so much
are you ok hon
marie looks back to the far reaches of the auditorium where the freaks and geeks crowd round elena worshipping her like the goddess she is
ill be fine
that new girl
i almost hit her in the parking lot
you mean the towel girl the one who transferred in
jesus shes trouble
you know the only reason shes slinging towels is cos its court ordered
marie and elena make brief electric eye contact across the sea of hormonally challenged students as principal lionel mosster his ill fitting sports jacket coffee stained steps onstage
were here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you
he pauses waits for the student body to quiet down
national studies report sexual activity among students at an all time high
the students all cheer naturally
well see whos cheering when youve got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands or get slapped with a paternity suit
or arrested for date rape
but dont take my word for it
he motions behind him to kristen richards early s a natural beauty whos doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses and chad borman late s
miss richards and dr
borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand
kristen steps up to the lectern
good morning my name is kristen richards
im an officer for the miami juvenile parole board as some of you already know
quick glance at elena who rolls her eyes
but thats not what brings me here today
when i heard about principal mossters sex education program i thought id volunteer my own personal story in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes i made
back in high school all i wanted to do was get drunk stoned and laid
the students roar their approval
by my junior year my life was a blur of cheap beer anonymous sex partying every night of the week
elena covers her mouth as if to cough
through fake coughs whore
kristen ignores the slur
and then one night at some pathetic frat party someone slipped a roofie in my drink
and raped me
this quiets the auditorium
there isnt a day goes by my skin doesnt crawl when i think of the violation and humiliation i endured
i can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong headed choices i did youll be seeing dr
chad steps to the podium
thank you miss richards
my names dr
i run the forensics lab at the police department where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders
most teens like ms
richards never get their lives together
the physical scars may go away but the emotional damage stays forever
while chad drones on muddy a gremlin eyed drooler sitting in front of elena looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up on the back of the
he spots the ugly plastic bracelet locked around one of her ankles
what i think it is is it
whattchya think it is bitch
the words catch in his throat
one of them
so you cant like go more than ten miles from the cop shop
elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet
i got someones panties in a bunch
back at the podium chad leans forward making sure his words resonate with the student body
and as for the perpetrators of this heinous act even if you are still a minor you will be tried as an adult and if convicted you will do hard
he pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students
are there any questions
calling out yeah i got one for miss richards
when they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity you sued his sorry ass right
kristen is taken aback by elenas insensitivity stumbles over her words finally spitting out the sad sorry truth
uh no actually i was never able to make a positive id
all i remember was his alcohol soaked breath whispering in my ear you wont remember but youll never forget
elena cracks a sideways grin
so what youre really saying is you fucked for free
kristen has no answer to that
principal mosster does his best to control the situation
youre on thin ice young lady
like elena cares
she leans back nods
the bright florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool where a diving meet is in full swing
blue bay high school would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri county region
breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region in their school colored bikinis are scattered around the pool area
but all eyes are on the home team
masturbatory fantasies abound as the blue bay girls diving team runs through stretches
and as exquisite as these girls are they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet marie stunning in her nearly see through white bathing suit
first up district champion marie clifford
the crowd cheers watching marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above
jenny right behind waits on the ladder
jay clifford maries chisel jawed stepfather in his late thirties focuses a digital video camera on marie from the front row of the bleachers
cmon now baby you can do it
marie just rolls her eyes
your stepfathers just got a lot invested in the team
marie looks at her stepfather nods tentatively but then notices the incongruous figure of elena sidling up to him
to marie just try to keep those legs together
shouldnt be a problem for miss teen virgin
jay looks round lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the worlds hottest towel girl
as in clifford construction
i am yes but
id love to see one of your erections
jays lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air
its a spectacular sight as the beautiful marie completes a double back flip entering the water with near perfect form
she quickly resurfaces climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to jay
nice take off gotta work on the landing
i cant do any better
jay shakes a finger at her silences her immediately
no such word as cant
now do it again
marie takes a deep breath approaches the ladder once more
as shes about to start the arduous climb elena hands her a towel
bet you choke
stops marie in her tracks
whats your major malfunction
just wanted to make a wager
between best friends
marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform
you blow this dive i get those diamonds of yours
marie stops looks down on elena from the fifth rung of the ladder shakes her head
howd you know about my inheritance
talk of the town birthday girl
todays the day right
and what pray tell are you willing to wager when i win
elena thinks for a second glances back at jay with a big smile
ill stay away from your stepfather
you make it i wont be your new stepmom anytime soon
marie just stands there incredulous for a moment
take your sorry ass back to the swamps
she ascends the ladder leaving elena behind
marie clambers up onto the high dive platform tries to focus on the task at hand
but cant help but notice her nemesis below walking slowly seductively up to jay intoxicating him
marie blocks out the distraction concentrates at the task at hand stepping to the edge of the platform and the foot drop looming beyond
she slides a ring off her finger kisses it for luck
its an odd design
four curved gold ridges just ready to hold a diamond
she throws the ring into the pool ahead of her the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water and a split second before it breaks
the surface marie is airborne
she twists magnificently through the air a sight of breathtaking beauty
thank god this is in slow motion
and as she gets ever closer to the waters surface she tucks does one last back flip straightening out at the last possible instant slicing through the water with nary
marie surfaces to roaring applause
treading water she cant help but watch her jays smiling face in the bleachers
sickeningly expensive powerboats and de rigged schooners line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the clifford mansion
banners and streamers wishing marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds
partygoers soak in the blazing florida sun sip at non alcoholic punch and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff raff on
marie sits away from it all lost in thought as jenny in cutoffs and a bikini top sidles up beside her
whats the matter sweetie pissed that one judge only gave you a
marie forces a smile
denial aint just a river in egypt babe
you got diamonds on the mind
have either of you seen my video camera
marie looks round to her stepfather shakes her head bringing a bemused look to jays face
i had it at the dive meet im sure
he shrugs picks up a crystal glass hits a fork sharply against it drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers
ladies gentlemen friends raise a glass to marie on her eighteenth birthday
everyone raises their fine crystal
shes become every inch of the woman her mother hoped shed be
wherever she is now julies looking down and smiling
tears well in maries eyes
and thats why on your eighteenth birthday marie i know your mother wanted you to have
he notices out of the corner of his eyes two well dressed men standing at the entrance to his house
whoever they are jays instantly unnerved
he stumbles over his words
she wanted you to have
a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends
e glances back toward the house watching the two men enter
please excuse me
and hurries after them
marie is left dumbfounded
so close but so far
what about my present
she chases after him
marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the opulent clifford mansion past framed family photos of jay marie and the late julie
es nowhere to be found
frustrated marie finds herself alone in the kitchen
she angrily selects a bottle of champagne pops the cork
before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices
it simply cant be done
marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen back into the hallway and down towards jays study
in all construction theres delays
marie sidles up to the door jam peaks through the crack
what she sees makes the blood run cold in her veins
an imposing cuban businessman mr
barajas stands threateningly over a visibly frightened jay
another man cicatriz dressed in designer silks stands menacingly in the corner clearly the brawn of this little operation
four months is not a delay
its a disaster
you have my word mr
barajas the building is almost finished
just give me a week two tops
barajas nods to cicatriz who moves in on jay with lightning quickness holds a razor sharp knife against his thumb
we are long past the negotiation stage
cicatriz runs the steel blade across jays thumb
marie has to cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood stain the spotless white carpet
for every day the building goes unfinished well take a finger
a sinister grin stretches across cicatrizs lips
clifford you finish before the eleventh day
and with that the cuban men head to the door
marie scrambles away her heart pounding
shes halfway down the hallway when mr
barajas and cicatriz exit jays study
she turns tries to look innocent as the cuban businessmen stare her down
ay appears in the doorway sweat cascading from his brow
shouldnt you be with your friends
i was just
cicatriz takes a step towards her
to marie ill be right there
with your gift
wait outside ok
marie backs away never taking her eyes off the intimidating cuban men
marie stumbles down the lawns past the semi clad partygoers in a daze as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne
jenny and the dive team wait by the dock and welcome their lost sheep with open arms
did you get the key
are you blue bays richest bitch
maries thoughts are drowned out by the roar of a powerful engine
all attention turns to a rusted motorcycle as it streaks across the verdant lawns leaving a spray of mud in its wake
nd atop the bike
elena in skintight leathers
holy shit who invited her
maries slightly drunken eyes narrow
elena brings the bike to a screeching halt inches from the surprised guests
the ultimate partycrasher
this is a private party
dont mind me
i aint here for your stupid party
shes striding towards the mansion towards jay whos standing at the patio doors an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands
get the hell outta here
marie stumbles after elena grabbing her from behind holding her back
theres a tense moment before
damn girl whattcha been drinking
stay away from my stepfather
and thats it
marie lashes out with a haymaker punch
connects on elenas jaw and she goes reeling back
but its ignited the street fighter in her and she comes roaring back into the fray ramming into marie and together they tumble to the ground
he crowds gather to watch the cat fight in equal parts appalled and aroused
its a hair pulling teeth gnashing make up smearing wrestling match no holds barred
the drunken marie has the upper hand the alcohol fueling her rage
what the hells going on here
and that stops the fight right there and then
marie looks up to see a red faced jay standing over her
trash is just looking for a meal ticket
elena gets to her feet licks the blood from her split lip
betcha proud of little marie now huh
he hauls marie to her feet thrusts her towards the mansion
groans from the crowd but jays mind is made up
jays already walking away
im going to the condos
sleep it off whydontcha
elena watches jay stride away like a lioness stalking her prey
work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site on prime beachfront real estate
these places would sell for millions if they were ever finished
in a concrete makeshift office on the top floor of the condo building jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the steel door swings open
inside are stacks of cash piled high along with a shiny new handgun
jay flicks through the money shaking his head
sotto not enough
just not enough
a clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun from the safe before closing it once more spinning the lock
jay walks out of his office into the half finished top floor of the condos
exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind schedule jay really is
he swings the gun round impotently seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light
finally jay lowers the weapon
it looks like he might collapse until he catches himself palms flat against the wall head down
he reels around sees elena moving toward him brushing aside the thick plastic sheeting
she has a bottle of beer in one hand a video camera in the other
jays video camera to be precise
what are you doing here
you promised to show me your erection
elena focuses the video camera on jays crotch
makes him incredibly uncomfortable obviously
is that my
elena thrusts the bottle of beer at jay
lighten up jay
jay takes the bottle from her sets it down on the concrete floor
i think its time you left
this brings a teasing pout to elenas lips
is that any way to treat maries new best friend
jays taken aback
youre best friends are you
weve been having sleepovers
talking about boys swapping tips
shes been teaching me about shopping ive been teaching her about giving mind blowing head
jays taken aback once more
how much more aback can he be taken
he reaches out and blocks the video camera lens
gimme the camera back
elena saunters slowly past brushing up against him
keeps the camera trained on his worried face
come get it
jays reaching his elastic limit
he reaches for the camera but elena wont let go
they wrestle for control of the video camera
and finally the camera slips from both their grasps flies across the room and shatters on the concrete floor
elena runs her finger under jays chin then turns and walks away leaving jay standing there all taken aback
a drunken marie brings her bmw to a swerving halt outside the construction site
she takes a swig from the champagne bottle on the passenger seat for dutch courage
sotto its present time
she reaches for the car door handle but comes up short
when she looks back up shes in for some taking aback of her own
elena comes walking out of the building site and the two girls lock eyes
theres an uncomfortable moment before elena flashes a satisfied smile and walks away
what the hell
maries about to get out of her car when jay comes walking out of the site looks around the lot sees maries car
what are you doing here at this time of night
marie stammers to find the words
wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier
i was out of line
jays mood lightens
when we admit our mistakes we grow
youve made an important step
what about my present
meet me at the museum
before school tomorrow
now go home get some sleep im gonna finish up here
he walks away and a smile creeps across maries face
a perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless mother daughter diamonds glinting in the morning sun
marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels
you really think youre ready for your inheritance
marie looks round to see jay striding into the museum still in the same clothes as yesterday
it was what mom wanted
jay looks at her sternly
youre the only one who can open that lock but im the one with the key
she wanted you to have the diamonds when you were responsible enough to know what to do with them
jay shakes his head slowly deliberately
underage drinking prying into my personal affairs fighting
but theyre mine
mom left them to me
theyre yours when i say theyre yours
for the time being ive got some major problems at the construction site
deadlines have to be met
well talk again when youve done some growing up
jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter starts walking her back towards the massive wooden doors
please dont fight me on this
were team clifford remember
without conviction team clifford
shes stuck in an awkward embrace with her step father
jay leads marie down the stone steps outside the quaint museum building
but as they approach his car theyre hit by
blue and the whine of sirens has jay spinning around in surprise looking over to see four police cruisers come to a screeching halt
what the hell
half a dozen of blue bays finest lead by the dashing young officer entwistle draw their badges approach jay
can i help you officer
youre under arrest on suspicion of rape
jays jaw drops to the ground
there must be some mistake this isnt possible
jay whats going on
entwistle puts a powerful hand on jay leads him to the first police cruiser
j call my lawyer tell him to meet me down the station
this is outrageous
entwistle gets into the police cars passenger seat
i didnt do anything i swear
im afraid shes got a different story
elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger
she stops in front of the two way mirror examines her reflection
tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab on her lip covering the wound marie inflicted at the party
and slowly elena starts to press on the cut until the blood starts to flow once more
theres a quiet knock on the door and elena quickly lowers her hand looks round
kristen richards the young parole officer who so heart wrenchingly told her story at blue bay high earlier comes quietly into the gray room
elena just looks up at her pitifully
could you tell me what happened
through stifled sobs elena states
it was jay clifford
he raped me
the interview room door swings open and detective michael morrison s enters
hes the personification of the term overworked underpaid
you understand the seriousness of this allegation young lady
elena nods weakly
and you know that well leave no stone un turned in the investigation
therell be a battery of forensics tests youll have to take humiliating stuff
and background checks digging up all kinds of dirt
and youll have to testify in court face the man youre accusing
crocodile tears roll down elenas cheeks
you sure you want to go through with this
no harm no foul you can just walk away right now
please detective this isnt the right time
i aint lying
you think im lying
kristen turns to her young ward
if youre telling the truth you wont find a more sympathetic ear
if im telling the truth
and if youre not theres gonna be trouble you understand
this is already trouble
the man youre accusing happens to be a friend of mine and when the dna tests prove youre lying im gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks
mark my words
elena withers under his glare
jay huddles in the small interview room along with marie and theo bloom his sharp suited attorney
were gonna sue their asses til time runs backwards
to marie youve gotta believe me i would never could never do anything like this you know that dont you
marie takes his hand squeezes it
were team clifford
jay forces a tired smile
thats my girl
the door swings open and morrison enters
jay stands shakes morrisons hand
to marie would you mind waiting outside while me and your stepdad have a little chat
marie looks to jay doesnt want to leave
its ok honey
michael and i are old pals
reluctantly she leaves letting the door swing closed after her
jay sits back down
morrison takes a chair opposite
hows the divorce treating you
shes taken me for everything im worth
i swear to god im never trusting another woman as long as i live
this is most egregious detective my client has pressing matters at his construction site
he cant afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense
to jay look were taking her statement right now gonna run every forensic test in the book
guarantee the casell come apart like a watch
jay nods certain he can beat this rap
she had my camcorder
recorded what happened
it should still be at the construction site
itll clear my name
youll be outta here by tonight
marie waits out in the anonymous hallway talking a mile a minute on her cell phone
i cant believe it jenny
it just doesnt make sense
i mean i know jay
i know hed never
when a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly only to see kristen come out walk towards her followed by someone
maries view is blocked by kristen until the parole officer passes her and reveals
this cant be
a look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on maries beautiful face
elena just smiles blows her a kiss
no such word as cant
police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building site
officers cordon off the road as forensics teams photograph every inch of the building
standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate mr
barajas accompanied as ever by cicatriz
they are both on cellphones both talking angry fast spanish
plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished condos
the white suited forensics team work meticulously led by the tireless dr
chad borman delicately dusting anything and everything that might yield evidence
morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by police tape
hes looking at jays smashed digital video camera now bagged and tagged as evidence
sexual predators often keep a trophy
morrison spins sees kristen
he stumbles with his words not used to talking to beautiful women
maybe he recorded the rape
morrison looks at the remains of the camera
and maybe he didnt
well never know
forensics said itd take months to fix it
he looks up into kristens hypnotic eyes
we were never properly introduced
she offers her hand and morrison shakes it
was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down
she hands morrison a business card which he absently stuffs into his pocket
you think maybe you could lean on the girl
get her to drop this nonsense
we all know shes lying
with all this black widow shit going down we just dont have the time or manpower to
she might not be lying you know
what makes you think that
just a look in her eye
i have some experience
morrison doesnt want to push her further
all of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the forensics team leaving everyone in pitch darkness
what the hell
slowly an eerie ultra violet glow fills the room
the white suited forensics technicians glowing under the black light wait patiently for evidence to show itself
suddenly the clear imprints of hands on the wall become clear along with the black stains of blood flecks
what is it
blood fingerprints sign of a struggle
id say weve got a rape on our hands detective but we wont know for sure until we run the tests
morrisons head is spinning
just do it
elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab rubbing her arm where a band aid covers a fresh needle mark
chad appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him
you vampires really need five pints of my blood
thats like an armful
chads surprised by her venom
its standard procedure in a rape test
test for drugs and such
she continues to pace as chad makes his way into the room rounds the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf
were going to need a urine sample
do you think you could fill this
chad goes red
puts the plastic cup down on the desk and elena grabs it
you wouldnt mind
removing your clothes
ill leave the room give you some priv
the breath catches in chads throat as elena takes her shirt off without hesitation
stands there in just her black bra
chads jaw drops
not just because elenas in her underwear but because of the clear bite marks on her neck and arms
he chowed down
theyre clear evidence markers
he reaches out grabs a polaroid camera from the desk starts snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention
the flash of the camera fills the room
flashbulbs explode as marie accompanies her stepfather up the steps of the austere blue bay courthouse surrounded by a gaggle of sound bite hungry pressmen
any comment mr
jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses
he disappears quickly into the shelter of the courthouse
to marie did your stepfather rape that girl
how could he do something like that
marie stops in her tracks wheels around and addresses the throng of reporters
says it like she means it
the packed courthouse is abuzz and the elderly judge wilcox is forced to slam his gavel down
jay sits at the defendants table suit impeccable hair immaculate game face on
theo sits beside him scribbling notes
marie is in the front row of the gallery surrounded by her coiffured peers
she tries to smile stoically at jay
kristen sits beside elena at the prosecution table
had is on the stand as arlo meese the slick district attorney steps forward
borman do your tests show that elena sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the th
yes they do
do they show that it was forced
there was extensive bruising and tearing
we found no semen evidence
the latex abrasions point to the use of protection
this is quite common in cases of premeditated rape
and what can you tell us about miss sandovals toxicology reports doctor
came back positive for rohypnol a common date rape drug
traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene
clifford and miss sandovals fingerprints were all over the bottle
i took it from her
she was far too young to be drinking
a slam of the gavel silences jay
borman i am going to show you whats been marked as states exhibit number
he nods to the bailiff and a projector whirs to life
an evidence photo that chad took of elenas wounds is displayed on a screen beside him
what does this slide show
miss sandoval was found to have numerous bite marks on her upper torso that occurred during the rape
what about those other markings
chad looks confused studies the slide sees four equidistant dots aligned in a small circle
i wasnt able to determine
fingernail markings possibly
to meese please continue
marie can barely breathe
im going to show you another slide thats been marked as states exhibit number
meese nods to the bailiff who dutifully changes the slide
the court goes dark for a second before the next slide is displayed
its a close up of jays teeth mouldings compared to the bite marks
what can you tell us about these mouldings
they were made from the defendants teeth and the tests i conducted show theres simply no other conclusion
the bite marks on miss sandovals body were made by the defendant mr
the court erupts flashbulbs exploding
jay slumps back in his chair his air of cool gone in an instant
he looks back at marie utter disbelief on his face
the tears well in her eyes
the judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control
tv news gleefully reports jays trial like a sordid soap opera
in the face of damning evidence jay clifford remained defiant
its thought that his stepdaughter marie clifford will testify in his defense tomorrow
and in other news officials from the fbi gave a press conference today commenting on their involvement in the black widow case
a walking suit agent milton dammers steps up to the podium
after numerous mistakes on behalf of the local authorities in blue bay the fbi is mobilizing its task force
morrison tosses the tv remote aside sits down behind his desk piled high with files mostly marked black widow and reaches down to pick up jays broken video camera still
in the evidence bag
its a long shot
morrison looks up smiles faintly when he sees kristen at the door
not a fan of hey how you doing are you
kristen smiles enters morrisons cluttered office
used to play at being a spider when i was a kid creeping around silently
guess i havent grown out of it
morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag
its the only thing standing between my friend and a ten year stretch
the forensics lab will have time to look at it now
the feds have taken over the black widow case
they knew i was close
they just want to come in and take all the credit
you got a chance detective
to help your friend
dont let this case slip away as well
morrison tightens his jaw knows what he has to do
the forensics lab is crammed with evidence bags and files
chad is working diligently painstakingly scanning a stack of bills one by one
he barely has time to look round when the door opens and detective morrison comes in
chad i got a rush job for you
chad rolls his eyes
no can do boss
were sifting through the black widow evidence
feds are movin in
theyll be taking over by the case by the end of the week
chads dumbstruck but dutifully takes the shattered video camera
you find anything on that tape you let me know ok
whatever you say boss
and make sure you get that money back into the evidence locker
nd chads left alone with the shattered remains of the video camera and a whole shit load of work ahead
the early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the smooth as glass surface of the school swimming pool
marie steps back up onto the high diving platform
tries to focus
slides the soon to be diamond ring off her finger and throws it tentatively into the water
she takes a breath and then dives straight and true into the perfect blue water below
maries lithe taught body comes arcing through the water darting down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring
marie surfaces reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the pool before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers an electronic ankle bracelet locked around
nice take off
gotta work on the landing
maries blood boils
what the hell are you doing here
elena just reaches down and picks up maries unfinished ring
looks like your bling aint blinging
give me that back
it was my mothers
marie climbs out of the pool faces down with elena
looks like she got ripped off princess wheres the rock
marie snatches the ring from elena slides it back on her finger
is that what this is all about
elena reaches out tries to stroke the wet hair off maries face
she recoils before shell let elena touch her
youre not a dumb as you look
enny followed by the rest of the diving team come marching out of the locker room and see the two arch enemies confronting each other
to her team mates we got trouble
elena wont back down
youre ruining my life and my stepfathers
it can end
just like that
she snaps her fingers and maries on the verge of tears
jenny and the rest of the diving team approach stand behind marie a seething mass of bikini clad mindless hate
why are you doing this
because i can
as she turns and walks away
good luck in court
the usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the small courtroom
marie is on the witness stand staring straight ahead at her stepfather at the defendants table
gone is the immaculate suit the perfect hair the poker face
hes looking worried now
theo paces in front of marie running her through a series of well rehearsed questions
and why did you go to your stepfathers building site that night miss clifford
it was my birthday
jay left the party before giving me my present
and you say you saw miss sandoval leaving
marie takes a moment looks to elena at the prosecution table
and how would you describe her appearance
she looked fine
she smiled at me
no further questions
he takes a seat next to jay whispers in his ear
meese starts his cross examination
would it be fair to say you dont like elena sandoval miss clifford
we dont see
eye to eye
is that why you attacked her at your party earlier that night
she wasnt invited
youd had a few drinks correct
reluctantly id had a drink
so by the time you allege to have seen miss sandoval could you tell the court exactly how much youd had to drink
a glass of champagne
or two but
no further questions
jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat
a bleary eyed chad sits in front of a bank of monitors working the image enhancement equipment fighting to get a watchable picture from the fuzzy static in front of
kristen sits behind him fighting to stay awake
to himself take out the chroma raise the luminescence
he clumsily reaches over the control panel hitting almost every button on the way
and that does the trick
suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear
kristens eyes snap open
the pixilated image of elena smiling comes into focus on the tv
call detective morrison
the shaky pixilated image of elena smiling flickers on the tv
soon enough though her smile fades
youre kidding right
jays voice can be heard behind the camera
cmon now baby you can do it
the video shows elena cowering
you cant do this
no such word as cant
a hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs elena throws her violently against a concrete wall
a flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus
when the camera steadies again elenas hands are pressed against the wall and shes sobbing
e please mr
just try to keep those legs together
and then static
pulling back from the tv we find ourselves in the courtroom completely empty save for jay theo meese and judge wilcox all staring in shock at the blank tv screen
clifford would plead guilty to rape the state is prepared to drop the charges of kidnapping and assault
to jay if i were you i would seriously consider the offer
in the cold stone jail visiting room jay sits behind the wire mesh an emotion marie and theo opposite
the prison guard waits by the barred door keeping his beady eyes on jay
im gonna lose this trial
im not so sure about that
the tapes a fake right
so all we need to do is
jay holds up a hand instantly silencing his attorney
you had your chance
to marie if were gonna win at all costs were gonna have to change the game
to theo do you have it
theo nods regretfully reaches into a breast pocket pulls out a im still dead set against this jay
i couldnt care less
whats the key for
if thats what it takes then thats what it takes
theyre my inheritance
all my assets are tied up in the condos marie
we have to pay this girl off make her testify that she faked the tape faked the evidence
theyre my diamonds
as soon as im out of here youll have them back
i know people who can
persuade her to hand them over
marie shoots an uncomfortable look to theo then back at jay uncertain what to say
more wrong than what shes doing to us
were team clifford right
you know im not guilty
you know i could never do anything like this
so do the right thing and get me out of this hellhole
tenderly no such word as cant
the tears well in her eyes
the key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling mother daughter diamonds
the alarms disabled maries finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems
the curator stands behind her in the empty museum hall ruefully watching his prize exhibit being removed
i knew the day would come still doesnt make it any easier
marie tears welling in her eyes takes a hold of the diamonds carefully takes them from the case
the offer still stands marie
if you ever decide to sell them please give us a first chance
marie turns to him the emotions overwhelming her
i dont think ill be able to im sorry
she scampers towards the door past the security guards
sotto me too
theos suv drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to the swamp past countless rusted airboats and into the gator trailer park finally coming to a halt in front
of elenas rotting trailer
theo gets out carefully his shoes sinking into the mud
marie reluctantly steps out of the car
a blinding porch light flicks on
theo and marie spin round squint through the light to see elena standing in her trailer doorway
e well well well
look what the cat dragged in
to theo da know youre here
we need to talk
somewhere private maybe
an elderly man uncle marty in a sweat stained t shirt and ratty underwear snores on the tattered recliner a half drunk bottle of whisky hanging from one limp hand
theo freezes when he sees him
drunken pervert take your pick
hes out til morning
uncle martys deafening snores confirm the assertion as elena leads them into her bedroom
lets just get this over with
to elena you won
you got what you wanted
mocking i just wanted justice
tomorrow youll take the stand tell the jury you faked the evidence faked the tape
we are prepared to make it worth your while
she holds the daughter diamond in front of elenas greedy little eyes
poker face not bad
but i always wanted a family
theo nudges marie
she sighs holds out the mother diamond in the other hand
a broad grin stretches across elenas face
theyre yours after you exonerate my client
im afraid im gonna need that payment up front
no thats not the deal
it is now
take it or leave it
marie takes a deep breath
its the most difficult thing shes ever had to do in her young life
dead silence except for uncle martys snoring from the front room
inally with a very heavy heart marie hands over the diamonds
when this is all over youll leave town
elena points to the ankle bracelet
i go more than five miles from the police station and im straight back in juvie
i understand your parole term is up next week
youve done your homework
points to the ankle bracelet as soon as this thing comes off im outta here
she reaches down and grabs the diamonds
dances past marie
may i suggest a little discretion miss sandoval
questions might be asked about this
arrangement if you were to
turn up to blue bay high wearing a tiara
i aint gonna flaunt it mate
i gots too much class for that shit
youre going to tell the truth on the stand tomorrow yes
elena raises her right hand
i swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
the court bailiff nods takes the bible from elenas hands
shes dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her wardrobe a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt
the courtroom is packed with journalists tv cameras and nosey neighbors
everyone wants a piece of this story
at the defendants table jay slick once more in armani watches theo approach the witness box with a new found confidence
sitting in the front row of the public gallery marie is riveted on the action
at the back of the courtroom kristen fidgets nervously beside morrison as theo steps up ready to question the newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial
its your assertion that my client mr
clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you on the night of the th
is that true
a hushed silence
marie jay theo all wait expectantly
is that what you say happened
elena clears her throat
a collective intake of breath from the crowd
just sexually assault me
theos balls shrink instantly
did you just say
he didnt just sexually assault me
he threatened to kill me if i told anyone
he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy
theos reeling caught off guard stumbling over his words trying to give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise
isnt it true that you were inebriated during the assault that it may not in fact have been mr
a smirking meese doesnt even bother to stand up
leading the witness
council will please rephrase the question
his eyes plead with elena to take the ball and run with it
unfortunately its to the wrong end zone
i was messed up alright
in fact only two things i remember
one was that bastard jay clifford taping me with that goddamn video camera while he violated me
the other was what he whispered in my ear right before i blacked out
she pauses for emphasis
judge jury gallery press corps the town of blue bay the state of florida hangs on her every word
he said you wont remember but youll never forget
the court goes berserk flashbulbs exploding along with the veins in jays head
kristens reeling from shock
to morrison what did she just say
marie leaps to her feet screams
marie has to be restrained trying to break through the crowds to claw elenas tear stained eyes out
a small television blares out todays top story
the young victims wrenching testimonial proved to be the final nail in the coffin for jay clifford
it took less than an hour for the jury to deliberate and sentence mr
clifford to years
v cameras witness jay being led away in handcuffs
you cant do this to me
the tv turns off
marie sits huddled in jays unfinished concrete building site office staring at the darkened television set
mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face
mumbling no such thing as cant
she lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it smashes on the concrete floor
strangely the dregs of the champagne start running down the floor
maries heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the rustling of plastic from outside the office
she steels herself gets shakily to her feet stumbling drunkenly toward the door
kristen stands in the darkened doorway of elenas less than welcoming trailer
she tries the door handle
she takes a deep breath steps inside
kristen flips on a light switch
the room is illuminated for a split second before the bulb surges and burns out leaving kristen in the near darkness
she takes out a flashlight creeps through the front room stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus
the beam of light finds a small blue pill nestled in the carpeting
kristen picks it up slides it into her pocket
marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor past the crime scene tape
in the dim light her eyes dart to every corner every shadow
he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged into darkness
slowly the eerie forensic ultra violet lights switch on filling the room with black light
and with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach marie slowly turns coming face to face with
elena her arch nemesis
kristen moves slowly into elenas bedroom shines her light on the walls
what she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins
barely able to breathe she takes out her cell phone
into phone detective morrison
elena and marie stare each other down
you could cut the tension with a chainsaw until
who invited you
a sinister grin spreads across elenas face as she holds up the breathtaking mother daughter diamonds reflecting an unearthly glow under the uv lights
mother and daughter
this brings a mile wide smile to marie as she dances into elenas arms
their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands dance over each others trembling bodies
when they finally break
i was sure youd blow it on the stand going on about forgetting and remembering
gotta make it seem authentic
gods in the details
and they kiss again lips locked tighter than jays jail cell
morrisons unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside kristens car and the harried detective steps out looking extremely unhappy
this couldnt wait til morning miss richards
call me kristen
the feds just arrived to take over the black widow case im up to my knees in paperwork
you remember what elena said right at the end of the trial
you wont remember
but youll never forget
what about it
elenas fucking with us
elena and marie are locked in their carnal embrace failing to notice the florescent lights flickering back on
suddenly elena feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck
she looks down to see dental alginate moldings of jays teeth being held by a smiling chad
mind if chad joins
the girls look up to see a beaming chad holding the teeth molding
elena just shakes her head
chad works the spring hinge of the dentures like a deranged ventriloquist act
he sets the dentures down on the concrete floor and takes in the sight of the magnificent diamonds
re diamonds two beauties
turning to marie and elena two beauties
he and elena help marie out of her blouse while elena runs her hands all over him
morrison and kristens flashlights cut through the darkness as they move back into elenas bedroom
just so you know this is called breaking and entering
i know all about it
especially having something stolen
they get into the bedroom and morrisons jaw goes slack as kristen shines her light on the walls
like my life
the walls are covered with newspaper clippings all concerning kristens rape police unable to find frat house rapist teenage victim wants justice in rape case you may not remember but
youll never forget only thing victim remembers risten tears some of the articles off the wall
once a thief always a thief
they suddenly freeze as the front door swings open the blood running cold in their veins as uncle marty stumbles inside
they hold their breath praying he doesnt see them standing in elenas doorway
uncle marty just mumbles something incoherent and collapses face first onto the couch out like a light
chad reaches into an evidence bag filled with blue pills
he removes three
little blue pills
one of the perks of the job
laughter as the girls accept the roofies swallowing them like candy
chad gulps down the third as elena begins to run her hands up and down maries back and shoulders
chads hands are all over marie as he helps slip off her bra
elenas lips move hungrily across chads face until they find his mouth
they kiss deeply
hen they pull apart chad helps elena pull off her t top as marie runs her hands up and down elenas bare back
elena turns back to her with a mischievous grin
you wont remember
but youll never forget
the early morning sun illuminates a massive slab of windowless concrete surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of nowhere
jay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of bullet proof glass
hes half the man he used to be broken trembling smoking like a chimney
his minds still a steel trap just one thats rusted shut
he picks up the two way phone
into phone mr
clifford this is kristen richards elena sandovals probation officer
she want to pin me for some more crimes
kristen takes the phone from theo
i just have a few questions
ive noticed some inconsistencies
youve noticed some inconsistencies
heres one big fucking glaring inconsistency for you i was set up
maybe so but thats not good enough
why were you set up
what would elena sandoval have gained from all this
jay hesitates unsure how or if to proceed
theo shifts nervously
jay gives j up
what the hell
im already in jail
how much worse can it get
i paid her off okay
my assets were tied up in the condos so we used maries diamonds
defensive it wasnt like i had a choice
she had me by the short an curlies understand
but elenas testimony was damning
why wouldnt she play ball
what is this the spanish inquisition
how the fuck should i know
manipulative little skank probably figured she could bleed me for some more money down the road
but ill tell you this much im gonna get those diamonds back make her wish she was never born
kristens mind is racing trying to piece together the puzzle
elenas airboat blasts through the reeds out into the middle of nowhere
she cuts the engine lets the boat drift unwraps the moldings of jays teeth from a cloth as well as a video tape marked blue bay diving meet maries birthday
looks them over one last time
and tosses them into the mire where theyre soon gobbled by ravenous gators
elena glides her airboat to a stop on the muddy banks of the trailer park stomps over to her trailer when she sees
two sets of tire tracks in the mud
elena stands in her bedroom disbelief washing over her
no sign of the newspaper articles
her walls are barren
sotto oh shit
the diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to practice
lagging behind is marie
shes about to catch up when she runs smack dab into a panicked elena
if anyone sees us together
what choice did i have
we got big problems
before anyone can see them marie pulls her away to the outdoor shower area out of sight from her teammates
she turns on all the shower heads
gotta be careful
make sure no ones listening
now whats the
i think i fucked up
marie gently takes a hold of elenas face
i dont know for sure
but i think that bitch parole officers made me
she was at my trailer last night
marie smiles pulls elena close as the steam rises all around
you disposed of everything right
the teeth the video all the research
elena cant fess up
i did but
shes got a hard on for me
wants to see me back in juvie
marie kisses her softly on the forehead
i wont let the big bad wolf get you
elenas damp tank top clings to her perfect body
i just want outta here
marie brushes a strand of hair away from elenas face
ill call the museum curator have him prepare the funds to buy back the diamonds
then were outta here right
a mile wide smile stretches across maries lips
just sit back relax enjoy the trip
dont forget to come again
heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets
sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface illuminating maries lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until
marie comes diving down into the crystalline water plucks the soon to be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool
marie surfaces at the edge of the pool
she places the ring onto the deck pulls herself out of the water
she tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with kristen whos picked up her ring runs it around her fingers
can i help you
i was wondering if i could have a moment of your time
ask a couple questions
marie glances nervously back at the pool where other members of the diving team go about their workout
im in the middle of practice
itll only take a moment marie
might even help jay
remember your loving stepfather
you want to help him dont you
kristen studies the ring for a moment then ventures
whyd you agree to part with your diamonds
this time marie cant hide her shock
jay told me
they were your inheritance
jay needed help
were a team
you mustve been pretty unhappy when jay didnt give you those diamonds for your birthday
maries taking a beating doing her best to remain standing
he said i wasnt ready
thats heiress payday no
mustve crossed your mind that jay might never let you have them
no of course not
shes a bad liar
and then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them
with your help no less
kristen moves in for the kill
but what i dont get is why wouldnt elena do what jay asked clear his name
after all shed gotten what she wanted
how should i know
marie watches in fascination as kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand
i mean the only way i can make sense of it is if somehow getting jay released from prison would spoil the plan
she hands the ring back to marie
not so lucky anymore
you tell me
chad strolls gingerly down the hallway opens the door to the forensics lab freezing when he sees
kristen waiting patiently for him
is there something i can do for you
i was wondering if youd do me the favor of running a quick test
uh sure i guess
whatcha got for me
she hands him the blue pill she found in elenas trailer
could you tell me what this is
chad tries to keep his cool
itll only take a minute
while chad goes about his work kristen begins nosing around the office
chad looks over his shoulder
be careful i got lots of evidence here
she starts flipping through evidence photos
are these the evidence photos from the elena sandoval rape
they are but
ever find out what caused these markings
she holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the judge questioned chad about in court
like i told the judge i guess theyre finger nail markings
they dont look like finger nail markings to me
they look more like this
she holds up the back of her hand where shed made the indentation with maries ring
would you say these markings are the same
w where did you get that
marie gave it to me
but you already knew that didnt you doc
chad has no answer to that
he can only blink stupidly and pray his silence doesnt incriminate him further
kristen heads for the door
calling after the pill
the massive front door swings open and marie crosses the foyer and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen
her heart is in her throat as she calls out
marie enters the lavish kitchen stops in her tracks when she sees chad standing at the full bar mixing the strongest drink known to man
what the hell chad
chad fidgets nervously
that parole officer was sniffin around today
marie scoffs steps up to the bar gets in chads face
not you too
shes just trying to prove her worthless excuse for an existence
she doesnt have a thing on us
yeah but shes askin the right questions
its only a matter of time
we gotta make our move
marie shakes her head resolute
we stick to the plan
give the curator time to come up with the money
chads trembling hands pour the drink most of the liquid making it in to two martini glasses
we gotta move fast keep the heat off
you cant take the heat get outta the kitchen
i wanna see em
make sure theyre safe
she downs half the drink in one giant gulp
i just wanna see em
i thought we were supposed to be partners here
chads trembling looking like he could lose it at any second
youre gonna be the death of me
she slugs the rest of the drink strides away and chad follows like a lapdog
nothings been touched in jays office the drops of blood the cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white carpet black
marie walks over to his desk opens a draw
removes a metallic lock box
i wanna see those puppies
marie rolls her eyes takes a key from a delicate chain around her neck and fumbles with the lock
finally she opens the box revealing the mother daughter diamonds resting on velvet lining
the sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on chad
he stops shaking his voice becoming more steady
i called the museum
the deals goin down tomorrow
marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him
what did you
she looks to the empty glass in her hand then begins to sway watching in horror as chad drops the diamonds into his pocket
im sorry okay
but its not like i had a choice
marie falls flat on her face her world crashing to black
the blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon the still water of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds
elena sits out on her idling airboat in the midst of the sawgrass smoking
the peace is shattered by her ringing yello
marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear rubbing her aching head slowly getting her wits back
nothing like good old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover
into phone chad fucked us
deadpan i know
i was there
no i mean he really fucked us
he drugged me an took the diamonds
elena stands on the edge of the airboat fear rising in her
ell me youre kidding
yeah its all a big joke
he stole the diamonds
elena lets out an anguished wail
keep it down my headaches bad enough as it is
weve gotta stop him
maries fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock
finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface
hes heading to the museum got himself an am meeting
hes gonna sell the diamonds
not if we find him first
the deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass speeding across the endless swampland expanse
elena expertly maneuvers the machine the wind racing through her hair
chads speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty daewoo bangs down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees
every hundred feet or so the road runs parallel with the water then cuts back into the trees
had spots an air boat not more than a few hundred yards from him
he does a double take just as the road disappears back into the trees
it couldnt be could it
the winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and chads worst fears come true
elenas racing along side of him in the airboat fighting to keep up
the road runs parallel to the swamp again and chads eyes nearly burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him matching his speed
give us back the diamonds
chads heart stops
he spins round looks straight ahead at the bmw racing right at he yanks the steering wheel hard left swerves his car clean off the dirt road and into the
thick swathe of melaluca trees maries bmw shoots past missing his car by inches
marie slams on her brakes brings her bmw to a skidding halt on the dirt road
she looks back over her shoulder at the swaying melaluca trees
no sign of chads car
elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side leaps into the reeds and clambers up to the dirt road
theres no sign of chads car just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed through
marie comes running up to join elena a tire iron in hand
sternly were not hurting him marie got it
we just get the diamonds back
m not gonna hurt him
marie stalks down the path chads car took off the dirt road
im gonna kill him
elenas breath catches in her throat
marie disappears into the trees and shes alone out on the deserted swamp road
dont do this
she hears a scream a girls scream
elena sprints into the thick of the trees
kristen is sitting at detective morrisons cluttered desk her brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper articles she pulled from elenas wall
morrison stands in the doorway watching her
you look like you could use a drink
kristen looks up from the articles into morrisons smiling face
she smiles back
when this is all over id like that
morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an fbi badge identifying him as agent milton dammers
the buzzcut agent drops boxes at morrisons feet
more black widow leads
i need you to put them in the evidence locker morrison
thats not my job agent dammers
it is now
marie is standing in a clearing staring at chads wrecked car at the top of a small slope wrapped around a melaluca tree like a christmas present
her piercing screams force elena to come running
marie stops screaming her face contorting in anger
no im pretty damn far from okay
she points to the front seat of the crashed car
elena can barely bring herself to look inside
marie shoves her in the back pushing her towards the open drivers side door
elena gasps when she looks inside the car
chads not there
marie clambers up the wreckage of the car stands on the roof
she surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is
with the diamonds
morrison grumbles as he scans his key card opening the wire mesh door to the evidence locker
he picks up a box and enters kristen also carrying a box a step behind
i appreciate the help
right back at ya
morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning shelves stuffed with black widow evidence
kristen notices the bundles of cash stored in and amongst the black widow evidence
you could have a helluva holiday on that money
recovered from the black widows last score
if id gotten to the scene just five minutes earlier i woulda gotten her as well
morrison shakes his head ruefully when a sudden sharp beeping has kristen reaching into her pocket fishing out a handheld gps
what the hell
a red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map
elena runs full pelt after marie through dense swampland the plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red
theres nowhere to run to you little weasel
she swings around finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of the ashen tree trunks
she races off in hot pursuit
elenas about to follow when she notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet
this cant be happening
marie slows looks back to elena
im more than five miles away from the police station
i go beyond five miles and the alarm goes off
you telling me your parole officer knows youre out here
elena can barely speak
chads face is drained of color as he runs through the dense swampland hugging the priceless diamonds
sweat cascades from his brow and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body swirl in the stagnant waters
most gruesome of all is a broken turn signal embedded in his right leg
as the water gets knee deep the last of chads reserve energy goes
he collapses in the stagnant marsh
not far off gators circle
its only a matter of time before they notice the blood in the water
the small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland
elena steps into the water her ankle bracelet flashing red
call it off marie
we gotta go or shell find us here
a splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls
you hear that
the sound echoes off the dense trees
marie points left
you go that way
marie heads off in the opposite direction
elena hesitates wants to follow but does as shes told and goes left soon enveloped by canopy of trees
kristen blasts down the blue bay streets a siren in the windshield blaring
the handheld gps continues to monitor elenas exact position in the midst of the swamp
elena stumbles through the thick stagnant water scouring the horizon for any sign of chad
a rustling sound stops her in her tracks
dead silence until
marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire iron like a prada clad big game hunter
calling out to elena you see him
no reply just her own voice echoing back
she rolls her eyes
kristens unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road
she checks the flashing gps signal
elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water gasps for breath
looking down she sees chad holding on to her like his life depends on it
he pulls her back down into the water just as she catches a glance of the circling gators
using her as leverage chad pulls himself out of the swamp climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid ground
elena coughs and splutters floundering in the blood soaked water
the ravenous gators approach sensing a feeding frenzy
dont splash they can sense you in the water theyll rip you to pieces
elena freezes looking round at the black eyes breaking the surface of the bloody water gliding in for the kill
she reaches out a hand to chad only a few feet away
e hesitates then reaches out to her
but stops short of grabbing her trembling hand
just balls his fist squeezing every last drop of blood out of the open wounds on his palm
the dark blood cascades down into the water around elena
and he smiles as the gators ease open their powerful jaws
chads eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose ears and mouth
he falls forward stiff as a board and splashes down into the water next to an apoplectic elena
behind him stands marie the bloody tire iron in hand
marie reaches out a hand pulls elena out of the water
she collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air
what are you doing
our diamonds are about to become dinner
elena cant move leaving marie to wade into the swamp
kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed
she checks the gps scanner
it doesnt show her which way to turn
which way which way
split second decision
she spins the wheel takes the left hand fork
just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned bmw an idle airboat a crashed car one dead man and two wild wild things
elena and marie soaked to the bone drag chads cold dead corpse out of the trees
marie drops the body heads straight for her abandoned bmw
elena follows stumbling through the vines her clothes dripping wet shivering more from nerves than cold
get rid of the body
and his car
where are you going
where do you think
i dont have a clue
marie spins round a vicious look in her eyes
she holds the blood soaked diamonds in her hand
chad made us an appointment to sell these
im gonna keep it
elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet
its only a matter of time before my parole officer finds me
marie turns back around flings open the bmw door and gets in
then i suggest you get to work
she fires up the powerful engine speeds away in a cloud of dust leaving elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life
elena struggles to drag chads bloody body back to his crashed car
the tail lights flicker throwing an ominous red glow over the dense thicket of overhanging trees
with a herculean effort she manages to stuff chads inert body into the drivers seat
she stumbles back horrified at the grim tableau before her
maries car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone museum building
the curator paces back and forth like an expectant father in front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds
marie bursts into the museum and he strides up to meet her shocked when he sees maries covered in blood sweat and guilt
are you alright
got the money
the curator nods nervously
i convinced the board of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding
he fishes in her bag for the diamonds
i received a call from your associate
he said he would be handling the transaction
change of plans
my associate got tied up at work
the curator nods unsure if he inquire further
marie finally pulls out two blood soaked diamonds from her bag thrusts them at the curator
he screws up his wrinkled face afraid to touch them
its just blood
with trembling hands elena opens the trunk of chads crashed car
she pulls out a plastic gas container sloshing the fuel around inside then trailing it back across the vine covered ground
she carefully places the empty container down standing twenty feet back from the wreckage fumbling in her pocket for a match
she can barely control her hands her whole body shaking in fear
finally she pulls out a matchbook still sopping wet from the swamp
she strikes match after match but they wont light until finally one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out
dont do this to me please
in frustration she runs back to chads car looking desperately for a lighter climbing all the way in
because of the slight slope its on the cars flimsy door slams shut behind her
elena pays no heed continues to rummage through the glove compartment
you gotta have a lighter or some
shes cut off as the wrecked cars horn blares out
deafening the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth
elenas heart skips a beat
chads corpse has slumped forward against the steering wheel
she struggles with all her might to pull chads body back off the horn
ilence reigns once more
elena takes short sharp breaths
looks over at chads body slumped to the side leaning against the drivers side door
im so sorry
not as sorry as shes going to be
the match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to smoulder for a second then reignites
the curator carefully examines the diamond turning it over and over in his hands
marie stands over him impatiently tapping her muddy shoe on the marble floor
im not sure
can you get the cash or not
the curator looks up to her bemused
i can get the cash
marie smiles a wicked grin
then lets have those dead presidents
the discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that elena trailed from chads
elena reaches over carefully closes chads bloodshot eyes
satisfied she turns to get out only to find the passenger side door locked
she tries the handle
tries it again
desperately yanks it
not opening no sir
elena looks over see chads limp elbow on the door lock
the small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and
elena cant help but hear the unmistakable sound of flames crackling
through the smashed rear window she sees the line of fire racing towards the car shes trapped in
she reaches over clawing her way past chads corpse trying to reach the door lock
her bloody fingers slip on the lock unable to pull it up
the fires shooting towards the crashed car only a few feet away
elena fumbles with the lock tears streaming down her face
the line of fire hits the crashed car and engulfs it instantly
bright orange flames cover the wreckage
the curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor
marie looks at him like hes mad
what the hell are you doing
one last test
the curator hovers his heel over the biggest diamond
marie screams out
he slams his foot down and the diamond shatters
elena screams as the passenger side window next to her smashes splintering into a million glass fragments
hands reach in and grab her pulling her through the flames
seconds later elena finds herself on the swamp floor in kristens singed arms
elena can barely talk looking back at the flaming wreckage in front of her
care to explain
it was an accident
the flames reflect in her tear filled eyes
marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds in a million tiny pieces on the museums marble floor
fakes im afraid
made of glass
cant believe they were our top attraction all these years
every muscle in maries body contracts
she stands before the empty diamond exhibit case runs her fingers over the portrait of her mother cradling her as a baby
thats my inheritance is it mom
goddamn christmas ornaments
and as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from the case and tears it to shreds
theres no stopping her now
red faced she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick the glass shattering
marie stop this instant
she continues her rampage regardless ripping a fire extinguisher from the wall and hurling it through another display case
i hate you mom
im glad youre dead
storm clouds gather over the whitewashed police station
elena sits with her head in her hands across from kristen in an anonymous interview room
i told you
elena looks up tears streaking her mascara
told me what
that if you were telling the truth id back you all the way
if you lied to me thered be trouble
elena slumps back down her head on the table
chad swerved off the road i swear
just swerved for no reason
just decided to take a shortcut through the swamp
elena sobs cant look kristen in the eye
it was an accident
the door to the interview room swings open and detective morrison strides through a fresh from the printer report in his hands
accident my ass
he flips the pages of the report
forensics finds the head trauma that killed chad borman was inflicted by a single blow from behind
lena looks up through panda eyes
he hit his head
was that before or after you dragged him through the swamp
elena has no answers as morrison takes the cuffs from his belt snaps them on elenas wrists
you got the right to remain silent which in your case is probably best cos of the shit you come up with
kristen stands up shaking her head
thats two strikes elena
one more and youre out
elena looks at her pleadingly
ill do whatever you want
thinks for a moment
nods to morrison as he drags elena to her feet
yeah you will
ill tell you the truth
ill tell you what happened
she killed him and took the diamonds
marie it was marie clifford
morrison just sneers
keep bleeting missy
all the way to the judge
i think its time he heard the truth about jay cliffords accuser
her arrest doesnt guarantee jayll be cleared you know that
you need marie you need the proof they set him up
morrison considers this
you came so close to nailing the black widow dont let this slip through your fingers detective
hes about to speak when elenas cell phone rings
kristen takes it from elena looks at the caller id sees maries name
speak of the devil
she holds the phone up
youre gonna answer it
and youre gonna say that everything went fine
no one found chads body
the plans still on
do you understand me
elena nods slowly
morrison turns to kristen
you thinking what im thinking
ristens patient with him
this is your chance
feds cant take this one from you
morrison weighs his options then finally nods
kristen clicks the phone on holds it to elenas ear
marie speeds wildly down the deserted blue bay streets one trembling hand holding a cigarette the other her cellphone
the diamonds are fakes
that cant be true
marie takes a long drag from her cigarette
dont you understand
theres no money
how am i supposed to take care of your broke ass
kristen is listening in on the whole conversation
she cups her hand over the phone whispers to elena
tell her she has to meet you
tell her she cant leave
elena nods and kristen puts the phone back to her lips
i gotta see you
ill send you a photo
just one last time
im gone gone gonski
kristen motions for her to continue
i think maybe
maybe theres a way we could still get some money
silence on the end of the line
marie considers this for a long moment
not over the phone
we gotta meet
school swimming pool
shes hung up
kristen nods to morrison
whered you keep the wire taps
gimme the key
he tosses her his electronic keycard
the blue bay high pool is illuminated in the dead of night casting blue ripples over the bleachers where elena waits nervously
she cant help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath her shirt
whispering can you hear me
morrison listens nervously to elenas tinny voice coming in through the speaker
is this thing working
the detective shoots kristen a concerned look
shes gonna blow it
elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest wincing as the tape pulls her delicate skin
dont think i can do this
its already done
elena looks up guiltily
marie is standing by the side of the pool
how much did she see
the words stick in elenas throat
i had no choice
blah blah blah
get over it
now you told me you had a plan
spit it out
jays got cash
at the building site
i saw it
marie rolls her eyes
thats your brilliant plan
its in a safe dumb ass
you a safecracker
have you got magic fingers gonna pick that lock
i dont think so
kristen winces as she listens to the girls conversation
through the speakers were gonna go to jay
tell him what we did
like hell we are
elena walks down the bleachers approaching a skeptical marie
listen to me
we go to the jail tell him well come clean tell the police everything if he gives us the combination
im still a minor theyll send me back to juvie
shit i could do that time standing on my head
how much money
elena reaches marie puts her hands on her hips
enough for you and me
grinds against her
we dont have to tell the cops anything
well let jays videotape do the talking
but we got rid of the real one
i kept a copy
never trusted you backstabbers
elena tries to pull away but marie drags her back until their faces are inches apart
theres no denying it
marie slowly draws her hand down elenas face down her neck to her chest
so close to the wire
finally places her palm over elenas heart
morrison and kristen listen intently in their headphones unable to breath
elena and marie stand there for what seems like an eternity unblinking
finally marie smiles
lets do it
jay laughs as he sits across from marie and elena separated by an inch of bullet proof glass
theo stands by the door
well well well
whod have thought
what a pleasant surprise
i guess you guys have kissed and made up
did you know the diamonds were fakes
jay nods slowly
your mom hocked them years ago
boozed it all away
you already know the end of her sorry story
maries jaw tightens
jay leans back
so to what do i owe the pleasure
we want money
whatever youve got in your safe at the beach condos
jay bursts out laughing again
of course you do
of course you do
well get you out of here
jay stops laughing leans back in to the inch thick glass
marie holds up a digital video tape
is that what i think it is
you give us the combination and this goes in the nearest mail box tied with a pretty pink bow
how do i know its the real tape
youre gonna have to trust us
ive been down that road before
marie opens the cassette housing ready to rip the tape apart
this is non negotiable
sir we have no grounds for appeal
this could be our only chance
whats the combination
the tortured screams of inmates echo in jays ears
no such word as cant
a prison guard puts a massive hand on jays shoulder
times up mr
to marie fine
marie shakes her head
the combinations the day mom died you sick fuck
jays led away in shackles
maries bmw flies down the deserted blue bay streets blasting through red lights
marie handles the car like a formula one driver and with twice the intensity
the g force pins elena back against the seat
marie steps on the gas
were in a world of shit
marie steps on the gas
well never get away with this
you know that dont you
marie steps on the gas
she aint saying a word and times running out for elena
morrison struggles to keep up with maries bullit esque driving
kristen stays focused on the one sided conversation in her headphones
come on elena
maries bmw screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos and marie strides towards the construction site entrance
elena gets out the car feeling decidedly sick
she circuitously adjusts the microphone taped to her chest then follows marie into the dark unfinished building marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey heading straight
for the safe
with a rock steady hand she works the lock
morrison brings his clunky police sedan to a halt around the back of the building site
kristen listens intently to the live feed
over headphones marie
please i cant do this
maries working the safe combination like a master thief spinning it nimbly between her buffed nails
elena stands in the makeshift office doorway trying to coax something incriminating from maries perfect lips
i told you not to kill chad
ill tell it to the police
marie doesnt even look round concentrating on the job at hand
ill tell em you made me lie about your stepfather raping me made me perjure myself on the stand went and killed chad and now
a very good year
third and final tumbler falls
the safe door swings open revealing a stack of cash and jays handgun
kristen shakes her head
its hopeless elena cant get marie to say an incriminating word
this has gotta end
its gonna end
one way or another
marie pulls out a wad of crisp clean bills draws them across her nose like a wine connoisseur
always in style
she dances over to elena waves the cash in her face
whyd you do it
whyd chad have to die
marie slides up against elena fluttering the cash over her in the worlds most expensive shower
elena couldnt be less interested focused on getting that confession
you killed him marie
you murdered him in cold blood
marie presses up against elena pushing her up against the unfinished dry wall
kisses her passionately finally silencing her for a few brief electric seconds
and when she pulls away her fingers dance down elenas shirt until
he rips the microphone from elenas chest
stands there with the dangling cord in her hands her face caught in a permanent snarl
the blood drains from elenas face
a piercing feedback forces kristen to throw aside the headphones
she looks to morrison
shes been made
morrison draws his gun
kristen shakes her head resolutely
i got us into this
a gunshot echoes in the darkness
just stay in the car
morrison sprints over to the building site leaving kristen in the car alone
elena stands with her hands up an ugly bullet hole in the wall just beside her
marie keeps jays gun trained on her as she unloads the cash from the safe
you stupid fucking sherbert
you think you could sell me out
they made me do it
morrison doesnt know his prick from a pogo stick
and that bitch parole officer she hasnt got the balls for this
marie takes dead aim once more
maries finger tightens on the trigger
kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction site
she reaches across to the drivers seat grabs the elena scrambles across the concrete floor desperately trying to make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars
she sees the forensic uv light switch on the floor reaches for it
stands in the shattered doorway surveys the expansive unfinished floor
is about to unleash a hail of bullets when
the work lights flicker out replaced by the eerie ultra violet lights scattered around the unfinished floor
bathed in the florescent blue glow of the lights elena scrambles to safety behind a pillar
her shirt glows her eyes like beacons
sweeps through the second floor meticulously checking every corner every shadow
runs towards the unfinished building looking up to the uv glow on the fourth floor
she sprints for the industrial elevator
scours the bizarre darkness hears a sound
the orange muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as marie shoots randomly
the flimsy plaster walls explode
enters the third floor from the fire escape continues his meticulous sweep of the building
stands in the industrial elevator jabbing the th floor button hyperventilating as more gunshots explode
she clutches morrisons shotgun to her chest getting closer to the top floor
shields herself as plaster rains down on her unable to see through the cloud of dust under the uv lights until
a bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot
she looks up to see the barrel of jays gun
maries face is contorted maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger
runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening gun shot rings out
followed by screams
he rips open the fourth floor fire door tearing through the building pushing through thick plastic sheeting until he finds himself under the uv glow
hick plumes of blood black under the uv light stain the walls and floor
he sees elena in a fetal ball trembling uncontrollably
beside her marie lies dead her chest a gaping crimson mess jays gun still clutched tightly in her cold dead hands
kristen looks up at him almost too shocked to speak
morrisons shotgun is still smoking in her hands
i didnt have a choice
she was gonna kill elena
morrison steps forward calmly takes the gun from her
its gonna be okay
the new crime scene is alive with activity
cops reporters bystanders
morrison sips coffee as paramedics wheel maries corpse to the ambulance
one of them hands something to morrison
a blood splattered digital video tape
we found this on the body
morrison takes it without a word
just got off the phone with the parole board
morrison turns around sees kristen approaching still visibly shaken
they want me to bring elena back to miami in the morning
sorry for this whole mess
morrison considers this picks his words carefully
it was my gun that fired the shots so it mustve been me who pulled the trigger
ill take the credit on this one
after all the black widow crap i had to put up with ive earnt it
you did the right thing
we did the right thing
risten smiles almost moves in and wraps her arms around the detective
he closes his eyes savors the moment
as she pulls away she hands him a card
you call me promise
now that this is all over maybe we can have that drink soon
she leans in kisses him sweetly on the lips
morrison watches her walk away
in spite of all the shit thats gone down hes probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of blue bay
morrisons unmarked sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of the county jail
the gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed jay clifford outside wincing from the bright sunlight
morrison gets out of the car meets jay
how you holdin up jay
he sure has
so whats next
guess theres nowhere to go but up
its all he can do to keep from breaking down
i cant help but feel partially responsible
if theres anything i
jay shakes his head
i dont think so but thanks
can i at least give you a ride somewhere
aint got nowhere to go
morrison watches sadly as jay stumbles past him walking to nowhere in particular
hopeful but up right
the detective heads back to his car stops for a second reaches into his pocket and pulls out kristens already dog eared card
he cant resist
dials the number after four rings theres no message
just a beep
into phone uh kristen its michael again
havent heard from you
hope youre doing okay
everythings fine here
havent been any questions asked that i cant answer an no ones brought your name up
so give me a call back and maybe we can go for that drink
es cut off by
the mail box you are trying to reach is full
your message has been deleted
puzzled he gets into his car
morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter pandemonium
federal officers are everywhere
he tries to pick his way through the crowd when hes intercepted by officer entwistle
you better come with me detective
entwistle leads morrison into his office where agent dammers sits behind his desk
so good to finally see you
what the hell dammers
i should be asking you the same question
morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker dumbfounded
dammers watches him his arms crossed
thats right morrison
every last bit of evidence from the black widow case
not to mention the money you confiscated
i was hoping youd be able to answer that question
what in gods name are you talking about
i didnt have anything to do with it
well your key card was the last one that opened this locker
morrisons heart is beating a mile a minute
a pretty receptionist sits behind a sparse desk when the phone rings
ade county parole
how can i direct your call
morrison paces back and forth on the phone as dammers watches not saying a word
into phone this is detective morrison blue bay pd
i was wondering if you had a forwarding number for kristen richards
shes one of your officers
has cases up here in blue bay
the receptionists fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in front of her
im sorry detective
theres no one here by that name
no of course there is
i worked with her personally
i have no record of a kristen richards ever working here
besides blue bays out of our jurisdiction
morrison struggles to control his emotions
no no no
soft waves lap against a pristine beach
palm trees sway in the warm breeze
a steady whirring is the only sound that disturbs the serenity
is it a lawn mower
a leaf blower
theres a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this idyllic scene
the swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical caribbean sunlight
and stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none other than kristen richards soaking up rays
at her side is a paper shredder and between sips from a pina colada she feeds document after document each one stamped black widow evidence in red ink
kristen looks over at elena equally stunning in a matching bikini
i cant believe morrison just handed me the key to the evidence locker
a broad grin stretches across her lips as elena empties the contents of a velvet pouch onto a table
he mother daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight
nothin like the real thing
switched em for the fakes right after marie tried to pay me off
elena picks up the bigger diamond hands it to kristen
kristen picks up the smaller diamond hands it to elena
morrison paces the infamous crime scene at wits end
dammers stands off to the side just watching him with a bemused look etched across his face
she was the black widow
her and that little
he tries to think of an appropriate slur for elena
cant come up with anything continues pacing frantically
played me like a fool
no need to be so hard on yourself morrison
beat smile thats my job
you smug son of a bitch
its not like you knew who she was anymore than i did
dammers nods slowly
thats the gods honest truth
but at least i didnt give her my evidence locker keycard
and i didnt lie about who fired the shots that killed the clifford kid
morrisons heart sinks
he looks like hes going to faint
steadies himself placing both hands against the wall just as jay did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago
dammers leads morrison to his awaiting car
they pass mr
barajas and cicatriz
barajas is in his usual foul mood
un pinche sink hole
no lo puedo creer
morrison stops regards barajas
what did you say
the foundation is sinking
the entire site is a sink hole
its completely worthless
im going to kill jay clifford
you and me both
elena and kristen lay side by side on loungers soaking in the sun when a voice rouses them
poor detective morrison
its hard to do that to a friend
especially one going through such a nasty divorce
they look up to see jay standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts no shirt sipping at a martini
told me hed never trust another woman as long as he lived
and then along came a spider
a black widow
jay glances at elena as he downs the last drops from his drink
more like widows
gotta say i was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff marie but you know what im over the bitch
elena suddenly gets to her feet
you want me to top you off
thatd be fine just fine
he hands elena his empty glass then kisses kristen tenderly
when they break
shes got a good head on her shoulders
kristen doesnt reply
just smiles watches elena over by the outside bar mixing jays drink
you two got me out of a mountain of shit ill tell you that
craziest goddamn scheme ive ever heard of
but hell you played it perfectly
my job was easy
it was elena who had to keep it all together
weve had some practice along the way
jay turns around smiles at elena as she holds out his drink
here you go mr
jay takes it from her appreciatively sips at it as he sidles off to the swimming pool
well all that nasty business its behind us
from here on out its the good life
he starts to climb the high dive
when he gets to the top he looks down at elena and kristen smiles
you two look so good its difficult to tell which ones the mother and which ones the daughter
kristen calls back up at him
thats just the roofies talking
says it so sweetly it takes a moment for jay to register the sinister implications
what did you say
his eyes are blood shot
he starts to sway atop the high dive
delta chi class of
id never really tasted cocktails like that
jays swaying uneasily on the high dive platform
whattya talking about
it was like being awake though an operation
i could feel everything happening but i couldnt do anything to stop it
you took something from me that night
but you left something behind
jays head is spinning as he looks to kristen to elena
he cant quite get his mind around it
everythings becoming blurry
i dont remember
he looks at the martini glass thinks he sees blue residue before it slips from his fingers falls feet to the concrete below shattering into a million pieces like so
many fake diamonds
lena and kristen stand side by side below him
you may not remember
a broad grin stretches across elenas lips as she finishes
but youll never forget
jay tries to take a step forward
tries in vain to regain his balance
its too late
feet to the unyielding concrete exploding like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup
nice take off
gotta work on the landing
they stand back watching jays pancaked body draining its precious blood into the ice blue pool
lets go get our money
they gather the diamonds walk away as the pool turns crimson red
as the credits roll
an anonymous luxurious office
a fat balding semi conscious man lies curled up on the floor as elena half undressed and wearing a black wig shovels cash into her oversized purse
theres a crackle on her walkie talkie
we got problems
from outside she can hear the wailing of sirens
almost done here
elena gets hesitantly to her feet slides a stack of s in her pocket for good measure
he gonna be able to make an id
elena glances at the man on the floor his puffy eyes glazed over like a jelly donut
not on your life
i gave him enough roofies to make an elephant forget
elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank
the getaway driver
kristen of course
i cant believe we just gave up all that cash
the black widows finally got an angle on our real prey
we goin to blue bay
he wont know what hit him
a smile crosses elenas perfect lips
and the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank
jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his unfinished office
thats an awful lot of money
jay spins round flabbergasted that someones watching him
who the hell
not enough though
gonna need those diamonds if youre gonna ride out this disaster
what the hell do you mean
kristen calmly reaches into her purse pulls out a handful of marbles
throws them onto the ground letting them roll towards jay
ut they stop change direction all coming rolling back in a small circle until they come to rest in the middle of the concrete floor
the buildings built on a sink hole jay
you know it and i know it
gonna need to think fast if you wanna keep the cubans off your back
jays tiny mind cant take it all in
howd you know all this
its what we do
elena walks seductively into the unfinished office
marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool looking at her mothers soon to be diamond ring through teary eyes
i just want whats mine
elena stalks the bleachers behind her
the diamonds are your inheritance
you deserve them
my fucking step monsterll never give me the goddamn key
elena jumps down the bleachers sits down next to marie
so you take it one way or another
behind closed doors chads completing yet another dubious transaction handing over a bag of roofies
the buyer this time
you take a check
money talks bullshit walks
i got strippers to feed
marie fishes out the money from her purse
howd you like to make some real cash
chad likes the sound of that
and its that simple
chad uses jays teeth mouldings to bite elena as marie trains jays video camera on her wailing on her in a drunken stupor
hey that hurt
shut it bitch
no pain no gain
elenas face is pressed against the concrete wall
chad sits at his video console all alone expertly manipulating the audio and video footage
well put you right here and
chad presses play
on the video screen a frightened elena is huddled against the wall
cmon now baby you can do it
elena watches as marie and theo drive away then turns to the glistening mother daughter diamonds
she opens a case with two identical glass replicas and replaces the diamonds
all the while uncle marty snores his head off
to uncle marty irritated will you knock that off
uncle martys eyes snap open
kristen and marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies
youre blocking our sun
looks over her sunglasses at
only all cleaned up in a pair of bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs
he clutches a briefcase
hellova job back there
your best ever if i might be so bold
this is our biggest score
you sure you can move it
not a problem
kristen nods to the briefcase in uncle martys hand
lets see the green
uncle marty lays the case down on the lounger opens it revealing stacks of cash
got another lead if youre interested
was just up in boston surveying a mansion thats just been sold
termites already eaten most of it
owners shitting bricks
theres gotta be an angle for the black widows
kristen and elena look to each other
we had a good run
uncle marty shrugs
guess all good things come to an end
so the diamonds
elena reaches down pulls the diamonds from the sand
hands them over and is about to take the case of money when
how do i know these are the real thing
elena looks to kristen
youre going to have to trust us
