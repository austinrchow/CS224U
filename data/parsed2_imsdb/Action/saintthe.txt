in by jonathan hensleigh director phillip noyce february new york city the only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner
has a future
wilde the majestic city and bay as seen from the elevation of the surrounding shan ho hills as we super panning away from the city we come before the bleak
facade of the saint boys voice o
simon magus was a magician and sorcerer in uhhm
twenty boys aged to sit at spartan desks bibles raised
father oneal walks amongst them
a career jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips
an awful man
and what happened to him francis
francis is the eldest and largest boy
jesus disciples came and performed miracles
when simon magus saw the miracles he offered disciple peter gold for the powers of god
what did disciple peter say to that
father oneal stands before the youngest littlest boy who unlike the others exhibits no fear in his huge intelligent eyes
father oneal hates this boy
the boy michael quinn doesnt respond
father oneal snatches his bible revealing a second book hidden behind it
its a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled the knights answer the question michael
the little boy stares up at him
thats not my name
father oneal yanks the boy from the chair
drags him by the arm across the room and out into the corridor
the other boys wait two seconds then they spring up and run en masse to the door
grouped in the threshold straining for a good view they watch as father oneil pulls michael quinn into an office down the corridor
the door has a stained glass window
we see it in silhouette father oneal with a cane switch in his hand the boy beneath him
down the switch comes
the boy yelps
and again and again and again
and now he screams
the boys huddled in the doorway begin to wince
with every repeated merciless descent of the switch
the boys sit at benches
michael quinn stares stoically ahead
the back of his shirt is striped with blood
father yin s a chinese jesuit grim in black frock and white collar paces amongst the benches
father oneal watches from the side
why one child is born into a good home and another into poverty that is but part of gods design
all of you are unwanted put here because of the sins of your unwedded mothers
the church has fed you and educated you
given you a home
stopping before michael quinn he points to a portrait on the wall of a stern faced jesuit
who is that boy
father michael quinn
a great man
you ungrateful little cur you will sit here without food until you appreciate your namesake
to the other boys all of you will sit with him
put lunch away mr
fong the orphanage cook wheels a food cart into the kitchen and locks the door
father yin exits followed by father oneal and mr
fong leaving a hundred boys staring at michael quinn
again father yin stands before michael quinn
the boys are seated for their evening meal
what is your name boy
michael quinn stares straight ahead
put supper away mr
fong wheels the food cart into the kitchen and locks the door
again a hundred boys stare at michael quinn
a long narrow room with bunkbeds
the boys arent sleeping
theyre grouped around michael quinns bunk
one boy has his hand clamped to michaels mouth the others are wailing on him
and outside fathers oneal and yin watch through the door
spareth the rod spoileth the child
father yin grits his teeth staring down at michael quinn whose face is welted
nothing has changed
put breakfast away mr
again the food cart goes into the kitchen
the fathers and mr
the boys rise moving toward michael quinn
theyre going to kick the living shit out of him
youll have your breakfast
michael quinn walks to the locked kitchen door
the other boys curious follow
michael quinn kneels before the door examining the lock
he looks around
on a counter next to the door are eating utensils
michael quinn picks up a fork
he bends the forks tines
inserts it in the lock
he fishes around for a second
he pulls the fork out rebends it and inserts it in the lock again
the lock pops
michael quinn turns and smiles
the boys flood inside
the hungry boys go for the food cart scooping up eggs and sausage
francis mouth full of sausage beams at michael quinn
they shouldve named you simon like simon magus the sorcerer
pulls the knights templar paperback from his back pocket templar
suddenly a sharp whistle
the boys startled whip their necks around
fong stands in the doorway
father oneal and father yin enter quickly
the boys back away from the food cart
who did this
the boys look at michael quinn
then francis speaks i did father
and another boy james i did father
and another and another i did father
they all say it
and the littlest youngest boy surrounded by his new confederates smiles slightly
his eyes glint
begin main title sequence a chilly september night
a rally is underway in the dvortsovaya ploshchad the vast square at the foot of nevsky prospect boulevard
the winter palace and hermitage loom in the b
peters burgers stand shoulder to shoulder listening to a speech
crews the bbc cnn etc
are transmitting the event
in i lenin stood here and promised a new age
the darkest years in our history
the speaker stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones his image projected on a huge screen like the sony screen in times square above and behind him
he is michael romanov coal haired fierce ardent eyes glinting like onyx voice cutting the night air
in gorbachev stood here and promised a new age
an end to communism
a free economy
and what else
crowd cheers the economy run by criminals the government run by charlatans
and they are in league together
louder cheers men and women of st
petersburg citizens of russia the salt of this country this must end
deafening cheers join me then in the song of our forefathers
romanov begins to sing ably the first verse of mother russia the russian anthem before the bolsheviks
the crowd joins him
the ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million russians
were stories up outside the citys nikko hotel
the rally across town is a distant glow
we hear the singing crowd
two hands appear gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture
a man in black climbs up securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit
a bulky backpack hangs from shoulder straps
he produces a diamond cutter begins carving a man sized aperture in the window
below in the foyer a japanese security man sits at his guard station watching c
news on a small television
wolf blitzer is reporting live from the rally
an extraordinary allegation bernard that russias present leadership including president victor karpov is connected with the countrys underworld
inside the foyer ballroom japanese businessmen are hosting a reception
the nikko hotels core is hollow like the hilton in new york thus the ballrooms ceiling is stories up
champagne servers are passing out glasses
a grey haired japanese businessman hiro myaki clinks his glass
the guests pay attention
during this we focus on a champagne server moving toward the lobby elevators with a full tray
the myaki corporation looks forward to many profitable days ahead
to our new manufacturing facility in st
to the new russia
as the crowd claps
the man in black kicks at the cut section of window pushing it into the hotel and plunging inside after it
the man in black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles and miraculously the piece of window doesnt fall
its stuck to his feet with suction cups
the man in black moves hand over hand toward the mezzanine balcony the window stuck to his feet
everybodys beaming toasting congratulating etc
totally oblivious to the man in black stories up inching hand over hand across the roof superstructure
the man in black has reached the mezzanine
two japanese security guards armed with automatic rifles walk their shift directly below him
they pass a wall mounted television also carrying the news on t
one things certain bernard michael romanov age french born and oxford educated descendent of the last czar is a political force to be reckoned with
the guards move down the mezzanine one jokes the other laughs
they disappear around a corner
the man in black hangs from the girder with one hand with the other he yanks the piece of window off his foot mounted suction cups
he drops to the mezzanine
he rests the glass against the wall
he peers over the balustrade at the party below
satisfied he removes his hood ending titles
this is simon templar
a hard self reliant crafty man
you should treat him as such or be very sorry you ever met him
it is unfortunate that a man of templars various talents can be so lacking
his journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast
this one gives no quarter
though his outward self glows with life he is dead inside
templar focused utterly steals inside a corridor
a long corridor with a door at the end on which is engraved myaki corporation
at the entrance secured in a niche is a bronze bust of templar stops cold
a rug an oriental runner extends the length of the corridor
templar kneels lifting an edge of the rug
revealing anti theft pressure sensors
templar produces a dartgun the size of a flare gun silenced with a spool of steel cable attached to the top
he aims down the corridor and fires
a steel dart explodes from the barrel spooling out the cable and imbeds above the door at corridors end
templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool
he looks around for something to secure it
sorry about this
he ties the cable around myakis bronze neck
he hangs from the cable testing it
it will hold
he pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips
its a glider for the cable
he attaches the glider to the cable grips the handles and glides the length of the corridor
templar bumps up against the door
he pulls his knees up and over the handles of the glider then flops over backwards hanging upside down
his face is now right next to the door handle over which is an electronic lock opened by punching a code
templar pulls out a black box
its a really small really powerful computer and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a minute and a half
templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike he activates the system
the little computer starts running through combinations of numbers
he waits hanging upside down
meanwhile the japanese guards are smoking by the elevator joking laughing
one of these guys is a riot
the elevator opens
the champagne server comes out tray in hand
compliments of mr
beaming they each take a glass
they clink and drink
the computer beeps
templar turns the door handle pushes open the door
he pulls himself up
hangs from his hands again
he swings his legs back and forth getting momentum up
he releases from the glider and lunges inside
a grand boardroom with japanese furniture and art
at the end of a fifty foot mahogany table is a painting of hiro myaki
templar walks over to it
he rips the painting off the wall and heaves it aside
and here where the painting was is a safe
templar unshoulders his backpack
he pulls out a pound carlsbad rinker industrial diamond tipped drill as big as a jackhammer
no finesse here people
no theres no time for high tech
hes going to drill right through the bitch right through four inches of tungsten steel
he starts setting up the drill
two champagne glasses lie shattered on the floor and next to that mess lie the japanese guards now unconscious
the champagne servers gone
because hes here moving quickly toward the myaki corporations office and hes not a champagne server but a thief and a killer a blonde russian named ilya
ilya stops just outside the interior corridor
with the guards keyring he shuts off the anti theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor
ilya stops short
his eyes spark
he sees templars cable and glider
templar wearing goggles leans into the drill as the bit chews into the tungsten lock
this is a violent exercise
sinews of metal spit out like shrapnel
hes through the lock in seconds
templar heaves the drill aside it lands with a thud on the beautiful mahogany table
he opens the safe
inside the safe is one object a small box the size of a cufflink keeper
templar grabs it and opens it
inside the little box is a tiny micro chip
templar closes the box and pockets it
his eyes twitch
this wasnt in the plan
templar faces ilya
ilya has a silenced handgun
on your knees
templar sinks to his knees give me the box
templar pulls out the box
tosses it to ilya
ilya raises the handgun at templars head
try something throw an extension cord on the ground
i guarantee it will land coiled in several places
ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drills extension cord
and this is not lost on templar
templar on his knees grabs the cord and yanks it the coil tightens around ilyas ankles
his legs fly from under him and he goes down the gun clattering across the floor
ilya tries to get to his feet
templar floors him with a right cross
templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room
ilya gains his feet and grabs his gun sprints after templar
templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it
he jumps clutching the ceiling girder above
hes going out the way he came in
suddenly ilyas hands are around his ankles
hes going stories to his death
his fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade
templar dangles there looking up at the sadistic face of ilya
and suddenly below a japanese woman looking up pointing at the man dangling from the balustrade above screams
and now everybody looks up
sound the alarm
call the police
ilya and templar
ilya calmly compresses his foot against templars left knuckles
the box please
templar grimacing reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his pocket
hands it slowly to ilya who reaches over the balustrade for it
templar stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs ilyas hand jerking him over the balustrade
ilya falls stories to his death
no he doesnt
he falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade there templar clambers up again atop the balustrade
he jumps to the ceiling girder
hand over hand swinging like an acrobat templars across the girder in seconds
he releases from the girder to the window frame
theres one further problem
ricocheting all around him
fired by ilya one floor down
templar reaches over his shoulder
pulls a gun from his backpack
to return fire
no its the dart gun
templar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires
a steel dart launches from the window flies fifty yards and imbeds in the templar ties the cable to the ceiling girder
he pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable
he grabs both ends of the hood
and he jumps
templar flies through space across the cable the hood acting as a makeshift glider
he lands on the roof of the adjacent building
templar looks around
sirens are wailing
he runs across rooftops disappearing into the st
women screaming everybody running around
ilya comes through the panicked crowd
petersburg policemen enter
i tried to stop him
he went out the window
five policemen go for the elevators
five more exit quickly
the befuddled police race off looking skyward at the top floors of the building
ilya curses silently
and peels away from the cops and commotion off into the night
the first class section
the plane is in flight
a stewardess young perky comes down the aisle pushing a magazine newspaper cart
simon templar sits there dressed as usual without much heed to fashion
note this reader templar is not a super spy super hero or super rake
he is a thief
hes examining several antique russian bracelets and lockets
he looks up at the stewardess
cockney wow are those gorgeous or what
you have an eye for beauty
of course you see it every time you look in the mirror
she blushes fidgets as his eyes bore in on her
why thank you mr
reads seat assignment templar
she continues down the aisle smiling to herself
templar resumes with his lockets
the plane has landed
passengers are filing out past the stewardess
goodbye goodbye enjoy your stay in london etc
templar moves past the stewardess carrying two carry on bags
he winks at her
she winks back and fingers one of the russian lockets now around her neck
good bye mr
as templar moves off she smiles to herself and cut to templar walks briskly away from customs
a man in trenchcoat falls in behind templar
two men appear in front of templar blocking his path the man behind templar comes to his side
they are scotland yard men baker teal and inspector macduff
hows the weather in st
lets warm things up for you
baker and teal gruffly take templar by the shoulder and walk him forward and cut to a spartan room a table and two chairs
macduff ransacks templars bags while across the room templar kisses the wall hands outstretched as baker finishes frisking him
to macduff careful with that
its delicate equip
macduff lifts templars mm pistol from the bag
its for protection
i deal in antique
snaps i know what you deal in
he holds up templars black bodysuit
my doctors recommended five miles a
sit down and shut it
templar sits down
baker has templars papers
he holds up a certificate
hes licensed to carry inspector
lets see the passport
baker hands macduff templars passport whats your nationality this week templar
looks at passport issued by the principality of
youre bloody joking
shrugs call the embassy macduff whips the passport at templar
templar calmly moves his head the passport flies by
hits the wall
macduff leans down coming in close
templar doesnt blink
his expression never changes
you pass through russia for a day with that gear and what a surprise a prototype computer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked from the myaki corporation
the night you arrive
we know you didnt fence it in russia
where is it
the door opens
teal enters tossing several x ray photographs on the table before macduff
two are of templars bags two are of his body
cockney all negative
he didnt swallow it
an embarrassing pause
youve got three options charge me or release me
whats the third
you can kiss my ass
a dreadful pause
he turns away then turns back and viciously backhands templar across the face templars head jerks
the blow would knock most men out
now templar smiles
like a serpant
and says calmly im a busy man
make up your mind
macduff stares at templar gritting his teeth
begins collecting his things
a quaint place off piccadilly
the stewardess from templars flight gulps a martini
she is tipsy
she shows it
then me mum says call uncle charlie hes in the airline business theres jobs there good benefits too and

templar enduring this sits opposite with a scotch

templar motions to a passing waitress

she rises wheres the loo in ere

she smiles crookedly hands over the locket

she blows templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom
templar watches her a moment
when shes gone he puts the locket on the table
he pries open the back of it with a pen knife
insert the locket there is a compartment in which sits the stolen micro chip
templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope
as she returns to the table
she sits down
the lockets gone
the waitress appears
maam wheres the gent who was sitting ere
he left luv
said youd take care of the bill
she hands the stewardess the bill
she stares at it
she sinks down confused blinking near tears
cut to a small plush discrete residential hotel in the heart of mayfair regent street grovesnor sq
templar approaches the front desk with his carry on bags
concierge harry winston and the hotel manager are behind the desk
good to see you sir
your room key south penthouse as usual
your suits are up from storage pressed of course and theres a bottle of oban on the dresser
oh and harry
pulls out the envelope with the computer chip ship this by overnight courier to that address
very good sir
jimmy a young bellman takes ternplars bags
templar doesnt let go
an uncomfortable pause
templar carries his own bags
templar steps past jimmy into the elevator
whats with the bags govnuh
theyre all he ever brings
the mans bills are paid by a bank in switzerland and his mailing address is a corporation in lisbon
no sir hes just shy
ternplar sits at a desk with a bottle of oban scotch and glass staring at the screen of a modemed mini computer
templar types lion contacting zebra is zebra home
and this comes back affirmative lion
templar types pigeon is flying will arrive a
and this back excellent
lion gets lions share
templar types a new command
a new screen appears templar types in n ls z
this appears balance as of s u
not a typo reader
its forty seven million bucks
templar picks up his scotch and drinks staring at the screen
hes waiting for something
the first digit vanishes
a appears in its place
now fifty seven million
templar permits a slight smile having just made million dollars and drinks his scotch
the phone rings
templar eyes it skeptically
he picks it up
a voice with an eastern european accent is this simon templar
midnight blackfriars bridge
a lot of money
if you want it
templar recradles the receiver he stares at it a moment and cut to templar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench coat
he goes to the desk where concierge harry winston looks up
harry im going for a walk over blackfriars bridge
and harry just perceptibly nods
and returns to his obsequious self
very good sir
templar walks off through the lobby
jimmy jimmy walks over its about time i taught you how to run the front desk
the bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow
below a tugboat plows the river horn bellowing
the lights of southwark twinkle beyond
templar enters from victoria embankment
two figures emerge from the fog
one is a huge dim wit with greasy hair as tall and wide as a bookcase
his name aptly is zero
the other is middle aged and strongly built
a high forehead clipped irongrey hair square jaw and aquiline nose deep set ruthless unblinking eyes
this is gregor tretiak
to characterize him as the john gotti of russia is to demean him
he is vastly more powerful
sizes up templar you are not a big man
but men like you never are
it is my pleasure simon templar
my name is
i know who you are
tell me what you want or i keep walking
suppose i dont want anything
suppose i want to kill you
suppose theres a high powered rifle trained at your head
as tretiaks eyes dart about templar raises his hand waving signaling to someone below the bridge that someone is concierge harry winston in a cloth cap and rain mack now
and yes he has a
scoped rifle trained at tretiaks head
back to the bridge tretiaks jaw muscles twitch
he smiles thinly
rumour has not lied about you mr
last night something was stolen in st
you talk about the place as if you own it
sinisterly i do mr
may i ask who hired you
you can ask
i wont answer
what you stole i wanted very badly
ilya emerges from the shadows
locks eyes with templar
the thief from the nikko
what is the saying if you cant beat them why not join them
an american phrase no
or are you british
get to the point
smiles of course
an american scientist has worked ten years to develop a certain technology
i am informed that the technology will be made public at the annual nuclear science symposium in washington d
i would like the plans and specifications for this technology
before the symposium
what are we talking about
a nuclear fusion generator
we have a man on the inside
why cant he steal it
the scientist trusts no one and keeps no hard records of the technology in the lab
they say its mankinds only hope after all the oils gone
this guys actually done it
the scientist is a woman
hands over a dossier her dossier
all the information you will need
my fee is fifteen million u
dollars half up front half when i deliver
youll hear from me
templar turns and walks off
templar one question
i ask you to steal a persons entire lifes work
you have no reaction
are you that cold
templar stares back expressionless
he turns and disappears into the fog
no rumor hasnt lied about you templar
various establishing shots of this suburban community just north of manhattan
pretty charming affluent
a large suburban supermarket
the aisles are full of westchester women affluent country clubby housewifey types
a hand reaches for a bottle of lemonade natural bringing it down to the eye level of jillian st
she is lean a swimmers body perhaps with terrific acuteness and authority in her thought speech and action
debate this woman
fine but youd better know what the hell youre talking about
her stare can stop a train
shes casually dressed
only her jacket stands out
its waist cut with a colorful diagram of protons and electrons circling a nucleus embroidered on the back
reads ingredients filtered water high fructose corn syrup
lemon juice concentrate
grumbles totally natural yeah right
she returns the bottle and turns coming face to face with simon templar wearing a moustache and glasses now
he has a bottle of lemon juice in his hand
smiles sorry i overheard
hands her the bottle the real thing
no chemicals no preservatives
she reads the label
satisfied she looks at templar
she puts it in her cart and wheels off and cut to jillian is examining apples
there is a thumping noise
finally she looks over at templar
hes standing in front of the watermelons
hes thumping one with his thumb
he notices jillian
these arent ripe
how are the apples
theyre in season
templar walks over to the apples
picks one up
studies it for a moment
i wonder why he didnt want us to eat these
she looks at him puzzled
in the garden of eden
sorry little slow today
looks at the apple uhm actually i dont know
why wasnt it no bananas
or avoid at all cost kumquats
wonder what god had against apples
she gives him a funny look and turns away
cant help you
how about william tell
you really think he shot one of these off his brothers head with an arrow
jillian turns around again
do i know you
i just moved to new york
she stares at him
this is a very strange man
intriguing yes but also possibly a lunatic
she decides to take the dismissive route well uhhm sir to answer your apple questions one i dont know what gods problem was
two william tell like paul bunyon never existed
and in case youre wondering isaac newton discovered gravity through planetary observation not because one of those fell on his head and i seriously doubt that eating one a day
will keep the doctor away
she wheels her cart off
says over her shoulder by the way welcome to the big apple
templar watches her wheel off
his eyes glint
this is going to be interesting
jillian slams down the hatch of her station wagon now filled with groceries
she gets in
the car pulls out of the parking lot
jillian driving drinking her lemonade listens to a cassette tape
an authoritative scholarly indian voice vijay singh v
cassette nuclear fusion occurs when pairs of nuclei meet and their protons and neutrons fuse together into a single nucleus
the fused nuclei move off at high speed producing energy
nuclear fusion could provide us with almost unlimited power
vijay singh v
cassette all you need are two hydrogen gases deuterium and lithium and a machine to make them fuse under controlled conditions
tell me something i dont know
jillian sees something through the windshield
she turns down the volume and squints a rolls royce sits on the road shoulder
as we pass the rolls we see simon templar standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression
looks at the rolls in the rear view mirror
just keep driving
jillian frowns again
against her better judgment she pulls over
throws it in reverse
jillians station wagon backs up to the rolls royce on the road shoulder
jillian gets out
she walks up to him
together they look down at the rear tire
its flat a pancake
wheres the spare
im not really certain
you do know how to change a tire
beat im not very
jillian rolls her eyes
give me your keys
templar hands them over
they walk to the rear
jillian opens the trunk
they both look down at
the trunks interior the spare tire is also flat
jillian rolls her eyes again
all right where do you live
its your lucky day
begins to walk off come on
templar watches her walk off
he smiles grimly
the car winds through westchester roads
vijay singh v
cassette research has centered on a machine called a tokamak developed in russia essentially a doughnut shaped tube that contains the gases to be fused
at this templar stares at the tape cassette
vijay singh v
cassette the tokamak hasnt worked because the two gases must be heated to a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees and kept together for several seconds
try room temperature idiot
the tokamaks got it all backwards
who is that
a powerful well respected man who doesnt know a goddarnn thing what hes talking about
if i got one tenth of his funding
jillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player
she looks out the window grumbling
they drive on
its the next left
first driveway on the right
jillians station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in westchester county
jillian stares open mouthed at the mansion
you live here
turns to him are you for real
he picks up jillians lemonade bottle
like the label says
no chemicals no preservatives
points at the house you work for this or inherit it
my father made shoes
i inherited the company

i believe the fourth finger on your left hand is
quickly okay so im not married

id be surprised if you didnt have several

jillian pops the wagons back hatch and gets out
they walk to the wagons rear
what about you
theres no wife stashed on some island someplace
no wife stashed on some island
they pick up templars groceries each takes two bags
no bimbo on the side
not a one
they walk toward the mansion
well thats a start

they set the groceries on a wicker couch

jillian fishes for a pen

she walks off to her car
templar turns toward the front door
jillian suddenly stops
templar turns whats my number
without hesitation eight seven seven five two nine eight
jillian smiles and continues toward the car mumbling and he has a brain
what do you know
at the mansions front door templar watches jillian get in her wagon and drive off
then templar keys open the door and enters
the place is empty
just templars two carry on bags on the floor in front of templar
its late now
templar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of scotch studying jillians life
there are pages of personal data and many photographs jillian in cap and gown jillian in a lab coat jillian at the beach etc
a legal pad with templars handwritten note templar stares into the screen of his mini computer
it is two hours later
insert the mini computer screen templar has entered every detail of jillians life
looks like this home state massachusetts hometown milton highschool milton academy highschool mascot bulldogs university harvard university mascot crimson it just goes on and on names of parents family members
teachers pets boyfriends favorite movies colors sports teams hobbies etc
templar finishes entering the details of jillians life
he copies it onto a disk pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer
he leans down and picks up a shoe box
he lifts out a womans shoe and jerks the heel which lifts away from the sole on hinges
revealing a hidden compartment in which templar places a small transistor
he clicks the heel shut
the shoe the same shoe now on jillians foot and widen to jillian and templar at a corner table in le cirque
the meal is over
theyre drinking coffee laughing at ease
the date is going well
i am not eccentric
you live in the biggest house in america but do your own shopping you talk to strange women about the history of apples and you give a first time date
isnt the tradition flowers
you said you liked them
they smile at each other
a waiter brings more coffee
theres a sudden commotion
jillian and templar look across the room a group of waiters are clapping their hands for a young couple seated at a table
to the waiter what happened
smiles he just asked her to marry him
jillian looks at the radiant young couple
just the check please
the waiter exits jillian looks at him you didnt answer my question
maybe it made you uncomfortable
maybe i should just shut up
no its all right
okay why jillian never got married chapter one i dont know where youre from
i dont know what its like there but here if a teenage girl doesnt want to be a cheerleader or drink till she pukes every weekend or talk endlessly on
the phone every night about absolutely nothing then she doesnt win many popularity contests know what i mean

the waiter arrives with the check gives it to templar
jillian picks up her purse and takes her wallet out
templar sees her doing this
no no no absolutely not

its not for us
its for the couple over there
points at the couple across the room waiter put their bill on my card please

the waiter takes jillians card exits
jillian smiles at templar
due to his mean origins and evolution templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life and this was the third
thus does simon templar smile uneasily back
neat modest non descript
jillian and templar enter
jillian walks across the living room into a bar alcove off the living room

he smiles nods ill be back in ten minutes
points at fireplace build a fire
she winks at him and exits
templar walks to the window and stands there waiting
we hear jillians car start see the headlights
youre making this too easy dear
he pulls from his pocket a black case flips it open turns it on
on a miniature computer screen is a detailed map of westchester county
two locations are pulsing jillians house and a moving object transmitted from a homing device which we now see its in jillians shoe as she stamps on the brake at
a stoplight and waits and we cut back to the house
templar moves down the hall opening doors looking for jillians lab
he moves quickly ruthlessly
he comes to a heavily locked fire door
he unpockets a set of burglars tools
for templar these locks are a joke
he opens them with alarming speed
he pushes open the door revealing a descending staircase
templar finds a lightswitch and flips it on
his eyes widen
here we find jillians laboratory
a pool of water the size of a small swimming pool is surrounded by hundreds of test tubes of various shapes and sizes containing chemicals
templar moves through eyes scanning everything
he sees jillians computer
walks over to it
he unpockets the homing system and sets it on the desk
the pulsing light is still moving jillian hasnt yet reached the liquor store
he turns on jillians monitor and hard drive
the computer screen blinks on
we see a menu a
personal finances b
income tax c
things to do d
research templar positions the cursor on e
research and hits enter
the modem engages this appears then this appears retrieval code smart girl
send your data into cyberspace and only you can retrieve it
because only you have the code
he unpockets the disk containing the data from jillians life and pushes it into the disk drive
he types a command a new screen appears press any key to begin templar hits a key and the old screen reappears but now in the space next to retrieval
code templars data appears
word after word like this massachusetts computer access denied boston computer access denied
milton computer access denied milton academy computer access denied bulldogs computer access denied its incredibly fast a new word appearing every second as the system tries to crack jillians code
but the computer denies access to each word
the homing device suddenly beeps
the pulsing light has stopped indicating jillian is at the liquor store
templar grimly turns back to the computer
the clerk walter hands jillian her change
she exits with a scotch bottle in a brown wrapper
templar paces he looks at the homing device
the pulsing light is moving back toward jillians house
templar looks at the computer his system continues entering words hendrix
on and on
each is met with jillian driving turns on the radio
she hums along
templar stares at the homing device the pulse is getting closer its do or die now
templars system suddenly stops
it has run through every word
each has met with failure
he yanks the system disk from the disk drive
he begins pacing
templar suddenly gets an idea
he sits and types tokamak
access denied templar stares at the screen in frustration
he looks at the homing device the pulsing light is getting really close
templar concentrates with every brain cell
we can feel him think
hes remembering something
were in jillians car again when they first met
try room temperature idiot
the tokamaks got it all backwards
templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out tokamak
under this he spells it backwards kamakot
he turns to the computer and types kamakot and instantly this flashes open sesame
the retrieval begins a document appears on the screen submitted by dr
thomas templar scrolls through the document we see a dizzying display of graphs tables plans specifications etc
templar pulls out the disk containing jillians data and shoves a fresh disk into the disk drive
he begins copying jillians research from harddrive to disk
he looks at the homing device
christ shes almost back
and indeed jillians car comes wheeling into the driveway
the document is copied
templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive and rips the slip of paper from the notepad
he flicks off the computer and sprints across the lab then up the stairs
jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters she comes in
templar relaxed lounges on the couch flipping through some magazines
he smiles that was quick
she walks past him to the bar alcove
michael quinn lets have that scotch
hey what happened to the fire
i thought wed create our own
smiles down boy
he gets up goes to the fireplace grabs some logs and lays them across the andirons and we the logs now gently burning
cole porter is playing
camera pans past jillians shoes on the carpet past the oban scotch on the coffee table now half empty to the couch where jillian and templar are locked in a
whoah whoah whoah time to put on the brakes
those lips oughtta be licensed buddy
i wasnt trying to
i know you werent but if we keep going im gonna be the one who gets us both in trouble
fans herself havent felt like that for awhile
she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes am i going to see you again
perhaps just perhaps for the first time in his black life templars having a hard time lying
smiles at her how about breakfast
its a date
ill walk you out shoemaker
in the threshold they kiss again
templar walks off to his rolls royce parked in the driveway
he smiles at her and waves
he turns toward his car his face goes hard and cold
on the nevsky prospect st
petersburgs equivalent of the champs elysees michael romanov stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a palatial mansion taking up a whole city block
ten thousand supporters surround him
many carry large slogan filled banners
four thuggish looking men stand guard inside the mansions compound giving romanov the eye
one is zero tretiaks bodyguard on blackfriars bridge
where is russias capital
no russias capital is
points at mansion crowd cheers a den of thieves
a limousine pulls through the crowd which reluctantly parts
the guards within the compound open the gates
and here the prince of thieves
gregor tretiak sits in the back of the limousine silently glaring at romanov
the limousine rolls inside the compound the gates clanging shut
every citizen in st
petersburg knows what that man does yet the police dont arrest him
they protect him
how can this be
maybe we should ask our elected whores in moscow
the crowd cheers wildly and starts hurling rocks bottles etc through the gate at tretiak emerging from the limousine
tretiaks guards surround him they move quickly up the mansions marble steps dodging the thrown debris
four large police vans roar up the back doors flinging open
petersburg police in riot gear deploy from the vans
the police push into the crowd wielding riot shields and batons
a melee breaks out romanov supporters versus the police
tretiak and his men move past a guard station manned by two guards watching six surveillance monitors showing at all times certain areas of
this is a former noblemans residence a foot diameter crystal chandelier hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above
a spectacular staircase ascends to a mezzanine with offices formerly bed chambers off it
tretiak approaches a man in a lab coat zubov wearing a grim anxious expression
zubov chainsmokes constantly
theres a problem
tretiak follows zubov down stairs into a large room with technicians hunched over computers
tretiak follows zubov to a large bank of computers
indicates computer this is the data your thief sent us
tretiak looks at zubovs computer screen
insert the computer screen
again we see submitted by confused cold fusion
fusion at room temperature
regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community
smiles then i read this
zubov begins scrolling through the document again we see the displav of graphs
she first proves why hot fusion the tokamak is impractical
you must heat the hydrogen gases so high more energy is wasted than created
here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion
scrolls more pages the hydrogen isotopes needed
scrolls more pages the physical plant
she even estimates its cost
scrolls more pages the next pages are the critical part what no one in fifty years has discovered
looks up at tretiak the combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature
tretiak leans toward the screen waiting
tretiak i think from reading this that the womans done it
she may have found a source of unlimited energy
what do you mean may have
i said there was a problem
zubov hits the scroll key
the next page appears we see the heading at the top of the page the chemical environment for cold fusion but theres something wrong with the rest of the page
we know this because of tretiaks expression and its not too happy
wheres the rest of it
its in her head
and cut to jillian humming the cole porter song from the previous evening fills a basket with breakfast for two eggs bagels etc
sunlight streams in
she wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back
she grabs flowers from a vase tosses them in the basket
she enters with the basket
looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of oban
she hums the cole porter song stabs her feet in the shoes templar gave her and goes to the front door
jillian comes out running into yuri her lab assistant who comes up the front stoop
mid s heavy russian accent white lab coat
good morning boss
where are you going
to see a friend
be back in a couple hours
she gets in her car
yuri gives her a look goes inside
the foyer phone rings
in russian theres been a change of plans
yuri stares at the phone and the huge estate as before
jillians station wagon pulls into the circular driveway
jillian gets out with the breakfast basket
moves up the flagstoned walk
suddenly the front door opens
a woman mid s pretty and well dressed comes out and locks the door
jillian watches her
the woman comes down the walk
may i help you
beat do you have an appointment
to see the house
the man who lives here
who owns the house
the estate is rented for weddings and corporate events
the rental agent gives jillian a funny look and gets in her car
jillian stares at the house thunderstruck
then she sharply inhales oh my god
jillian gets in her car
templars computer screen which reads templar sits in the british air lounge
he has shaved and his eyeglasses are gone he looks like himself again
in the b
businessmen are relaxing reading newspapers drinking coffee
over the intercom varig air flight to rio de janeiro departing at a
m boarding now from gate seventeen
templar checks his wristwatch its a
templar types in his password and waits
on the screen this balance as of u
the same balance since london
somethings not right
he hasnt been paid
jillian runs down the hall breath escaping her lungs
the supermarket the flat tire all a set up
calls down the hall yuri
she unpockets her keyring her hands trembling uncontrollably
jillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer
she moves in a panic as if in a living nightmare
she turns the computer on
she types in the code word kamakot and her research paper appears on the screen
in the lower right corner it reads last entered p
she sees something on the desk
the notepad on which templar wrote his notes
the page is indented with templars pen marks the words tokamak and kamakot are clearly visible
no this cant be happening
turns calling she jumps startled because yuri is right behind her
he moves toward her and woman o
is that a good system
a woman s dowdy and serious in an accountant like way has sat down across from templar
points at templars computer
woman accountant o
going to europe
templar ignores her uhmm im going for coffee
its really no trouble
okay lady anything to get rid of you sure
she smiles and walks off to the coffee counter passing a businessman who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the wall street journal
templar eyes the man then looks back at his computer
he begins typing
the phone modem engages
templar types lion contacting bear
is bear home
this comes back affirmative
templar types lion has not been paid
this comes back lions data is defective
templar types define defective
this comes back lions employment terminated
templar stares at the screen his mind racing
the accountant woman comes back to the table with templars coffee
sets it before him
british air flight to london now boarding from gate fifteen
i repeat british air flight
the woman accountant rises picks up her bag
well thats me
templar sort of smiles back
she walks off to catch her flight
the businessman next to templar hidden behind his newspaper sets his coffee cup down next to templars
the businessman flips a page engrossed in an article
he reaches back for his coffee but takes templars cup
he drinks from the cup
excuse me thats my
the businessmans newspaper is shaking
it falls to the table
the businessmans face is flushed
he pitches over
his head thuds on the table
templar feels the businessmans carotid artery
templar picks up his coffee and smells it
templars eyes dart to the lounge
the lady accountant is gone
nobody in the lounge has noticed whats happened
templar hurriedly collects his things
an airport taxi stops at the curb
templar gets out paying the cabbie
the taxi pulls away
templar approaches the house eyes darting
he moves toward the door unpocketing his mm pistol
he checks the doorknob turning it
no one is here
he moves through the living room into the back corridor glancing into the kitchen where we see that someone is behind the refrigerator holding a silenced gun in a blackgloved
templar moves through the hall looking in each door
he comes to the lab staircase
the door is open
templar heads down the stairs
templar comes down he walks to the computer
he looks at the document on the screen
he begins scrolling going to the end this time
we see the graphs tables plans specs
then the critical page appears and under that
a nintendo game
little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships
templar stares at it stunned what he sent the russians is essentially worthless
templar shuts off the monitor
the screen blackens
the black screen reflects light
it reflects a person coming down the stairs
a person with a gun
templar dives away as three bullets blow the computer monitor to shards
the woman from the j
lounge not an accountant but an assassin draws a bead on templar who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as bullets shatter bottles beakers test tubes glass fills
templar stands up his mm leveled at the woman
the womans gun is leveled at templar
thats a reuger nine shot
i counted nine
what if youre wrong
the tension boils
templar was right her hand flashes to the gun ejecting the spent clip
she tries to ram in a fresh clip but shes not fast enough
templars across the room in half a second
he presses his gun to her forehead
when were you hired and for what
im not in a very good mood
templar cocks the hammer
this gets her attention
take it easy
i was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out and detonate the house
it was empty when i got here
whos your employer
i dont ask names
did they have accents
she nods he lowers his gun im paying you out of your contract
dont ask questions
whats your price
fifty thousand for you fifty for her fifty for the house
templar pulls out his wallet from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper
hands them to her
she examines them
good as cash
about the airport no offense you understand
go and dont come back
and she turns and walks off
templar enters looking around thinking
he looks in the bathroom
he looks in the closet
on the floor are jillians footwear sneakers pumps cowboy boots etc
right templar the shoes
templar pulls out his homing device and clicks it on
like before an electronic rendering of westchester county
but no pulsing light
templar enters commands adjusting the screen widening it to greater new york
somewhere in queens fairly close to the atlantic ocean we see a pulsing light
but its fixed inert
the pulsing light begins to move east quickly
templar watches it
the pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile
and its heading for the ocean
and it goes in the ocean
dawning on him a
indeed simon templar a plane
a mid sized gulfstream
jillian sits in a wheelchair covered with a blanket
slowly opens her eyes
yuri lifts away the blanket
jillians wrists are tied to the wheelchair armrests her ankles to the footrests
yuri produces a syringe
he grabs jillians forearm and pushes in the needle
jillians head bobs forward
templar hurries through the concourse with his carry on bags taking a left moving past sign the passengers are in a line going through security
templar walks up next to a guy in a brooks brothers suit
stares at him
after a few seconds of this
can i help you with something
whatd you pay for it
ill give you twenty grand for it
they stop i need to get on that plane
very badly obviously
studies templar fifty thousand and its yours
templar rolls his eyes but the guy is unmoved
templar scowls and pulls out his bearer bonds
a hangar at marseilles marignane airport
a man is sprawled inside the engine cowling of a wwi classic biwing fighter
we only see his legs
remy samarkand s algerian pulls himself up and sits on the engine cowling
bandanna around neck
a tattoo here a scar there
coco a young mechanic hands remy a cellular phone
coco walks off remy samarkand aeronautique remy samarkand
i need a favour remy
smiles anything for simon templar
the concorde touches down as we super templar with his carry on bags and remy samarkand run across the tarmac toward a lear jet being fueled
in the b
sits the huge concorde jet
they yell over the howling jet engines
the homing device the screen shows a map of europe
two locations are pulsing remys jet moving north from paris and the jet carrying jillian moving across scotland heading due east
the plane is in flight
templars homing device and mini computer sit on the cockpit console
what are you smuggling these days
how long has it been two year
now tell me whats so important about this plane
fifteen million dollars of my money
picks up cellular phone and a score to settle
templar punches numbers and cut to the citys decrepid industrial section
panning past buildings we come to the facade of apex electronics the only well maintained building on the block
a throbbing drum beat is heard within
you could eat off the floor
a stereo plays german techno rock at a zillion decibals
a communications satellite hangs from a hoist
berta frank hereafter frankie late s blonde spiky hair pretty in a sort of dangerous way is soldering a panel of transistors to the satellite
a wall mounted t

frankie lights a cigarette
gregor tretiak is not a very nice man simon

four hours later
jillian sits head bowed unconscious
yuri sits opposite
he is nodding off
if only jillian could wake up
the pilot shouts back
were over helsinki
yuri wakes sits upright
remys peering out the window
two miles ahead the russian jet roars past heading east toward st
remy jerks the stick banking into a right turn behind the russian jet
remy looks at his altitude gauge
remy looks at templar templar nods back
remy pushes the stick the lear jet begins descending
jillian sits still unconscious
or is she
through the tiniest slit of eye so as not to appear conscious jillian looks at yuri then at two parachutes shelved above the emergency exit
back to scene yuri stands up and stretches
he goes to the window and looks out
wheelchair trivia wheelchair armrests are removable enabling a patient to transfer himself from the chair to a regular chair or car seat etc
jillians right hand photographed in extreme close up under the blanket pulls out the pin securing the armrest to the wheelchair
she lifts the armrest separating the aluminum tubing freeing her right wrist
through the windshield is the russian gulf stream
remy his headset on turns to templar
petersburg tower wants us to circle
follow them down
what do we do when we land
havent figured that out yet
the aircraft is tilted forward in descent
the pilot shouts back to yuri russian subtitled prepare for landing
the pilot shuts the cockpit door
suddenly jillians eyes are open her hands are free and shes throwing off the blanket and gripping the wheels
she pushes the wheelchair bursts forward
yuri gets to his feet the wheelchair slams against his shins
jillian whips the detached armrest across yuris head
yuri falls backward dazed
jillian rolls to the emergency door one hand yanking open the door the other grabbing a parachute from the shelf
wind howls through the cabin
jillian gets the parachute on
her ankles are still bound to the footrests
to hell with it shell lose the wheelchair in mid air
she pushes forward as yuri lunges across the floor grabbing the wheels
jillian and the chair teeter on the edge of emergency door exit half in half out
yuri clings to the chair wheels
his body jerks forward
hes sliding on his stomach
jillian and the chair are pulling him out
terror in yuris eyes
he grabs for the door frame
his fingers slip
jillian the wheelchair and yuri hanging from the wheelchair plunge from the aircraft
templars bagging his computer and homing device
remy suddenly clutches his arm
templar looks up
templar s remy s pov through windshield jillian and yuri fall from the aircraft
the pilot looking down at jillian and yuri clicks on his short wave radio we have a problem
jillian freefalls in the wheelchair her ankles still bound to the chairs footrests
yuri is beneath her clutching the wheels
he tries to pull himself up
jillian yanks the rip cord a plume of silk spills out and jillian and the chair slingshot up decelerating from m
in two seconds
yuri cant take the g force his hands rip away from the chair
he plummets screaming and feet later he will hit concrete in st
jillian pulls out the footrest pins the footrests separate from the chair in the same manner freeing her ankles
the chair releases falling away
templar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him
he yanks open one designated parachutes
two huge toucans fly out of the hatch
they flap around the cockpit
templar looks askance at remy
i get ten grand for them in paris
maybe a russian would pay more
templar grabs a parachute pack and races to the back of the plane
he yanks open the emergency exit door
cold air blasts his face
put down in helsinki and wait for my call
and templar jumps and an autumn day in peter the greats city
pedestrians walk the streets
petersburg is called venice of the north because its built atop marshy islands connected by canals
there are over bridges on the canals boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic
a woman glancing up notices something
woman russian look
points skyward look
other pedestrians stop
they too look up at a parachutist jillian of course descending into the heart of the city
and down she comes landing hard in the middle of an intersection
taxis and automobiles swerve aside nearly killing her
others screech to a stop
jillian gets to her feet wild eyed and frantic tangled in cord and parachute silk
she looks around at crowds of pedestrians staring at her
petersburg police cruiser comes through the intersection to a stop
a young cop just hangs up his c
radio and gets out
he approaches jillian
across the neva river from jillian is a city park with a huge equestrian statue of peter the great
under the statue two old russian geezers are playing chess smoking pipes arguing etc
down templar comes
the parachute snags on the bronze horses head
templar dangles feet off the ground
he looks at the geezers directly below
sorry about this
he shrugs off the parachute pack and falls landing on the chess board scuttling the pieces
the geezers fall backward on their behinds
templar gets to his feet gaining his bearings looking for jillian
he takes off running
jillian sits in the back seat catching her breath
the young cop looks at her in the rear view mirror
do you speak english
takes a deep breath composes herself im an american scientist
last night in new york a man stole something from me then this morning i was kidnapped by my lab assistant god this sounds like a bad novel
suddenly a rock bounces off the windshield
what was that
the police cruiser moves past a throng of michael romanov supporters carrying placards and banners
they begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles
the cruiser clears the romanov supporters
rocks and bottles smash on the back windshield
there could be revolution maybe
city very dangerous
in the intersection ahead two other police cruisers pull into the street blocking it
the young russian cop brakes the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers
an older russian cop followed by a plainclothesman approach the young cops cruiser
templar sprints across the neva river bridge connecting the peter and paul park with downtown st
he suddenly stops short seeing jillian in the cruiser the older cop and the plainclothesman approaching
the older cop leans in the window
russian is this her
russian yes sir sergeant ravik
the plainclothesman emerges from behind the older cop
in one shocking effortless motion he places a silenced handgun to the young cops head and squeezes the trigger
blood spatters the windshield
jillian gasps in horror at the plainclothesman
the older cop opens the door shoving the young cops corpse to the passenger side
ilya gets in back next to jillian pressing the handgun into her ribs
the cruiser roars off into st
templar looks around
he sees a motorcycle stand filled with motorcycles
runs to it
chooses a big powerful honda street machine
he pulls out his burglars tools jams one in the ignition
he has it running in seconds
he throws it in gear and roars off
templar blasts through traffic on the honda
hes on a street parallel to jillians
at an intersection templar looks to his right where he can see one block over on the parallel street the police cruiser moving through traffic
templar guns the motorcycle
the engine whines
he races ahead accelerating through the gears
at the next intersection templar throws the cycle into a skidding hair raising turn
hes going round the block to cut off the sedan
the police cruiser moves through the intersection
suddenly templars motorcycle templar less veers into the path of the cruiser
the cruiser hits it head on
the motorcycle rides up the cruisers hood and smashes through the front windshield
the cruiser careens out of control
it fishtails twice and crashes into a streetlight pole
up front the older cop is unconscious hes taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield
in the back ilya is groggy semi conscious
jillian is reeling also theres a gash on her forehead
the back passenger door jerks open
templar lunges inside
ilya raises his gun but hes weak disoriented
templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him
this has all happened so fast
jillian looks at ilya then at templar
and templar yanks jillian out
the intersection is chaos pedestrians running up surrounding the police cruiser vehicles stopping etc
templar virtually dragging jillian plows through the crowd passing a russian army corporal whos just gotten out of his army supply truck
russian let me help
russian pointing back at the police sedan help them
the corporal runs to the smashed cruiser and templar and jillian run to the corporals supply truck
the drivers side door opens
in comes jillian then templar
templar shoves jillian across the front seat and gets in behind the wheel
he floors it
they accelerate into traffic
templar looks at jillian
shes trembling staring catatonically straight ahead
who are you
tell me who you are and what the hell is going on
i was hired to steal your research but you know that by now
you left the critical data off the disk
where is it
she doesnt answer thats a bad cut
he hands her his handkerchief
she swats it away
look youre in big trouble
the guy who hired me will do anything to get your research
once he has it youre a corpse
give me the missing data and ill get you out of here
you can trust me
she stares at him in disbelief
chews the word trust you
she grabs the door handle and yanks it open
templar grabs her arm pulling her back
they wrestle back and forth
damn it dont be stupid
she picks up the corporals steaming cup of coffee sitting in a holder on the console between them and throws it in templars face
templar recoils blinded releasing jillian
he jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes
jillian lunges out before the supply truck fully stops
she hits the pavement running
she hurries off blending into the crowded sidewalk
templar gets out cursing wiping the hot liquid from his eyes
he looks around
runs off in jillians direction abandoning the supply truck
templar running out of breath rounds a corner onto lomonosova avenue in the citys shopping district
its jammed with pedestrians shoppers merchants etc
templar moves through the crowd eyes scanning left and right
theres no sign of jillian
then he sees her
just a glimpse
moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the fontanka the largest and most beautiful of the citys grand canals
templar runs over the fontanka canal bridge
he comes back the other way
he stops in the middle of the bridge exhausted out of breath
below him passing under the bridge all types of water conveyances skiffs barges dinghies etc are navigating the canal
and emerging from underneath the bridge seated in the back of a water taxi
templar races off the bridge
templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal
the water taxi is yards past the bridge
jillian sees him coming
templar closes the gap
now hes running alongside the taxi staring at jillian
and she stares back at him stony expressionless
the canal is wider now and the water taxi accelerates pulling away from the slower skiffs
templar slows to a jog
he stops lungs heaving
the sun is setting to the west
the water taxi speeds off into the setting sun leaving templar with this image of jillian eyes unblinking staring at him with pure unadulterated hatred
night is falling
down the street from tretiaks headquarters a federal express van rolls up to a traffic light
frankie has arrived in st
she sits at the wheel in a federal express uniform
she pulls out a charge of c plastique with a timer
she opens the van door tosses it into a sidewalk trash receptacle
she accelerates through the light now green and takes a left into tretiak s headquarters parking behind a limousine which has just entered
the limousines doors open
several dark suited men get out
one of them is ivan gracha the russian mafia figure shown on the c
a map of st
petersburg and outlying regions is spread out on tretiaks desk
tretiak ilya zubov and ten men are present

tretiak goes immediately to his desk pressing the record button on a v
the surveillance camera in tretiaks office begins taping the meeting
ivan gracha and six bodyguards enter

two guards man the guard station eyeing the bank of six video monitors
frankie enters with a big delivery box
frankie russian delivery
frankie hands guard the box and hands guard a clipboard for his signature
frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow
on tretiaks office monitor we see tretiak with ivan gracha raising a toast
in the screens lower corner are the letters rec
the meeting is being taped
the c in the trash receptacle blows
it blows up two cars and a tree
a monstrously concussive explosion
gracha drops his wine glass it shatters on the floor
gracha and his men unholster their weapons
tretiaks men go for theirs
a tense stand off
what is this tretiak

tretiak goes to his desk stabs an intercom button the guards save one barge out the front door
the remaining guard answers the intercom leaving frankie unattended by the surveillance monitors
her hand moves to the co axial cable behind the video monitors yanking it
she plugs a transmittor into the monitor then replugs the co axial cable into the transmitter
the guard turns to frankie
what was that
templar stands in a shop doorway
he pulls out his homing device
adjusts the screen
the computerized screen now shows the st
petersburg city grid
two pulses a fixed pulse templar and a moving pulse jillian on the other side of town
templar turns his collar up walks off into the night
templar comes down a street in a scummy part of town
a guy in a doorway swigs a vodka bottle looking dangerously at templar
a few prostitutes pass
templar pulls out the homing device
insert the homing device the moving pulse is one block from templar emanating from inside a huge building the nevsky rail station
back to scene templar pockets the homing device and walks across the street to the train station
an enormous facility yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at the north and south ends
templar enters from the north looking around
he walks quickly to the center of the station concourse
station loudspeaker v
next train to moscow boarding on platform
templar approaches platform
passengers are boarding the next train to moscow
against the wall a gang of ten prostitutes are smoking drinking vodka laughing
jillian is with the prostitutes
her backs to templar but its her
same atomic jacket the shoes templar gave her same height same weight
templar isnt the only one whos spotted her
two men in black trenchcoats obviously tretiaks men are converging upon jillian from the other direction
they havent yet seen templar
templar moves off quickly drawing his gun
as tretiaks men move in for the kill
templar falls in behind them whipping the barrel of his gun over one then the other
they fall unconscious
the prostitutes alarmed whirl around and
its not jillian
templar thunderstruck looks at the prostitutes feet
shes wearing jillians shoes and jacket
on her wrist is jillians wristwatch
the train to moscow is pulling out of the station
templar sprints away back toward the station concourse
its all clear now jillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to moscow
automobiles are parked in front of the station
templar picks a b
out come the burglars tools
templars through the door lock in two seconds
he gets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock
templar speeds down the highway moving in and out of traffic
his cellular phone chirps
he unpockets it clicks it on
in the b
through a window we see tretiaks headquarters looming down the street
frankie sits in front of six video monitors like those in tretiaks headquarters they are receiving the video transmissions from tretiaks surveillance cameras
we see exteriors zubovs lab corridors etc
frankie is looking at a monitor of tretiaks office tretiak is pacing talking on the phone
they havent found her and they dont know where she is
shes on a train to moscow
thats bad news
theyre stopping every train leaving the city
call you later frankie
templar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel
veers wildly across three lanes of traffic swerving off the highway down an exit ramp
petersburg city outskirts
rounds a corner onto a two lane road running next to the moscow line train tracks
templar stares ahead through the windshield
templars pov the train tracks a half mile ahead is a street crossing
we see the blinking caboose lights of the train to moscow
its stopped at an intersection in front of two black sedans parked across the tracks
jillian sits alone looking around nervously wondering why the hell the trains stopped
her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead
she wears the prostitutes ratty jacket and shoes
two of tretiaks men enter the first passenger car heads swiveling back and forth checking every passengers face
templar runs up to the rear passenger car
tretiaks men come through the third car
templar comes the other way looking for jillian
through one car and into the next
he sees jillian
this time it is her
on come tretiaks men into another car
theyre one car away now
jillian sits up in her seat she looks through the connecting door into the next car which tretiaks men are entering
she rises to flee running into templar
jillians eyes bulge
shes going to scream
templar clamps her mouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel tracks
templar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside looking down the tracks
we hear a train whistle and rumbling wheels
templar comes back inside
tretiaks men are half way through the next car and approaching fast
were going to jump
jillian terrified wide eyed nods
and they jump
templar and jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks
a train whistle blares
jillian looks up her face contorts with shock at a train bearing down on them at m
jesus its right on top of them
templar grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with feet to go
the train screams past them
tretiaks men enter the car where jillian was
outside the st
petersburg train flashes by blocking any view of templar and jillian on the other side of the tracks
they continue down the aisle into the next car
the train to st
petersburg is gone
jillian stares at templar with hateful eyes
he gets up and yanks her to her feet
pulls her back toward the train to moscow
a german businessman is having a heated conversation on a cellular phone
outside we see tretiaks men walking toward their vehicles
templar and jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman
it has reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy
the train begins moving again
templar and jillian sit regarding each other
you cant get rid of me
like a bad flu
pretty smart selling the clothes and watch
you were going for the u
embassy werent you
present tense please am going
before we discuss the present lets discuss the past
she stares hard malevolently at him

my name is simon templar
i dont have an address because i live in hotels

the german businessman is looking at them
jillian pulls the curtain shut
then she slaps templar hard across the face
you wicked man

slaps him again thief
she draws back to slap him again
he catches her arm
they freeze this way faces inches apart
shes trembling her face a mask of hatred
i hope you rot in hell
he lets go of her
she stands up

as far away from you as i can
templar pulls out his mm pistol
jillian stares at the gun
michael quinn jokes
she glares at him
templar pulls out his cellular phone
be at moscow airport at eight a
fueled and ready to go
templar clicks off the phone and pockets it
then he pockets the gun its barrel pointing at jillian through his jacket
with his free hand he grabs her arm and puts it under his arm clamping it to his body
were going to sit here and not make a scene
id get some rest
templar leans back shutting his eyes
i sleep light
jillian out of the corner of her eye notices something through the curtain
across the aisle the german businessman is folding up his cellular phone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor
he leans back and closes his eyes
the satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle
close enough for jillian to touch
the exquisite astonishing city on the ganges river
a courtyard in the traditional indian style
zubov and two of tretiaks men approach a building
zubov rings the doorbell
the door opens
an indian gentleman peers out
hes about in a madras shirt and nehru jacket
this is dr
vijay singh whose taped lecture we heard in jillians station wagon
who are you and what do you want
my name is vapin zubov
i would like to discuss something with
scowls come back at a decent hour
singh begins to shut the door
zubov puts his hand in the door jamming it
i would like to discuss cold fusion doctor
singhs demeanor changes
pushes open the door
passengers are yawning pulling up their window blinds
sunlight streams in
a porter passes by
thirty minutes to moscow thirty minutes
the porter moves past the german businessman hes asleep and snoring
across the aisle jillians eyes are darting from the german businessman to templar whos looking out the window
i need to use the ladies room
i think you can trust me to
i dont trust anybody
jillian gives templar a disgusted look
she rises and moves into the aisle
tell me something
how much were you paid
its not your business
i think it is
fifteen million dollars but it didnt work out
they pass a porter serving snacks fruits and cheeses from a cart
jillian looks at the cart
does it bother you
what you do
you have no conscience
no sense of morality
its a commonly used and generally understood word
not by me
theyve arrived outside the ladies room
jillian opens the door begins to enter
you are not going in there with me
templar brushes past her leaving the door open
he steps up on the toilet examining the window above
okay how about do unto others as they would do unto you
how about do unto others before they do unto you
templar pulls up the window
it opens only five inches its prevented from rising further by two safety screws drilled through the frame
how about love thy neighbor
the man who said that was crucified by his
satisfied templar steps down and walks back to jillian
she shakes her head laughs mirthlessly
were you raised by wolves
who were your parents lucretia borgia and the marquis de sader the two people in question werent as nice as that
i wouldnt know
i never met them
are you through
its all yours
she gives him a look and shoves past him into the ladies room jillian enters closes the door and locks it
she stands on the toilet and examines the window
sees the safety screws
she steps down
she turns on the sink then kneels and pulls up her pantleg revealing the german businessmans cellular phone stuffed in her sock
she pulls it out
she turns the sink on full blast creating as much noise as she can and punches numbers
international operator please
pause the american embassy in moscow please
jillian waits for the call to connect and cut to jillian exits the ladies room
you really will rot in hell know that
good all my friends will be waiting for me
they move down the aisle passing the serving porter jillians hand dangles over the fruit and cheese cart
she plucks up a serving knife with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve
i thought you trusted no one
give it to me
the knife you just took
pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over
when she turns back toward her berth she doesnt like what she sees the german businessman has woken up
hes yawning opening up a stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a jillian continues down the aisle sweating it out
if the guy discovers that his phone is missing
each step is a mile
finally jillian and templar come to their berth
the german businessman is reading a letter
the letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters
jillian accidentally knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the armrest
they fall to the floor next to the german businessmans satchel briefcase
jillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the letters
im so sorry
as jillian rises and hands the german businessman his letters we see that the cellular phone is back in the german businessmans satchel briefcase
templar and jillian sit down
the train pulls into the station
the porter comes down the aisle calling out moscow station moscow station
templar and jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits
as they pass the ladies room give me a second will you
i dont feel well
make it quick
jillian goes in the bathroom
jillian enters and stands on the toilet
out comes the german businessmans letter opener
she centers the opener in one of the screw heads leans into it and twists
she begins unscrewing it
templar is impatiently looking at the ladies room door
the passengers are filing past him
he knocks on the door
jillians got one screw out
the other is coming
templar knocks again
just a second
templar knocks again louder
no response inside
the german businessman passes by him
porter i seem to have lost my letter opener
templar stares at the guy
the door smashes open splintering the lock
templar bursts in
something instantly gets his attention
the fully opened window
and no jillian
templar bolts out
jillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse
a stupendous vaulted interior
as impressive as grand central in new york or victoria in london
she moves through the crowd
eyes scanning everything and nothing
she bumps into a commuter who scowls
jillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars
she pulls her collar up
waits it out
across the concourse a man studies her
hes tall blonde looks like he played linebacker for ohio state
she eyes him
everyone is a potential enemy
but this guy is obviously american
the blonde man opens his wallet flipping out his embassy badge and c
john whitehead special agent central intelligence agency
was your trip all right
yes it was fine oh who cares im finally safe
squeezes his hand do you have a car
first id like to ask you some questions
that was an interesting story you told the embassy
please understand the united states embassy receives fifty calls a day
my husbands been murdered my daughters been sold into white slavery you get the idea
so before we waste a lot of peoples time ms
thomas you say you have p
s in chemistry and nuclear physics
whats the atomic symbol for say
jillian stares at whitehead
youve gotta be kidding me
templar dashes across the platform looking everywhere
jillian has vanished
suddenly his cellular phone chirps
he unpockets it and clicks it on
talk to me frankie
frankie red eyed and drinking coffee is staring at the video transmission from tretiaks office
tretiak and ilya are talking
intercut between the two as deemed necessary she called the u
embassy a half hour ago
considers this does tretiak know
simon the u
embassy has more leaks than a polish submarine
who do you think intercepted the call
as frankie says that she doubletakes at the monitor showing tretiaks office
frankies eyes widen
on the video monitor a third man has entered the room
it is the crusading reformer michael romanov
frankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors
it begins taping the transmission from tretiaks office
frankie turns some dials bringing into zoom focus tretiak and romanov
she ups the volume
we hear this hail michael romanov czar of the fatherland
how will that sound to the average russian
a whisper i dont believe it
templar runs up the escalator plowing through the disembarking passengers taking two stairs at a time
templar comes off the escalator
the place is packed with commuters
he moves off eyes darting in all directions for jillian while meanwhile cd thats big c little d cadmiums valence is its atomic number is and its atomic weight is
or would you like that carried out five more decimal places
smiles good enough
come this way ms
he ushers her off
as they move from behind the pillar yards away across the concourse templar sees jillian and whitehead
he looks around thinking
he sprints for the side exit
the circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis buses automobiles
jillian and whitehead exit the station
ahead two mercedes sedans are waiting
several darksuited men stand next to an open back door
shakes her head what a nightmare
to think my work could just be taken from me
youre safe now doctor st
well have you back in new york in no time
they continue toward the parked mercedes
suddenly jillian blinks
she sees something
its templar driving a russian sedan
he rolls to a stop across the circular drive staring a hole right through jillian grimly shaking his head at her trying to warn her
whitehead looks at jillian
jillian eyes templar across the drive
jillian looks at the men waiting by the mercedes
she looks at two moscow police officers standing to the side
something doesnt feel right
you had a question
theyre drawing closer to the waiting mercedes
nothing i was just thinking that when my research was stolen i felt like the buffalo bills after they lost four world series
hah hah i bet you did
im a baseball fan too hah hah
jillian looks at him differently
the buffalo bills lost four super bowls whitehead
they continue toward the waiting sedans
jillians eyes dart around
her forehead is sweaty
and she bolts from him taking whitehead by surprise
jillian sprints across the circular drive for templars car whitehead after her
the men by the waiting mercedes converge on jillian from the side
templar throws open the passenger side door for jillian
the men coming from the mercedes open fire on templar blowing in the sedans side window
jillians almost there
she reaches the open sedan and dives inside
she tries to shut the door whitehead gets hold of it
jillian screams at templar
templar floors it
the car squeals away from the curb
whitehead runs alongside trying to get the door open
the car accelerates
whitehead sprints but cant keep up
his feet leave the ground he clings to the doorframe through the blown out window
whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across jillians body at templar
his finger squeezes the trigger as jillian shoves his hand up
bullets blow holes in the roof of the car
jillian hits whitehead hard in the head
whiteheads head snaps back
she hits him again
whitehead falls away from the car
he rolls twenty feet and stops dazed but alive
templar guns the sedan through a red light
cars to the left and right screech to a stop
the sedan flies on
were going to the airport
templar guns the accelerator
the two mercedes pull up to whitehead who staggers to his feet
he gets in the lead mercedes the two cars race off after templar and jillian
templar floors it through another intersection
he looks in his rear view mirror
theres no sign of the two mercedes
whos worse them or you
templar looks down and registers shock in the intersection ahead a blind man with a walking stick is tap tapping across the intersection
jillian cringes expecting the worst
templar throws the steering wheel and the sedan swerves clearing the blind man by two inches skidding wildly through the intersection
templar fights the wheel but hes losing
the skid cant be corrected
the sedan slides sideways hits the curb and flips over spinning like a top across the sidewalk
the mercedes moves through traffic
whitehead and the other men look around
the mercedes rounds a corner
across the intersection is the overturned sedan on the sidewalk surrounded by gawking pedestrians
the mercedes pulls up
whitehead and his men get out
they warily approach the sedan drawing guns
the pedestrians back off getting the hell out of the way
whitehead and his men surround the car
they kneel guns trained inside
templar and jillian are gone
whitehead barks at his men
fifteen block radius
go house to house
whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings
we focus on one of them a russian orthodox church several blocks away under scaffolding and mesh wire in the process of renovation
camera pushes in on the churchs huge onion shaped turret
and were in the turrets interior round with stained glass windows a desk and chair
a trap door leading to the vestibule below bangs open
jillian comes up followed by templar his gun in hand
theyre cut and bruised exhausted
jillian slumps against the wall shivering
templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows
from this elevation he can see the entire city
templars first pov red square a mile across town where a thousand muscovites are listening to a pro michael romanov speech
shifting from red square to the city outskirts we see moscow international airport where remy waits
templars second pov the united states embassy is just a few blocks away we see the american flag flying from the roof stanchion
in the intersections around the embassy tretiaks men stand by their vehicles watching
every point of access to the embassy is sealed
we see whitehead
a mercedes pulls up to him
ilya gets out
the embassys surrounded
is staring at templars computer
the modem is engaging
jillian sits up staring at the screen
jillian reads an electronic message which appears jillians eyes grow wide with terror
templar looks out a third window
templars third pov tretiaks men are going building to building in a fifteen block radius sweep closing in on the church
the airports out
theyre drawing a noose around us
we dont have much time
templar turns away from the window
he sees jillian looking at his computer
he walks over to it and reads the message
jillian gets slowly to her feet watching templar
jillians mouth quivers as templar types lion considering offer
templar looks at jillian
she stares back
a long moment
what are you going to do
i deserve at least that
desperate now ill die
if you take their offer theyll kill me
and if i dont theyll kill me
interesting situation id say
jillian sinks to the chair her voice shaking
its over its all over
youre not human
youre an animal
im a businessman
i perform services for profit
and spare me the lecture
you didnt spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity you did it to get rich
richer than anyone on earth
richer than god
beat ill make you an offer pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties should come to about one months
she slowly looks up at him
i dont hold the patent rights to cold fusion
dont you understand
her voice cracks she begins to softly cry it wasnt about money it wasnt about becoming rich
if you dont own the patent rights who does
a foundation in my name
the royalties were going to go to scientific research curing cancer
christ how can you understand this
she lowers her head weeping openly
camera pushes in on templar staring at her
even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness
here for the first time does it flower in simon templar
but we dont know this
templar betrays nothing
he picks up his homing device and clicks it on
he types in this command moscow
the device beeps the moscow street grid appears
he types a new command subterranean data
moscows subterranean grid appears superimposed over the street grid we see the guts of the city the moscow subway water and gas mains etc
in a corner of the screen is a table of schedules
templar analyzes the information on the screen
he quickly rises goes to jillian pulling off his belt
he pulls her up
she stands limply still weeping no longer resisting
hes bigger and stronger theres no use
templar gathers jillians wrists together and ties them with the belt
he pulls her to the trapdoor and cut to several pedestrians walk by
templar walks jillian quickly to a manhole cover
he kneels and hoists the cover off
he points into the hole
jillian her wrists bound steps down uneasily her feet finding the top rung of a steel ladder
she descends into the manhole
jillian and templar come down the ladder dropping to the steel gridded walkway over the moscow sewer
templar pulls jillian twenty feet down the walkway
at this point in the wall there is a hatch with a compression hatchwheel the turning of which opens the hatch like on a submarine
within the hatch we hear rushing water
thats a municipal water main
in one hour youre going in there
templar pulls out a switchblade
clicks it on
jillian shivering with terror stares at the blade
they shut it down twice a day for five minutes to clean the filters
once at noon once at midnight
noon is in one hour
how do you know all this
part of my job
now ask the logical question
where does it go
under the united states embassy
theres an exit hatch into the embassy courtyard
thats where were going
templar lowers his gun
he lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt
you heard me
a long pause
they stare at each other
then what happens
lets get to the embassy then well talk about it
templar about that night at my house
dont talk about it okay
he turns away from her
she watches him
the michael romanov supporters are marching past the kremlin with placards bearing romanovs face chanting karpov must go
ahead awaiting them are two units of moscow police in riot gear
a police sergeant clicks on a megaphone
on come the romanov supporters
rocks start flying
the romanov supporters push into the line of police
the police push back with shields and truncheons
a melee breaks out
the romanov supporters surge past the police
it is a wild uncontrolled chaotic scene
romanov supporters flood past the embassy gates chased by moscow policemen
fights rage allover the street
a full fledged riot is breaking out
overturned cars are burning
looters run through the streets with stolen goods
we hear the sporadic crackle of small arms fire
marine and army green beret detachment grimfaced and heavily armed stand silent vigil inside the embassys wrought iron gates
colonel william crosby embassy c
exits the embassy and approaches the front gates
a full beer bottle smashes at his feet showering him
ilya and his men stand next to their vehicles silently watching the embassy
the whooshing water in the municipal water main begins to subside
templar looks at this watch
insert templars wristwatch it is exactly noon
right on time
the water subsides to a trickle
templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it
opens the hatch
residual water spills out onto the walkway
templar pulls himself into the water main
he extends his hand to jillian
jillian looks uncertainly inside
right under tretiaks men and up into the embassy compound
you can do this
she grabs templars hand
he pulls her up and inside a four foot diamater pipe
templar pulls out a penlight switches it on and sticks it between his teeth
on hands and kneess templar and jillian move off through the water main
templar and jillian crawl up
templar shines his penlight at the ceiling an exit hatch with hatchwheel is above them
it doesnt seem like weve gone far enough
we havent up theres the street in front of the embassy
looks at his wristwatch come on
weve got two minutes
they crawl off through the water main
templar and jillian crawl toward a second exit hatch
there it is
they reach the exit hatch
they look at it
oh my god
the exit hatch has no hatchwheel
jillian panicked looks down the water main
weve got to go back
checks his watch not enough time
thinks the hatch under the street
what about tretiaks men
better than drowning
they scramble off
we hear whooshing water coming down the pipe
the waters back on
back they go crawling as fast as they can
templar and jillian reach the exit hatch under the street
templar grips the hatchwheel as the water roars through the pipe hitting jillian flush blowing her backward she desperately clings to templars shoulders as he spins the hatchwheel
the water rises mercilessly
theres a foot of air then six inches then just three then none at all and theyre under water
templar desperately turns the hatchwheel spinning it one last time and whooosh the hatch door blows open and smashes against a one foot diameter pipe running along the wall of
the service manhole cracking a fissure in it
pressurized gas blows out of the pipe
templar pulls himself up
he reaches down and pulls jillian up
templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut
jillian looks at the gas spewing from the cracked pipe
she sniffs the air
templar looks at the pipe
a warning is printed in five languages gas dangerous
city gas line
we cant stay here well asphyxiate
templar and jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover
templar pushes up the manhole cover popping his head out looking around
his eyes widen with alarm a police van is rolling straight for his head
he ducks and closes the manhole cover as the van rumbles over it
above the van has stopped
templar pushes up the manhole cover
the van has stopped directly over the manhole
templar slithers out
pulls up jillian
theyre under the van now
the vans rear door opens ten men jump down to the pavement
we see their black boots they are moscow police arriving to arrest the looters
templar and jillian crawl toward the vans rear
templar looks toward the u
its yards away but looks like miles
both of us will never make it
but one of us can
draws his gun give me ten seconds then break for the embassy and dont stop running until youre at the gates
its a hundred yards so move it
what are you going to
thats my business
he stops simon
dont do this
theyll kill you
a long tense pause
the world can do without simon templar
it cant do without you
smiles grimly see you around sometime
he takes a deep breath and logrolls out
above the van templar gets to his feet in the street gun drawn
he races from the van heading in a direction away from the embassy
across the street ilya double takes seeing templar sprinting from the van
ilya whitehead and tretiaks men sprint down the street after templar firing as they run leaving jillian under the van with a clear path to the embassy
she counts it off three
templar dives behind an overturned car and comes up firing on tretiaks men
colonel crosby watches the situation unfold
what the hell is going on
in the street ilya whitehead and the other men close in on templar laying down a withering fusillade of fire
templar returns fire from behind the car
jillian logrolls out from under the van
she sprints for the embassy gates
sees jillian running for the embassy
as he returns fire he exhorts her under his breath
ilya firing on templar sees jillian
he spins running in a new direction
hes going to get jillian before she can reach the embassy
jillian sprinting screams to the embassy marines
open the gate
in the embassy courtyard colonel crosby turns to his second in command a lieutenant jones
lieutenant jones and a marine private push open the embassy gates
colonel crosby watches jillian helplessly
theres nothing he can do
not until she reaches the embassy
on jillian comes legs pumping feet pounding the pavement
ilya is right behind her
she can feel his breath hes so close
behind the overturned car templar dodges bullets corning thick and heavy now and watches in terror as ilya with a desperate reach collars jillian
she shrugs off her jacket leaving ilya with the jacket but no jillian
jillian lunges through the embassy gates
and is instantly surrounded by u
jillian looks up at colonel crosby panting
im an american citizen
you have our full protection maam
looks at ilya back away from the gate
ilyas black eyes stare at colonel crosby
he backs away from the gate
he turns and sees at the overturned car templar out of bullets with his hands raised surrounded by tretiaks men behind the overturned automobile
ilya fuming walks across the street to templar
at the overturned car ilya walks up to templar
with the calm efficiency of a hangman ilya puts his hand on templars shoulder and forces him down down to his knees
he sticks his gun to templars head
hes going to execute templar right there behind the overturned car in the street
in the embassy courtyard jillian watching frantically turns to colonel crosby
thats russian soil out there maam
jillian turns away horrified shielding her eyes
templar russian wait
ilya looks at templar
looks at his men
and ilya laughs
chuckling at first then open mouthed
all of tretiaks men laugh in templars face
ilya takes out a cigarette
hands it to templar
lights it for him
templar russian thank you
and ilya and tretiaks men continue to laugh
they wont be for long
because templar is looking at a grate above the municipal lines below
and tretiaks men are sniffing the air wondering why it smells like rotten eggs
templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as the entire street in front of the u
embassy blows sky high as the gas main ignites
ilya whitehead and the other men are blown off their feet
some are killed
asphalt and dirt rain down followed by water as the municipal water main goes up
ilya and whitehead get to their feet looking around water falling like a monsoon
templar is gone
and the police van is speeding away
templar guns the van through moscow streets
he pulls out his cellular phone
remy stands by his jet smoking a cigar looking impatiently at his watch
his cellular phone beeps
simon where the hell are you
you want me to do what
remy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the lear
templar guns the van straight for a group of tretiaks men conducting the building to building search
they pull two sedans into the intersection blocking it
templar doesnt slow he accelerates and hits the two cars where their bumpers meet blasting through them and races on past the intersection
remys lear jet skirts moscow rooftops just feet off the ground
as the jet clears the kremlin roof we see majestic red square spreading before us
templars police van roars into red square as on the other side of the square remys lear jet touches down
in red square
it taxis to a stop next to lenins tomb
the police van screechs up next to the lear
templar races from the van to the jet dodging bullets fired from tretiaks men firing from sedans entering the square
the lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans lifting off almost scraping the landing gear against their windshields
it wings into the air clearing the top of the ivan memorial by a foot
and heads west
a shot of the city as we super st
petersburg two days later the gates open
a black sedan pulls into the drive and stops
zubov gets out then dr
singh dressed in a conservative indian suit carrying a briefcase
tretiak emerges from the mansion greeting doctor singh
singh enters behind tretiak and zubov
they move to zubovs lab table
singh dons reading glasses
zubov places jillians research before him
singh flips a page then another
he is awed
its like salieri looking at mozarts sheet music
hes searched all his life for something and
another person has found it
beat yes yes
looks up i will give you a list of the things i will need
i request solitude

turns back to jillians document leave me now
tretiak and zubov exchange a look
singh rubs his brow bearing down on the material flipping through the pages which dissolve into pages being flipped but these contain photographs
jillian sits with f
agents rabineau and lonner
rabineau flips the page
simon templars photo stares at jillian
she studies it a moment
shakes her head
be certain ms
she looks again

its not him
agents rabineau and lonner exchange a look
jillian walks down the tree lined mall
templar is standing there
she walks up to him
they showed me photographs of criminals

i said that the man in the photograph doesnt have the eyes of a criminal
pause they stare at each other the washington symposium is tomorrow afternoon

jillian draws closer
their lips are almost touching
the benefits of warm fusion
templar pulls her lips to his and cut to
there follows a love scene
afterward in each others arms it is in the eyes
youre not bad
being bad is the only thing ive ever been good at
you can be good at being good
she strokes his hair if youre afraid of the dark remember the night rainbow
if tomorrow morning the sky falls have clouds for breakfast
if the birds forget their songs listen to the wind
and if between right and wrong do what is right
who said that
smiles privately my grandmother
templar gently takes her face in his hands
whispers to her
how did i meet you
smiles saint thomas
late at night
singh is working feverishly
the desk is stacked with papers and books
he is surrounded by three chalk boards with chemical isotope diagrams
he is adding chemicals to a bath of hydrogen in a compression chamber
sodium bicarbon nitrate
a cobalt magnesium isotope
liquify the cobalt at degrees fahrenheit add the magnesium
the chemicals begin to mix
he picks up an electrode needle attached to a lightbulb
singh takes a deep breath
he introduces the electrode needle into the compression chamber through a rubber valve
and like a miracle the lightbulb illuminates
singh looks up as if hes just seen shiva
it actually works
the capital on a cold drizzly autumn day
photographers are taking jillians picture as she moves through a crowd outside the smithsonian
she is formally dressed
agents walk with her
it is raining
the place is a sea of umbrellas
several reporters trail after her
ben rothstein omni magazine
is it true
have you done it
that question will be answered in ten minutes mr
marilyn jones doctor st
vijay singh has said that your theories are insupportable
smiles sorry but im not interested in doctor singhs opinions on this or anything else
jillian moves up the steps radiant and beautiful it is the pinnacle of her life
she looks across the mall
templar stands there
alone smiling at her
jillian winks at him mouthing the words open it
he pulls a giftwrapped box from his pocket and opens it
inside is a tie pin a stick figure man with a halo over his head
templar sticks it through his tie
picks up the accompanying card
insert the card reads anyone can be a saint simon templar
templar looks back at jillian
he sees something
behind jillian moving toward her through the crowd is a blonde man under an umbrella
it looks like
templar squints for clearer vision
he begins walking toward the smithsonian
he quickens to a jog now hes running
on the smithsonian steps the reporters crush into jillian
please no more questions
across the sea of people templar reaches the blonde man
templar grabs his arm whips him around
whats the idea
its not ilya just a reporter with blonde hair
meanwhile jillian backing up the stairs from the reporters draws closer to a dark haired man seen from behind who lowers an umbrella pushing a button on the handle revealing
a glistening needle point
camera moves over his shoulder revealing
with dyed black hair
jillian keeps backing up the stairs
behind her ilyas needled umbrella strikes her
jillian feels something
like a bee sting
her hand moves to her hip
as ilya moves off through the crowd
templar comes through the crowd to jillian
agents grab him
i know him
the agents release templar
jillian looks at him
templars panting out of breath
what is it

smiles go get a seat
jillian moves up the stairs into the smithsonian
across the mall
ilya is gone melting into the sea of umbrellas
the room is packed with scientists and reporters
jillian mounts a podium in front of the room
in two physicists claimed to have perfected
her eyelids flutter cold nuclear fusion
their results couldnt be duplicated
jillian is perspiring
she has cotton mouth
she picks up her ice water
her hand shakes
templar seated in the back watches her
it is my pleasure to announce that her eyes roll back have
she opens her eyes
and the world is swirling
jillian falls her ice water smashing on the floor
templar runs to her shoving people aside

the next images collide and merge upon one another nuclear physicist jillian st
thomas suffered a cerebral aneurism
death occurred at two fifty one p
it is the ruling of this court that death was due to natural
and foul play was ruled out
in international news the situation in st
the square is filled with thousands of michael romanov supporters
theyre camped out now
news team transmits from the square
the scene is reminiscent of the tiananmen square crisis bernard
the death toll stands at forty eight civilians and at least twenty one armed forces personnel
rumors escalated today that
a limousine pulls through a crowd of romanov supporters outside the heavily guarded gates of the admiralty russias naval headquarters akin to annapolis
general nicolai radischev
we see a photo of radischev has promised michael romanov his support pending the outcome of todays meeting between romanov and president karpov
romanov in the back of the limousine waves to his supporters
they go wild clapping and cheering
the limo continues into the admiralty compound
the limousine rolls through a guarded checkpoint stopping before the admiraltys nuclear situation facility in a more dangerous time this is the place from which russian military leaders would conduct
its an acre sized field of concrete recessed feet into the earth
it looks like a very large very deep swimming pool emptied of water
in the middle is a concave shaped entrance hatch visualize an enormous bowl turned upside down
the two halves of the concave hatch open down the middle each side retracting into the facility
on the concrete floor next to the hatch is a small detection unit
well find about the unit shortly
romanov and four bodyguards exit the limousine
two russian secret servicemen escort romanov to the entrance hatch
they descend down stairs to a large room dominated by an electronic map of the world
rows of computer stations run the length of the room
it looks like a n
the secret servicemen lead romanov across the room to an office relatively comfortable with a computer a television and v
and a small satellite link
victor karpov the popularly elected president of russia rises
karpov is intelligent with a calm professional demeanor
a nuclear bunker mr
you must worry for your safety
i have reason to
they glare at each other
you understand my policy on taping meetings
romanov consents with a wave of his hand
karpov motions to his attache who flips the switch on a video camera mounted in the wall
ill get to the point
your remarks are irresponsible theyve caused civil unrest
unless you appeal to your supporters to stop rioting i will institute martial law
beat tell me what you want
a public debate then new elections
well let the people decide
considers this agreed
they shake hands
romanov rises and exits
a hand reaching for a shotglass
the hand shakes so badly
it has to set the glass down
widen to templar drunk at noon in a wretched little dive on avenue a
his face is drawn and pale
hasnt slept or shaved for days
his fingernails are dirty
two dark suited men enter
one pauses by the entrance the other goes to the bar
he sets a folder on the bartop and slides it to templar
the two men exit
templar opens the folder
inside is a plane ticket
a plane ticket to st
tretiak sits behind his desk
the room is dark
the womans death was unfortunate
to think what we could have done with her formula
but life goes on no
templar sits opposite tretiak staring at him
he is shaved and rested his eyes utterly alert
when romanov gains the presidency russia will be ours
the possibilities are you would agree endless
beat you have talent
i need that talent to break into an impregnable facility
be part of this templar
considers this fifteen million plus the fifteen you owe me
i owe you nothing
you were hired to steal something and you failed
thirty million and i use my own men
twenty million and one of my men goes with you
templar nods in agreement
goes to the door
templar turns you had feelings for the woman didnt you
i dont have feelings tretiak
templar his face hard cold expressionless exits
tretiak watches him
a hotel in the heart of the city
we hear sounds of demonstrations and rioting in the street below
templar sits at a table with harry winston remy samarkand and frankie
architectural plans and photographs of the admiraltys nuclear situation facility are spread amongst room service trays
ilya and the massive zero sit on the couch listening
ilya eyes templar
templar periodically meets ilyas eyes
these exchanged glances are rife with hostility
theyve been at this a while and everyones frustrated
no no no karpovs office is in the nuclear operations room
the entry hatch cant be activated from above only below
its lead lined and reinforced with eight feet of concrete
explosives and drills are out
electronic by pass
understand something simon please this is not a bank
this is the former soviet unions missile command
forced entry is impossible
a long pause
everyone looks at each other
templar examines a photograph of the facility
he fixates on it
he sees something
templar points at the small detection unit next to the nuclear operations entrance hatch
frankie looks at the photograph then picks up a set of blueprints
starts flipping through
that is the facilitys
comes to the relevant page and reads radiation detector
in the event of nuclear fall out it automatically closes the hatch
everyone turns to templar
youre saying the system can think
then it can be lied to
romanov and tretiak stand on one side of the lab
across the lab zubov and dr
singh are huddled over a hydrogen tank just like the one we saw in jillians lab
the tank is surrounded by hundreds of testtubes and beakers containing chemicals
the world will continue to spend half its gross national product on oil
and russia will spend none
within five years we will be the wealthiest nation on earth
and its leaders romanov the most powerful people
the situation in the city has worsened
the romanov supporters outside the admiralty now number several thousand
they carry pro romanov banners and shout down with karpov
in the b
we see more rioting
an overturned truck
a military ambulance careens around the corner and rolls past the romanov supporters up to the admiralty gates
two russian navy m
s open the gates
the ambulance pulls inside
the drivers window rolls down
its harry winston dressed as a russian army harry winston russian two soldiers shot by looters
waves the ambulance through
harry waves back
the ambulance pulls into the admiralty compound going past to the rear to the naval hospital emergency ward
the ambulance pulls up next to the emergency ward
the back door opens
remy dressed as a paramedic gets out
remy and harry haul out two heavily bandaged russian soldiers on stretchers
the stretchers expand into rolling gurneys
harry and remy roll the wounded soldiers inside
harry and remy roll the gurneys through the emergency ward
naval doctors and nurses are scrambling around attending to wounded soldiers
the scene is frenetic
the gurneys roll past the operating rooms through double doors into a room
no one notices
a room stocked with hospital supplies
the wounded soldiers spring off the gurneys
they are templar and ilya
ilya wears the uniform of a naval m
templar wears a bulky lead lined anti radiation suit
templar shoulders his backpack
harry winston stands on a counter pushing up the ceiling tile
templar and ilya climb atop the counter
harry forms a stirrup with his hands and hoists templar then ilya through the hole in the ceiling
templar and ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a wire mesh templar rips off the wire mesh screen
thirty feet below in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility two naval guards are walking their shift
they walk around the corner
weve got sixty seconds
templar crawls out of the ventilation duct his feet finding a windowsill
just three inches to stand on
ilya crawls out his feet finding the same windowsill
the two men are side by side
they begin inching across the sill to a steel runged ladder leading to the concrete floor below
ilyas foot suddenly slips
his arms flail
he tries to keep his balance but fails
templar catches ilyas wrist
a terrifying tableau ilya hanging over the concrete floor below held up only by templar
if templar lets go ilyas dead
they stare at each other
and templar pulls ilya back
ilya gets his footing
catches his breath
nods to templar
they continue to the ladder and descend
the naval guards walk their shift
templar and ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch
templar kneels next to the radiation detector unshouldering his backpack
templars anti radiation suit has a goggled hood which he dons
he then carefully lifts from his backpack a plexiglass rectangular box the size and shape of a shoe box and a high powered cordless boltdriver
the plexiglass box has two compartments one empty the other filled with templar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector
he unpockets four concrete bolts crews and bolts the box tightly to the concrete floor with the cordless boltdriver
the plexiglass box has a steel mount with holes for this purpose
the naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall then turn back toward the nuclear situation facility
templar turns a knob on the plexiglass box the door separating the two compartments within the box opens
inside the smoky gas releases
it wafts into the radiation detectors sensors
templar watches anxiously talking to it
radon isnt plutonium but you dont know that
the detectors emergency light begins blinking
boom you just got nuked
unbolts the box now its two months later and the radiations gone
templar rips the plexiglass box away from the detector releasing the radon gas into the air
a moment passes
the emergency light turns off and open sesame the concrete hatchdoors separate revealing stairs
templar rips off his hood
he and ilya descend
the naval guards are nearing the rear of the admiralty
around the corner is the nuclear situation facility
templar and ilya race down
at the base of the stairs is the hatchdoor open close switch
templar throws the close switch
above the hatch doors start to close
the naval guards come around the corner just as
the concrete hatch doors pull shut
templar and ilya move through the nuclear situation room to president karpovs office
ilya and templar enter
ilya opens the credenza behind karpovs desk revealing rows of videotape cassettes
ilya rifles through the tapes
templar kneels behind the t
he switches the t
s satellite link from receive to transmit and adjusts the satellite frequency
ilya hands templar a video cassette tape
templar throws it in the v
and hits a button
transmits the tape over the satellite link to the satellite dish on the admiraltys roof which sends the transmission into outer space where it bounces off a satellite and returns
to a v
in the hotel suite where frankie hovers over an array of sophisticated editing equipment
tretiak romanov and several of tretiaks men stand to the side
templars transmission plays on a t
its a tape of the karpov romanov meeting tell me what you want
a public debate then new elections
well let the people decide
considers this agreed
frankie hits play on a second v
here we see the tretiak ivan grachameeting taped earlier upon what conditions would you accept a partnership
fifty percent of the drug trade in st
petersburg and moscow
a third of prostitution and gambling
s are connected to a video morphing system not unlike those used by filmmakers
frankie hits some buttons on the morphing machine
on the first v
monitor romanovs image is lifted from the videotape
it simply disappears
templar and ilya waiting
templar looks at his watch
come on frankie
frankie finished hits play
we see an altered version of the karpov romanov meeting
romanov has been morphed out and ivan gracha bas been morphed in
on the screen it now looks like this tell me what you want
fifty percent of the drug trade in st
petersburg and moscow
a third of prostitution and gambling
president karpov shakes grachas hand
frankie turns to tretiak and romanov

romanov clicks on his cellular phone
general radischev please
yes an emergency
frankie alarmed turns to tretiak
whats he doing
templar wont have time to get out of there
tretiak nods to zero who opens the door into the hall
two moscow policemen enter
they stride over to frankie yank her up and handcuff her dragging her off
the naval guard in the garrison looks up with wide startled eyes at three russian tanks rumble up to the admiralty followed by a detachment of russian army special forces
under his breath mother of god
the tanks smash through the gate rolling into the admiralty compound
the special forces men walk silently past the startled naval guard who rushes inside and hits a klaxon horn
harry and remy startled by the klaxon look out the storage room window at
come on simon move it
the tanks roll into the admiralty compound a message blares from one of the tanks loudspeaker tank loudspeaker v
this is a matter of national security
i repeat this is matter of national
the tanks roll up to the nuclear situation facility
the special forces men walk up to the open hatch
templar looks at his watch
hes waiting for frankie to send back the morphed tape
come on frankie
suddenly the transmission starts coming across the satellite link recording over the old tape
its almost finished
the special forces men come down the stairs and across the room toward karpovs office
templar yanks the morphed tape from the v
r and goes back to karpovs credenza
he kneels by the drawer
something fast and unexpected happens like slight of hand
templar pulls a second tape from inside his suit and puts it back in the drawer sliding the morphed tape under the credenza
he stands turns and freezes
ilya remember he is dressed as a naval m
has his gun leveled on templar
ilya steps past templar
lifts the tape from the drawer the tape from templars waistband
the door bursts open
the special forces men pile inside
the special forces major regards the situation
i found him over there
holds up the tape with this
give it to me
turns to his men arrest president karpov
four special forces men race out
president karpov and his wife are sleeping
the door blasts open throwing a beam of light on karpov who sits up staring with a confused expression at the special forces men glaring back at him
but revolution is in the air
thousands of st
petersburgers are pouring into the square
it is an anxious surreal scene
russian tanks and armoured vehicles surround the square
the crowd explodes with thunderous cheers as michael romanov escorted by soldiers comes through the crowd
general nicolai radischev tall stern career army man follows with a contingent of junior officers
behind radischev are templar frankie and president karpov under arrest escorted by special forces men
romanov climbs atop a tank turret
he looks out over the crowd
the crowd comes to a hush
like lenins arrival at finland station
a history in the making atmosphere
friends countrymen i give you major antonin scarpinin
major scarpinin the special forces major climbs atop the tank turret
twenty minutes ago a team of russian special forces acting on confidential information raided president karpovs office
across the square tretiak and his men emerge from several limousines
as tretiak moves through the crowd ivan gracha and twenty of his men approach
thank you for coming ivan it is a great night for russia
i dont give a damn whos president
ill make my money either way
maybe you should take greater interest in politics ivan gracha
tretiak and gracha turn to major scarpinin listening
on the tank turret templar and frankie are shoved by soldiers up next to scarpinin
templar and frankie exchange a steely glance
on the other side of the square remy and harry come through the crowd
seeing templar and frankie atop the tank they stop in their tracks and watch
this man a known international thief aided by this woman a german operative were arrested stealing a surveillance videotape from president karpovs office
scarpinin shows the seized tape to the crowd then hands it to romanov who climbs atop the tank
templar and frankie are pulled down from the turret and led away to two army trucks in the background
one month ago i said i would prove that those who call themselves our leaders
points at karpov are in league with those who we know to be thieves traitors rapists of our once great country
do you want to see this proof
out for blood romanov hands the tape to major scarpinnin who walks it over to an army communications technician standing by a portable v
linked to the huge screen seen in romanovs earlier speech above romanov
on the tank turret romanov points at the huge screen
the crowd waits breathlessly
on the screen the tape begins playing but we dont see karpovs office
shockingly we see
simon templar stashed the tape frankie recorded of the tretiak romanov meeting in karpovs office
we see hail michael romanov czar of the fatherland
how will that sound to the average russian
the average russian is a fool
in the crowd there is confusion incredulity
romanovs eyes widen
tretiak and men stare in disbelief at the screen
ivan gracha and his men slowly back away from tretiak
he exists to be dominated
to partnership in government
no romanov to partnership in crime
michael romanov looks down at the crowd and
russians stare back at him in silence
that it is a fraud
turns to general radischev i can explain
motions to major scarpinin arrest him
scarpinin and his special forces men close in on michael romanov the crusading reformer
across the square tretiak and his men huddled in a protective circle stare into the angry faces of half a million russian citizens
a pin could drop
tretiak and his men brandish their weapons
the intimidated crowd backs off
they move quickly toward their vehicles the crowd parting for them
a detachment of russian marines comes through the crowd
they are heavily armed and ready for business
tretiak aims and fires
a marine goes down
civilians scream and dive away
pandemonium breaks out
tretiaks men open fire
the marines return fire
a harrowing amount of ammunition is expended in seconds
ten of tretiaks men and many marines take hits
zero dies instantly
a brutal close quarters firefight
the outnumbered marines take the worst of it
tretiak ilya and tretiaks surviving men run past the fallen marines to their vehicles
they pile into the first two cars and squeal away heading down the nevsky prospect
panic and pandemonium
soldiers running here and there amidst panicked civilians
a special forces sergeant stands guard outside one of the trucks
a naval paramedic supporting a wounded paramedic staggers up
harry winston and remy of course
harry winston russian sergeant give me a hand
the sergeant gives harry a hand
remy stands up whips the barrel of his gun across the sergeants head who collapses onto harry
harry drags him off and remy pulls the pin on the trucks doorlock
the door swings open
templar hops down
remy and harry hurry off to the other army truck
templar gets in the truck sliding behind the wheel
he starts the ignition and throws it in drive
the truck rumbles forward hopping the curb
the army truck roars out of the square pursuing tretiaks vehicles down the nevsky prospect as behind him the tanks and armoured vehicles also roar out of the square followed
by russian marines special forces and the enraged crowd
they too head down the nevsky prospect for the mafia headquarters
tretiaks vehicles wheel into the circular drive
no guards are present
tretiak and men exit the vehicles and race inside tretiak and his men hurry in
no guards here either
tretiaks on his cellular phone
get the plane running well be there in five minutes
to his men clean out the safe
burn the records in my office
tretiak and ilya go quickly to the basement stairs
tretiaks men go for the upstairs staircase
shows a newscast from the ploschad
singh and zubov having seen everything that just transpired are frantically destroying their data and records
zubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket
singh is deleting the computer files
tretiak and ilya come down the stairs
zubov pops a disk from the computer
we reduced the fusion formula to one disk and destroyed everything else
and tretiak draws his gun
as does ilya
zubov and dr
singh stare at the guns
what are you
tretiak shoots zubov
ilya shoots dr
the two scientists fall dead
so much for honor among thieves
then tretiak wheels on ilya his gun coming up
yes so much for honor among thieves
tretiak freezes startled
because ilya has his gun leveled on tretiak
tretiak tries to speak
words wont form
tretiak pitches over backward
ilya walks past tretiaks corpse yanks the computer disk from zubovs lifeless hand and turns templar stands across the lab gun in hand
ilyas eyes dart around the room
we can share this templar
we dont own it
eyes glinting the jillian st
there is a sudden shrill whistling sound
templar and ilya look around
dont be a fool
im a fool
you thought you could get away with murder
used curare didnt you
induces blood clotting
templar clicks back the hammer
what do you want
the whistling is louder
anyone with military service knows the sound of incoming ordnance
what do i want
now give me the disk
theres a massive explosion above
the laboratory is rocked
a shelf of chemicals teeters over falling on templar knocking the gun from his hand
the beakers of chemicals smash all around templar ilya sprints for the stairs
templar grabs for his gun lying in a puddle of carbolic acid
he grabs the gun the acid burns his flesh
he drops it and races for the stairs
ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door
templar comes up sprints after ilya
ilya with templar hotly behind gets to the front door flings it open and
and ilya and templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of a russian tank
just sitting there in the mansion courtyard
russian soldiers behind it
ilya and templar duck
the tank fires
the missile projectile explodes from the tanks barrel flies through the mansions front door over ilya and templars heads
wings across the interior of the mansion
and slams into the rear wall of the mansion exploding blowing the wall down revealing another tank at the mansions rear lumbering toward it
ilya slams the door shut and whirls on templar
they trade blows
ilya has the better of this
he shoves templar aside and races back through the foyer
templar recovers and races after ilya tackling him in the middle of the floor
they roll on the floor trading vicious blow after vicious blow when a tank shell rips into the mansions domed cupola
templar and ilya look up in horror as the foot diameter crystal chandelier descends
templar and ilya dive away
the chandelier crashes spectacularly in the middle of the foyer exploding like a glass grenade
a huge piece of crystal hits templar in the side of the head opening a gash dazing him
theres no place to go
ilya races for the staircase
templar recovers and takes up the chase again
up the staircase they go
a second tank missle slams into the dome imploding it
chunks of stone and masonry fall on ilya and templar knocking them both backward
the lab is rocked by the explosions
racks of chemicals in beakers fall to the floor smashing
the chemicals begin to ooze together
a chemical reaction is occurring
the mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke
tretiaks men are at the windows with automatic weapons firing on the army below
two men drag a crate into the office
they open it revealing an anti tank grenade launcher
they pull it from the crate and set up the tri pod
continue up the staircase
ilya reaches the mezzanine
he climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome
he pulls himself up
templar repeats ilyas actions climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater
as he pulls himself up
he compresses his foot against templars knuckles
theres no way out this time
theres a burst of orange light as a tank shell explodes on the roof knocking ilya off his feet allowing templar to pull himself up to the roof
the tanks continue firing
russian marines fire round after round into the mansion
tretiaks men inside return the fire
harry remy and frankie run up looking with alarm at the vicious firefight
realizing templar is within
the anti tank grenade launcher is operational
one of tretiaks men loads the other fires and an anti tank shell launches from the window and hits the tank in the courtyard blowing its turret off
tretiaks men fire assault rifles from the windows
no ones surrendering
its a fight to the death
templar and ilya on the mansions roof
the view is mind boggling the nighttime st
petersburg skyline looming in the background and below three russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion
across the exploding crumbling rooftop ilya and templar go
a tank shell explodes in front of ilya
ilya falls concussed by the shell
templar dives upon him wrenching the computer disk from ilyas pocket
ilya slams his forearm into templars head
the disk flies from templars hand scuttles across the roof shingles falling through a crater
it flutters to the mansion floor feet down
they get to their feet circling each other
their footing is not trustworthy like ice in spring
tank shells slam into the mansions upper architecture and roof
a shell hits the mansions east wall detaching the drain pipe running up it
ilya draws a switchblade
backing templar up
templars at the very edge of the building
theres no place to go
templars feet are unsteady
because the cornice of the building is crumbling beneath him
and templar falls
he looks over his shoulder his wrists turning hands opening and
templar catches the detached drainpipe
the drainpipe sags under templars weight bending
and it stops
templar hangs there bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and the adjacent building fifty feet below
ilya turns back
hes going after the disk
ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the staircase
while in the basement
another whole shelf of chemicals falls smashing
the chemicals continue to mix
templar dangles from the drainpipe
it gives again
the drainpipe is about to break
templar looks down into the flames and demolition below
tretiaks mansion staircase foyer night ilya races reaches the foyer
the building is imploding chunks of stone falling all around him
ilyas eyes are wild
he wants that disk
ilya gets to it
its finally in his hands
he goes for the staircase
the chemicals are steaming now in a froth becoming more and more and more volatile
templar dangling from the drainpipe looks wildly around for an escape
if he could just get to that adjacent building
its too far
and his hands are slipping
then from the mansions basement the very guts of the building the chemicals in the lab detonate and ilyas eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him
ilya falls engulfed in flame still clutching the cold fusion disk
the drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall
it falls away from the mansion with templar still holding on
templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of the adjacent building
templar pulls himself up and looks back at
the entire building comes apart at the seams
it crashes into a heap of rubble
the skyline of the great city as we super new york city one month later its mid day
people coming and going
camera pans past the office door stenciled rockefeller foundation charitable donations to a huge desk
two middle aged ladies are going through a four foot stack of mailed donations
they are lucy and delores
heres one from that guy who owns most of brooklyn
ten bucks again
ill alert the media
guys richer than god
reads a check hey mr
anderson at the met gave a thousand this year
but lucys not listening
shes staring at a check
her eyes are like hubcaps
oh my goodness gracious
looks at delores get mr
what is it
a check for fifty
gulps million dollars
delores gets up goes to lucy whos hyperventilating
lucy hands her the check
delores starts hyperventilating
lucy reads the letter its from a jillian st
thomas foundation for the benefit of scientific research
never heard of it
lucy hands delores the letter
insert the letter is printed under a letterhead with a logo design the stick figure man with halo the same design as the tiepin jillian gave templar
delores looks at lucy
lucy looks back
and over this we hear a voice
weve heard it before
if youre afraid of the dark remember the night rainbow
a lone man stands on the bridge
the spires of manhattan rise above him
the sun is setting
if tomorrow morning the sky falls have clouds for breakfast
if the birds forget their songs listen to the wind
camera closes in on the hard defiant face of a man who has changed a great deal in these months
and if between right and wrong
and simon templar joins jillian here speaking with her soul
do what is right
and simon whispers to himself
i will do what is right
pulling back we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework
and we cant be certain it is vague but the rays filtering through the bridgework seem to cast a halo over templars head
he is now the saint
to be continued
