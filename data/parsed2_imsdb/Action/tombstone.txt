href b b an original screenplay by kevin jarre fourth draft march roll prologue over main title a collage of old photos prints etc
and silent live action vignettes all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly remembered dream
the first images show the opulence of the gilded age the epic vistas of the west cattle drives and cowtowns with all their violence
the economic explosion following the civil war created an unprecedented nation wide market for beef
previously worthless cattle running wild throughout texas were gathered into herds and driven north to the railheads in kansas
fortunes were made as cowtowns sprang up on the prairies wide open centers of commerce and vice their streets choked with heavily armed young men fresh from the cattle drives
in those days the correct term for a cowhand was drover
cowboy like cowpoke was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used
but these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street
in fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern new york or los angeles and there was no law but that of the gun
a dashing figure in a prince albert coat appears long locks tumbling down his shoulders twin navy colts thrust into a red sash at his waist a tin star on
next we see him in action downing barroom opponents at once pistols flashing around the room like a strobe light straight up at yards or eye to eye at point
blank range the greatest gunman of all time was an illinois abolitionist farm boy named james butler hickok better known as wild bill the prince of pistoleers
but wild bill worked his trade on the side of justice and as marshal of cowtowns like hays city and abilene he became a legend the one man who stood
between law and chaos
now hickock sits facing us playing poker as a shabby looking figure with a gun steals up behind him and fires
wild bills fame spread nation wide but his end came quietly in the spring of when a strange cross eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his
head apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a celebrity
now a group of cowhands carouse a streetcorner raising hell as mustachiod young lawmen walk up trying to quiet them down
in dodge city meanwhile wyatt earp and bat masterson were becoming known as fast guns
but their fame had nothing to do with shooting
seeing its hopeless the lawmen whip out their pistols and start clubbing the drovers making them stagger and grimace holding their heads
earp and masterson operated more like modern policemen using teamwork and persuasion to keep order
still sometimes things got out of hand
an armed drover creeps up behind the lawmen about to fire
but wyatt had a guardian angel
a reed thin figure with a sawed off shotgun steps from the shadows behind the drover and fires
the huge blast whites out the screen for an instant making the drover seem to disappear
the lawmen spin around
the thin man breaks the shotgun open then calmly holds out his wrists to be cuffed
earp looks at him in shock mouthing the word thanks
john henry doc holliday was the son of an aristocratic highly cultured southern family
trained in philadelphia he had embarked on a career as a society dentist when he contracted tuberculosis
advised to practice in the west where it was thought the climate and clean air would prolong his life doc soon realized it was all only a matter of time
and gave up dentistry to become a professional gambler and gunman
the scene shifts to an elegant victorian home a stern jewish patriarch orders his darkly beautiful daughter upstairs as her weeping mother looks on
the girl huffs up the stairs followed by her little white dog
next the girl and dog are seen escaping through a window to the street below and a waiting cab
others headed east
bent on becoming an actress
josephine marcus defied her wealthy and very proper san francisco jewish family to run away with a traveling theatrical company braving the perils of the frontier on her own
dangerous as this might seem it was another age and women were so rare their presence so cherished that they could travel virtually anywhere in the west in perfect safety
now we see horsemen silhouetted against the night sky a hand knocking on a door figures conferring in darkness then more riders moving west in restless haste toward the rising
at about this time the texas rangers having eliminated the commanche threat turned their attention to the outlaw gangs marauding along the rio grande cleaning up the border strip in
years of hard riding
those they could not indict or convict the rangers put down in their black book letting it be known that they could either leave texas or face summary execution
this resulted in the mass migration of the absolute dregs of the texas underworld to the most dangerous uncivilized part of the entire country the southeast corner of the arizona
a jagged moonlit landscape a lone prospector and his burro moving along a ridge a pick digging into a rocky ledge an ore car emerging from a mine shaft finally
a hilltop cluster of tents becoming the skeletal wood frame beginnings of a town
harsh and inhospitable savaged in turn by the apache and mexican bandits this had always been an accursed place a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself
could never prosper much v
then in a prospector named ed schiefflin set off alone into the dragoon mountains
friends told him he was crazy that the only thing hed find in this godforsaken place would be his tombstone
instead he found silver lots of it and overnight the town of tombstone sprang up
mining taking out millions in ore
land value shot sky high and speculators and gamblers and opportunists of all nations scrambled in by the thousands to make tombstone queen of the boomtowns so rich that the
latest paris fashions hard to find even in the biggest cities were sold there by the wagonload from the makeshift storefronts
an engraving of a stagecoach holdup herds of cattle moving north a newspaper story of a massacre in mexico congressmen railing at each other shaking their fists
meanwhile the exile texans had banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang
seizing controp of the surrounding countryside they robbed stagecoaches at will while the big absentee business interests employed them as tax collectors and strongarm men
but the backbone of their trade remained border rustling periodic raids into mexico to steal cattle while engaging in what was described as a virtual orgy of murder and violence
the raids became so frequent and so bloody that the mexican government formally protested to u
president chester a
arthur prompting heated debate in congress
general sherman declared that the only possible way of bringing order was to send in the army but in the wake of civil war reconstruction federal intervention in civilian affairs
was politically impossible
pounding hooves flowing manes a pack of night riding horsemen kicking hell for leather across the desert moonscape
with only some members the gang was an elite body of gunmen known by the red silk sashes they wore around their waists
fiercely proud of their terrifying reputation and answerable to no one they were a law unto themselves finally emerging as one of the earliest examples in american history of full
scale organized crime
end main title as the screen fades to an ominous black and
they called themselves the cowboys
burning daylight hard reality
a squad of uniformed mexican rurales rides through the sonora desert sabres glinting in the sun
approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard bitten captain signals them to stop leaning down to study a jumble of hoofprints on the ground
he turns to the anxious looking young rurale on his right speaking in spanish via subtitle its them only an hour north
but this is the border
you saw what those animals did at that rancho
you think a border is going to stop me
no im going to see them suffer for what they did
i swear it on my soul
the captain spurs his horse and they ride on at a gallop plunging into the canyon
the full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls of the canyon as the rurales ride through
at the bend the captain halts them
the young one starts to speak but the captain shushes him peering into the darkness
a few beats then turn around
but suddenly gunfire erupts from the shadows all around them blasting them from the saddle each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant freezing each victim in the
moment of his death
then just as abruptly the firing stops leaving only the captain the young rurale and a rd rurale alive
dazed and bloody they struggle to their feet as armed figures emerge from the shadows walking into the moonlight toward them
with broad brim hats swept up in front silk scarves and red sashes high boots and silver studded gunleather they look like th century pirates
these are the cowboys old man clanton the ageless white bearded leader curly bill brocius nd in command smiling bull necked ike and billy clanton the old mans sons florentino
a mexican half breed and johnny ringo dark byronic with an air of something very strange
the old man nods to florentino tell em to get on their knees
florentino does so in spanish
the others kneel but the captain remains on his feet steely eyed defiant
he will not kneel
he is proud
so howd you like our little carry on over at that rancho
kinda hit the spot didnt it
hey somebody get that stick on his knees
curly bill casually fires his shotgun into the captains legs dropping him into a splayed lotus position
curly bill knods
they call me old man clanton
im what you might call the founder of the feast
now maybe you aint heard but we skylark through your dingy little country just about any time we damn well please and big hat crummy lookin free holes stumblin around

hell ive let stronger stuff run down my leg
so next time we come better step aside

the others rise and dash away but curly bill stops the captain hold up jefe
got a joke i wanna tell you
the captain speaks grimly in spanish
he say he know you killing him
now howd he figure that out
he say he is no afraid someone will revenge for him
a sick horse
a sick horse

scattered chuckles from the others but we notice ringo frown and draw his pistol as the captain repeats the words
something i dont know he talk fancy you know like a priest
is like a sick horse who sits thats not what he said you ignorant wretch
your spanish is worse than your english
come on lets get it over with
ringo takes aim
the captain sneers suddenly in english you go to hell
gunshots as the cowboys fire their pistols and shout running their stolen herd out of a draw into a clearing where the mclaury brothers wait frank older edgy and tom
younger easy going
looks like you had a party
oh we had a big time
the old man curly bill and ringo rein up and look out at the sun rising magnificently from the desert floor
the old man stretches his legs in the stirrups taking out a whiskey flask
aint that sweet
thats why i stay out here
thank you god
he raises the flask and drinks
curly bill turns to ringo whatd the messican mean a sick horses gonna get us
didnt make no sense
he was quoting the bible revelations behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him
well now thats a little more like it
a black horse a fabulous thoroughbred stallion rears and neighs on an open flat car where its tethered with near identical geldings
a small boy tries to pet it as a strong featured fair haired man appears quieting the horse
tall and slim in a black frock coat and black flat brim hat he moves with assurance and grace a man in control

wyatt turns back to his horse testily
suddenly boy id know that sour face anywhere
his brothers stand behind him smiling
though virgil is a little older and heavier
morgan a little younger and slimmer theyre otherwise identical to wyatt right down to their style of dress
wyatt breaks into a grin hugging them both his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm
well how do we look

virgils blonde wife allie small fierce and irish steps up with morgans fair cameo lovely young louisa in tow

hugs her laughing allie girl

all exchange greetings and hugs
wyatt positively beams boy i sure been dreamin about this
he turns them toward the stationhouse window arranging them in a group and pointing to their reflection
there look at that
god almighty wyatt smiles shaking his head
morgans starts to speak but dont talk just
they stand silently studying themselves together as a family
wyatt still shaking his head happily drinking it in
finally all right now lets go make our fortune
a large woman wyatts black horses tied to the rear crosses the majestic forbidding arizona desert with its red volcanic rocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so
mysteriously like huge spiny hieroglyphics
a camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with stars
the women virgil and morgan sit by the fire
morgan petting his dog a sweet little foxhound
louisa sits behind him twirling his silky blonde hair turning to mattie dont you love their hair
they all have the same hair
just then wyatt appears on his stallion galloping across the moonlit plain toward them sitting his horse like a centaur
its clear hes a magnificent horseman
virgil smiles look at him go will ya
i tell you thats the real wyatt born in the saddle
oh he can go all right
can he then
rather ride than eat
the women cackle lasciviously
virgil groans at allie try to be a lady will you
wyatt rides up and dismounts unsaddling the horse
give him some good exercise
sure some stud
some string in fact
whatre you gonna do race em
clean up with this boy
louisa turns to mattie fishing in her bag mattie hon did you say you needed some laudanum
i have a bottle right here
just be careful
its full of hop
youre a lifesaver
dont worry i just get headaches sometimes
as wyatt leads the horse away the women get up allie and louisa going to the river with dishes mattie crossing to the wagon
virgil and morgan watch her appreciatively mighty fine
wonder where he found her
same place we found ours probably at the other end of camp mattie climbs into the wagon and lies down
wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head
come up to the fire honey
i think ill just lie down awhile a coyote starts howling from the far darkness
mattie shudders long as i live ill never get used to that sound
theyre just lonely is all
hell i howl myself sometimes
you get lonely
she seems genuinely surprised
wyatt looks genuinely confused
over at the fire morgan hugs and mashes louisa playfully
come up lou

she fights loose
wyatt walks up sits shaking his gold watch
look at that
brand new money ward too
years old and i dont even have a decent watch

hey virge see anything of doc while you were in prescott
hit a streak when we left
him and kate
from the stream uh that woman
i miss doc
i miss that ol rip
i dont neither do i
he makes me laugh
a handsomely appointed saloon
at a corner table the pot is so rich players have folded leaving ed bailey a big sullen tough looking gambler facing gaunt elegant doc holliday
full of southern refinement and languid almost feline grace
doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if hes merely clearing his throat
bailey leans forward seething with impatience i said thats to you holliday
in or out
sly boots must be a peach of a hand
kate horony docs voluptuous hungarian consort enters refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup
she has a faint accent here doc
bless you darling puts arm around her darling
are you mad
youre not wearing a bustle
oh for christs sake
ed bailey you look like youre just ready to burst
well call me a fool but i guess ill just have to call
cover your ears darling
doc covers the bet and shows his hand
bailey pounds the table
god damn son of a
isnt that a daisy
just pick up your money and go
sick of listening to you simper
now ed are we cross
doc leans forward revealing an ivory gun butt under his coat
skinny lunger your guns dont impress me
wasnt for those guns youd be nothin
why ed what an ugly thing to say
does this mean youre not my friend anymore
you know ed if i thought you werent my friend i dont think i could bear it
now a cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well steals over docs face as he takes out his nickel plated
colt lightning and
peacemaker and lays them on the table
there now we can be friends again
but remember ed friendship is trust so please dont hurt me
doc bats his eyelashes
bailey jumps up boiling
a long sweaty moment then bailey lunges
doc spring up grabbing him by the hair and jabbing his fist into baileys armpit
bailey screams and doubles over
doc gives him two more blows so light they hardly seem capable of the effect theyre having
but as he turns to give him another we suddenly see that theres a knife in docs hand
the bartender reaches for the shotgun under the bar
kate pulls a derringer from her muff and puts it to his ear
touch that gun i burn you down
he backs off
kate covers the room
bailey drops to his knees
oh my god
does it hurt
eyes gleaming cruelly doc blows his cigarette smoke into baileys face
bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position
kate gathers up the pot as doc retrieves his guns looking around the room
then both back up to the door
well good evening then
the others look down at the groaning bailey lying in a pool of his own blood
a gambler shakes his head judas
doc and kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the hotel
i calculate thats the end of this town
and lets dont bother about the luggage darling
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started kate points to horses saddled and packed outside the hotel
my sweet clever magyar so thats why youre not wearing a bustle
doc gives kate a peck on the cheek as they mount and ride off
a small cottage at the edge of town
as the earps drive up we see a sobbing woman sitting splay legged in the middle of the street while her husband tries to comfort her
small children stand alongside them watching in stunned silence as cowboys frank stillwell cocky arrogant and pete spence lean dark heave their furniture and belongings out of the cottage into
the street while snarling things like shut up
the earps stop staring at this scene in shock allie looking ready to fight
virgil restrains her stillwell looks up whatre you lookin at
virgil looks at wyatt who shakes his head
they drive on as
unlike the dreary weather beaten western towns in movies tombstone is new and colorful part town part mining camp a wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half finished
stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and shanties all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of the desert and the purple dragoon mountains beyond
we hear the vibrant din of hammers and saws player pianos hurdy gurdys clip clopping horses hooves and pealing laughter as the earps drive up allen street the main drag
lined with saloon after saloon sidewalks bustling with drovers miners chinamen and sullen gun toting hard cases
they pull up in front of the grand hotel and step down
johnny behan handsome well dressed wearing an ornate crescent shaped gold sheriffs badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands newcomers eh

wyatt looks enquiringly at his brothers
hes calling the shots
wyatt shrugs back
finally guess well take all three
a large stable and corral backing up into a vacant lot
wyatts big horses feed in their stalls while wyatt faces the stableboy and easy on the grain i dont want em too fidgety
morgan and virgil enter with fred white the jovial old town marshal

regular slaughter house
high rollers wont go near it
too bad nice place
wyatt nods suddenly very interested as they walk on and
we feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool dark as wyatt enters going up to the ornate mahogany bar
though a large handsome saloon complete with gaming tables it has only a few patrons on hand
the lilly and the rose is on the player piano as bartender milt joyce appears what can i get you
let me have one of those cigars
lights up looks around kinda nice in here

milt joyce owner operator
well excuse me for askin milt but isnt it kinda dead in here
joyce points to the faro table in the corner where johnny tyler an unshaven plug ugly with a big d
carried ostentatiously in a shoulder holster deals to a couple of scruffy looking drifters
you see that bird at the faro table
thats johnny tyler
he barged in here one day said he was takin over the game started slappin customer wavin his gun around scarin off all the high class play
only trade comes in here nows just bummers and drovers just the dregs

tyler looks wyatt over noting he is unarmed
he stands sneering for a man that dont go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless
dont need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you
that a fact
its a fact
well im real scared
damn right youre scared
i can see it in your eyes
wyatt steps forward suddenly eyes cold and hard like a shark
suddenly realizing hes in way over his head
tyler shrinks back reflexively his hand moving toward his gun
the other players scatter
wyatt nods his voice calm and steady go ahead
skin that smoke wagon and see what happens
listen mister im getting tired wyatt abruptly slaps his face making his teeth clack together
im getting tired of your gas
jerk that pistol and go to work
tyler goes pale all pretense of courage gone
wyatt slaps him again
i said throw down boy
tyler stays frozen blood dripping down his chin
you gonna do something or just stand there and bleed
wyatt plucks his gun away handing it to joyce
no i didnt think so
keepsake hang it over the bar
all right youngster
out you go
wyatt takes tyler by the ear dragging him across the room like an unruly child
at the door he gives the ear a twist
and dont come back
wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns to joyce casually see how easy that was
wyatt walks up to his brothers at the corner
well were off and running
just acquired us a quarter interest in the game at the oriental
so to speak
down the block unseen by the earps a wild eyed tyler is advancing on them with a sawed off shotgun
he is within feet when suddenly why johnny tyler you madcap where are you going with that shotgun
tyler spins around to see doc standing in a doorway smiling
i didnt know you were in town
wyatt spots doc and walks up brothers in tow
though they dont so much as shake hands we sense a strong bond between the men
how the hell are you
going into business for ourselves
wyatt just got us a faro game
since when is faro a business
didnt you always say gamblings an honest trade
i said pokers an honest trade
only suckers buck the tiger
the odds are all with the house
depends how you look at it
i mean its not like anybodys holding a gun to their heads
thats what i love about wyatt
he can talk himself into anything
tyler begins to tremble
finally oh sorry johnny i forgot all about you
you can go now
just leave the shotgun
tyler scuttles off as behan approaches affably
sheriff behan doc holliday
forgive me if i dont shake hands
so hows tombstone treating you
but i was thinkin you know what this town really needs is a race track
actually you know thats not a bad idea send a signal were growing up
little ahead of yourselves arent you
this is just a mining camp
see how everyone dresses
awfully toney for a mining camp
no the dies cast were growing be as big as san francisco in a few years
and just as sophisticated
i can hardly wait
as if on cue a bullet whizzes past behans head
more gunfire as a man holding a bloody hand to his throat reels out the door of the nearby crystal palace his gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before
he pitches face first onto the sidewalk dead
immediately more men appear a staggering drunk with a bullet hole in his shoulder and turkey creek jack johnson a leathery plainsman with his gun at the ready
a crowd forms as the drunk raises his pistol bellowing
you son of a bitch
thats right keep comin keep comin
turns to behan very cosmopolitan
i know him
thats creek johnson
suddenly a rd man texas jack vermillion long haired hawk nosed appears pistol at the ready keeping bystanders at bay
spots wyatt wyatt
the drunk now has raised his gun to where its almost level and yeah good
right about there
the drunk drops in a heap
johnson spots wyatt hello wyatt
what was that all about
crawfished a bet called him a liar
i saw the whole thing
turns to behan sheriff may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion
watch your ear creek
doc points to his bloody ear
johnson touches it sees the blood gives a silent start
just then white arrives looking weary facing johnson and vermillion
fraid ill have to have those guns
we were legal
gotta take you before judge spicer
well law and order every time thats us
they hand over their guns while virgil looks at the dead men lying in the street shaking his head what kinda town is this
a stagecoach stops in the street
josephine marcus looks out the window her little white dog under her chin
she and wyatt spot each other instantly both impressed
that must be the theatrical troupe
theres a show tonight at schieffelin hall
hey wyatt you goin to the show
maybe well see you there
turns to white wont we
white leads them off to jail
wyatt and josephine hold each others gaze as the coach drives on
doc smiles well an enchanted moment pony deal and mcmasters watch as the actors exit the coach for the hotel
josephine turns to the pretty st actress interesting little scene
i wonder who that tall man was
typical frontier type
long and lean
and those gray eyes
like a wild hawk
you see quite a few of his type out here
oh i want one
the actors enter going to the desk while josephine looks for a place to sit
a fat well dressed easterner with a newspaper sits nearby ignoring her
seeing this from outside mcmasters instantly barges into the lobby hoists the easterner out of his chair and hurls him bodily out into the street
josephine nods her surprised thanks
mcmasters tips his hat shyly exits as the st actress returns with her key
they exchange looks
a full house pandemonium
curly bill ringo and their cowboy entourage form a block in the center rows while billy brekenridge behans bespectacled slightly effeminate little deputy makes his timid way down the aisle
looking for a seat midst the off fist fight and yelling match
cocky young cowboys billy grounds and zwing hunt call out to him hey sister boy
shut up zwing

curly bill beckons
happy as a lark breakenridge takes the seat next to him
up above the earps sit in a box the women thrilled this is so much fun
we havent been to a show since years

shouting from below lady they better be good
doc enters kate on his arm
the women exchange uneasy nods
kate you know the earps
they sit as white enters with mayor john clum and wife
wyatt this is mayor clum and his wife
your reputation precedes you
i wonder not a prayer

while the orchestra tunes up and the crowds excitement rises white sits next to wyatt pointing out the different cowboys and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we pan
over them well everybodys here except the old man

curly bills the only one he talks to
i mean theyre all rough boys but ringo

the house lights dim
the audience hushes
a spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage professor gillman and his ballet of gravity
out in the audience barnes groans professor gilllman
oh hell i seen him in bisbee
he catches stuff
the curtain goes up
professor gillman a rd rate juggler in white tie tailcoat and black tights steps out and starts tossing indian clubs in the air
the audience starts groaning but the professors rictus like smile never changes
having seen enough frank stillwell stands up and shouts hey profesor
stillwell raises his pistol and fires
an indian club explodes in the professors hand
screams and scattered laughter in the audience
the professor is frozen in utter shock staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out loud they shot me
i dont believe it
a chord of music and the curtain drops like stone
the other acotrs hustle the professor off the stage appalled
the st actress turns to mr
fabian a handsome slightly raffish classical tragedian
my god theyre shooting at us
theyre actually shooting at us
whatll we do
only thing we can do dear be good
in any event at least we wont have to wait for our notices

now this is theater
more music and another card reads selections from the bard of mr
romulus fabian tragedian in excelsis
the curtain rises and fabian steps out a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga
in the audience curly bills mouth drops prettiest man i ever saw fabian throws open his cloak revealing his lithe form in doublet and tights
the whores in the gallery hoot and cheer
how come he aint wearin no pants
points to whores thats how come
ladies and gentlemen the st crispins day speech from henry v
to set the scene england is now at war with france
everything rests upon the battle about to begin
henry the young king of england addresses his men thusly my cousin westmorland
no my fair cousin another gunshot and a bullet spangs into the column next to fabian with a shower of plaster
without missing a beat fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues if we are marked to die we are enow to do our country loss and if
the fewer me the greater the share of honour
in the audience barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively
hes got nerve ill say that
what do you think billy
starry eyed breakenridge answers without thinking oh he wonderful
uh oh looks like somebodys in love
raw laughter from the others
breakenridge sinks in his seat
let him alone
on stage fabian is in full cry giving the local a slice of the ripest ham we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds
his blood with me shall be my brother be he neer so vile
this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now a bed shall think themselves accursd they were no here
and hold their manhood cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispins day
wild applause and cheering
fabian bows with elaborate modesty
thats our kinda stuff
the curtain falls
another card faust or the devils bargain and the orchestra whirls into danse macabre by saint saens the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop all black and red covered
with weird beardsley esque designs and images of death and damnation
a light comes up revealing an ancient white bearded scholar sitting alone with his books
then a hooded satan dances across the stage slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth
in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina
the old man succumbs signing satans contract
the audience watches in rapt attention especially the cowboys hes gonna some up short on that one
know what id do
id take the deal then crawfish and drill that ol devil in the ass
how bout you johnny
what would you do
i already did it
satan makes a flourish
a flash pad explosion transforms the old scholar into a young student
the ballerina flits by
the student offers her gold
they dance swirling about the stage in a mad waltz with satan hovering behind them mirroring their every move like a puppet master
finally having gotten all his gold the ballerina drifts away leaving the young student alone lost in bitterness as he changes back into the old scholar sitting with his books
satan appears over him exultant and triumphant ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord
thunderous cheering and applause
the curtain rises again and the performers come out for bows all except satan
very instructive but who was the devil
suddenly satan bounds out removing the hood
its that woman from the coach
ill be damned
josephine spots wyatts box and smiles
doc raises an eyebrow you may indeed

after the show and theatergoers including the earps stroll homeward arm in arm down allen all looking up at the clear night sky above
at the oriental wyatt stops turning to virgil comin to the oriental virge

another kiss and he heads for the oriental with morgan
mattie walks on after the others fishing through her bag for her bottle of laudanum
the saloon is packed
track along the bar at floor level past a wild array of high button shoes patent leather pumps and stack heeled boots with jingling silver spurs
track again at shoulder level past an equally wild array of slouch hats pork pies derbys and wide brim sombreros
wyatt sits against the wall dealing faro with doc at his side morgan on lookout while a sweaty overdressed high roller makes bets gnashing his teeth and drumming his fingers
n a fever of impatient greed all right im on fire

ringo looks at doc holding his gaze while suddenly whipping out his
everyone but doc flinches
ringo does a dazzling series of twirls and tricks his nickel plated pistol flashing like a blaze of silver fire finally slapping it back into his holster with a flourish
cheers and hoots
doc rolls his eyes hooks a finger through the handle of his silver cup then launches into an exact duplication of ringos routine using a cup instead of a gun
the room bursts into laughter
ringo lets a strange little hint of a smile cross his face then exits with the others
white exhales turns to wyatt see what i mean about it getting spooky
curly bill huh
who was that other idiot
ike clanton old mans eldest son
know he aint got the stuff makes him miserable
yeah and dangerous
sitting up on the bar to see the show josephine turns to behan the man dealing faro
who is he
thats wyatt earp
made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas
a peace officer
impressive man yes very
and very married
oh so thats it
curly bill steps out with ike and ringo
he looks around
i feel like doin somethin
looks up hey chinky
come here a minute
an old chinaman minces by
curly bill dashes after him
doc is at the piano drunk as a lord but playing chopin flawlessly
kate pours him another drink
thats my lovin man

now the high roller comes reeling up loud and gratingly drunk
hey is that old dog tray
sounds like old dog tray

camptown races stephen stinkin foster
i see well this happens to be a nocturne
you know frederic fucking chopin
doc plays on
josephine leaves with behan
morgan sighs now that wounds me
little tin swain walkin off with that black beauty
i mean im a married man and all but still it aint right
wyatt grunts and nods perturbed
outside the others mount up but curly bill stands drugged up in the middle of the street arms out head back eyes closed luxuriating in the moonlight
boy i feel great
full of that hop i got from chinky
i feel just capitol
you boys go ahead
im gonna stick around awhile howl at the moon
the others shrug and ride off
curly bill pulls his pistol spinning it
back inside the oriental its late few patrons remain
a few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as gunshots echo from outside
white goes to the window looks outside curly bill
hes over across the street shootin out the lights
this is great this is just great
just then behan dashes in white as a sheet josephine in tow have you been out in the street
somebodys got to do something
youre the sheriff
its not county business its a town matter
outside curly bill starts taking potshots at a passerbys feet making him dance down the street and scurry for cover
curly bill cackles
inside white turns uneasily to wyatt why dont you just leave it alone
no i gotta do something
i dont suppose youd card none of my business fred
wyatt keeps dealing doc keeps playing
white draws himself up and exits
outside curly bill reloads and keeps shooting
white steps out into the street
we feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we see that his hand is trembling
he crosses the street coming up behind curly bill hey curly
come on now boy
curly bill spins around
whites gun stares him in the face
well howdy fred
back in the bar wyatt puts his cards down looks over at doc
maybe i ought to go out there
you will or you wont
dont look to me
im going to sleep
doc lays his head down on the keys passes out
wyatt frowns for a moment
finally he stands turning to morgan go wake up virgil
turns to joyce hey milt lend me a sidearm will you
joyce hands him a colt from under the bar
outside white covers curly bill trembling harder now
an adrenaline rush in a man whites age is hard to look at he seems so frail so vulnerable
even his voice has a quavering edge to it hand that over
come on now
why sure dad
im only in fun
here she is
with a reassuring smile curly bill holds his pistol out butt first
white reaches for it visibly relieved
but quick as a snakes tongue curly bill spins it around and fires point blank into whites chest blowing him over backward the blast so close it sets his clothes
curly bill turns just as wyatt flashes into frame and slams him over the head with his pistol barrel laying him out in a groaning heap
wyatt glances at white lying semi conscious in the street chest heaving eyelids fluttering making weak little bird like sounds smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest
clum runs up put his clothes out
clum pats the embers out in whites clothes but as wyatt starts to haul curly bill up he suddenly finds himself surrounded by ike billy clanton and six other cowboys
turn loose of him
he just killed a man
he said to turn loose of him
well im not so go home
swear to god mister step aside or well tear you apart
the cowboys tense up ready for action
wyatt holds his ground his hard steady gaze zeroing in on ike you
come here a second
ike steps up full of brass
without warning wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead snapping his head back
wyatt cocks the pistol
the other cowboys hush
wyatts eyes bore into him
you die first get it
the others might get me in a rush but before that im gonna make your head into a canoe
ike stands stock still
billy steps forward undaunted hes bluffin
lets rush him
this is it
the cowboys poise themselves ready to start but and you you simpleton youre next
again a hush
doc stands behind wyatt still drunk but with his
trained on billy
billy sneers hell he cant hit nothin
hes so drunk hes probably seein double
doc pulls out his
training it too on billy i have two guns
one for each of you
billy pauses chastened
suddenly theres another commotion as virgil and morgan bull their way through the crowd from behind with shotguns
all right look out
break it up
go home all of you go home now
this breads the groups will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the cowboys disperse
wyatt lowers his pistol heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still groggy curly bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail
come on you
crack me back of the head like some stinkin bull
hell you aint no fightin man youre just a cop
as the earps and doc step out on the sidewalk we can see the semi conscious curly bill through the front door of the jail laying in one of the
cells holding a bloody kerchief to his head
wyatt closes the door locks it gives clum the keys
hell keep till morning the street is quiet as they start back toward the oriental
virgil and morgan following at a discreet distance smirking keep your eye on that brass ring
dont let anything side track you
i know i need a keeper
meanwhile across the street at the hotel josephine turns to behan
well i guess you can see never a dull moment
maybe you should stay around to see what happens next
you might find a future here
maybe even my destiny
morgans hound sleeps in the corner while virgil and morgan shoot pool
wyatt looking on
but he says did i actually see it happen and i said no when i arrived fredd already been shot
so the judge said cant have a murder without a witness case dismissed
can you beat it
after all that
oh hell who cares none of my business anyways
clum enters frowning and anxious just as morgan sinks a shot
boy i love this game
when were finally set we gotta each have a billiard room in our houses
excuse me wyatt just a moment please i wanted to try and reason with you
we still havent found a marshal and come on mayor he already told you no
what about you
you were a lawman
were all busy
sorry mayor but youre really barkin up the wrong tree
you tell em virge
clum exits shaking his head
they keep playing
after a beat you know i was thinkin maybe we ought to open our own place
thats the real money
build it up milk it for all its worth then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to
live like kings
lets you and me take a walk around town virge see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots
i cant hardly believe it
its working out just like you said wyatt
were lootin this burg six ways through sunday
pretty fun too isnt it
kinda actually yeah
i gotta admit
virgil and wyatt walk down a quiet tree shaded lane on the outskirts of town
suddenly a rubber ball rolls into their path
a small boy plays in the front yard of a nearby cottage
virgil and wyatt approach virgil returning the ball whatre you up to today son
the boy stands stock still staring at the men in silence
cat got your tongue
he turns and walks back to the street without another word
wait a minute virgil
where you goin
virgil keeps going
wyatt starts after him leaving mother and child in confusion as
in tight on a gleaming silver shield town marshal tombstone a
pull back to reveal it pinned to virgils breast
he sits by his parlor hearth with morgan at his side
wyatt sits opposite with his head in his hands
i couldnt help it wyatt
i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face
i mean these peoplere afraid to even walk down the street and im trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture
thats not me thats somebody i dont even know
dont do this to me
its got nothin to do with you wyatt
its nothing to do with me
im your brother for christs sake
god i dont believe this
turns to morgan talk to him will you
or hit him
no answer pauses oh no dont tell me
morgan looks down in sheepish silence
then he pulls back his coat revealing the deputys badge on this vest
like you said wyatt
gotta back your brothers play
just did like i figured you would
listen to me both of you
this is no good
this is trouble we dont need
for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family
do this and you throw it all away
you saw what happened to fred white
come on were not about pickin fights
just gonna keep a little order thats all
like you said just gotta know how to handle em
old fred wasnt up to it
we know that were doin wyatt
all right say youre right say you dont get yourself killed
theres something else
turns to morgan its too late for virge he already rolled his bone
but its not too late for you morg
whatre you talkin about
wyatt exhales wearily then crouches down in front of his baby brother looking deep in his eyes his voice soft plaintive all the years i worked the cowtowns i was
only ever mixed up in one shooting
a man got killed
wasnt my fault just doin my job
i dont even know if it was my bullet that dropped him but
i dont kno its sort of hard to explain
at first i just felt funny you know kind of clammy inside
but when it finally sunk in what id done
believe me boy you dont ever want to feel that way
pauses didnt even make a dent did i
stands exits youre both makin a big mistake
armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks eyes scanning the tracks beneath him
he rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house
he dismounts studying tracks as rancher henry hooker rides up strong noble looking like something from a frederic remington canvas
hooker nods back
this hookers ranch
and im hooker
you seen anything of a man on horseback leading a black stallion
hooker suddenly falls silent looking at the ground nervously
well you mustve seen somethin the trail runs right by your waterhole
no answer oh i see
so it mustve been a cowboy right
really got you people treed dont they
look mister its fine for you boomers to court trouble youre just passin through
us cattlemen gotta live here
best i can dos point you up to the cut
thats their roost
wyatt nods his thanks
hooker looks down ashamed
wyatt stares at him a moment
theres something genuinely troubling about so strong a man living in fear
wyatt rides on shaking his head
a small camp near a clump of trees
pony deal brews coffee while mcmasters leans against a fallen oak log feeding an eager pack of mongrel pups from a block of jerky as wyatt rides up
run for your lives boys
its that great two gun dog catcher from kansas
mcmasters isnt it
listen you seen a black stallion with look i got a rule
i dont talk to lawmen
dog catchers neither
im not a lawman im just a private citizen getting my property back well in that case i saw your horse
billy clanton was takin him up to the cut to show him off
the boysre all up there right now branding
and in a mood
still want your property back mr
wyatt and mcmasters ride along side by side through the hills
so what about you cowboys anyway
if i had to explain it you wouldnt understand
just say were brothers to the bone
yeah but some of the things they say your brothersve done
theres all kinds of horses aint there
same with cowboys
what they dos their affair
i dont preach and i dont judge
i aint no dog catcher
a wide plateau in the mountains dotted with tents water and fee troughs rope corrals etc
cowboys cut out steers while others crouch around fires cooking looking up with naked hostility as wyatt rides up
mcmasters points to the edge of camp where billy clanton is currying wyatts stallion
you seem like a nice fella
like tove know you better
had you lived
wyatt rides on making for billy
ike steps up with indian hawk swilling the giant half breed
they walk alongside wyatt
hey law dog
the hell you doin here
how bout i just drag you off that horse and eat you blood raw
wyatt ignores them riding up to within feet of billy and dismounting
billy looks up supremely confident and unconcerned
whered you get that horse
beauty aint he
i asked where you got him
where do you think
i stole him
more cowboys gather jeering
wyatt steps closer
look i dont want any trouble with you but thats my horse and i mean to have him back
one way or another
come and get him
look kid i know what its like i was a kid too
even stole a horse once
but you cant dont sweet talk him make a move
yeah go ahead mister
make a move
billy steps back poised
ike and swilling do the same
more cowboys move up behind him
the scene seems on the brink of explosion when curly bill suddenly streaks into frame on his buckskin mare majestic and times life size as he pulls back and skids
to a stop in front of wyatt raising a giant roostertail of dust making everyone but wyatt recoil
give him his horse billy
come on curly
dont let him shut up
give him his horse billy
billy reluctantly hands over the leadline
wyatt mounts and rides off with dick nailor in tow curly bill riding alongside
feel bad about ol fred
just cant hold back when im feelin woolly
still feel kinda bad
but now were square
anyway no use for holdin a grudge
i deserved a rap in the head
make you a deal
my brother took over the marshals office in tombstone
got it in his head hes gonna make the place safe for widows and orphans
you and your boys stay out of his way ill make sure he stays out of yours
you know i got to admit you got a lot of bark on you comin up here like this
they were all gonna jump me back there
what ever happened to one against one
aint our way
we go all on one one on all
fight one of us you fight us all
thats the cowboy way
and how come you call yourselves cowboys
cowhands ride for the brand
oh we ride for a brand all right
gives wyatt the finger this brand
how bout you
points thumb at self this brand
were gonna get along just fine
a lazy afternoon
the earps and clum lounge in front of the hotel
i cant thank you enough
since you took over there hasnt been a single problem
were finally becoming a civilized town
nothin to it
maybe i jumped the gun
maybe those cowboys arent near as bad as theyre painted
you know i was thinkin theres a lot of money in the cattle business
wait a minute you thinkin of getting in bed with the cowboys
business is business
dont have to love em to work with em
not if theres money in it
you are the one wyatt
you sure are
old man clanton leads other cowboys with a herd through the rocky canyon slipping a flask and singing as the first shot rings out from the rocks above becoming a
when the dust settles all are dead except the old man who lies pinned under his horse semi conscious
figures emerge from the shadows
its the rurales led by the same young rurale from before
he bends down to the dazed old man speaking carefully the old one you kill
this was my father
sits up suddenly what and im supposed to tremble
kiss my ass messican
hissing gleefully he jams a derringer under the young rurales chin and fires blowing off his sombrero as he falls
the other rurales fire emptying their guns into the old man as if he were some monstrous rattlesnake that might bite them
curly bill ringo and the others are by the fire passing a bottle as frank still well gallops up and dismounts breathless old man clantons dead
ambushed in guadaloupe canyon
messicans got him
in tight on curly bill as the news sinks in
he clenches his fist in rage then bites a knuckle getting his control back
all right first things first its my outfit now im runnin the show
ringos number two man
im next in line
you aint got enough in your britches
think you can prove otherwise go ahead
seething with humiliation ike mounts up and rides off
curly bill turns back to business all right
billy go after ike and cool him off then go find the mclaurys tell em what happened and keep an eye on things
wes fuller and bill claiborne too
rest of you come with me
were goin to mexico
they mount in a bunch and take off south like the wind
wyatt is up on his stallion riding along the foot of a high hill
coming to a cut he suddenly stops
josephine is yards up ahead gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit riding side saddle through the cut on a pretty mare
looking for an escape wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut
he follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of josephine
he groans well hello
weve never actually met
my names wyatt earp i know
i was beginning to think wed never meet
this is fortuitous
that means lucky
i know what it means
suddenly wyatts stallion groans nervously throwing its head aroused by the presence of the mare
what is it
that mares in season
calms her horse now shes starting
how do they know
its the scent
we better split em up
i have a better idea lets run it out of them
before wyatt can stop her shes off at a full gallop
wyatt pauses debating with himself
finally yeah im an oak all right
he takes off at a dead run
catching up the horses find their rhythm breaking into a smooth gallop flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies
so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them
coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice
josephine heads right at it
youre not that crazy are you
oh yes i am
a crack of her crop and she streaks toward it
wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit
the sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together sailing through the air side by side josephine giggling like a little girl
they light on the other side and gallop on
they pull up at a huge desert stone formation a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell
wyatt dismounts helping josephine
he takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide table shaped rock for them to sit on
that was lovely
you know you almost got us both killed back there
fun though wasnt it
youd die for fun
i was sure you never laughed
i laugh sometimes yes but how often
tell me are you happy
am i happy
i dont know
happy as the next man i guess
i dont laugh all day long like an idiot if thats what you mean
youre a little touchy about it
im not touchy i just its a silly question thats all
am i happy
are you happy
of course im always happy
unless im bored
that blonde woman is that your wife
what about her
tell me what do you want out of life
where do you get these questions
i dont know make some money have some kids you know

how would you know
just doesnt thats all
well i ought to know my own mind and im tellin you what suits me is a family and kids
that suits me right down to the ground
in fact thats my idea of heaven
pauses all right whats your idea of heaven
wyatt laughs almost in spite of himself
youre laughing again
but thats what i want
go places and move and never look back and just have fun
thats my idea of heaven
need someone to share it with though
you mean behan
sees her shrug then why are you with him
well hes handsome and hes charming
hes all right
dont say it i know im rotten
i cant help it
ive tried to be good but its too boring
the way you talk
never heard a woman talk like that
oh look i havent got time to be proper i want to live
im a woman i like men
if thats unladylike then i guess im not a lady
at least im honest
well youre different no arguing that
but youre a lady all right
ill take my oath on it
he looks at her enchanted but suddenly his face clouds
i dont know doesnt make any sense
i almost cant look at you
like it hurts
i know me too
what should we do about it
he takes her in his arms and kisses her
she sinks in his arms
he kisses her again then falls to her knees throwing his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds of her skirts
she runs a hand through his hair
he stands lifting her with him until they are face to face and she can feel him pressing into her
after a beat you know this is adultery
you burn in hell for that
then lets make sure we get our moneys worth they loll on the rock facing each other clothes in disarray
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall
and i dont even know your full name
easy to fix
wyatt berry stapp earp
and im josephine sarah marcus
my friends call me josie
no im gonna call you sadie
i hate sadie
well youll always be sadie to me
we better get back
he looks away and stands helping her up
they go to their horses
he lifts her up into her saddle and stands awhile arranging the folds of her skirt
after a beat so i assume were regarding this as just a kind of interlude
look its too much of a tangle
i already cast my lot
i cant go back and i cant sneak feel back enough as it is
you feel bad about this
i didnt mean it that way
you know you dont have to sneak
you could stay with me
i know things wyatt
i could make you so happy
i cant im sorry
he mounts and rides off with a wave
she watches him awhile
a victorian photographers studio behind the o
a large skylight overhead illuminates the backdrop as cammilius s
fly the prosperous looking owner prepares his camera
josephine is o
in the dressing room on the left what mood would you like for this picture miss marcus
any particular occasion youre commemorating
i want to remember exactly how i looked on this day so i want you to take a picture of me
she steps out wearing a diaphonous veil shrouding her from head to toe
though it partially obscures her form we can see that shes completely nude underneath
all of me
fly fumbles with his camera his composure gone
she turns to a nearby mirror studying herself black tresses rounded lips maddening curves and smokey eyes a dark angel
she smiles because im wonderful
mattie lies in bed lost in an opium dream
she snaps out of it and sits up as wyatt enters and gives her a kiss glancing at the half empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand
that the bottle lou gave you
better go easy on that stuff
i know what im doing
where have you been
how you doin
i dont know
im all right
sure im sure
what is this
wyatt sits down on the bed suddenly intent his face alight well i was thinking weve already made a pile of money
maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on
and we could stay on the move you know
just keep going see the world
live on room service the rest of our lives
howd that be
wyatt whatre you talkin about
just thinkin out loud
dark circles under his eyes looking dreadful doc is at the corner table with virgil behan ike clanton and the mclaurys
josephine lounges by the piano luscious in a white gown singing frankie and johnny in a torchy voice
wyatt enters blanching at the sight of josephine
joyce appears at his elbow new singer
aint she somehin
wyatt nods weakly
josephine gives him a half smile
doc wont quit been up hours
clanton came in an hour ago they switched over to poker
tried to get him to bed but he just wont let go
and nobody can make him
they go over to docs table and sit down
doc beams drunkenly wyatt
just in time
pull up a chair

she kisses doc
behan nudges wyatt what dyou think of the singer
thats not what i meant
behan gives him a wink
wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat
this hand is down to doc and ike and the pot is huge
doc shows his hand
ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage son of a bitch
thats twelve straight hands
nobodys that lucky
the earps stiffen as the cheshire cat smile comes over doc why ike whatever do you mean

wyatt jumps in separating them
behan notices as josephine gasps a look of alarm crossing her face
take it easy
ike just go home and forget it will you
i aint forgettin nothin
ike lurches to the bar
behan takes josephine aside whispering i saw that look on your face just now
whats between you and wyatt
well that certainly was a bust
i want my money back
come darling lets seek our entertainment elsewhere
doc stands up taking kates arm to leave
but he falls back down dizzily suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing
whats wrong doc
not a thing
im right as the mail
again he tries to stand
this time he keels over onto the floor and starts coughing up blood
wyatt rushes to him
get a doctor
virgil give me a hand
they lift the unconscious doc off the floor
ike turns to joyce
whats wrong with him
doc sits up in bed revived but looking like death warmed over mouth gaping open eyes swimming with every breath
goodfellow stands by the bed putting on his jacket
your condition is quite advanced
id say youve lost some percent of your lung tissue
so what does that mean
two years two days hard to say
if you have any chance its to stop now smoking drinking gambling night life
you must have a healthy diet and most importantly you must have complete rest meaning you must attempt to deny your marital impulse
well that sounds inviting
sorry but im afraid youve no choice
he takes his bag and exits leaving doc alone with the abyss
kate enters going to his bedside and starts rolling him a cigarette
how you feeling doc
i knew it wasnt nothin
we must talk darling
it appears we have to
redefine the nature of our association
whats that mean doc
you know i dont understand when you talk up high like that
you mean you dont want to be my lovin man no more
im a good woman to you doc
dont i always take care of you
nobody cares for you like me
im a good woman
yes i know
you are a good woman
kate smiles licking the cigarette
she puts it in his mouth and leans over to light it so her ample bosom bulges over her bodice
as doc stares at her chest something behind his eyes seems to shut down
he takes a long drag from the cigarette
then again you may be the antichrist
the cold blue light of dawn peeks through the windows
ike drinks at the bar brooding
he reaches behind the bar for his guns leaning his rifle against the brass rail
bastards think they can cheat me
nobody cheated you ike
ike reaches across the bar and slaps him
joyce scowls more irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it
the few other patrons left look up drowsily
ike nods in drunken satisfaction picking up his rifle and i dont take no mouth from any bartenders neither
give somebody a rap on the beezer get some god damn respect around here
now you tell the earps and doc holliday if i see em on the street im gonna send em all to hell on a shutter
you tell em that
ike and the mclaurys storm off as virgil and morgan step out onto the street
wyatt turns to them in disbelief what the hells going on
walking down allen ike stops the group at the telegraph office i want to send a telegram
we start to feel a growing sense of dread as grim horsemen come galloping out of the desert toward us
billy clanton wes fuller and billy claiborne ride into town trotting by the jail with the earps looking on
billy clanton wes fuller and billy claiborne
now theres six of em
this is like a bad dream
just stay calm use your head
itll be all right
just the same though
pauses sighs guess you better swear me in
in tight on a brass mounted wooden case
it opens to reveal a gleaming colt
with an extra long barrel the gold shield inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with to wyatt earp peacemaker
this is the buntline special wyatt earps legendary sidearm
wyatt takes it from the case and puts it in his coat pocket as mattie looks on
thought you swore youd never carry that thing again
yeah well i swore a lot of things
behan and jospehine watch from the hotel as the cowboys all but ike armed with pistols walk side by side down the middle of allen
im terribly afraid this looks like the end of the earp brothers
josephine goes pale
the cowboys swagger by defiantly giving the earps sidelong glances
meanwhile the street starts to buzz townspeople beginning to notice that something is happening
here they are again
look at em
easy virge theyre just tryin to egg us on
suddenly doc appears from around a corner a little the worse for wear in a long dark inverness cloak and carrying a big gold headed walking stick
whatre you doin out of bed doc
what the hells going on
ive had five people walk up to me saying the clantons and mclaurys are gunning for me
a vacant lot behind the ok corral with flys gallery on the left and the harwood house on the right
the cowboys stand in a knot near their horses passing a bottle around
like to teach those bastards a lesson
probably already scared them to death
you call it ike
whatre we gonna do
grabs bottle gimme that
virgil comes out of the nearby wells fargo office with a huge stevens gauge shotgun just as joyce runs up
those cowboysre tellin everybody in town theyre gonna clean you out
theyre down in that lot right now behind the ok corral
dont worry doc its not your problem
you dont have to mix up in this
doc turns on wyatt genuinely shocked and hurt
thats a hell of a thing for you to say to me
what the hellre we gonna do
wait till the liquor wears off
once they start getting headaches theyll lose interest
wyatt theyre threatening our lives
youll never make that stick
theyre carrying guns in town
virge thats a misdemeanor
you go down there to arrest em something goes wrong maybe this time somebody gets his head broke suddenly its a mess and it wont end there youll have cowboys
comin around lookin for trouble from here to christmas
you gonna risk all that over a misdemeanor
pauses thinking no damn it its wrong theyre breakin the law
pauses all right virge your call
but give doc the shotgun
theyll be less apt to get nervy if they see him on the street howitzer
virgil trades the shotgun for docs cane
doc folds the shotgun under his cloak
they get set waiting for wyatts cue
come on boys
they start down allen footsteps pounding the board sidewalk virgil and wyatt in front morgan and doc in the rear
bystanders step aside trading whispers as they pass turning onto th st
behan dashes around the corner into the lot facing the cowboys
theyre on their way over here
the earps and doc turn off th onto fremont st
creek johnson and texas jack vermillion watch as they pass the grocers
there they go
look kinda like preachers
the vacant lot starts to come into view and the earps are fighting nerves now
fists clenched gritting their teeth eyes darting all over the street they look all too human and nothing like their legend
its only doc bringing up the rear who couldnt care less
wyatt narrows his eyes virge youre makin the arrest
you make contact ill back you up
morganll back me up docll keep an eye out for trouble
and keep your hands on your guns
they even look like theyre gonna start something buffalo em
right over the head
wyatt i know what im doin
sees onlookers look at em all
they love it
how in the helld we get ourselves into this
just then behan walks up holding up his hands reassuring you dont have to worry about a thing
i just went down there and disarmed them
come on boys
the earps quicken their step as behan enters flys gallery
seeing the approaching earp party the cowboys glance around at each other setting themselves
now at the end of the sidealk the earps can see that the cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates
wyatt mutters under his breath oh great
disarmed my ass
the earps slow their step gathering themselves
this is it no turning back now
the cowboys spread out
as the earps get closer and closer it seems as if the very air is electric with tension
but as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach they suddenly do look like their legend tall figures in long black coats advancing in a
line grim and unstoppable a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds
finally they stop
the groups are facing each other perhaps feet apart
doc raises the shotgun the cheshire cat smile spreading over his face
virgil steps forward his face set holding up docs cane weve come to arrest you
throw up your arms
a weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do
then billy clanton and frank mclaury slap their hands to their guns
the earps instantly tense up hands on their pistols
virgil waves his hands frantically afraid theyve misunderstood hold
i dont want that
suddenly realizing whats happening fuller and claiborne bolt and dash into flys gallery
everyone else stands frozen breath short pulses pounding each staring into the others wide open eyes
then something in billy clantons eyes seems to go dead and wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him oh my god
billy and frank jerk their pistols and the scene explodes everything happening in split seconds as wyatt draws and fires knocking frank down with a gutshot
morgan fires blowing billy back against the wall of the harwood house
tom darts for the cover behind his horse as ike dives onto wyatt shrieking like a woman no no please
i dont have a gun
this fights commenced
get to fightin or get away
wyatt hurls him aside
ike sprints for the gallery
tom fires over his saddle at doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse
billly bounces back up howling and fires the bullet piercing virgils calf
he drops to one knee
tom fires again
doc fires one barrel into the air the blast making the horse rear up exposing tom for a split second
doc fires again
toms side explodes into red mist the full charge of red mist the full charge of buckshot slamming him into the harwood house
tom drops his gun and teeters into the street talking eerie little mincing steps already dead but still moving like a chicken with its head cut off
billy fires again dropping morgan with a hole in his shoulder
doc pull his lightning and fires double action times hitting billy in the abdomen while frank bounds back into the fight firing wildly
virgil gets up firing back
the whole scene now bathed in thick smoke the fight starts swirling into the street each man jockeying for position
inside the gallery behan and fuller watch at the window as ike dives in
he snatches fullers pistol and fires through the window
ikes bullets whiz past wyatts ear
he spins around calling to doc behind us
in a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat doc pivots replacing the
in this right hand with his big
then with one pass of his left hand rapid fires quick as a machine gun burst times the bullets ripping through the gallery showering ike and the rest with splinters
and broken glass
behan hauls ike up and they dash out the back door fuller and claiborne right behind all frantically running for their lives
outside billy gets to his knees seemingly indestructible and fires at wyatt wyatt returns fire
eyes wild and bulging a bloody hand clutching his wounds frank staggers across the lot bearing down on doc through the smoke i got you now you son of a
youre a daisy if you do
doc opens his arms giving frank a clear shot at his chest
the bullet grazes docs holster
frank trudges closer about to fire again but doc drills him through the heart while in the next millisecond morgan fires from his prone position on the ground the big
blast carrying away the top of franks head
as the last shot echoes through the hills frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother tom finally runs out of
steam and pitches face first in the dirt leaving only billy leaning against the harwood house legs splayed out in front of him absolutely shot to pieces clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears more cartridges
somebody load my gun
he keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step timidly into the street
fly bends down and takes bills gun from his hand and the fight is officially over having lasted only some seconds
wyatt helps morgan to his feet as behan strides briskly onto the scene addressing wyatt all right
youre all under arrest
wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief
finally i dont think ill let you arrest us today behan
more bystanders arrive a crowd scene rapidly developing
the earp women run up from the west end of fremont
josephine fights her way through the crowd from the east
she and wyatt catch sight of each other
she grins tears in her eyes
he nods smiling
seeing the whole thing behan fumes
and so does mattie who turns and walks away while allie and lou run to their men hugging them
meanwhile doc stands over franks body fingering the graze over his thigh jeering under his breath you call that shooting
comes up to wyatt the mclaurys are both dead
billy clantons just about gone
wyatt nods pocketing his gun sadly surveying the bloody scene
guess we did our good deed for today
fireworks explode in the darkening sky as a cortege of cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward boot hill the crude little grave yard curly bill and ringo
in the lead ike right behind with the coffins and a banner saying murdered on the streets of tombstone
as they take places at the gravesite wyatt approaches curly bill
if there was any other i know
just did what you had to
that banner and stuff thats just ike
dont worry about it
wyatt nods tips his hat walks off
looking after him curly bill whispers dont worry about a thing morgan lies in bed his shoulder in bandages
wyatt sits by him how you doin boy
morgan looks out the window staring at nothing
he looks tired older all the fun and youthful zest gone from his face
you were right
its nothin like i thought
i almost wish
i know kid
wyatt touches his arm a look of unutterable sadness in his eyes
this is the one thing he didnt want for his little brother
the cowboys are gathered around a huge bonfire sparks drifting up toward the heavens faces vivid in the firelight like an ancient warrior host
curly bill faces them bottle in hand heres to the memory of billy clanton and tom and frank mclaury
they went out real cowboys dead game right up to their last kick
they won their places at the big table with davy crockett and wild bill and old man clanton
theyre up there right now tradin shots with em
and theyll never be forgot
hundred years from now therell be men settin around a campfire passin a bottle tellin stories about those boys
theyre what you call immortal
and i say god bless em
they all drink long and deep ringo wiping away tears
then all right first we hang back just bide away till everybody thinks thiss blown over
mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while wyatt finishes shaving in the dressing room wiping foam from his face looking in the cabinet for a towel
opening the bottom drawer a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor
laudanum bottles all empty
mattie looks up as wyatt comes out bottle in hand mattie
what about this
looks up keeps ironing i need it
least you admit it
admit what im an opium fiend
no wyatt i just said i need it
i need something to keep me warm at night
look mattie i know youre you know nothing

oh you smile sometimes ive even seen you laugh
but theres no light in your smile for me wyatt nothing to keep me warm

pauses whats between you and that jew woman
this catches wyatt off guard
he looks at her
then all right look

i can i swear
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me shes nothing to you
right out loud so i can hear
tell her shes nothing tell her shes nobody just dirt
will you do that
wyatt falls silent
mattie stands staring at him a moment then until you can do that weve got nothing to talk about wyatt
now leave me alone
she keeps ironing
wyatt looks as if a building fell on him
behan comes out of nellie cashmans spots josephine going down toughnut
he catches up to her pacing her
she keeps walking
listen i want to talk to you
i dont have time
grabs her i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight
listen to me
youre my woman and im your man
you told wyatt youd disarmed those men
do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man
youre just a dirty little fixer
you filthy whore
a hand reaches into frame spinning behan around
morgan stands there arm in a sling red in his eye you dont talk that way to a female human being
look i dont want to take advantage of an injured man but you better with his good arm morgan slugs behan in the mouth
behan drops like a leaf as much to avoid a further injury as from the blow
morgan turns to josephine leading her away
across the street curly bill and ringo share a flask watching ringo looking even odder than usual
curly bill chuckles so shes wyatts slice now
looks like we got another name for the tally book
the earp brothers stand in front of the oriental
dropped him that was it
sorry if i made a worse mess for you
im the one made a mess
made a right fair mess of the whole thing
wyatt looks down miserable
virgil looks up at the sky getting warmer
guess springs comin
just then morgan sees breakenridge passing by in silence
i say hello deputy
turns to them i dont want to talk to you
those men you killed were my friends
im just a nothing but if i wasnt id fight you id fight you right now
so i dont wanna talk to you
he hurries away eyes tearing up
the earps look on in amazement
all they ever did was make fun of him
sister boy shouldve stuck around
a liquored up ringo stands behind them on the sidewalk like an apparition murder in his eyes hands thrust into the pockets of a long black buffalo coat ivory gunbutts
what dyou want ringo
i want your blood and i want you souls and i want them both right now
dont want any more trouble ringo
steps up to wyatt well you got trouble and it starts with you
im not gonna fight you theres no money in it
come on boys
wyatt turns into the oriental
his brothers follow
ringo howls wretched slugs dont any of you have the guts to play for blood
im your huckleberry
doc stands there smiling that cheshire cat smile
thats just my game
all right lunger
have at it
they face each other eyes blazing about to reach critical mass
you call it
here it come one two at the last possible instant curly bill flashes into frame along with stillwell and spence grabbing ringo from behind while the earps step in front
johnny dont jesus
come on son
turns to earps never mind
they haul ringo up the street out of earshot
ringo is boiling i want them spitting blood
now aint the time
turns to others i tell you boys even im worried whatll happen once ringo runs this outfit
god have mercy
he pulls ringo into a doorway away from the others
tears in his eyes clawing the air ringo is beside himself
theres no god theres no devil i hate the god damn world
i want to die
you just need to get your feet back under you thats all
come on boy lets kick south
down to the old playground
an adobe rancho in the sonora desert small humbly furnished
inside a mexican family children a husband and young wife eat dinner
suddenly curly bill and ringo burst in guns drawn shouting in spanish
everyone freezes and as the children start crying we feel the familys sense of inner terror
curly bill looks the trembling young wife over nodding at ringo see son there is a god after all
nightfall and the wind howls down the street kicking up dust in swirling columns
a flash of lightning streaks down from the purple clouds and a thunderclap crashes in our ears echoing through town into the hills making the horses neigh and fidget
but inside its bright and warm
florentino is alone at the bar nursing a drink while wyatt deals for morgan and a few others
virgil looks out at the storm shaking his head gonna be one of those nights
the cowboys are gathered on a rise
curly bill stands before them silhouetted against the boiling sky arms outstretched exulting in the storms fury
he turns to his men eyes ablaze all right boys
nows the time to get woolly
josephine sits by the window reading swinburne
a knock at the door
she answers it
she bristles but easy
i just wanted to tell you thingsre about to start changing around here
lots of so called hard cases and tough nuts swagger around this town but none of ems got a clue about the real play
none of em
i dont understand
you will after tonight
bet on it
allie and louisa sip tea by a blazing fire in the hearth warming themselves against the storms cold
mattie sits nearby sewing
god its a cold night
come up to the fire mattie
suddenly theres a knock at the door
louisa looks out the window
outside is the tall silhouette of a woman in a dark cloak
it looks like a woman
allie opens the door
josephine enter breathless comes into the parlor
mattie sits up in shock
the others gather round
please i know its awful me coming here but listen i cant say why but i think something is another knock
allie goes to the window
theres a weird sense of deja vu as outside we again see a cloaked womans now who in
its another woman
allie starts to open the door but josephine suddenly leaps up and no
with her dancers quickness she dashes across the parlor grabbing allie and pulling her to the floor just as a tremendous shotgun blast rips through the open doorway
the chandelier overhead explodes showering the screaming women with broken glass and a harsh male voice cuts through the air as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness everybody dies
the sound of the gunshots are lost in the wind and thunder as virgil gets up yawning getting late
guess ill turn in
bundle up virge
cold out there
virgil nods exiting with a wave
wyatt and morgan keep playing hardly noticing as moments later florentino walks out
virgil turns off allen onto th the wind whipping his coattails
he glances up as florentino walks by crossing th and ducking into a doorway
something seems to be moving in the shadows of an unfinished building on the opposite side of th
a booming sound echoes outside muffled by wind
morgan looks up that thunders sure somethin
that didnt sound like thunder
moments later virgil walks back in pale hatless a blank look on his face
he moves with odd shuffling steps holding himself sideways
wyatt and morgan exchange puzzled glances then virgil
virgil does an unsteady stutter step his face taking on a pleading almost childlike look of panic
but as he turns his body toward wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is in bloody shreds his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few gory ribbons
his voice is a frightened sob wyatt
he starts to swoon
wyatt rushes over and grabs him as
the hotel room where theyve taken virgil
hes on the bed wrapped in bandages semi conscious
wyatt and morgan stand in the doorway with doc and the women
allie is at virgils side hands over her mouth as dr
goodfellow speaks in somber tones im afraid your husbands been very badly hurt
i had to remove the entire left elbow joint
what that means is well im afraid oh no no no no
she starts wailing
suddenly alert virgil sits up taking her in his big right arm pulling her close his voice calm reassuring no no dont worry honey
i still got one arm left to hug you with
she buries her face in his chest and sobs
he holds her rocking her back and forth
wyatt turns away shutting his eyes
virgil lies in bed staring blankly into space
wyatt sits at his side hands over his face while allie hovers in the b
its all my fault
if i hadnt been so damn smart if id just
oh god virge im so sorry
look wyatt i dont want to talk right now
virgil what am i going to do
for gods sake just leave me alone
virgil grimaces in hopeless agony
allie touches wyatts arm
he doesnt want to talk now
wyatt stands backing away
he turns pleadingly to mattie standing in the doorway
she looks away
he walks out
wyatt comes into the lobby and freezes as mcmasters approaches
wyatt starts to walk by him but mcmasters steps into his path no wait
i know nothin i sayll fix things but i want you to know it wasnt me
brothers to the bone right
not anymore not after this
wyatt looks into mcmasters eyes and we can see he means it
morgan is by himself in the empty saloon calmly shooting pool his dog jumping enthusiastically at every shot as wyatt enters
get down boy
morgan are you crazy
theyre out gunning for us
what the hellre you doin
whats it look like
they want a piece of me they can come and get it im not crawlin into my hole

our own brother
ruined for life
no sir i aint going no place
you want to go fine
im stayin right here and have it out with those bastards
morgan pulls back his vest revealing virgils badge
wyatt drops into a corner chair defeated
morgan makes a shot leaving only the ball
a few beats
seeing wyatts misery morgan softens poking him with the cue
wyatt looks up
morgan taps the middle pocket
wyatt shakes his head
how much you wanna bet
wyatt holds up his watch
wyatt raises his brows i just got it fixed
morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the ball looking over at wyatt in triumph
wyatt applauds rolling his eyes just as a bullet spangs into the wall by his head
wyatt dives for the floor as another shot pierces the window
wyatt jumps up bounding to the door to see several figures cash into the darkness
wyatt turns back and freezed
morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge jerking and shuddering involuntarily
wyatt rushes to him
the dog whines as doc rushes in with kate and mcmasters
wyatt is trembling
get the doctor
the curious crowd outside watching through the windows
morgan is on the pool table lying on his side with his shirt pulled up
the dog cowers in the corner whining while dr
goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe making morgan writhe in perfect agony
the doctor turns to wyatt hold him
wyatt takes morgan in his arms
the doctor probes
morgan jerks violently
suddenly we hear a blood curdling scream
louisa is in the doorway tearing her hair lost in utter hysterics
oh no get her out of her
and now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering louisa shrieking as others restrain her and morgan gives a violet jerk breaking wyatts grip
the doctor snarls about at the end of his rope
i said hold him god damn it
somebody shut that dog up
morgan takes wyatts arm his voice like a childs
you were right wyatt
they got me good
dont let em get you too
will somebody get the damn dog out remember about the light youre supposed to see when youre dyin
easy morg dont think about that now
i cant see a damn thing
tears well up in wyatts eyes
he touches his brothers face
morgans eyelids start fluttering
wyatt squeezes his hand
the dog starts howling long and loud and pitiful and in the next moment the air is filled with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the
wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk staring at the blood on his hands
standing in the crowd across the street josephine sees wyatt and starts for him
behan grabs her
she wrenches free and with the whole town watching starts running toward wyatt
seeing her wyatt backs away in horror shaking his head no no get away get away from me
she keeps coming
finally in desperation whore
get away from me
she pauses unable to believe her ears then runs away crying
fuming with rage kate starts after wyatt
doc pulls her back cant you see why he did it
the howls continue as wyatt trudges down the street alone
suddenly he doubles over clutching his abdomen in agony staring at his bloody hands
the wagon bearing morgans pine coffin waits in the street hitched and ready
virgil is up front with the women arm in a sling pale
doc and kate wait on horses nearby
finished loading wyatt looks around
people line the street watching in silence
clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door unable to meet his gaze
the very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio active
bystanders gape as josephine steps out of the hotel regal and impervious as a queen wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat her little white dog scampering after her
passing behan he gives her nasty look and spits
she doesnt even break stride
lounging in front of the crystal palace with the other cowboys stillwell gives curly bill an enquiring look
naw shes nobody
wyatt junked her
passing wyatt she doesnt even glance at him
doc sighs and so she walked out of our lives forever
without a word wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins driving off
he pulls up in front of the cowboys
they make a show of pretending to hide their guns
wyatt looks straight ahead i want you to know its over
were leaving and were not coming back
sniffs hey you smell that
smells like something died
stifling a laugh oh jesus johnny
allies eyes flare louisa stifles a sob
the cowboys snicker
wyatt clenches his teeth still staring straight ahead and drives on
a few beats then curly bill turns to ike take frank and finish it
a train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds while porters load morgans coffin into a boxcar
up ahead mattie and louisa fumble with luggage while allie boosts virgil into a passenger car
as we hear the conductors voice shouting board
ike and stillwell emerge from the shadows near the scales crouched behind shotguns
they exchange nods and start forward cocking their weapons squinting through the steam thats virgil with the women
but where the hells wyatt
right behind you stillwell
they spin around
wyatt stands behind them looking down the barrels of virgils big gauge
stillwell raises his shotgun wyatt fires
stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled heap his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags
screams page cut off right side page missing rest of usre months out of independece but were from carthage illinois originally
im from monmouth
another illinois man
step down marshal
have a feed
lucindas ever silent son sits at a nearby wagon staring at wyatt while lucinda rolls dough lovely as ever
just finished telling his story wyatt sits by the fire with the wagonmaster and several others
they shaker their head aint got law aint got nothin
only thing between us and the animals
always the way it goes though
only way to down an illinois mans from behind the dogs dont dare face em
lincoln wild bill now your brothers illinois men all and all downed from behind by dirty dogs and democrats
guess an ordinary mand be out for vengeance but i dont figure thatll answer here
its a reckoning youre after
if the lord is my friend
let not your heart be faint let your arm be steel thats all you need of the lord
wyatt pauses nodding suddenly understanding the truth of it
looking up his eyes meet those of lucinda
she smiles wiping flour from her hands
wyatt smiles thoughtfully moved by this unexpected encounter
doc gallops into camp with mcmasters texas jack vermillion and turkey creek jack johnson exchanging greetings with wyatt who leads him over to the center of the camp then know
why youre here
way ahead of you wyatt
you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan
everybody knows theyre the ones to blame for your brothers
i want the cowboys
all of em
i mean to break em up drive em out of the territory
are you out of your mind
what on earthd make us takes out wad of bills ill pay you each in advance and ill mount you on those
he points to his magnificent blacks tied nearby
they look them over as wyatt takes out a stack of warrants
got a sheaf of federal warrants
being in the territories its up to our discretion how theyre served
that means we got the cowboys without quarter
the black flag brother
no prisoners no mercy amen
and i never even saw a horse like that
it cant be done
it might be done
if we hit the waterholes through the southern dragoons the whetstones and huachucas we could take em on in pieces run off their herds
faces wyatt keep your money ill show you where those waterholes are
just promise me youll finish it
no matter what happens youll see it through to the end
ill have your hand on that
vermillion and johnson confer in whispers then we come through this in one piece can we keep the horses
vermillion nods to johnson who crouches down with a pair of dice
he makes one pass two passes
finally crapped out
okay were in
the thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting each with a rifle in a scabbard and a double barreled shotgun across the saddle fork
lucindas son looks on with gathering awe as wyatts men each carrying pistols face their boss
the minute we start well be going against local and county law
if we fail the u
government wont be able to lift a finger to help us
nevertheless i want you to understand we carry the full force and authority of the law of this land
they exchange glances each man feeling a little shiver at the magnitude of what theyre about to attempt
wyatt faces them raise your right hands
do you solemnly swear to uphold the laws and constitution of the united states of america and to protect her citizens to the best of your ability even at the
cost of your own life
all chorus i do except for doc who rolls his eyes
wyatt hands each a federal deputys badges
doc waves his away you know why im here
my hypocrisy only goes so far
they mount up about to begin but suddenly wait
lucinda runs up to wyatt reaching up and tying a blue and gold silk scarf around his neck
wyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up good luck boys
and give em hell
they shake hands then wyatt motions to his men
they take off at a graceful lope riding through camp toward the deadfall and the desert beyond
unable to contain himself any longer lucindas son bounds up onto a wagon waving and shouting spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast wyatt earp the two gun man
whistling death and bloody murder
wyatt the widow maker avenging and bright purple poison on horseback with lightning in his eye and thunder in his heart
wyatt and his he devils holy terrors and true five black centaurs blowin fire and quicksilver
ride out and charge and shoot and strike and cleave and hack and thrust home
dont let up and give no rest and never call retreat till the last ones smashed and smote and runnin for cover
best em all and break em up and bang their heads together in a bunch and give no quarter though they be ten times ten thousand
wyatt turns in the saddle sweeping off his hat with a cavaliers flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a single bound and pass into the desert
an immigrant father grabs his infant son lifting him up
whatre you doing
someday hell be able to say he was there when wyatt earp rode out to bring the law
music up avenging and bright as wyatt and his men ride through the desert abreast on their giant chargers glossy black coats shimmering in the sunlight hoofbeats pounding in unison
all right lets wring em out
they break into a dead run streaking across the frame
as they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and for a single perfect moment it appears as if theyre airborne flying across the skyline like
the winged horsemen of myth
johnson turns to vermillion laughing at the sheer joy of being alive like flyin son
just like flyin
the sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge overlooking the camp where on one side florentino and several cowboys sit in a circle playing poker
while others recline on bedrolls laughing and drinking
on the other side at the foot of the ridge spence pony deal and others crouch over a fire cooking
suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating
spence turns to pony deal who shrugs maybe they smell a wolf
turns to other cowboy go up there and take a look
the cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far side of the ridge
spence and the others continue cooking
moments later a crashing sound comes echoing over the ridge like thunder
the cowboys look up startled
pony deal points look
the pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge
the cowboys exchange confused glances all attention focused on the far end of the ridge
then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with
the speed of a flame
they are within a few yards of the fire when johnny barnes suddenly spots them and look out
spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before wyatt and his horsemen slam into them with terrifying impact the bodies disappearing under their horses hooves
the cowboys recoil in total shock jumping up from bedrolls stumbling in confusion scrambling to get out of the way as the possemen plow through the fire and roar into
camp pistols blazing in air horses rearing and snorting
united states marshals
a worried looking florentino shrinks back behind the others trying not to be spotted
meanwhile doc leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby cowboys forehead
say something witty
they herd the cowboys over to one side of camp shouting get over there
but barnes brazens up to wyatt hey you cant come a loud crack as wyatts quirt lays his face open to the bone
one more word and ill blind you
get over there
to mcmasters hey brother whatre you doin i aint your brother i aint none of your damn brothers
all right run em off
doc and wyatt cover the cowboys while the others scatter their herd with pistol shots
indignant swilling sneers at wyatt bastard
like to eat you blood raw
a queer look in his eye wyatt dismounts and faces swilling
all right breed
and then wyatt drills him in the jaw with a straight right hand
swilling drops like a stone
wyatt hauls him up by the hair and hammers him left right left steps around digs down and pile drives a left hook to his gut
swilling topples back into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes out
meanwhile seeing his chance florentino ducks down and makes for the remuda as doc looks down at swilling
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut
faces cowboys felt his liver go on that last one
get him to a doctor or hell be dead in a couple hours
at the remuda florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off bareback
mcmasters point pulling his rifle from its scabbard florentino
hes getting away
drop his horse
mcmasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his winchester and fires
yards away the bullet hits florentinos horse in the shoulder with a thunk
it drops tumbling end over end and plunging florentino face first into the ground
he jumps up spitting out a mouthful and starts running
wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward closing the distance in seconds
florentino gasps and runs faster pulling a bellygun from his sash wyatt almost on top of him
he turns and fires on the run
a branch next to wyatts head explodes
wyatt keeps coming drawing his buntline impervious unstoppable
florentino turns for another shot just as the black piles into him sending him flying and tumbling him down an embankment
he scrambles to his feet as wyatt dismounts starting toward him with deliberate step eyes blazing long barreled pistol held in front of him
florentino backs up in terror gun at his side shaking his head i dont kill your brother
i dont even know him
i was only lookout
it was money they give me twelve dollars
it was money
a human life
wyatt nods still coming cold blooded murder in his eye
florentino screams raising his gun no
wyatt fires blasting florentino to the ground
he advances firing over and over emptying his gun into him
the cowboys watch as wyatt gallops up dragging florentinos bullet riddled body behind him
he reins up un dallying the rope
the corpse flops at their feet
they jump back horrified
look at him
thats how youll all end up if you dont get it through your head its over the cowboysre finished
so tell the others and get out of the territory cause next time i leave no one alive
you been warned
to his men all right burn it
as his men prepare to fire the camp several cowboys move to pick up floretinos body but leave that trash where it lays
wyatt and his men ride through the blazing camp the flames lighting up his eyes like a demons
the possemen crouch by their fire
doc sits shivering miserably by himself as vermillion turns to johnson
you know we might just pull this off
not so sure
somethin tells me it gets harder from here in
pauses shouldve held out for more money
meanwhile wyatt and mcmasters confer over a map
wyatt points to a specific point on the map very interested i know that cut
you mean theres a waterhole near there
but this time theyll be ready
well see about that
now we see what so interested wyatt its the same mountain cut where he and josephine met
pony deal and a party of cowboys ride through the desert yards from the cut pushing a herd
keep your eyes open for earps bunch
swear to god aint gonna get the drop on us this time
riders up ahead
its them all right
wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth of the cut
they tense the st cowboy squinting against the sun
at the cut wyatt and his men poise themselves doc nodding they saw us
here they come
the cowboys charge forward outnumbering them better than to and only yards away
the possemen choke up on their reins alerting their horses for action as wait
yards and the first shots ring out richochetting off the walls of the cut
the others blanch but wyatt stays cool waiting yards
till we can see their eyes and now
they whirl around and disappear into the cut
the cowboys keep coming
wyatts group reaches the little trail leading up the wall of the cut he used to avoid josephine
they clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop unseen as moments later the cowboys gallop by and continue through into the desert on the other side
wyatts group careens up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller coaster following the tiny narrow path at a breathtaking clip the trail finally plunging them
back into the draw behind the cowboys
they speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut drawing their pistols as the cowboys gallop into the desert before them unaware
they charge forward
seeing the empty desert ahead the cowboys pull up looking around in confusion
suddenly a volley of gunfire hits them from behind knocking several from the saddle
they spin around just as wyatts group slams into them head on guns blazing cowboys tumbling from the saddle left and right horses rearing and toppling over backwards
the remaining cowboys turn and dash into the desert
wyatt shouts come on
wyatts group charges the thoroughbreds closing the distance in seconds
vermillion stands in his stirrups roaring like an animal as he plunges into them swinging his quirt like a saber and lashing a cowboy across the face making him tumble
to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll
mcmasters closes with another throwing an arm around him and jerking him from the saddle snapping his neck
doc overtakes a rd jams his pistol into his face and fires point blank blackening his face with soot and blowing out the back of his head as he falls
reins in his teeth shotgun at his shoulder johnson comes up behind a th and fires
the cowboys head disappears in a cloud of pink vapor the body dropping like a stone
wyatt bears down on pony deal at a dead run
pony deal turns in the saddle and fires at him
we feel a surge of breathless exhilaration as wyatt swings out of the saddle like a commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his horse hiding in
pony deal turns for another shot only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him
but in the next instant wyatt darts around under his horses neck and fires blowing pony deal head over heels off the back of his horse
wyatt bounds back into the saddle as mcmasters rides by drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor the st cowboy
only a few yards in front of them he whips his horse frantically trying to get away
mcmasters is about to fire when wyatt rides up deflecting the shot
the cowboy makes it over a rise and disappears
whatd you do that for
so he can tell the story
curly bill studies a map drawn in the dirt listening with ringo ike etc
while the st cowboy describes the battle didnt make any sense
one minute were chasin em next theyre right on top of us
we couldnt stop em they got everybody
easy now its only five men
been havin it their way cause they been surprising you
hittin the waterholes and that judas mcmasters is showin em right where they are
pretty damn cute
but nobodys cute as me
points to dirt map next ups black draw
but that smart wyattll say no thats where theyll expect us to hit well hit the one after
thats where they show next
only im gonna be there first
and throw a little party
curly bill grins his coarse face radiant in the firelight
doc sits by the fire shaking and shivering and sweating
vermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket but dont touch me
he pulls back
doc wraps himself in the blanket
after a beat you really look awful
not half as bad as i feel
then why in hellre you doin this
you ought to be in bed
wyatt earp is my friend
hell i got lots of friends
turns glares at him i dont
meanwhile at the other side of the camp wyatt and mcmasters huddle over the map johnson walks up maybe you ought to have a talk with doc wyatt
i dont know if hes gonna make it
theres no reasoning with him
points to map next waterholes black draw
we could be there by mid morning
theyre wise by now
which is next iron springs
yeah lets try there iron springs
a camp near a waterhole with cowboys crouched by a fire sipping coffee
wyatts men ride up to the rocks overlooking it and dismount unseen
there they are
no herd though
well go around that way come up on foot
they pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the rocks on foot creeping up on the camp seemingly undetected
but suddenly the cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and ambush
and suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side explodes in gunfire
vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others hugging the rocks
a bullet richochets into a rock at johnsons head biting his face with fragments making him wince christ
hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with more cowboys curly bill raises his head grinning and shouting hey wyatt
how the hell are you
wyatt and his men react to his voice
the fire continues
suddenly theres movement in the rocks above them
doc points look
got some boys workin around those rocks behind you
another minute or two gonna have you in a crossfire
how do you like that
seeing the spot theyre in mcmasters turns to the silent wyatt hes right
they get set up in them rocks its the end for us
and now for the first time we see fear in these men actual naked fear
but curly bill laughs having the time of his life
course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party
then what larks
crouched by curly bill barnes chuckles
a confident ripple of laughter goes through the cowboy line they know theyve got them
on the other side vermillion shakes his head grimly
aint takin me alive damn it
mcmasters looks at the still silent wyatt shrugging helplessly think of somethin fast or were cooked
they really are at the end of their rope all looking to wyatt for a solution
he remains silent
then suddenly in this supreme moment a strange almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply no
and now we can almost hear the ether ringing in our ears as wyatt takes his shotgun and while the others look on in horror rises to his feet
bullets whiz around him
doc jumps up to grab him but a ricochet drives him back down
wyatt advances quickly across the clearing walking right into the teeth of their guns repeating no
wyatts clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through but he just keeps coming
seeing this curly bill also stands a weird manic elation coming over him
he hoots and howls look at that
come and get some boy
curly bill waves away his mens fire and walks toward wyatt gauge shotgun in one hand
in the other blasting away
let me let me yeah
die you bastard
curly bill fires again
wyatts hat flies off
he fires again digging a gash in wyatts boot heel
now curly bill takes dead aim with his
and click its empty
he tosses it aside
suddenly a sharp wind gusts up making the tails of wyatts duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances
eyes wild with battle rage curly bill quickly raises his shotgun
son of a bitch
wyatts coattails evaporate into swirling shreds as he takes deliberate aim with his mighty gauge hissing through clenched teeth no
and with that wyatt lets go with both barrels
curly bills mid section vaporizes the huge double charge of buckshot ripping him completely in half
the other cowboys flinch as theyre sprayed with flecks of blood and gore
barnes screams jesus christ
eyes burning like two twin hells wyatt pulls his buntline and fires
barnes doubles over
wyatt fires again
the others recoil their faces looking as if they are living in a waking nightmare as wyatt advances on them still firing
another goes down
doc leaps from the rocks gun in hand and come on
now they all rise and open fire advancing abreast a wall of gunfire driving the remaining cowboys off running for their horses
wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the others run up
beside himself doc helps wyatt to a nearby rock sitting him down and examining him running his hands all over his body
the others fire at the cowboys retreating on horseback
wyatt my god
youre shot to pieces
yeah better run you bastards
turn to doc how is he
looks up amazed i dont believe it
but i saw em im telling you there isnt a mark on him
meanwhile wyatt starts to tremble
theyre camped by a running stream
wyatt stares into the fire
doc crouches opposite him shaking his head im a man without fear wyatt
i literally dont care if i live or die
but even i cant fight human instinct
somebody suddenly starts shooting at me i duck
what on earth were you thinking about
i dont know
it all happened so fast
if id had a chance to think about it i guess i probably wouldve been scared but
swear to god doc i just dont know
at the other end of camp vermillion and johnson sit together
after a beat hey creek you ever see anything like that before
never even heard of anything like it
both look shaken to the very core of their beings
finally i just thought of somethin i never thought about before
pauses looks at him i dont want to go to hell
wyatt sits by the fire sipping coffee
vermillion and johnson approach
johnson drops a wad of money on wyatts bedroll
wyatt looks up in surprise talked it over
we decided we dont need the money
took out dollars each though
federal possemans fee
that all right
we come through this alive can we keep the badges
wyatt nods picks up the money and quietly moves off toward the stream by himself
moments later mcmasters approaches wheres wyatt
down at the creek
walking on water
ringo crouches by the fire with the other cowboys his face a deeply shadowed mask
iron springs survivors stand before him we hit him half a dozen times but he just kept comin walked right up to curly bill with that gauge and blew him
he killed curly bill
ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds inhaling and exhaling like an animal eyes swimming in panic
he didnt just kill him he burned him down
blew him in half
i mean all the way in half like a melon
then he turned around with that big colt and killed johnny barnes shot up a couple more fore we got out of there
but it was his face you shouldve seen his face
hes just a man
you didnt see his face ringo looks up at them suddenly dead calm his face a blank
you see my face dont you
out of nowhere ringo draws and fires shots so quickly they sound like one
the survivors drop with bullets through their brains
the others jump transfixed by the insane brutality of what hes just done
ringo draws himself up in full possession of the situation the new leader fearsome matchless everybody get this through their heads
wyatt earp dies
im running the show now and im telling you earp dies
his men too
they all die
were gonna kill em
for what they did to curly bill were gonna ride em into the ground and slaughter em like rabbits
cause this is my time children
this is where i get woolly
most of the others are asleep or talking among themselves as billy grounds turns to zwing hunt whispering what dyou think
i didnt think curly bill could be killed
im tellin you this whole things gone sour
we got hands droppin like flies and ringos flat out of his mind
i mean hell brother you feel like ridin against wyatt earp
hell no brother
then brother lets you and me cut out
right with you brother
they steal away toward the horses as
ringo faces behan grim intent while behan sputters holding up a san francisco newspaper are you crazy
its front page news all over the country
its getting out of hand ringo
if things dont settle down soon you heard me behan
ringo you dont understand ringo glares at behan his eyes burning implacable no you dont understand
ringo rides up with behan and dismounts
a rd cowboy steps up billy grounds and zwing hunt ran out
four five others too
separate the wheat from the chaff
behan looks worried as ike and the other cowboys gather around
just then breakenridge rides up
whatre you doing here billy
curly bill was my friend
id like to come with you
sure why not
ringo slaps the little deputy on the back and turns to his men
his unaccustomed good humor is very troubling
i told you it was time to get woolly
now gather round children gather round
and raise your right hands
now weve come full circle as ringo rides across the desert at the head of his men strong armed to the teeth full of fight and all wearing deputy sheriffs
badges a posse of outlaws a miserable behan bringing up the rear
wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the horizon the cowboy posse rides out of the sun drawing closer thats ringo out front
and theres behan
must be of em
what the hell
theyre wearin badges
they all exchange looks of disbelief then mountsre getting jaded
were gonna have to find a place to rest em up
suddenly looking very sick doc sways dizzily in the saddle
wyatt dismounts reaching for him
the others do the same doc
dont touch me god damn it
just dont touch me
doc turns his horse as if to ride on then faints dead away
they all catch him easing him to the ground as
wyatts group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house vermillion keeping doc in the saddle
hooker and of his hands rides out to them horsere pretty well fagged and we got a sick man with us
you can put up at my ranch if you want
hooker motions down the hill toward his house
doc lies in bed semi conscious white as a sheet drenched in sweat
the others look on worried
hooker shakes his head im no doctor but he looks pretty bad
his face creased with worry wyatt sits down next to doc
mcmasters motions to the others
they file out leaving wyatt alone with his friend
grounds and hunt ride up and stop on the top of a hill overlooking a mountain crossroads somewhere in the whetstones
whats it gonna be brother
i dont care
colorado new mexico long as were out of the territory
suddenly a stagecoach comes into view making its winding way through the crossroads below
hunt points grinning just what we need
they spur their horses down the hill drawing their guns
the cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the whetstones
they look up as the stage rolls up and stops
shouting and commotion as behan and breakenridge approach and confer with the driver then behan turns to ringo robbery
men stuck em up and killed a passenger
one of em rode a mexican saddle the other had a mother hubbard
billy grounds and zwing hunt
behan opens the door
fabian lies inside cradled in josephines arms surrounded by the other actors in the troupe
reclined at full length head back he looks like the dying hamlet even more beautiful than in life
breakenridge gasps oh no
were headed for a booking in denver
they tried to take my watch
he cursed them for cowards and they shot him
he mayve been vain and an actor but he was better than all of you
and gentler and braver
i dont understand any of this i only know its ugly
youre all ugly and he was beautiful he tried to put something fine into your ugly world and you killed him for it
anyway the ones who did it are headed north
not that you care
his soft face suddenly turning resolute
breakenridge goes to his horse and mounts
wherere you going
get back here
the little deputy straightens his spectacles turning to behan im sorry sir but we got to have some law
and he rides off alone into the whetstones
behan sputters but let him go
the stage is stopped out front
the driver waters the horses and the actors mill around silently
wyatt and hooker walk out had a holdup
came her to water their horses before pushin on
seeing each other wyatt and josephine freeze
wyatt approaches sorry about your friend
pauses and im sorry about
i forgave you the moment you said it
the driver jumps back onto the stage motioning to the others
i have to go
theres so much he wants to say but
wyatt opens the coach door for her
she gets in
it pulls out with a crack of the drivers whip
she and wyatt hold each others gaze as the stage recedes into the distance
creek johnson steps up next to him
wyatt looks at him see how she breezed out of here
like she had wings
funny thing but i cant really remember how she looked
i can remember parts of her clear as crystal her mouth her walk how she shut her eyes when she laughed little bits and pieces but not the whole package
cant put it together for some reason
good god youre really cards in spades
im in love with every second of her life
hell ill probably love her when im dust
a cold camp in the hollow of a mountain
wrapped n blankets grounds and hunt sip cold coffee
hunts pats him no fire tonight son
too many riders out
suddenly theres an o
both jump up
breakenridge steps from the shadows winchester at his shoulder squinting through the dark with his spectacles
its deputy breakenridge
they relax and lower their pistols heaving sighs of relief
thank god we was afraid you shouldntve killed mr
you shouldntve done that
it was wrong
im takin you both in for it
you gotta be kiddin
look just go home fore you get hurt
dont want to kill you but i will if i have to
im warning you
no im warning you sister boy
grounds steps forward menancingly
breakenridge tenses dont try it
sister boy just go to hell
grounds raises his pistol
breakenridge recoils in fright stumbling backward in the dark and his rifle accidentally fires
grounds drops like a stone a look of utter disbelief on his dying face
hunt looks at him in shock then turns on breakenridge raising his gun and snarling
breakenridge fires again
hunt grabs his midsection dropping his gun and falling to his knees
he looks up at breakenridge who shrugs timidly sorry
hunt falls over dead
breakenridge stares at the bodies hardly believing it himself
wyatt and his men are on the porch listening to hooker brought em in draped over their saddles
little billy breakenridge
he done it
so i guess the laws finally arrived in southeast arizona
wyatt shakes his head hardly comprehending what he started
the cowboys are camped on a mountaintop overlooking hookers ranch in the valley below
a messenger rides up with a letter for behan as ringo paces studying the set up with ike
hookers got around or hands
we could take em right enough but it might be a mess
keep the place bottled up for now see if we can figure a way to flush em
behan suddenly steps up beside himself holding up his message its too much
its completely out of hand
governor gospers talking about asking the president to send in the army
listen ringo youve got to get this over with and youve got to do it now
one way or another
wyatt stands on the front porch looking through the front door to the back bedroom where doc lies unconscious while hooker and the others look on we should get moving
docs just in no kinda shape
dont have to bother about that
took a vote
cowboys or not you can stay here as long as you want
anyway maybe you done enough
i mean you whittled em down considerable now theres talk of sendin the army in here
ask me you done enough
rides up points rider comin in under a white flag they look up as the rd cowboy rides up with a white kerchief
got a message
ringo wants mcmaster to come over to our camp for a parley
he didnt figure on all the stink this is causin
might be hes lookin to strike a bargain
if so he probably figures he needs somebody like me who talks his language
could be we got him
i dont like it
might as well hear him out
anyways what choice we got
mounts horse whispers but no matter what happens see it through to the end
if you dont ill curse the day i ever laid eyes on you
before wyatt can answer mcmasters rides off with the cowboy
mcmasters rides up with the rd cowboy
riding through camp all his former comrades flares at him with pure hate
only ringo smiles stepping up as mcmasters dismounts
well hello sherm
you wanted to talk
yeah kinda wanted to see if youd join back up with us
that what you got me up here for
youre a cowboy youre a brother
come back no hard feelings
forget it ringo
isnt there anything i can say thatll change your mind
youre gonna stay with your new friends
least they dont scare women
youre the boss
one thing though
ringo moves closer looking him in the eye and smiling how you gonna get back to em
the rd cowboy rides up to the ranch house dumps a large something in front and gallops back to just within earshot as wyatt and his men run up
the object is a human corpse and though we cant see what was done to it the expressions on their faces are plain enough
why couldnt theyve jus killed him
shouts ringo wanted to be sure he got your attention marshal
he wants a straight up fight just you and him settle this thing once and for all
you win we quit the territory ringo wins your deputies get safe conduct to the colorado line
sundown today in the oak grove at the mouth of sulphur springs canyon
ride out with your escort well meet you
you tell ringo
just tell him ill be there
wyatt are you crazy
i made a promise
wyatt listen you cant beat him
youre good and god knows you got the courage but you aint in ringos class
hell hes the best thats ever been
cept maybe for wild bill
hes right wyatt
ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him
but id do it id get that one into him
so help me god i would
all right wyatt maybe you can
but you gotta die to do it
you gotta die
in tight on wyatt as these words sink in and
its late and the last rays of the sun come through the window falling on the bed where doc lies awake but looking like hell
wyatt sits next to him staring at the floor
after a moment what makes a man like ringo doc
what makes him do the things he does
a man like ringos got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he cant ever fill it
he cant kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it
and it drives him mad
cold and dirty
so what does he want
what does he want
he wants revenge
doc looks at him a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes
wyatt looks down again and its a long time before he speaks remember how i said it all happened so fast with curly bill i didnt have time to think
well ive had plenty of time to think about this
i spent most of my life since i was born not knowing what i want out of life just chasin my tail
but now for the first time i know exactly what i want
and thats the damnable misery of it
pauses looks at doc i cant beat him can i
doc shakes his head
wyatt nods then stands ready to exit but no wait ill go with you
doc struggles to sit up sweating and trembling finally falling back down almost passing out
wyatt puts a hand on his forehead
im sorry wyatt
god im so sorry
thats all right doc
never got to wear one of those
doc points to wyatts badge
he takes it off pressing it into docs hand
doc smiles then does pass out
its late almost sunset
wyatt steps onto the porch where hooker and the others wait
he glances back into the house looking at the unconscious doc through the open bedroom door
they want him theyll have to go over us first
wyatt nods gratefully offering his hand
hooker takes it abashed
wyatt mounts up with johnson and vermillion
they ride off at a slow gallop figures against the twilight sky
ringo waits atop the hill with ike and the rd cowboy watching as wyatts group rides out only three
they left somebody behind
lets go take a look
ringo and the others ride up
hooker steps up with several hands
whatre you doin here
whos in there
imagine hes dyin
ringo squints through the front door of the house to the open bedroom where doc lies unconscious chest heaving sweating
drag him out here lets have a look
i looked the other way when you did a lot of foul things but i aint lettin you torment a dyin man
not as long as hes under my roof
i draw the line there
hooker and his men look resolute
ringo smiles nodding all right hooker
ill be back in about an hour
well see how brave you are then
ill be here
ringo and his men ride off
at the crossroads they stop ike peeling off
soon as im through with wyatt swarm down with the whole bunch and finish off creek johnson and texas jack
and they gallop off in opposite directions as
cowboys ringos seconds ride up to where wyatt and his men stand dismounted waiting
one points to a thicket nearby hes waitin for you by the big oak quarter mile up that trail
behan and the other cowboys wait at the road above the canyon
strong mounted and ready
ike rides up full of anticipation get ready
soon as ringos done were gonna take care of the others
arent we giving them safe conduct
sure we are
all the way to hell
ringos seconds wait nearby as wyatt whispers to his men theyre not givin you any safe conduct
soon as the shooting starts kick east for the new mexico line
wyatt shakes hands with vermillion who turns away with emotion hiding his face
wyatt turns to johnson
i aint got the words
wyatt pats his shoulder and walks off alone into the thicket the only sound the musical clinking and chiming of his spurs
a gorgeous sunset yellow and red and magenta
making his way down the trail wyatt looks up at the sky
a flock of wild geese fly overhead in v formation oblivious to the human drama below
wyatt stops drinking it all in as if trying to grab all he can in the time left
suddenly he closes his eyes falling to his knees trembling afraid for the first time
he clasps his hands dear god this is the last battle
i worked it out in my head every which way and i know theres no way im comin through this alive
youve preserved me this far so i only ask one more favor just let me live long enough to kill that man
thy will be done and theres an amen to it
wyatt stands back up his fear gone replaced by calm his face luminous almost angelic
he walks on spurs still chiming as
a clearing by a creek with a cluster of small oaks
ringo leans against a tree sipping from a hip flask smoking a slim cheroot
we hear the chiming spurs approach
ringo looks up as the tall silhouette of his enemy emerges from the shadows of the thicket
well didnt think you had it in you
smiles sets himself shall we
im your huckleberry
ringo stiffens as the silhouette steps into the waning light
its doc pale and drawn looking like death itself but awake and ready just the same why johnny ringo you look like somebody just walked over your grave
sees his shock oh i wasnt quite as sick as i made out
my fights not with you holliday
i beg to differ
we started a fight we never got to finish
play for blood remember
i was kidding about that
for the last time that cheshire cat smile comes over docs face i wasnt
pins on wyatts badge and this time its legal
ringo nods his hock replaced by a growing malice
as they set themselves once again their eyes begin to blaze boring into each other their concentrated rage focusing on each other about to reach critical mass
all right lunger
lets do it
a long tense moment then both grunt in unison
blurred movement the flash of a gunshot
doc slaps his gun back in its holster as ringo stumbles a bullet hole in the side of his head
back in the thicket wyatt hears the gunshot and starts running
blood coursing from the hole in his head frenzied messages flickering all through his shattered brain going only on pure hate ringo stumbles and jerks struggling to raise his pistol
doc dances in front of him urging him on come on
but finally ringo falls over into the crook of the oak tree his pistol firing into the air harmlessly
doc looks down at him shaking his head oh johnny
youre no daisy no daisy at all
just then wyatt appears looking at doc in total shock
doc looks at him like hes a fool then points to ringo poor soul he was so high strung
afraid the strain was more than he could bear
suddenly we hear horses crashing through the brush toward them
my horse is over here
they dash off into the thicket
moments later ringos seconds ride out into the grove
seeing ringos body their jaws drop
vermillion and johnson practically jump for joy as wyatt and doc emerge from the thicket doc leading his horse
ill be dipped in shit
i will too
alert by the shots ike turns to behan and the others
all right get ready
vermillion and johnson are mounted watching while doc tries to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness
though on his feet its clear doc is as sick as ever sweating and panting running on sheer animal courage
wyatt stands behind him his hands poised to help trying to will him into the saddle jerking his hands behind him every time doc looks back
finally with a last grunt doc throws a leg over his horse and drops into the saddle
wyatt mounts turns to his men pointing all right whats it to be
new mexicos that way
colorados closer sore the cowboys
theyre up that road right now waiting to jump us
were the law aint we
well the law dont ride around vermin it rides right at em
like mcmasters said see it through to the end
wyatt looks at doc who shrugs
wyatt swings his horse alongside suddenly noticing his badge on docs chest
doc smiles wanly i just wanted to see what it felt like
he starts unpinning it but wyatt stops him pressing his palm onto the badge over docs heart
a last look around each other then wyatt signals and they start up the north road at the lope four abreast the last charge of wyatt earp and his immortals
from a lookout position above a cowboy calls down to the others riders comin
behan heaves a sigh of relief glancing around at the others
well i guess ringo did it
but suddenly ringos seconds gallop up from the flank ringos dead what
straining to see in the falling light the cowboy on the rock shouts excitedly thats wyatt earps bunch
the word starts to spread the crowd of horsemen buzzing
suddenly off in the distance the horsemen come into view coming straight at them at a lope
theyre comin right at us
down the road wyatt asnd his men pull their shotguns holding them at the ready as they break into a gallop
the cowboy on the rock jumps down mounting his horse
here they come
the cowboys line up on a rise blocking the road
they draw their guns
wyatt and his men keep coming now yards away
behan groans panic sinking sour and heavy churning his bowels oh no
now wyatts men break into a dead run hurtling toward them at top speed their thoroughbreds eating up the distance now only yards away
the cowboys tense up more and more biting lips grinding teeth
the th cowboy turns to the nearby rd cowboy what dyou think
i think its time to start workin for a livin
they break and run
so does another
suddenly the whole mass of them explodes in panic with horsemen riding in all directions scurrying away like cockroaches from a light
ike looks around screaming at them beside himself as the th cowboy rides by kill em
its only four men
why dont you kill em
why dont you
the others keep going leaving him behind
but seeing wyatt bearing down on him ike finally bolts himself pounding off hell for leather into the hills
wyatt and his men keep coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise suddenly as before the ground seems to fall out from under them and for
another burning moment they once again appear airborne grim faced avenging angels on winged horses now even more majestic in the twilight like a myth made flesh awesome superb and unutterably beautiful
as they approach only breakenridge remains giving them a tentative wave
wyatt points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash cresting another rise and passing into legend
the clock on the wall of this private denver hospital room ticks gently but inexorably as doc lies in bed with father feeney a catholic priest sitting at his side
painfully emaciated his breathing shallow and labored doc is so weak its all he can do to even move his eyes
but he brightens as wyatt enters well hell wyatt
wyatt i want you to meet father feeney
father feeneys just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome
you see it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds
how you feelin doc
rather an obvious question under the circumstances dont you agree
a better one might be how do you feel
sits down sighs hurts
hurts pretty bad
i imagine it would yes
so now we can add self pity to your list of frailties
all right doc
you think im kidding
youre the most fallible wrong headed self deluding just generally benighted jackass ive ever known
yet withal even at your worst youre the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life
when will you wake up
you wouldnt know a normal life if it bit you in the ass
thats great coming from you
i played the cards i was dealt wyatt
your problem is youre always trying to play someone elses
allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free there is no happiness wyatt there is no normal life
theres only life thats all
the rest is relative
then what do i do
first you can grab that black haired woman and make her your own
take that girl and start running
run and dont look back
all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by
this time run and dont look back and call it living
live every second live it right up to the hilt
pauses takes his hand live for me
wyatt stares into his eyes letting this sink in
just then doc looks up as if something were pressing on him
then wyatt please if you were ever my friend if you ever had even the smallest feeling for me leave
they look at each other and something passes between them something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion
wyatt starts to speak but never mind wyatt
doc turns away
doc looks over at father feeney now lets see father
what was that monkey show you were talking about
you mean extreme unction
better start that ball rolling
father feeney nods picking up his missal
as he starts to intone the last rites doc looks down at the end of the bed and sees his feet poking through the sheets
they are bare
doc smiles ill be damned
looks at feeney this is funny
a lively road company production of h
josephine and chorus girls all adorable in out size sailor suits do the seamens hornpipe to the resounding applause of the audience
josephine and her fellow chorines including the st actress from before all in various stages of undress sit at the long mirror removing their make up and chatting i cant
get used to this thin air here in denver
i thought i was going to faint on that last buck and wing
i know its suddenly the door bursts open
screams and stunned reaction
wyatt rushes in and goes to josephine who sits in stunned silence
he falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies
it hits all of a sudden and below theres california and you swear youre looking at heaven
wyatt stands pulling her close clasping her hands in his i have nothing left
i have nothing to give you
i have no pride no dignity no money
i dont even know how well make a living
but i promise ill love you every second of your life
dont worry wyatt
my familys rich
brilliant sunlight clean crisp air as a train hurtles through a pass high up in the rocky mountains blowing its whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up
over the sheer towering snow topped mountain walls into the crystal clear sky above
wyatt leads josephine by the hand through the parlor car both hardly able to contain themselves brimming over with excitement and anticipation like children waiting for christmas morning and trying
to ignore the group of reporters dogging their footsteps swarming around them calling out to wyatt mr earp
one minute please
you and your four men have just accomplished in one week what it took the texas rangers four years to do
please do you have any comment
wyatt and josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of porters into the next car
only the st reporter gives chase
moving into the passenger car furthest forward wyatt leads her through the door to the platform over the coupling between cars
chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest the train is immersed in shadows
wyatt points ahead to the approaching crest there
itll come up over that ridge
inside meanwhile the st reporter comes through the car and spots them up
a business type passenger tugs on his sleeve whats the commotion
who are they
dont you know
thats wyatt earp the lion of tombstone and his lady fair
outside still bathed in shadows wyatt and josephine hang onto the railing and lean out watching in as the train nears the top
get ready here it comes
here it comes
then as if on cue they crest the mountain and are suddenly bathed in golden sunlight their heads leaning from the train wyatts blonde hair and josephines black tresses flowing
in the breeze their faces luminous looking straight ahead toward their future
hold on this image as the sun gets brighter and brighter finally making the frame white out as we
epilog desert an old man and woman walk arm in arm through the mojave tiny figures in a vast landscape sierras looming in the distance
wyatt and josephine embarked on a series of adventures throughout the west making and losing several fortunes always living the high life spending every winter just the two of them
prospecting for gold in the desert foothills of southeastern california
up or down thin or flush in years they never left each others side
the figures of the old man and woman fade away leaving only the desert and the mountains which are eternal
wyatt earp died in los angeles in
among the pallbearers at his funeral were early western movie stars william s
hart and tom mix
flickering images from early hollywood silent films split the frame on one side the grim but impassioned figure of william s
hart the original western good badman crouched menacingly behind a pair of sixguns his costume dusty and severe and on the other side tom mix the original western fantasy hero
so light hearted and optimistic with his sunny grin and fancy white outfit
tom mix wept
hold on these two images as the music swells and we
