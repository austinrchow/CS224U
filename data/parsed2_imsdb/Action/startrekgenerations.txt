star trek generations screenplay by rick berman ronald d
moore brannon braga march a vast and sparkling starfield
a pinpoint of light appears and starts moving toward the camera
a small and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end but we cant determine exactly what it is yet
a vast and undulating sea of wheat
we become aware that there are two heads sticking out of the stalks of wheat two men are standing and looking up at the sky
as we move towards them we begin to hear their conversation
and we can see that the two men are scotty and chekov dressed in civilian clothing
points to sky there he is there to the south
peers upward what are ye blind
thats a bird
as they stare up at the sky
the cylinder tumbling through space is now closer and we can now see that it is a bottle of some sort and it is tumbling directly toward the camera
as before chekov and scotty staring at the sky
concerned repelling the crystalline trench
rafting down lava flows
its like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the galaxy
suddenly we hear a double sonic boom
re sound that should be him now
i think hes just crossed the sound barrier
they shield their eyes against the sun and look up
the bottle gets closer
a man in a high tech body harness and parachute lands in the wheat flat on his back
his body suit is charred scorched wisps of smoke still curling off of it
there are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots
scotty and chekov move to him
the man removes his helmet
revealing that it is kirk
he smiles broadly like a child who has just come off a roller coaster
right on target
i jump out over the arabian peninsula
and i end up here right on the dime
kirk gets to his feet
actually captain your precise target area was thirty five meters
points that way
thanks for pointing that out
kirk starts to pull off his suit reacts to a sudden pain in his back
ive warned ye about that back of yours
you should have a doctor take a look at it
kirk waves him away and continues to remove his harness
the tumbling bottle rushes past and we can now see that it is a champagne bottle dom perignon
follow the bottle as it tumbles through space
kirk scotty and chekov as before
tomorrow i want to make a tri elliptical jump
thats where you jump out over northern china and make three complete orbits before you start re entry
perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony
this strikes a nerve with kirk we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face
im not going
beat scotty help me with this chute
what do you mean youre not going
when i retired i swore id never set foot on a starship again and i meant it
firm i dont want to hear anymore about it
im not going and thats final
the champagne bottle smashes onto the bow of a federation starship excelsior class sitting in its dock in orbit around earth
follow the shards of glass from the bottle as they spread over the ship
revealing the name on the hull a large picture window overlooking the starship in its berth
the window is filled with people in starfleet uniforms applauding the christening of the ship but we hear nothing
the people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out over the ship in its berth
the great ship sits in spacedock
close on a set of turbolift doors as they slide open to reveal kirk scotty and chekov
a bright light shines into their faces and they react
move to reveal that the bright light is coming from a futuristic camera with a small bank of lights attached to it
the camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operators head
there are four journalists clustered in front of the turbolift one associated with the camera the others using padds to make notations
also clustered around the door are the bridge crew of the enterprise b
everyone is applauding as kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and enter the bridge
overlapping captain kirk how does it feel to be back on the enterprise bridge
captain can i have a minute
captain scott do you have any comment on
captain john harriman pushes through the crowd
excuse me excuse me
there will be plenty of time for questions later
the journalists edge away and the cameraman moves to get a good angle
continuing to all im captain john harriman
id like to welcome you all aboard
its our pleasure
harriman is young confident eager this is his first command and he takes it very seriously
i just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage
beat i remember reading about your missions when i was in grade school
the original enterprise officers all stop and give him a look
harriman looks a little embarrassed he didnt mean to insult them
but kirk gives him a little smile lets it roll off
may we have a look around
chekov sees someone in the background calls out to her
chekov moves off
breezy so captain
this is the first starship enterprise in thirty years without james t
kirk in command
how do you feel about that
the journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve
kirks eyes flash for a moment the longer hes on this bridge the more he realizes he doesnt feel good about it at all
he tries to shrug it off with a smile
im glad to be here to send her on her way
he tries to move away from the journalist who dogs him
what have you been doing since you retired
at this point chekov approaches with a young mid twenties attractive asian female ensign named demora
to kirk excuse me captain
id like you to meet the helmsman of the enterprise b
ensign demora sulu captain james kirk
its a pleasure to meet you sir
my fathers told me some
interesting stories about you
kirk is shocked
for a long moment he stares at her in amazement
hikaru sulu is your father
you met her once before but she was
chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height
but that wasnt so long ago
it couldnt have been more than
twelve years sir
it wouldnt be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm
thank you sir
to chekov let me show you the new inertial guidance system
demora and chekov move off and kirk looks after them for a long beat
the expression on his face changes from shock to sadness
something is clearly bothering him
scotty moves over to kirk with a smile on his face
to kirk damn fine ship if you ask me
but kirks mind is still on demora
he watches her as she moves to the helmsmans position
you know scotty
it amazes me
and what would that be sir
when did he find the time for a family
its like you always said if somethings important enough you make the time
kirk nods absently
scotty realizes something
thats why youve been running around the galaxy like an eighteen year old
finding retirement a little lonely are we
kirk gives him a look
with that kind of tact im glad youre an engineer and not a psychiatrist
excuse me gentlemen
if youll take your seats
revealing that three chairs have been neatly arranged to one side
scotty kirk and chekov all take their seats
the journalists take positions on the opposite side of the bridge
harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the bridge crew go to their stations
to all prepare to leave spacedock
aft thrusters ahead one quarter port and starboard at station keeping
beat captain kirk id be honored if you would give the order to get underway
please i insist
all eyes on kirk he has little choice
he stands uncomfortably
there is a moment of anticipation
to all take us out
everyone breaks into applause
kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and annoyance
sotto very good sir
sotto brought a tear to my eye
the great ship majestically leaves the dock and heads out into open space passing directly overhead
a short time later
harriman turns to his guests
weve just cleared the asteroid belt
our course will take us out beyond pluto and then back to spacedock
just a quick run around the block
beat if we have time well conduct a few tests of the warp suddenly the communications console starts to beep
the com officer hits a few commands in response
to harriman were picking up a distress call captain
this grabs everyones attention
we hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent
fritzed this is the transport ship lakul
were caught in some kind of energy distortion
we cant break free
need immediate help
it tearing us the voice is drowned out by static
the science officer checks something on his console
the journalist with the holo camera turns on his light and pans it around to capture the action
the lakul is one of two ships transporting el aurian refugees to earth
harriman blinks a couple of times surprised at this unexpected turn of events
kirk watches him intently
harriman clears his throat then turns to demora
can you locate them
the ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five
distance three light years
signal the closest starship
were in no condition to mount a rescue
we dont even have a full crew aboard
the navigator checks his console
were the only one in range sir
the holo camera light is shined on harriman as he shifts in his seat hesitant to take the plunge
kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg
finally harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit
i guess its up to us
to demora helm lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp
kirk fidgets in his chair itching to get in on the action his instincts taking over
scotty shoots him a side long glance
is there something wrong with your chair captain
kirk gives him a look
the ship snaps into warp
a few minutes later
demora is watching her console
were within visual range of the energy distortion captain
which now shows a huge ribbon of crackling energy directly ahead of the enterprise b
everyone reacts to the bizarre sight
what the hell is that
off console ive found the transport ships
the viewscreen now shows two transport ships trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy
the ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large tendrils of crackling energy
contd their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress they wont survive much longer
the ship suddenly shakes
the navigator works his console
were encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon
well have to keep our distance
we dont want to get pulled in too
harriman frowns at the screen trying to figure out what to do
kirk can barely contain himself to him the answer is obvious
he blurts out the answer tractor beam
scotty quickly elbows him in the side this isnt kirks ship
kirk shuts up
harriman glances at kirk
we dont have a tractor beam
you left spacedock without a tractor beam
it wont be installed until tuesday
beat ensign sulu
try generating a subspace field around the ships
that might break them free
when kirk hears this order he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word no under his breath
he knows that wont work
continuing shakes her head theres too much quantum interference captain
harriman frowns again trying to come up with another solution but it isnt easy its his first day in command his ship is under manned and ill prepared
its a nightmare come true
kirk is itching to get in on this his fingers digging into the arms of his chair but he restrains himself
venting plasma from the warp nacelles
that might disrupt the ribbons hold on the ships
releasing drive plasma
a tense beat
harriman glances over at the journalists then glances over at kirk
kirk gives him a pained smile trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action
continuing its not having any effect sir
i think sir
the starboard vessels hull is collapsing suddenly the right hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery tendril of energy and it explodes
the other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted
everyone reacts with shock on the bridge
how many people were aboard that ship
two hundred sixty five
harriman pales at the sight
seems shell shocked by the destruction of the ship
hes overwhelmed now at a genuine loss as to what to do next
urgent the lakuls hull integrity is down to twelve percent sir
harriman looks over at kirk who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young captain
this is a delicate moment harriman doesnt want to look incapable but at the same time he needs help
i would appreciate any
suggestions you might have
kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle
he moves down to stand next to harriman
sotto first move us within transporter range and beam those people to the enterprise
harriman looks at him with surprise
what about the gravimetric distortions
theyll tear us apart
gently risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
kirk gives him a supportive look
harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen
helm close to within transporter range
kirk glances at the cameraman whos still shining the light on them all
and second turn that damned thing off
the cameraman turns off the light
the ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon
the tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship just missing it
were within range sir
to lieutenant beam them directly to sickbay
concerned how bigs your medical staff
embarrassed the medical staff
doesnt arrive until tuesday
chekov turns to the two journalists
you and you
youve just become nurses
chekov and the journalists exit to the turbolift
main engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays
by pass the relays and go to auxiliary systems
the lieutenant is having problems at the aft console
sir im having trouble locking onto them
they appear to be
in some sort of
kirk turns to scotty
scotty quickly moves to look at the transporter console
what the hell
kirk moves to him
their life signs are
are phasing in and out of our space time continuum
scotty begins to work
their hulls collapsing
the ship is destroyed by an energy tendril
all eyes on scotty
i got forty seven of them
beat grim out of one hundred fifty
suddenly the ship is rocked violently
klaxons and alarms start to wail and the lights flicker on and off
bulkhead explodes sending metal fragments screaming across the bridge and killing the navigator
scotty quickly takes over the dead mans console
were caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon
all engines full reverse
the ship is turning sideways into the wake of the ribbon but cannot break away
it is clearly being pulled along out of control
tendrils leap up from the ribbon lashing against the ship
the room is filled with the survivors of the lakul
they are all members of the el auriaan race humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing
the survivors are in various states of shock
many sit on the floor staring into middle distance
some lie on tables unconscious
others are mumbling incoherently to themselves
chekov and the journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is rocked and flung about
chekov has a tricorder
incoherent overlapping the colors are touching me
im caught in the glass
i can see the seconds
etc it will be all right
were going to take care of you
he looks at the tricorder
off tricorder only minor injuries so far
beat but it looks like theyre all suffering from some kind of neural shock
one journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio bed with a dazed look on his face
he has a nasty looking wound on one side of his face
we will later learn that this man is named doctor soran
the journalist is about to turn away when suddenly soran grabs him roughly clearly a man of great strength and pulls him close
sorans eyes are suddenly wild crazed
its all right
youre on the enterprise
i have to go
i have to get back
you dont understand
let me go
soran begins to attack the journalist but before he can do any real damage chekov injects soran with a hypospray and soran falls unconscious
what was he talking about
suddenly a woman with her back toward us stumbles nearby
chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her before she falls
the woman turns around and we see her face for the first time its guinan
she seems dazed and confused
chekov smiles at her warmly
its going to be okay
here just lie down
as he guides guinan onto a table
energy ribbon on viewscreen
inertial dampers failing
engines not responding
harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one hand
his face pales
quiet i didnt expect to die my first day on the job
kirk tries to buck up the young captain
sotto the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death
beat then louder scotty
outraged theres just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude
hull integrity failing
kirk looks at scotty expectantly for a moment
continuing but i do have a theory
i thought you might
an anti matter discharge directly ahead
it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
a photon torpedo
quickly to demora load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command
demora turns to him
we dont have any torpedoes
kirk glances at harriman
dont tell me
harriman nods a little embarrassed
the shaking gets worse
captain it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish
onto the idea where are the deflector relays
deck fifteen section twenty one alpha to kirk ill go
you have the bridge
harriman heads for the turbolift and there is a moment as kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the captains chair one more time
but he pulls himself back before harriman can exit
a captains place is on the bridge of his ship
beat ill take care of it
harriman nods in acknowledgement
kirk heads for the turbolift
on the move to scotty keep her together until i get back
matter of fact i always do
kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut
kirk running down the corridor opens a door
a small control room with a few consoles
kirk rushes in and rips off one of the large wall panels
he quickly begins to re route cabling and circuitry
the ship is shaking badly
forty five seconds to structural collapse
scotty is working the consoles frantically
bridge to captain kirk
kirk working furiously
captain i dont know how much longer i can hold her together
kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed
to demora activate main deflector
demora works the console
a large burst f energy leaps out of the main deflector dish and explodes in front of the ship
there is an immediate reaction within the energy ribbon which roils and fluctuates in response
were breaking free
the ship now begins to turn away from the crackling ribbon
but just as its turning one final tendril of energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship
the ship is rocked so hard that everyone is knocked off their feet
gradually the shaking stops
demora scrambles back into position
everyone reacts with relief
excited to com you did it kirk
to demora damage report ensign
off console theres some buckling on the starboard nacelle
reacts weve also got a hull breach in the engineering section
emergency forcefields are in place and holding
sections twenty through twenty eight on decks thirteen
looks at scotty with meaning and fifteen
everyone turns around and looks at scotty
to com bridge to captain kirk
beat captain kirk please respond
still no response
scottys face falls
continuing to demora have chekov meet me on deck fifteen
harriman very concerned gets up and follows scotty
they exit to the turbolift
scotty and harriman head down the corridor
they round a bend
and then stop short
they react to something ahead of them
revealing that the corridor ahead of them is gone
a jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and open space can be seen beyond the twisted metal
a forcefield flickers on and off holding the vacuum of space at bay
scotty and harriman look at the awesome sight for a moment
chekov comes running up the corridor behind them
he stops and reacts
beat was anyone in there
a long silent beat as scotty looks out into space
a huge chunk has been ripped out of the engineering section looking like an open wound
scotty chekov and harriman can be seen standing inside the small corridor looking out into space
a short time later
scotty harriman and chekov are listening to demora who is working the helm console
ive checked the entire ship and the surrounding space
theres no sign of him
a silent moment
chekov looks to scotty hoping to hear some sort of miracle
scotty takes a moment looks at the empty command chair
then he shakes his head
a long beat as everyone is forced to accept this terrible truth
quiet just a quick
run around the block
i never thought it would end like this
all things must end mr
harriman finally breaks the stillness of the bridge
lets go home
harriman steps down to the captains chair and takes command of his ship
scotty and chekov exchange a final look
off the reactions of these two friends whove just lost someone very dear to them both
the crippled ship turns and heads away
as a flag is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast
the flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind the blue and white banner of the united federation of planets waves in the breeze
a nineteenth century three masted sailing vessel about the size of a frigate is hove to and sitting in the water gently rocking
across the stern of the ship we can see the name enterprise picked out in gold letters
where picard and riker are standing before the assembled crew of the ship
everyone is dressed in full dress naval uniforms of the period complete with cocked hats epaulettes etc
the crew is standing at attention
the wind whistles through the rigging
the timbers creak
picard grimly looks over his crew
then finally he nods to riker
bring out the prisoner
a drummer begins a long drum roll
as worf is brought on deck by troi and geordi
worf is shackled by hand and leg irons
troi and geordi hold him by either arm and shove him toward the captain
the drum roll stops
picard moves to worf and peers at him closely
i always knew this day would come
are you prepared to face the charges
worf doesnt answer and troi jabs him in the side
i am prepared
picard looks to riker who then pulls out a large rolled piece of parchment
he opens the scroll and begins to read from it
in the b
geordi removes worfs shackles
we the officers and crew of the u
enterprise being of sound mind and judgment hereby make the following charges against lieutenant worf one
that he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions
that he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years
that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew
riker puts away the scroll there can be only one punishment for such crimes
beat i hereby promote you to the rank of lieutenant commander with all the rights and privileges thereto
and may god have mercy on your soul
everyone roars in approval
picard smiles at worf and shakes his hand
contd congratulations commander
smiles thank you sir
picard continues to smile at him for a moment
then riker steps in
extend the plank
worfs face registers surprise as everyone grabs him and hauls him toward the side where a long plank is being pushed out over the water
into the sea with him
feed him to the sharks
walk the plank
picard gives riker a questioning look
dont you think youre taking this a little too far number one
when we went to ancient rome for deannas promotion we threw her to the lions remember
picard shrugs it off
its not exactly his cup of tea but hell go along with it
worf is hustled to the rail where beverly is waiting patiently by the plank holding a long pike
worf is put on the plank and crusher prods him with the pike until worf is nearly at the end
worf finally stops and turns around
a shout everyone falls silent a moment
worf looks over the side at the water below
a little embarrassed i cant swim
calmly to worf the holodeck safety program is engaged
the computer wont let you drown
but the sharks are quite convincing
beverly prods him with the pike and worf falls into the sea with a huge splash
everyone laughs and cheers
reveal data who is standing near the side rail looking a little confused at the reaction
to beverly doctor i must confess i am uncertain as to why pushing someone into freezing shark infested water is amusing
its all done in good fun data
get in the spirit of things
data thinks a moment then he lifts beverly with one hand and hold her over the rail
data lets go and beverly plummets into the ocean
data looks around no one is laughing
they all look a little surprised
that wasnt funny
data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd
hes more confused than ever
are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet beverly comes up on deck
well now that were all aboard
beat then smiles number one bring the ship before the wind
savoring the moment lets see whats out there
aye aye sir
to troi take the wheel commander
troi takes the ships wheel
shouts all hands make sail
raise up tacks and stand by the braces
the crew springs into action
rushing to their places aloft and on deck
grabbing ropes and lines
starting to unfurl the sails
trimming the yardarms
getting the ship ready to sail
picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great satisfaction and contentment
imagine what it was like will
just the wind the sea and the stars to guide you
bad food brutal discipline
beat no women
but picard wont let riker rain on his parade hes thoroughly enjoying himself
bridge to captain picard
there is a personal message for you from earth
annoyed put it through down here
to riker but the best thing about a life at sea was that they couldnt get to you
picard walks toward the bow
to com computer arch
a u shaped arch with several computer panels visible appears on the forecastle
its a strange sight to see a piece of the th century on the deck of this ship
picard goes to the arch and activates one of the monitors and waits for the transmission to appear
a text message appears and he starts to read it
after a moment he reacts with shock and dismay to something on the screen
whose attention has been drawn to picard at the arch
she reacts with concern at the expression on his face
to crewmember here
take the wheel
troi moves toward the bow
whose face is now ashen with shock
clearly he has just read something on the screen which is very disturbing
he stares into the middle distance for a moment
troi moves to him
quiet captain are you all right
if youll excuse me
he turns off the screen
the holodeck doors appear within the arch
picard is clearly distracted as he exits to the corridor
troi looks after him with concern
he takes a couple of steps toward worf
set the royals and the studding sails mister worf
worf looks at him blankly for a moment
smiles points aloft you see the top yardarm now look to the suddenly a com voice interrupts
bridge to commander riker
were picking up a distress call from the amargosa observatory sir
they say theyre under attack
to all red alert
all hands to battle stations
captain picard to the bridge
everyone on the ship reacts and there is a general rush to the bow of the ship
the great ship at impulse
we follow it and then see ahead of the ship a small solar observatory with a complex optical array
the observatory bears scorch marks and other signs of recent battle
in the b
a yellow sun can be seen
picard in command
riker troi worf and data at their stations they didnt have time to change so they are all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony
the ship is at red alert
the image of the burnt out observatory is on the viewscreen
it looks like were too late
off console there are no other ships in the system
sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
the station complement was nineteen
a grim beat
picard gets up and starts heading for the ready room his attitude is dismissive almost irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern of his
secure from red alert
number one begin an investigation
ill be in my ready room
troi and riker exchange a surprised look
hard make it so
an awkward beat
whats wrong with the captain
but they have their orders
as riker and worf head for the exit
the station is a smoking ruin consoles flickering lights dim damage everywhere
only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked
riker worf beverly and two security guards materialize
theyre all back in uniform holding phasers and palm beacons
worf has a tricorder and beverly has a medical kit
the room is cramped there are fallen bulk heads and blown out consoles
the debris makes it difficult to get a clear view of the room
these blast patterns are consistent with type three disruptors
well that narrows it to klingon breen or romulan
beverly follows her tricorder readings
im picking up life signs
about twenty meters ahead
that rules out klingons
riker gives him a look
they would not have left anyone alive
they pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station
and come to the body of a starfleet science officer
he has taken a disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty looking scorch mark on his uniform
beverly immediately takes some devices out of her medical kit and begins to treat him
worf youre with me
paskall you and mendez search the upper deck
the security guards climb a nearby ladder while riker and worf head down a dimly lit corridor
riker stops at two bodies in the hall checks them over but theyre dead
there is a sudden banging from the far corner of the room
worf and riker quickly move to a collapsed bulkhead
they both grab hold of a large metal plate pull it aside and begin to dig through the debris
finally a hand can be seen grasping about from within the pile of rubble
riker and worf work faster
worf grabs the mans hand
its all right
do not struggle
worf holds the mans hand as riker shoves away a final console
we reveal the head and torso of doctor soran one of the survivors from the lakul and last seen in sickbay aboard the enterprise b
soran has not aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face from the earlier wound
he blinks a few times seems a little dazed
im commander william riker of the starship enterprise
doctor tolian soran
soran puts a hand to his head still trying to get his bearings
who attacked you doctor
im not sure
it happened so fast
calls out commander youd better take a look at this
riker and worf move to the ladder as beverly begins to scan soran
riker and worf move over to the two security guards who are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from view
one guard turns over the body revealing a romulan soldier
worf looks at him in disgust
riker and worf exchange a look
off their reactions
data is sitting in a chair petting spot the cat
geordi is standing next to him
is she still angry
but id stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you
i still dont know why you dropped her in the water
i was attempting to
get in the spirit of things
i thought it would be humorous
troubled by this recent experience
he puts spot down and moves to a bulkhead
he activates a control panel and a small compartment slides open revealing a small computer chip which is suspended in a glass and metal framework
data looks at the chip for a beat and geordi moves to him in concern
youre not thinking about using that thing are you
it has occurred to me on several occasions
but i believe this may be the appropriate time
wait a minute
i thought youve always been afraid it would overload your neural net
that is true
however i believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse
for thirty four years i have endeavored to become more human to grow beyond my original programming
and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor
re chip this emotion chip is the only answer
geordi considers a moment looks at the chip
and reluctantly has to agree
data sits down and la forge moves to stand behind him
but at the first sign of trouble im going to deactivate it
geordi works on datas head for a moment and then opens a panel on datas head revealing the blinking circuitry within
riker is standing next to picard who has his back turned and is staring out the window
picard seems distracted during the scene his mind clearly elsewhere as riker finishes his report
we found two dead romulans aboard the station
were analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from
picard nods absently
theres still no indication of why they attacked the station
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
beat inform starfleet command
this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet
is there a problem
thank you number one
picard keeps his back turned looking out the window
riker hesitates awkward
there is something else captain
one of the scientists
a doctor soran
has insisted on speaking with you
beat i told him you were busy sir but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away
that will be all
is there anything wrong
a beat then riker turns and exits
off picards unreadable face
the room is bustling with patrons and activity
data enters with an odd look on his face
his body language subtly altered
he is looking at the world through new eyes
geordi is following him closely watching his every move
they move to the bar
guinan comes over she has not aged at all since the enterprise b
she sets down an exotic looking container full of dark liquid
you two just volunteered to be my first victims
re liquid this is a new concoction i picked up on forcas three
trust me youre going to love it
she pours two glasses of the liquid
data takes one and sniffs it then takes a drink
geordi watches him closely
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response
what do you feel
i am uncertain
i have had little experience with emotions
i am unable to articulate the sensation
ill explain later
data finishes the drink
concentrates tries to make sense of the rush of feelings
his expression is one of disgust
to geordi i dont think he likes it
that is it
i hate it
data i think the chip is working
data looks at geordi with a big smile on his face
i hate this
it is revolting
in the b
we see picard enter ten forward
as he walks through ten forward and heads toward a table by the windows
soran is sitting at the table staring out at the stars lost in thought
his observatory uniform is distinctive and sets him apart from everyone else in the room
picard walks up to the table
yes yes captain thank you for coming
the men shake hands and picard sits down
soran is an imposing physical presence but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work
picard waves away a waiter
nothing for me
brusque to soran i understand theres something urgent you need to discuss with me
i need to return to the observatory immediately
i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star
picards reaction is a little impatient this doesnt sound that imperative to him
were still conducting an investigation into the attack
once weve completed our work well be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory
until then the timing is very important on my experiment if it is not completed within the next twelve hours years of research will be lost
were doing the best we can
now if youll excuse me
picard moves to stand but soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm
the unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in sorans face stops picard in his tracks
cryptically they say time is the fire in which we burn
and right now captain my time is running out
beat we leave so many things unfinished in our lives im sure you can understand
for some reason sorans words have struck a deep chord within picard
he looks away from sorans compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment
when he finally speaks his voice is barely above a whisper
ill see what i can do
picard walks away without a word before soran can thank him
soran looks after him with relief then pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens it
he looks at the watch for a long moment
then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one picard took
follow soran across ten forward
until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees
of guinan who is now back at the bar
a dark look crosses his face he is disturbed by the sight of guinan
he quickly turns and exits
she begins to sense something as though someone is watching her
she turns looks in the direction where soran was just standing but theres no one there now
she shakes off the feeling and goes back to work
a short time later
a romulan tricorder is connected to some diagnostic equipment near a console
worf is talking to riker
worf activates a monitor which shows a complex diagram of sensor information
one of the dead romulans had a tricorder
we analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on
in theory a trilithium based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti matter weapon
but they never found a way to stabilize it
why were they looking for it on a federation observatory
it doesnt make any sense
contd have geordi and data go over with the next away team
tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium
the station is still a wreck
geordi and data are scanning the room with tricorders
off tricorder theres no sign of any trilithium in here
geordi continues to scan
then suddenly data lets out a quiet giggle
geordi stops and turns to look at him
data giggles louder
laughing to himself i get it
i get it
you get what
data laughs again
when you said to commander riker
imitating geordis voice the clown can stay but the ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go
geordi looks blankly at him for a moment
during the farpoint mission
we were on the bridge and you told a joke
that was the punch line
the farpoint mission
data that was seven years ago
i just got it
laughs it was very funny
geordi indicates a corridor
they exit in that direction
a short corridor connecting the ops center with other compartments
geordi suddenly stops in front of what appears to be a standard bulkhead
wait a minute
theres a hidden doorway here
i can see the joint of the metal with my visor
geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what appears to be a smooth bulkhead
off tricorder there appears to be a dampening field in operation
i cannot scan beyond the bulkhead
geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door
i dont see a control panel
or an access port
off tricorder it appears to be a magnetically sealed
data steps forward and opens a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within
i believe i can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo
data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist over the door panel
joking open sesame
there is a humming sound followed by a loud click
the door slides open
smiles you could say i have a
geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace
they exit to
a small room with several probes stacked in holding racks
geordi and data scan
im still not picking up anything
someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room
they put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room
data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up
geordi begins inspecting the probes
finally stops at one probe which has several odd devices attached to the side
data take a look at this
data comes over you ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration
data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth
making tricorder talk no geordi
i have not
it is most unusual
data giggles and geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian
just help me get this panel open
data helps geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe
they open the panel and geordi looks inside
he reacts to something
my visors picking up something in the theta band
it could be a trilithium signature
data suddenly start laughing
geordi turns in irritation
data this isnt the time
laughing i am sorry
but i cannot stop myself
i think something is wrong
datas laughter escalates into hysteria
then data begins to jerk and shake and goes into a bizarre emotional seizure
a rush of emotions race across his face
anger passion shock
a kaleidoscopic blur of reactions contort his features
then it stops and he falls to the ground
geordi rushes to him
data has a look of surprise on his face as he blinks a few times
he sits up
data are you all right
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
we better get you back to the ship
hits combadge la forge to enterprise
theres no response
geordi frowns for a beat then we hear sorans voice
is there a problem gentlemen
standing in the room
geordi didnt hear him come in
yeah as a matter of fact there is
theres a damping field in here blocking our com signal
re data will you give me a hand
over the above dialogue soran glances over at the solar probe geordi was inspecting
he notes the opened panel and a disturbed look crosses his face
soran looks back at geordi
id be happy to
soran moves toward them
and then without warning he punches geordi in the face knocking the visor across the room
he whirls around and points a phaser at data who suddenly looks fearful
please dont hurt me
picard is standing at the replicator
the cup of tea appears in the replicator and at the same moment the door chimes
picard would rather not be bothered right now but he is polite as always
what can i do for you
im here to see if theres anything i can do for you
i appreciate your concern but id rather not discuss it right now thank you
but troi wont be brushed away so easily
im afraid i cant just leave it at that
the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something
as ships counselor its my duty to as ships counselor its your duty to know not only when youre needed
but also when youre not
you cant fool an empath captain
i know exactly when im needed
picard is really not in the mood for this
his tone hardens
well with all due respect to your betazoid senses i prefer to be alone right now
i suppose i could make out my weekly report to starfleet command without your input
beat admiral lusby
regarding the unusual behavior of jean luc picard i find him increasingly irritable
i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to all right all right
youve made your point
troi takes a seat and patiently waits
picard gets up
moves around the room for a moment
he speaks in a flat unemotional tone of voice
the message i received
beat my brother
and his son my nephew burned to death in a fire
troi reacts genuinely surprised
captain im sorry
beat i know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother
what i cant get out of my mind is the image of rene my nephew
i just cant believe hes gone
he trails off
its only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies
sensing more but it goes deeper than that doesnt it
i can sense that rene meant a great deal to you
in a way he was as close as i ever came to having a child of my own
troi eyes an open photo album on the table
she reaches over and flips through the pages for a moment
there are many photos inside
from many periods in time including one of picards brother standing next to his young son
this is the picard family album
your family history is very important to you isnt it
nods ever since i was a little boy i remember hearing about the family line
the picards that fought at trafalgar
the picards that settled the first martian colony
when my brother married and had a son
picard hesitates this is difficult for him
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
nods my brother had shouldered that burden
allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
theres nothing selfish about pursuing your own life
your own career
picard moves to the window stares outside
a shadow crosses his face
hes getting to the heart of the matter
you know counselor
im not getting any younger
for some time now ive been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind
beat but i always took comfort in the fact that when i was gone my family would continue
picard moves back to the photo album open it to the last page an then flips through the remaining pages they are blank
ive had brushes with death
more than i care to contemplate
i always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform
beat but now
the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it
he looks at her
im the last picard
a quiet beat as troi considers him
captain perhaps we suddenly a blinding burst of light from outside the windows washes into the room
troi and picard rush to the window and shield their eyes against the glare
all hands to duty stations
picard and troi enter from a turbolift
riker and worf at their stations
the star is on the viewscreen getting darker by the second
more flaming debris is being ejected into space
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star
all nuclear fusion is breaking down
how is that possible
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago
the stars going to collapse in a matter of minutes
something beeps on worfs console
sir the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave
shocked level twelve
thatll destroy everything in this system
transporter room to bridge
i cant locate commander la forge or mister data sir
to worf did they return to the ship
works no sir
they are not aboard
how long until the shock wave hits the observatory
four minutes forty seconds
picard looks at riker who then quickly heads for the turbolift
riker and worf exit
the star is almost entirely dark
radiating out from the star is a huge shock wave a rapidly growing sphere of energy
soran is standing at a console watching a graphic depiction of the stars collapse on a monitor when the door suddenly opens
soran whirls around and fires his phaser at riker and worf
they dive for cover just outside the room
note the probe geordi examined earlier is now gone
to worf what the hells he doing
worf dodges another phaser blast and sees geordi lying unconscious on the deck
data is nowhere to be seen
enterprise to commander riker you have two minutes left
yells to soran soran did you hear that
theres a level twelve shock wave coming
weve got to get out of here
sorans only answer is another phaser blast
ensign hayes is at tactical
an alarm suddenly beeps on the tactical console
a klingon bird of prey is decloaking off the port bow
as an old style klingon bird of prey decloaks near the observatory
soran is continuing to shoot at riker and worf
riker suddenly notices something off camera
data is huddled in a corner of the room cowering in fear
the firefight continues
see if you can get to geordi
data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face
i believe i am
suddenly sorans communicator beeps
soran reaches down and grabs the unconscious geordi by the collar and the two of them dematerialize
soran has the visor in his hand
riker data and worf react
the bird of prey cloaks and vanishes
transporter room to bridge
i have the away team aboard sir
to con helm warp one engage
the enterprise warps away just as the shock wave reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery on a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of the
darkening star and shock wave
move to reveal we are the inside an old klingon ship its beaten up and patched in several places obviously not a first line model
watching the viewscreen are lursa and betor two powerful looking klingon women
they are sisters
and very dangerous
male klingons man the various stations
the sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in awe
toh pak cha
a great power
soran now enters the bridge
his expression is dark and angry
he is clearly not a prisoner here and he strides up to the sisters
excited to soran youve done it soran
but without warning soran hits betor squarely in the jaw knocking her back over a console
several klingons leap to their feet drawing their weapons
but betor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee
she dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth
her expression is angry and threatening
i hope for your sake that you are initiating a mating ritual
you got careless
the romulans came looking for their missing trilithium
we left no survivors on their outpost
betor has now gotten to her feet in the b
they knew it was aboard the observatory
if the enterprise hadnt intervened they would have found it
but they didnt find it
and now we have a weapon of unlimited power
i have the weapon lursa
and if you ever want me to give it to you i advise you to be a little more careful in the future
betor grabs soran and holds a wicked looking knife to his throat
perhaps we are tired of waiting
soran is unfazed by this threat
without my research
the trilithium is worthless
as are your plans to reconquer the klingon empire
lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sisters knife away
set course for the veridian system
to helm bosh ta jah veridian set course for veridian a klingon guard enters dragging the unconscious geordi
what shall i do with this
soran moves toward geordi a grim look on his face
bring him with me
i need some answers from mr
riker and worf are on the move down the corridor
i have spoken to the klingon high council sir
they identified the bird of prey as belonging to the duras sisters
surprised lursa and betor
this doesnt make any sense
a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star kidnaps geordi
and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades
what the hells going on
they exit to
worf and riker enter
beverly is closing a panel on the back of datas head
he is sitting on a bio bed scanning himself with a tricorder
how is he
it looks like a power surge fused the emotional chip into his neural net
will that be a danger to him
i dont think so
the chip still seems to be working
id feel better if i could take a closer look but i cant remove it without completely dismantling his cerebral conduit
to data looks like youre stuck with emotions for a while
how do you feel
i am quite
preoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data
but were going to get him back
i hope so sir
datas expression is still one of concern
beverly pulls riker aside
wil i checked into doctor sorans background
beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of doctor soran along with some biographical information appears
hes an el aurian
over three hundred years old
he lost his entire family when the borg destroyed his world
soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the lakul
the ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon but soran and forty six others were rescued by the enterprise b
reacts that was the mission where james kirk was killed
i checked the passenger manifest of the lakul
guess who else was on board
she hits a control and suddenly guinans face appears on the screen
riker reacts to the image
close on guinan as she looks up surprised
thats a name i havent heard in a long time
move to reveal guinans quarters which are unlike any of the others on the enterprise
none of the standard furniture consoles or decoration are present
the floor is made of tile not carpet
the walls are draped in exotic fabric
the lighting is moody and subdued
picard is standing before guinan who is sitting cross legged on the floor
they talk to each other with an easy familiarity
two old friends who know each other well
do you remember him
i remember everyone who was on the lakul
even the ones who didnt make it
guinan stands and begins to move about the room
shes clearly troubled by the memories
she hesitates looks off into the middle distance for a few moments
picard moves to her
its important that you tell me what you know
we think sorans developed a weapon
a terrible weapon
it might give him enough power to soran doesnt care about power or weapons
all he cares about is getting back to the nexus
whats the nexus
guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic looking alien artifacts
this is difficult for her to discuss
its a place ive tried very hard to forget
she makes the decision to plunge ahead
that ribbon isnt just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space
its a doorway
it leads to another place
it doesnt exist in our universe
and it doesnt play by the same rules either
what happened to you
i cant remember very much
what it looked like or how long i was there
but i do remember how it felt
she turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory
it was like being inside
as if joy was a real thing that i could wrap around myself
ive never been so content
a long beat as picard absorbs her words
but then you were beamed away
guinan shows a rare burst of anger
i was pulled away
i didnt want to leave none of us did
i felt like id left a part of myself behind
all i could think about was getting back
i didnt care what i had to do
guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars
it took a long time but eventually i learned to live with it
and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me
beat i knew things about people
your sixth sense
ive always wondered where it came from
beat and what about soran
soran may still be obsessed with getting back
and if he is hell do anything to find that doorway again
but why destroy a star
beat thank you guinan
he heads for the door
let someone else do it jean luc
picard stops looks at her
let them send another starship
dont get near the ribbon
if you go into that nexus youre not going to care about soran or the enterprise or me
all youre going to care about is how it feels to be there
beat and youre never going to come back
picard weighs her words
sees the warning in her eyes
and carefully backs away and exits
a dimly lit room somewhere in the bowels of the klingon ship
like every other room on this decrepit ship the room looks well worn and ill maintained
soran is seated behind a table holding the visor
a padd and sorans pocket watch sit on the table
geordi is sitting in a chair across from him his shirt has been removed
he looks very tense
re visor a remarkable piece of equipment
but a little inelegant wouldnt you say
beat have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more
normal is what everyone else is
and what you are not
what do you want
soran takes a moment
as you may or may not be aware i am an el aurian
some people call us a race of listeners
beat right now mr
la forge you have my undivided attention
i want to listen to everything you know about trilithium
trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the romulans
i think its a derivative of soran picks up the padd from the desk and activates it
suddenly something small with sharp edges can be seen moving just underneath geordis skin near his chest
geordi moves his hand to the spot but then the protrusion is suddenly gone
i dont want a science lecture
you were on that observatory looking for trilithium
i was ordered to by the captain
on the padd in sorans hand we can now see an interior graphic of geordis body sitting in the chair
the graphic is interactive moving as geordi moves
a blinking dot represents the movement of the probe inside his body
right now the dot is in the middle of his chest
lets try to move beyond the usual prisoner interrogator banter shall we
you have information and i need it
beat did the captain explain his orders to you
did he say why you were searching for trilithium
what has she told you about me
i dont know what youre talking about
on the padd we now see the dot has moved to a position next to geordis heart
soran looks up at geordi
my instincts tell me youre lying
and i know that cant be easy for you
off padd i can see you have a good heart
soran taps a control on the padd
suddenly geordi grabs his chest in pain
soran watches geordi for a few seconds then taps the padd again
geordi gasps and starts to breathe
i forgot to tell you
while you were unconscious i injected a nano probe into your bloodstream
its been navigating your cardiovascular system
and right now ive attached it to your left ventricle
smiles a little trick i picked up from the borg
theyre full of great ideas
i just stopped your heart for five seconds
it felt like an eternity didnt it
did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage
i didnt know that
we learn something new about ourselves every day
maybe i didnt make myself clear
it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows
i told you everything
you might as well just kill me right now
sorans features soften as he smiles slightly
for a moment he looks genuinely compassionate and its a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity
im not a killer mr
beat lets try thirty seconds
soran taps a control on the padd
geordi gasps and strains against an unimaginable pain
soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover
sits back in his chair watching the seconds tick away
a room filled with exotic looking devices sensors and computers which handle the enormous task of tracking the ships position in space
the monitors around the room display various diagrams of the energy ribbon as seen in the beginning of the film
data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen
picard is standing next to him
throughout the following data seems distracted and preoccupied
according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty nine point one years when is it expected back
data doesnt answer right away
the ribbon has already entered the galaxy
it will pass through this sector in approximately thirty one hours
picard moves about the room
but determined to find out whats going on
guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon
if thats true then there must be some connection with the amargosa star
the stars destruction has had numerous astro physical effects within this sector
however none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon
give me a list of those effects
i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed
no matter how insignificant
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information
data works the computer and then the computer begins to work
data sighs his expression becomes downcast and gloomy
he sits down and puts his head in his hands
picard finally has to say something
data are you all right
i am finding it difficult to concentrate
i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of
remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory
what do you mean
i wanted to save geordi
but i experienced something i did not expect
beat i believe it was fear
picard regards him sympathetically
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome
its something we all have to learn to deal with
but i did not deal with it sir
i let it prevent me from helping my friend
beat does that make me a coward
and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe youre beginning to experience
it is a most unpleasant feeling
the computer finishes its calculations and the console beeps
data works the console
information appears on screen
according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector gamma emissions have increased by five percent
the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction
a research project on gorik four was halted due to increased neutrino particles
ambient magnetic fields have decreased by wait
why did it change course
matter of fact the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector
any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction
picard is starting to get an idea
hes onto something here
he moves to a large table in the center of the room
musing a minor course correction
beat where is the ribbon now
data moves to the table to work
after a few beats an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the ceiling of the room
a blinking dot shows the position of the ribbon
this is its current position
can you project its course
still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil
picard finally has to lay down the law
i have nothing but sympathy for what youre going through
but right now i need your full attention on the task at hand
if you cant provide it
then ill have to relieve you of duty until doctor crusher can remove this
emotion chip of yours
im sorry but you leave me no other choice
this snaps data back
he considers this for a long moment then looks determined
i do not wish to remove the chip sir
although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with
i cannot imagine going back to a life without them
i have taken an important step toward becoming truly human
if i were to turn back now
beat i would like to continue in my duties sir
picard smiles at him
courage is an emotion too data
can you project the course of the ribbon
i believe so
data works the console
a red line moves to form an arc through the star field
picard examines the display for a moment and nods
hes excited on to something
enhance grid a nine
data works and the display now zooms into a single sector
the red line cuts through the sector
where was the amargosa star
a star is highlighted near the red line
you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered
could that also affect the course of the ribbon
thinks i believe so
data works and holographic display changes again
the red line representing the course of the ribbon now shifts to the right away from the amargosa stars position
picard is beginning to realize whats going on
thats what sorans doing
hes changing its course
beat but why
why try to alter its path
why not simply fly into it with a ship
data thinks for a moment
our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged
picard thinks about this
then has a flash of insight
he cant go to the ribbon
so hes trying to make the ribbon come to him
beat data is it going to pass near any m class planets
works yes sir
there are two in the veridian system
the display zooms in on a star very close to the ribbons path
we now see a solar system with a single star and four planets
the red line moves directly through the system it passes very close to the third planet
picard eyes that planet and points to it
its very close to veridian three
but not close enough
picards mind is going a mile a minute
he suddenly has a horrible realization
data what would happen to the ribbons path if he destroyed the veridian star itself
on the display the veridian star suddenly darkens and goes out
the red line shifts slightly until it makes an exact intersection with the third planet
they both react to this sight
theyre both aware of just how serious this is
thats where hes going
it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa
grim and destroy every planet in the system
picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread
are any of them inhabited
veridian three is uninhabited
but veridian four supports a pre industrial humanoid society
approximately two hundred thirty million
a grim beat
to com picard to bridge
worf here sir
picard heads for the exit a sense of urgency and determination in his every move
red alert mister worf
set a course for the veridian system maximum warp
picard and data exit stellar cartography
as it goes into warp
lursa and betor in command as soran enters
did you get anything from the human
his heart just isnt in it
off console we have entered orbit of veridian three
prepare to transport me to the surface
when do we get our payment
soran hands betor a small computer chip
this contains all the information youll need to build a trilithium weapon
its been coded
once im safely to the surface ill transmit the decryption sequence to you
a federation starship is entering the system
the helm works
the view screen now shows the enterprise at impulse entering the system
they are hailing us
ducha on speakers
the helm works
we hear picards com voice
we know what youre doing and we will destroy any probe launched toward the veridian star
sorans expression darkens
what do we do
soran checks his watch
theres no time for this
reacts that is a galaxy class starship
we are no match for them
soran thinks for a moment
then he gets an idea
he pulls geordis visor out of a pocket
he eyes it with intent
i think its time we gave mister la forge his sight back
off lursa and betors curiosity
nearing veridian three
the planets star is visible
picard is pacing
riker data worf troi n
s at their stations
the ship is at red alert
datas mood has improved
hes making an effort to keep a positive outlook
to stay upbeat
maybe theyre not out there
theyre just trying to decide whether a twenty year old klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship
or perhaps theyre on the surface
mister data scan the planet for life forms
data smiles delighted at the request
i was hoping you would ask me to do that captain
i just love to scan for life forms
as data works he breaks into a merry little song
sings life forms
tiny little life forms
where are the life forms commander
works there is too much interference in the planets ionosphere for an accurate reading
worf turns to picard
sir according to my calculations a solar probe launched from either the klingon ship or the planets surface will take eleven seconds to reach the star
beat however since we do not know the exact point of origin it will take us between eight and fifteen seconds to lock our weapons onto it
they exchange a grim look
quiet to picard thats a pretty big margin of error
how long until the ribbon arrives
approximately forty seven minutes sir
disturbed i have to find a way to get to soran
an alarm goes off on worfs console
captain klingon vessel decloaking directly ahead
on the view screen the bird of prey decloaks
they are hailing
on the view screen lursa and betor appear
what an unexpected pleasure
lursa i want to talk to soran
im afraid the doctor is no longer aboard our ship
then ill beam down to his location
just give us his coordinates
the doctor values his privacy
he would be quite
upset if an away team interrupted him
ill beam to your ship and you can transport me to soran
urgent sir you cant trust them
theyll kill you just like they killed geordi
lursa and betor exchange a glance
innocent we did not kill your engineer
then return him
in exchange for what
if you let me speak to soran
the two sisters appear to consider this for a moment
to lursa the captain would make a much more valuable hostage
to picard well consider it a prisoner exchange
the transmission ends
picard heads for the turbolift
number one you have the bridge
have doctor crusher meet me in transporter room three
as picard exits
picard stands on the platform
crusher and nurse ogawa stand nearby
the transporter chief works his console
receiving the coordinates captain
picard dematerializes and at the same instant geordi materializes
beverly and ogawa rush to his aide pull out their tricorders and scan him
geordi is conscious and hes wearing his visor
a large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush
a single rock face juts upward forming a backdrop for the plateau
against the rock face a large scaffolding has been erected planks and beams forming a complex structure ladders connect each level
it leads to a narrow ledge a dozen meters above
picard materializes on the plateau
note picards combadge is gone and he is unarmed
a moment as he looks around
strange animals and birds can be heard
he turns and sees soran standing nearby calmly looking at his pocket watch
soran puts the watch away
you must think im quite the madman
the thought had crossed my mind
the only possible reason youre here is because youre not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all
so youve come to dissuade me from my horrific plan
beat good luck
soran turns his back on picard and walks away
picard takes a step to follow him and then is jolted backward by a large forcefield which briefly flashes into view
the field completely surrounds the plateau enclosing soran and the scaffolding with picard on the outside
off picards surprise
the klingon navigator is working his console
i have established the link
put it through over here
lursa and betor move to one of the consoles with a large monitor
the screen shows static for a few seconds then clears to a distorted view of a ceiling on the enterprise this is geordis pov
note the pov is slightly fritzed but free of the usual visor effects
where is he
suddenly crushers face looms large in the picture as if shes leaning over geordi
she smiles and starts talking
we can see her lips move but we cant hear what shes saying
silent dont worry theres been no permanent damage
your heart is perfectly fine
theres been a little arterial damage
lursa and betor pull back in surprise at the image
human females are so repulsive
beverly is leaning over la forge who is on a bio bed
and some myocardial degeneration
im going to give you some hematozine and i want to run more tests
but i think youre going to be fine
picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible forcefield looking for some way in
soran is concentrating on his padd as picard tries to engage him on some level
you dont need to do this soran
im sure we could find another way to get you into this nexus
soran gets up and works his control padd
suddenly a probe launcher decloaks in the middle of the plateau
the launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a small car
soran goes to the launcher steps onto it and begins working the control panel
calm distracted ive spent eighty years looking for another way captain
this is the only one
beat of course you could always come with me
you fancy yourself an explorer
heres a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced
not if it means killing over two hundred million people
beat then with meaning i wonder
did your wife leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder
this has touched a nerve in soran
something dark and ugly flickers across his face
continuing pressing on when you tucked your children into bed
do you suppose they ever suspected that their father would one day kill millions as casually as he kissed them goodnight
soran looks up at picard
and for a moment we can see that picard has really gotten to him here
then he finally smiles a smile that doesnt quite reach his eyes
geordi is taking a bath
we can see his legs and feet sticking out of the water in front of him
he stands up
lursa and betor are still watching la forges pov on the monitor
they are bored and irritable
i thought he was the chief engineer
then when is he going to engineering
the pov shows geordis view as he stops in front of a mirror
wipes away the steam and reveals his own reflection
lursa and betor gnash their teeth in frustration
soran is working intently on the launchers control panel
picard is still walking the perimeter of the forcefield
hes also still trying to engage soran find some way to get to him
what youre about to do is no different from when the borg destroyed your world
soran continues to work
keeps his voice calm and conversational
and there was a time when i wouldnt have hurt anyone
then the borg came
and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe its death
beat afterwards i began to realize that none of it mattered
were all going to die anyway
its only a question of how and when
you will too captain
you might contract a fatal disease
you might die in battle
soran now turns and fixes picard with a penetrating look
or burn to death in a fire
picard freezes at this
soran steps off the launcher with a confident look
he moves closer to where picard is standing
you looked surprised
but you shouldnt be
ive been to the nexus captain
i know things about people
beat arent you beginning to feel time gaining on you
its like a predator
its stalking you
you can try to outrun it with doctors
but in the end time is going to hunt you down
and make the kill
this strikes home with picards own recent concerns
he struggles for a moment
its one of the truths of our existence
what if i told you i found a new truth
time has no meaning there
the predator has no teeth
soran glances up at the sky expectantly then turns away from picard and goes back to work on the launcher
off picards disturbed expression
betor watching the monitor impatient
the pov shows geordis view of walking down a corridor
lursa walks over to join her
where is he now
i dont know
now he is roaming the ship
he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering
picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the forcefield
he sees something on the ground a gnarled root from a large nearby tree
the root is poking out of the ground leaving a small arch through which daylight can be seen
picards mind begins racing
he glances at soran and then picks up a pebble and while keeping his eye on the root he tosses the pebble into the air where it hits the forcefield
the forcefield flashes on briefly and picard can see that the bottom border of the field follows the contour of the root
but it does not extend underneath the arch
soran turns at the sound of the crackling field
thats a fifty gigawatt forcefield
i wouldnt want to see you get hurt
soran returns to working on the launcher
but picard looks back down at the root
then walks away planning his next move
lursa and betor are watching the monitor of geordis pov with irritated expressions
on the monitor geordi rounds a corner and enters engineering
the sisters lean forward eagerly
geordi is talking to an engineer named farrell n
s working in b
id like to run a level three diagnostic on the port plasma relays
i think one of the generators is fluctuating
okay lets do it
they both move to consoles
on the screen we can now see several of the monitors in engineering
on the left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of the enterprise
lursa suddenly reacts to something on the screen
to betor replay from time index four two nine
the image on their monitor runs backward for a moment and then freezes
on the screen we can see several of the monitors in engineering
on the left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of the enterprise
lursa touches the diagram
continuing magnify this section and enhance
the picture zooms in on the cut a way graphic and sharpens in focus
there are several blocks of numbers and text visible
lursa studies the image
their shields are operating on a modulation of two five seven point four
the sisters exchange an excited glance then move toward the command area
calls out adjust our torpedo frequency to match two five seven point four
the two sisters smile eagerly
to riker sir i am detecting an anomalous subspace reading in main engineering
it may be wham
the ship is rocked hard
alarms go off on the bridge
the klingon ship is firing four t rpedoes at the enterprise
the torpedoes pass directly through the ships shields and hit directly on the hull
shocked they have found a way to penetrate our shields
lock phasers and return fire
the enterprise fires at the bird of prey
but the phaser shots are stopped by the klingon shields which flash on when theyre hit
the bird of prey returns fire
the shot carves a jagged tear in the enterprises hull
the ship is jolted again
the con console explodes and the con officer is killed
to troi deanna take the helm
get us out of orbit
troi rushes to the con and works
the enterprise turns and leaves orbit but the klingon ship is right on top of them
firing at the defenseless starship
hull breach on decks thirty one through thirty five
the bridge lights flicker
the situation is desperate
urgent to worf worf thats an old klingon ship
what do we know about it
are there any weaknesses
the ship is jolted
they all hold on
it is a class d twelve bird of prey
they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils
is there any way we can use that to our advantage
i do not see how
the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device
there is a sudden explosion on the upper level
geordi and the other engineers rush to deal with it
get a stabilizer on that conduit
riker suddenly gets an inspiration as the bridge is to data could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak
suddenly enthusiastic yes
if we sent a low level ionic pulse it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems
onto the idea as their cloak begins to engage their shields will drop
and theyll be vulnerable for at least two seconds
to data data lock onto that plasma coil
confident no problem
data goes to work
worf prepare a spread of photon torpedoes
well have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak
were only going to get one shot at this
target their primary reactor
with any luck their warp core should implode
the enterprise rolls and turns back toward the planet tries to get away from the klingon ship
but the bird of prey follows its every move
i have accessed their coil frequency
initiating ionic pulse
the ship is hit again
an aft console explodes
make it quick
lursa and betor in command
savoring their imminent victory
to navigator target their bridge
the navigator suddenly reacts to something on his console
we are cloaking
mistress our shields are down
the ship begins shimmering engaging its cloak
lursa and betor react to the sight on the viewscreen as the spread of torpedoes heads directly for them
the two sisters exchange a look
the ship is suddenly rocked hard and we can see the beginning of an the ship implodes completely destroyed
pieces of the shattered vessel float past the camera
excited picard has made his way back to the gnarled root
he stands a few feet away
a couple of pebbles in his hand
he glances at soran whos absorbed with his work on the launcher
picard then surreptitiously tosses a pebble toward the root
it misses and bounces off the forcefield
soran looks over his shoulder at picard who sits down on a rock
soran returns to his work
picard tosses a second pebble this one also hits the forcefield
soran turns with a vaguely irritated look
as if to a child dont you have anything better to do
picard doesnt respond
soran goes back to work
picard waits a moment then takes aim and tosses another pebble toward the root
this time the pebble bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau inside the forcefield
picard keeps his expression neutral but hes found a way in
the room is a disaster
wreckage from destroyed consoles and debris are scattered throughout the room
geordi is desperately working with engineers near the warp core which is running faster and faster
to com la forge to bridge
ive got a problem down here
the magnetic interlocks have been ruptured
i need to get the the warp core starts to spew white hot gas
continuing coolant leak
the emergency isolation door comes down and people start rushing out of engineering
geordi heads for the corridor
on the move to com bridge weve got a new problem
were about five minutes from a warp core breach
theres nothing i can do
riker is faced with a no win situation
he makes the decision
to troi deanna evacuate everyone into the saucer section
to data mister data prepare to separate the ship
troi and data work and riker moves to the captains chair
he presses a button on the armchair console
a unique and urgent alarm is heard throughout the ship
series of shots as the alarm sounds rushing through the corridors
directing people toward the correct doorways
grabbing their children and heading down the corridor
they grab a wounded crewmember and pull him down the corridor
scrambling through jefferies tubes and closing hatches behind them
soran is finishing his work on the launcher
on one of the monitors on the control panel we can now see alien graphics and numbers ticking by obviously a countdown in progress
soran finishes and turns off the control panel
he steps down and looks over at picard who is standing near the forcefield
now if youll excuse me captain i have an appointment with eternity and i dont want to be late
soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face
picard watches him intently for a few moments
then quickly springs into action
people scramble through the tube and out into a corridor
geordi is the last man through the hatch
he turns and manually shuts the hatch behind him
hits combadge thats it bridge were all out
one minute to warp core breach
to data begin separation sequence
to troi full impulse power once were clear
looking forward from behind the rear of the massive ship
a crack appears as the separation process begins
everyone is watching the viewscreen with anticipation
ten seconds to warp core breach
engaging impulse engines
moves away from the battle section
before it can completely escape the battle section explodes the force of the explosion hits the saucer section knocking it toward the planet
everyone is knocked to their knees
helm controls are off line
they all look at the viewscreen
the planet is rushing toward them
as he reacts to the terrifying image
picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back hes trying to wriggle underneath the root
its not easy
he knows theres not much room between the ground and the invisible field
he just gets his head and shoulders underneath when he accidentally touches the field and it crackles violently around him picard is jolted by the shock
turns at the sound of the field sees picard and then draws his weapon
soran quickly fires at picard
is blasted apart creating a cloud of dirt and smoke obscuring picard and the whole area momentarily
soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding his disruptor still in his hand ready just in case picard somehow survived
soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris
the dust from the explosion finally clears
but picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling
glances up at the sky and sees the distant energy ribbon just coming into view
theres no time to look for picard
soran begins to climb the scaffolding
plummets into the planets atmosphere
the ship is shaking and rolling violently
everyone hanging on for dear life
teachers and parents lead a group of children toward an intersection
the parents go down one corridor the teachers and children down another
one child cries out and tries to reach for its mother but theres no time a teacher keeps the child moving down the hall
people are bracing themselves for the crash taking emergency positions against walls etc
the ground is getting closer on the viewscreen
off console i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters
im attempting to level our descent
to com all hands brace for impact
the leading edge of the huge saucer tilts upward slightly
and then it hits the surface
the saucer begins to plow through the dense rain forest as the ship continues to tear through the jungle we intercut the following sequences
riker and the others hanging on as the ship shakes violently
a family huddles for protection as the windows are blown inward by debris
the side window is blown out
and picards photo album is tossed across the room along with everything else
outside the ship we see a huge wall of metal crashing through the jungle uprooting trees
birds scrambling out of the way
an enormous scene of destruction as it tears through the foliage
the ship continues to jump and shake
every light on the ship goes out in the crash
finally it comes to a stop
there is a long quiet beat
then people begin to stir in the darkened room
who is slumped in his chair
he catches his breath lifts his face and looks up into
he shields his eyes and looks up at the ceiling and reacts
the sun is shining in through the shattered overhead window on the top of the bridge
there is a fluttering sound as a couple of birds perch on the rim of the window
the saucer has come to a stop in the middle of a rain forest
the passage of the saucer has gouged a long trail through the forest behind the ship
off this startling sight
soran is climbing up the scaffolding
he gets a couple of levels up and then suddenly a boot kicks him in the face
picard has made it inside the field
a quick fight ensues during which picard is knocked a few levels down on the scaffolding
he lands hard happens to look up into the sky
he sees something
the energy ribbon can be seen in the distant sky a bizarre snake of color streaking across the deep blue sky
time is almost up
picard avoids a vicious kick from soran glances down at the probe launcher and realizes hes got one chance
he rolls to his feet runs toward the probe launcher
there is a thunderous roar as the launcher fires the probe into the sky
the plateau is suddenly quiet as the probe streaks toward the distant sun and disappears from view
picard gets to his knees stares after the probe shocked
they watch the sun for a silent moment waiting
begins to darken and collapse as seen before
the scene darkens as the sun goes out
and night falls on the planet
soran a look of profound elation on his face makes his way to the top of the scaffolding and looks into the sky
gets to his feet and stares at the onrushing ribbon the wind whipping up on the plateau
he backs away at the sight coming to a stop with his back against the scaffolding
theres no where to run
as the ribbon of energy tears across the scene in a washed out by a blinding flood of red light
then suddenly the ribbon is gone
and so are picard and soran
the plateau is strangely and utterly silent after the passage of the ribbon
even the birds have stopped chirping in the trees
as the energy ribbon rushes past the camera a huge shockwave from the destroyed star hits the planet and it explodes in a blast of fiery debris
being led through a darkened hallway
he is wearing a blindfold
off screen hands tug and pull at him leading him forward down the hall
hes lost and confused unsure where he is or whats going on
he tries to resist but cant
the hands keep pulling at him
he is finally brought out into a larger room dark
the hands release him and he stands alone
he takes a beat and tries to take control of the situation
whats going on
where am i
two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove the blindfold
the blindfold drops revealing a blurry kaleidoscope of colors and shapes
as he blinks and tries to focus
as the room comes into focus
the first thing we see is an enormous gaily decorated christmas tree sparkling with hundreds of lights
a th century french living room
it is beautifully decorated with lights ornaments holly
brightly wrapped presents are clustered beneath the christmas tree
there are five children standing and sitting in the room all looking at picard with bright smiling faces waiting for him to say something
picard stares at the scene for a moment unsure how to react
then we hear the womans voice again and we move to reveal an attractive woman in her forties standing next to picard
picard is stunned
dont know what to say
one of the children a young girl speaks up
say merry christmas papa
in a daze merry
the children break out into applause
the woman kisses him on the cheek then steers him to a large overstuffed chair
picard sits down and the children starts handing out presents with much laughter and chatting
this ones for you
i hope this is the book i asked for
take this one to papa
as the activity swirls around him picard begins to feel an immense sense of satisfaction and happiness
its like a drug an overwhelming feeling of joy and contentment fills picard
its a wondrous experience
he settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across his face
for reasons he cannot name and does not even want to understand at the moment he is very very happy
to picard isnt the tree beautiful papa
picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in the world
yes its astonishingly beautiful
all of it
all of the children now crowd around the chair with a single large gift and hand it to picard
one of the younger boys speaks up
this is from all of us
i cant imagine what it is
picard tears open the box and pulls out a th century sextant an old fashioned nautical navigational instrument
its a beautiful piece with polished and gleaming brass
excited its a sack tent
picard eyes it with delight
you mean a sextant
and its a handsome one at that
from about eighteen twenty id say
wherever did you find it
its a secret
smiles oh a secret
well that makes it a doubly special gift
thank you all
the children react with pleasure
they cluster around him showering him with hugs and kisses
merry christmas papa
i love you father
picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection
the children pull back and return to their own presents
there is a swirl of activity and commotion as a warm and heartfelt christmas morning is played out
to picard ill go get dinner ready
theyll be starving in a minute
picard nods as the woman exits the room
he looks around the scene utterly happy utterly content
the children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as picards eye falls on the glorious christmas tree
he cant help but smile as he looks over the ornaments and decorations
of the sparkling lights and ornaments a swirl of color and light
his eye is caught by something in particular on the tree
he leans forward slightly and stares at it
his eye has been caught by an ornament near the top of the tree
it is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny light at the center in the shape of a star
as picard watches the star suddenly goes out
and it radiates a shimmering light effect that expands outward into the glass sphere
its a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out as seen earlier in the movie
but this is just coincidence
this is the way the ornament was designed and its simply one of many ornaments on the tree
the image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere
it has reminded him of something hed nearly forgotten a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene
he frowns the reverie momentarily disrupted
but he tries to push it aside not wanting the spell to be broken
he stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window its snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment
then he reacts to something
reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament its still blinking
picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away
he cant hide from it
this isnt right
this cant be real
its as real as you want it to be
picard turns to see standing before him
she is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the enterprise b
as they talk the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if picard and guinan arent there
picard is stunned
whats going on
where am i
youre in the nexus
picard looks around
is the nexus
this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
enjoy them jean luc
picard tries to make sense of it he focuses on guinan
guinan what are you doing here
i thought you were on the enterprise
i am on the enterprise
i am also here
off his puzzled look think of me as
an echo of the person you know
a part of her she left behind
when the enterprise b beamed us off the lakul we were partially in the nexus
the transporters locked on to us
but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind
all of us
where is he now
wherever he wanted to be
guinan smiles at him
papa help me build my castle
picard glances over at the boy who is building a play castle out of the th century equivalent of lego
for a moment picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy
to boy in a few minutes
picard looks around at the children
the lure to stay here becoming more powerful
continuing awed to guinan these are my children
theyre great arent they
you can go back and see them born
go forward and see your grandchildren
time has no meaning here
theres a general rush toward the adjacent dining room
the youngest boy looks at picard goes over to him and takes his hand
are you coming
picard looks down into the face of his child
his heart swells the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound
almost in a trance he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room
his eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment
torn between the two images
and then in one of the most difficult moments of his life he bends down to the child
go on without me
the boy looks at him quizzically for a moment then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others
picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice
can i leave the nexus
why would you want to leave
insistent can i
where would you go
i dont understand
i told you time has no meaning here
if you leave you can go anywhere
picard realizes the opportunity before him
i know exactly where i want to go
back to that mountaintop on veridian three
before soran put out the star
i have to stop him
what makes you think things will be any different this time
ill need help
beat guinan will you come back with me
together we could i cant leave
im already there remember
picard looks crestfallen for a moment
guinan gives him an enigmatic smile
i know just the guy
suddenly theres the cry of a hawk from offscreen
picard turns at the sound picard finds himself standing outside a rustic but architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the canadian rockies
a hawk is circling overhead making the crying sound that picard heard
the air is cold frigid picard can see his breath
picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being chopped from around the corner of the house
picard moves to look around the corner and sees james t
hes still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the enterprise b at the beginning of the film
he is vigorously chopping wood with an axe
hes enjoying himself lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor
hes never felt this good in his life
theres no trace of back pain or any other ailment
picard recognizes the famous captain as would any century starfleet officer
kirk pauses looks up at the strange man before him
his expression is wondrous almost child like
like in picards christmas sequence kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the nexus
its like a dream thats over powered him
beautiful day isnt it
yes it is
kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile
do you mind
it takes picard a beat before he realizes that kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him
picard places the log on the block and kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe
captain do you realize what but kirk interrupts as he sees something o
wait a second
i think somethings burning
picard follows his look to see smoke billowing out of one of the windows of the house
kirk rushes into the house and picard follows
kirk rushes in
the kitchens decor is th century with a few rd century touches copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and starfleet paraphernalia
picard hesitates in the doorway a little unsure about rushing into some strangers house
kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove
its very hot he quickly sets it down near the sink waves the smoke away with his hand
looks like someone was cooking eggs
to picard come on in its all right
this is my house or at least it used to be i sold it years ago
picard comes in and tries to orient kirk to whats going on
im captain jean luc picard of the starship enterprise
before kirk can react to this remark an antique clock on a shelf chimes as it strikes the hour
kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder he is entranced by this experience beginning to connect with things and memories from his past
i gave this clock to bones
pressing on im from what you would consider the future
the twenty fourth century
kirk hears what picard is saying but like picard in his fantasy he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him
a dog barks from o
they both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets kirk with enthusiasm
jake you miserable old mutt
how can you be here
to picard hes been dead seven years
kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a womans voice from somewhere upstairs that stops kirk in his tracks
as she speaks we can see the shock on kirks face
come on jim im starving
how long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen
amazed thats antonia
kirk looks at the food on the stove
hes beginning to realize something
wait a minute
kirk glances at picard
what are you talking about
this is the past
kirk moves to a drawer and opens it
inside is a horseshoe with a tiny red bow tied to it
this confirms things for kirk
he picks up the horseshoe
this is nine years ago
the day i told her i was going back to starfleet
kirk is swept up in the moment overwhelmed by memories sensations feelings
he goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition
these were ktarian eggs her favorite
i was cooking them to soften the blow
re horseshoe and i gave her this
picard steps in
i know how real this must seem to you but its not
this isnt really your house
weve both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus
but kirks mind is clearly elsewhere
hes being swept away by the emotion of the moment
realizing the opportunity he suddenly has
kirk indicates a shelf as if asking picard to go to it
theres a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left right behind the nutmeg
kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs
he cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast
picard waits for a moment then goes to the shelf grabs the dill weed and hands it to kirk
how long have you been here
kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs
i dont know
i was on the enterprise b
in the deflector control room
keep stirring these will you
kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray
picard is getting a little impatient but stirs the eggs anyway
continuing the bulkhead in front of me disappeared
then i was out there chopping wood
back to stove thanks
kirk takes the pan of eggs back from picard
history records that you died saving the enterprise b from an energy ribbon eighty years ago
but picards words mean almost nothing to kirk
he is thoroughly enjoying himself and picard is almost a distraction
kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray
amused so youre telling me this is the twenty fourth century
and im dead
as i said this is some kind of
yeah i heard you
frowns at tray somethings missing
then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster as if on cue two slices of toast pop out
kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates
kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door
captain i need your help
i want you to leave the nexus with me
kirk goes out of the kitchen and picard follows
kirk and picard both on the move
kirk heading for a staircase
we have to go back to a planet called veridian iii and stop a man from destroying a star
there are millions of lives at stake
kirk tries to keep it light hoping this man will go away
you said history considers me dead
who am i to argue with history
youre a starfleet officer and you have a duty to hard i dont need to be lectured by you
i was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers
and frankly i think the galaxy owes me one beat i was like you once
so worried about duty and obligations that i couldnt see anything past this uniform
and in the end what did it get me
not this time
kirk brushes past picard and stops at the foot of the stairs
looking up the stairs im going to walk up these stairs march into that bedroom and tell antonia that i want to marry her
kirk begins to climb the stairs
this time things are going to be different
he goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him
picard glances around the room in frustration then gets a determined look on his face and marches up the stairs after kirk grasps the doorknob opens it and steps through
the door into picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn
straw on the floor
farm implements on the walls
sunlight streaming in through the slats
there are stalls in the barn with a few horses visible
kirk is standing a short distance away he looks surprised as well
and he is no longer holding the tray of food
re barn this doesnt look like your bedroom
kirk looks around for a moment the pieces starting to fall into place
he smiles with a growing realization
no its not
this is my uncles barn in iowa
he points to a horse with a saddle on it
re horse i took that horse out for a ride seven years ago
on a spring day
kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring day
just like this
if im right this is the day i met antonia
he turns to picard
this nexus of yours is very clever
i can start all over again do things right from day one
kirk grabs the horse swings up onto the saddle and rides out of the barn filled with excitement
picard watches him for a moment then looks at one of the other horses in the barn
he makes a decision and then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall
kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside and across a stream
through a thicket of trees
and finally out onto a rolling plain
there is a large ravine up ahead
kirk sees it and smiles tightly
he spurs his horse faster toward the ravine
the horse is tearing along
comes up to the edge of the precipice and makes a daring leap to the other side
horse and rider land together and kirk spurs the horse on
but as he rides we begin to see a change come over him a look of doubt crosses his face
somethings not right
he slows the horse to a trot
and then to a complete stop
he sits there for a moment and frowns
turns and looks back at the ravine which is now a fair distance away
something about that jump is nagging at him
he turns his horse around and then digs in his heels
the horse breaks into a gallop racing back toward the ravine
kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the horse makes the leap across yet again
this time when kirk lands he brings his horse to an immediate stop
we can see on his face that something is very wrong
he turns and stares at the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face
in the distance picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own
he stops next to kirk
there is a long quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side
kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings
re ravine i must have made this jump fifty times
and every time it scared the hell out of me
but not this time
its not real
a quiet beat
kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance shading his eyes against the bright sun
picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a woman walking her horse
re woman antonia
nods shes not real either is she
nothing here is
nothing here matters
all euphoria is now gone from kirk its a moment of self revelation
he glances around
its kinda like
exciting for a few minutes
but in the end you havent really done anything
you havent made a difference
kirk takes a beat then looks at picard
and in a way hes truly seeing him for the first time
captain of the enterprise huh
close to retirement
i hadnt planned on it
there is a passion and a fervor in kirk that we havent seen until now
well let me tell you something dont
dont let them promote you
dont let them transfer you
dont let anything take you off the bridge of that ship
beat because while youre there you can make a difference
the two captains face each other for a moment
picard hears what kirk is saying but also knows thats not the whole story
picard gives him a direct look and there is something in picards eyes a glint of resolve and determination
you dont need to be on the bridge of a starship
come with me
help me stop soran
beat make a difference again
a long silent beat as kirk considers picard
and slowly unexpectedly a smile spreads across his face
how can i argue with the captain of the enterprise
a beat what was the name of that planet
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim
you could say that
musing of course if spock were here hed say i was being an irrational illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that
and for the first time we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us jim kirk is back
sounds like fun
the two men turn and walk away from antonia
and as they walk a roar of color and sound washes out the screen as seen before
soran is standing in front of the forcefield facing picard
now if youll excuse me captain i have an appointment with eternity and i dont want to be late
we realize we are watching the same events play out again
soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face
picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield
picard accidentally touches the field
turns at the sound of the field sees picard and then draws his weapon
soran quickly fires at picard
is blasted apart creating a cloud of dirt and debris obscuring picard and the whole area momentarily
soran jumps down one level his disruptor still in his hand ready just in case picard somehow survived
soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris
the dust clears
but picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling
soran glances up at the sky and sees the energy ribbon then begins to climb the scaffolding
suddenly a boot kicks him in the head
who is attacking soran in picards place
the two men begin to fight
as picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher
the following happens very quickly kirk fights with soran hand to hand brutal
picard works the control panel trying to make sense of it all
it wont respond
the control panel is bizarre and confusing many different screens and alien graphics
the alien countdown graphics continues to race by
the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer
soran tries to pull his disruptor but kirk knocks it to the ground
theres a struggle for the weapon
picard looks helplessly at the control panel
nothing he does has any effect
he keeps hitting buttons
looking for other control panels anything to affect the launcher
suddenly picard touches one particular control and the screen changes to an image of the veridian sun held in the center of the alien cross hair
begins working the control panel
he looks at the screen
hits a control
suddenly the probe cloaks
picard reacts at his mistake
picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air a bizarre sight
picard isnt sure what to do he can feel the console but he cant see any of the controls
kirk punches soran and sends him flying backward
soran lands heavily on the ground unconscious
kirk stands over him breathing heavily
he holds his back in pain that old back pain from the beginning of the movie
desperate kirk theres a control padd in his right pocket
sees picard standing in mid air and then reaches down pulls the control padd out of sorans pocket
he begins working it
his eyes open
he sees what kirk is doing
looks around quickly
sees the disruptor lying a few feet away just beyond his reach
picard goes back to working on the controls
the twenty fourth century isnt so tough
without warning kirk is blasted forward shot from behind
reveal soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand
he gets up whirls around points the weapon at picard
the probe is suddenly launched in a roar of flame
his eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky
the two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun
makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet
soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle
we hear a muffled explosion
cant believe his dreams have been shattered
he looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead
the disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding
moves to kirk checks his pulse
the captains eyes flutter hes still holding on but hes badly wounded
is standing on the rock ledge
he reaches up toward the sky as if trying to grab the ribbon with his bare hands
but the ribbon passes by and disappears
his look of shock turns to fury and madness
he turns to picard
he jumps down a few levels and then dives off the scaffolding at picard
but picard is quicker
he grabs the disruptor and fires the blast catches soran drops to the ground a short distance away
the pocket watch has been shattered
turns back to kirk cradles the dying mans head in his lap
kirks eyes flick open and he takes a ragged breath
his eyes flutter
hes fading fast
ill find a way to contact the enterprise
youre going to be all right
did we do it
did we make a difference
beat thank you
least i could do
for a captain of the enterprise
kirk coughs again try to hang on
kirk looks up at the sky
the sunlight is warm on his face
a quiet moment
then with a last smile on his face it was fun
hold te scene for a long moment the two men in the quiet clearing
close on picards hand as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones
move to reveal that picard is placing the final few rocks on kirks grave
he reaches into a pocket and pulls out kirks command insignia pin
he carefully places it on the grave
and stands there silently for a few moments
a distant whine of engines can be heard
picard looks up into the sky
an enterprise shuttlecraft is flying through the sky toward the mountaintop
the shuttle has just landed and the door opens as picard enters the clearing
worf geordi and n
security guards jump out to meet him
captain are you all right
what about doctor soran
you neednt worry about the doctor anymore
picard moves toward the shuttle
then stops as he notices that the shuttle is damaged
picard turns and notices for the first time that la forge has a bandage on his face and worfs uniform is torn
was there a problem with the klingons
worf and la forge exchange a look
you could say that
as seen before
captains log stardate
the starship farragut has arrived in orbit and has begun to beam up the enterprise survivors for transport back to earth
a hive of activity crewmembers moving about carrying personal effects equipment etc
some wounded people being carried on stretchers
the corridor is lit by emergency beacons and a hatch has been opened at one end of the corridor leading to the exterior of the ship
daylight and jungle can be seen outside
continuing our casualties were light
but unfortunately the enterprise herself cannot be salvaged
move along the corridor in find beverly helping an injured crewmember into the arms of a waiting medical n
ogawa walks up to her that should be the last of the wounded doctor
she looks exhausted
two hundred thirty two patients in under two days
two medical n
s walk past carrying an empty stretcher
beverly glances at them
calls out save that stretcher
is there another patient
no that ones for me
data and troi are looking through rubble in a different section of the ship with tricorders
troi reacts to something on the tricorder
over here data
i think ive found something
data moves to her with a hopeful and excited look
off tricorder one life sign very faint
data hands his tricorder to troi and then begins to pull debris aside with android strength
as data pulls aside a large piece of plating revealing spot the cat sitting in the wreckage
she looks at data and gives a plaintive meow
he picks up the cat and holds it close stroking its fur
the cat purrs happily
i am very happy to find you spot
another family reunited
data turns revealing that there are tears in his eyes
troi is surprised and touched at the sight
are you all right
i am not sure counselor
i am happy to see spot
and yet i am crying
my emotional program must be malfunctioning again
troi puts a gentle hand on him
i think its working perfectly
data looks up at her and smiles through his tears
off the image of data cuddling his cat
picard and riker are sifting through the rubble of what once was the ready room looking for something
riker sees something in the rubble
is this it
riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier
relieved yes number one
he takes the album
brushes off the dust and flips through the pages for a moment
riker looks around the wrecked room
im going to miss this ship
she went before her time
picard has been rejuvenated by his experience
given a new perspective on the issues of life and death
its not how many years youve lived wil
but how youve lived them
beat someone once told me that time is a predator that stalks us all our lives
but maybe time is also a companion who goes with us on our journey and reminds us to cherish the moments of our lives
because they will never come again
beat we are after all
a quiet moment
riker finally smiles
speak for yourself sir
i kinda planned on living forever
picard smiles back at him and the two men exit to
riker and picard enter from the ready room
they look around the wrecked bridge for a moment
riker glances at the captains chair
i always thought id have a crack at this chair one day
you may still
somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise
a beat then picard hits his combadge
continuing to com picard to farragut
two to beam up
the two men dematerialize
