written by shane black bang bang bang down you go its just a job i do genesis just a job to do you wanna be a detective
heres what you do take a trusted friend and imagine the worst thing the most despicable thing the thing it would never even cross their minds to do
then assume theyve already done it twice
hallenbeck private investigator when you consider that a career in pro foot ball means maybe ten years after which you got no legs left and during which youre a painkiller
drug addict a million a year sounds about right
so when people bitch at me about the money i made i have a pat response go fuck yourself
james alexander dix former quarterback l
stallions the only light that of a flickering tv screen
a big man lies shirtless on the bed
watching a sports program
we hear on tv eliminating the draft
worst thing ever happened to pro football
already you got eric dickerson no teams good enough for him
you got dion sanders this guy bosworth bunch of peacocks
nagurski i saw him play for bucks a game
and he woulda played for free you get me
he loved the game
forget about it
the telephone shrills in the stillness
the man on the bed answers it
do you know who this is
kid from ohio is looking real good billie
the mans hand unclenches
a container of pills spills over the blanket
he stammers im
try real hard
what youre gonna do is rush for yards against chicago
and you will
this is a business billy
you dont make one fifty youre history the kid steps in
no more job
and no more pills billy
just give me time
one hundred and fifty yards
the phone clicks off
nfl running back billy cole stares straight ahead mouth working spastically
over chicago illinois as the camera spirals down toward a teeming football stadium
we hear crowd noise and marching band music deafeningly loud as we superimpose the legend the broadcast team huddles inside the quilted jackets squinting through the snow
speaking into headset mikes
good afternoon and welcome to soldier field chicago site of todays confrontation between the l
stallions and the chicago bears
this is vern lindquist with terry bradshaw and yes my friends it is that cold
billy cole sits alone in front of his locker
face bathed in sweat
he takes a bottle of pills from the locker
hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we
a deafening crunch as a defensive back hammers a wide receiver nearly decapitates him
the ball rolls free
the back recovers it
big ray walton puts a devastating hit on bricmont so chicago turns over the ball with a minute and forty seconds left
the injured player goes by on a stretcher moaning
cheerleaders jump and frolic
gets up off the bench
the rest of the offensive unit sprints onto the field
straight ahead eyes front
like a robot
his heartbeat thuds on the soundtrack
and so l
has a chance to ice the game no pun intended
and you gotta be thinking give the ball to billy cole
he has had an outstanding day racking up yards against a tough defense
the huddle breaks
team trudges through the snow to the line of scrimmage
cole adopts a three point stance
everything happens in hyper real slow motion the snow falls
the receivers breeze past in motion to begin their patterns
moving like gazelles
coles fingers paw the cold earth
he is like a spring
coiled and ready
the ball is snapped
turf and snow
a firecracker series of pops as linemen collide
the ball floats through the snowy air
pitch out to cole
he takes it on the run
tucks it under his arm
behind him the quarterback bites the dust leveled
cole turns the corner
picks up a blocker
up ahead the free safety barrels toward him
low and hard
cole does not blink
he reaches beneath his jersey
pulls out a gun
pumps three shots into the free safetys head
the bullets go straight through
on the back of his helmet
a mixture of blood and fiberglass
cole keeps going jogging for the end zone
around him sound
another defensive back
reacts with almost comical terror
dives to one side
blows out the guys knee
ends a career
we are now in full scale panic
the players are fleeing the field
a few brave men gather around the fallen players
are on the field now
running full out
theyve got riot guns cocked and locked
sprinting through the snow
cole crosses the goal line
drops the ball
turns facing the cops
his eyes are insane
the crowd is screaming
people are running back and forth like extras in the keystone cops
the first two blasts from the cops riot guns go high and wide
one shot blows apart the base of the goalpost
the forty foot high monument pitches over collapsing like a wounded giant
lands in a shower of snow and ice
cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him
he smiles and says
im going to disneyland
puts the gun to his helmet
we superimpose the legend good morning mr
america and all the ships at sea
welcome to another lackluster morning in southern california
palm trees limp
degrees at am
camera cranes down past a huge rotting billboard
on the billboard a girl in tight jeans
grabbing her own butt
a surprised look on her face
yes honey thats your butt
move in on a tiny weather beaten bungalow
in the shadow of the freeway
a shingle hangs from a wrought iron post joseph r
hallenbeck confidential on the lawn a late model plymouth
the sprinkers come to life
fling water across the car
inside the car a lone man is asleep arms akimbo
sprawled across the seat
half empty bottle of seagrams v
radio on playing tinny jazz music
picture the tiredest meanest grouchiest son of a bitch self hating loser you can
now give him a two year old suit from c r clothing
such is the aforementioned hallenbeck
three neighborhood kids have gathered around the car
enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk
one tosses a baseball from hand to hand
one picks his nose
shit we should do something to him
kid continues mining for nose eggs
it looks like his entire fist is up there
pause then i know where theres a dead squirrel
with a tail sticking out
the youngest kid holds it aloft reverently
looks in the open car window at hallenbeck
dead to the world
they heave the squirrel into the car and run away
the sprinkler goes round
the mashed squirrel perches on his chest
a shadow falls across him as return scratching their heads
staring in at him
take his bottle
kid smiles nervously
reaches in with infinite patience
trembling hand inches closer and closer and closes on the bottle as without warning
sits bolt upright and grabs the kid and stuffs a
revolver in the kids face and cocks it
the kid of course shrieks
and the light of sanity dawns in hallenbecks eyes
he sucks in a deep breath
releases the struggling kid
swears under his breath
watches the boys flee in terror
notices a dead squirrel in his lap
heaves it out the window
pumps a camel into his mouth
rescues the bottle of seagrams
thus begins his morning
he opens the car door
the sprinkler douses him
he gets out
stands on the lawn
one of the kids the toughest one is standing on the sidewalk
im not scared
youre on my property kid
sidewalk belongs to the government
hallenbeck stares at him
he leans over and vomits on the lawn
one hand gripping the car fender
the sprinkler goes round and round
a redwood beach house mellow in the morning sun
there was a party here last night
balloons and streamers
tawdry in the light of day
a plush bedroom
sun streams in the window
a young man sits straddling a backwards chair
bare foot bare chested
blond hair perfect tan
he is nursing a beer
smoking and staring at where a tawny golden girl lies serene and innocent
like a sleeping kitten
rumpled sheets one breast exposed
no tan line
the man takes a drag off the cigarette studies the sleeping girl
meet jimmy dix
twenty seven years old former national league heartthrob
he shakes his head and mutters jesus kid if only you werent so damn ugly
he gets up and goes into the head
pulls out a glass vial
dips a coke spoon with practiced ease
sucks it up a nostril
for one moment he catches his own eye in the mirror
seventy thousand people screaming
jimmy in the middle
its a night game at the coliseum
hes the quarterback
jimmy fakes the draw
around him all is impact
sound and fury
he targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket
sixty yard toss hits the guy between the numbers
covered with dirt and mud
young and proud
seventy thousand voices tell him hes alive
he makes a difference
alone in the bathroom
leaning on the counter
a voice calls softly from the bedroom jimmy are you still here
pause then i dont know
he looks up at his reflection
glazed eyes beard stubble
crows feet around the eyes
i guess i am
he sniffs clearing his nose
hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in
sprawl of furniture
stack after stack of sports magazines
drop all your belongings out of a plane
they will land like this
he flicks on the light
crosses to the couch and flops down
plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table
next to the bottle we see side by side
in one younger hallenbeck is kissing younger bride
in the other the president of the united states presents hallenbeck with a medal
they are both smiling beneath the presidential seal
hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin
the phone rings
chain lights another smoke stubs out his old one
chins the receiver and says hallenbeck investigations
hey joe mike miller over at swerdlow
you got a minute
jeez you sound fucking terrific
whatd you do last night
sat in the car
looked at the sky
i killed a squirrel and dont even remember

she goes onstage at seven
its two hundred bucks joe
sighs gimmee the address
and joe big favor okay
fix yourself up if you can manage it
look the part
not like the last time okay
hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the tv
his face is ashen grey
hollow eye sockets
gimmee the address
hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare
his tie is crooked
his cuffs are too short
he looks like a grouchy bear
he looks up at the girl on the billboard
gorgeous does not respond coy
hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his plymouth
keys the ignition
phil woods saxophone fills the air
he looks at himself in the mirror
softly nobody likes you
everybody hates you
youre an asshole and youre stupid
youre gonna lose
pause smile you fuck
he stretches his mouth into a grimace
pulls out into the street
off he goes
jimmy dix leaves the bedroom
pads barefoot down a hall littered with beer cans food wrappers
a sleeping guy
stops at a door peeks in all night poker game in progress
four bleary eyed men
stack of wrinkled money on a card table
they all grunt
one of them name of henry looks up at him
holds out a half smoked doobie hey jimmy
you want some of this
why do you think they call it dope
beat henry did i do anything last night that i should know about
you puked a couple times
pointed at some ladys tits
chased a dog for a half an hour
fucked a congressmans daughter shit on someones car
no man i meant something bad that i should know about
frowns my ass hurts i think i had gay sex last night
i dont remember
when are you gonna come look at my gun collection
one of the other players looks up says are you jimmy dix
played for the stallions
and that was me
hell i think the league gave you a raw deal
what the hell shit floats
ill be back
i hope so
ill be back
everyone plays cards
no one looks at him
jimmy is seated in the devastated living room
putting on shoes
he hears a commotion outside a woman scream ing
he frowns puzzled
pads out onto a redwood deck
a six foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck
he is dunking a terrified female head under the water and laughing
jimmy clears his throat
the man looks up annoyed
what the fuck you want jimmy
whats with the girl
she surfaces sputtering and screaming
ray thrusts her beneath the surface again
bitch wont blow me
pause then too early in the morning ray
let her go
shes not coming up till she starts blowing
jimmy swallows hard
let her go
fuck you loser
what are you doing at a league party asshole
you and ol dex manley should get together swap stories about gettin booted
jimmy controls himself with an effort
ray shes gonna drown
not if she blows me
jimmys eyes are smoldering
he steps to the right
casually scoops up a football lying on the deck
last chance ray
jimmy turns as if to walk away
instead he spins back and launches the football
it sings thats how hard he throws it
and when it smacks ray in the face something breaks
it aint the ball
the big man howls
clutching his flattened nose
the girl comes up for air
gagging and choking
jimmy is at her side instantly
pulls her out of the water
get out of here
he leans over and grabs ray by the hair
the guy is bleeding
jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart
best arm in the national league you son of a bitch
he lets go
ray sags semi conscious
the poker players come running as jimmy walks back inside
jimmy gets into the car
takes out his vial
spoons some powder sucks it up
a voice in the background hey someone shit on my car
joe hallenbeck slides his plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling
gets out crosses the lawn
a fat neighbor is watering shrubs next door
morning joe hows it going
my ears are burning andy
even as we speak someone somewhere is calling me an asshole
im playing tahoe on the th
hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room
a woman forty ish once beautiful appears in the bedroom doorway
wearing a terry cloth robe
this is joes wife i thought you were in las vegas
where did you sleep
he brushes past her and crosses to the bed
on the pillow a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly
hey furry tom
he sits on the bed
lights a cigarette
opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his
starts to load the gun
how much did you lose
i wasnt there to gamble
i was doing a skip trace
how much did you lose
he suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand
a crayon sketch
he picks it up frowns whats this
darians class drew holiday pictures
that was hers
her teacher wants to see us joe
its a picture of santa claus except this santa has long stringy hair bloodshot eyes and grotesque talons
a little girls severed head is clutched in one hand
underneath in block capitals is written satan claus
kids got some talent dont you think
her voice is ice cold
joe turns and regards her levelly
you okay sarah
i couldnt get to sleep last night
well i think the kid will be fine
boys still tease her about the headgear
are you kidding
brace face thats the latest
under his breath shell be fucking them by the time shes fourteen
watch your goddamn mouth joe
well christ you let her wear enough makeup
the kid looks like a goddamn raccoon
she comes in late at night i think christ a burglar
i almost shot her twice
youre not funny
all the girls at that school wear makeup
yeah but they dont apply it with a paint sprayer
and for your information our neighbors think im very funny
go live with them
dont tempt me
he tosses the holstered
on the bed
stalks into the bathroom
he sighs tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet
walks back out into the bedroom
he kneels looks under the bed
straightens and says very conversationally whos the guy in the closet
sarah stops dead
spins and stares at him
frowns oh thats right you sometimes forget that im a detective
lights a cigarette see first i noticed how tense you were but i let that pass
then i noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there but meanwhile your hair is completely dry you follow
why the steamy shower
because someone else was in there right and since hes not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door
a day early
please no applause
a silence hangs between them
sarah just stares
shakes her head
well nothing changes
youre still a lunatic
im sorry honey i dont enjoy being observant but someones gotta do it
beat whats his name
i have to get dressed
its okay ive seen you naked
so apparently has someone else
whats his name
you want me to open the closet joe
you want me to indulge your fucking paranoia ill throw the door open is that what you want me to do
is this a trick question
ill do it joe
and then well both know youre a psycho is that what you want
an awkward pause
finally hallenbeck scowls and says no
we wont open the door
door stays shut
instead what im gonna do is
he scoops up the im gonna count to three and then im gonna put a bullet in there and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth
if you shoot up my house joe i will make you eat that gun
the truth is a beautiful thing
he cocks the hammer
arm extended hand rock steady
call your shrink joe
i still have the number
call him and tell him youre losing it i cannot fucking deal with you like this
starts to pull the trigger
and sarah screams jesus no
and grabs the gun
she looks at him
he looks at her
swings slowly open then
and out steps a man in a bathrobe
hair still soaking wet
none other than mike miller joes early morning phone call
we know this because joe says
keeping her warm for me
the gun barrel does not waver
not an inch
dont do nothing dumb
how as she mike
on your finger scale how was my wife
it just happened joe
it just happened
you call me from here this morning
she said you were in vegas
i was gonna leave a message on the machine
when you found out i was back
why didnt you split
she said relax he never stops home once hes in the office

stares at him you knew
so how about it mike
on a scale of one to ten
how was she
joe come on how long we been friends huh
id say roughly until you put your dick in my wife
you gotta understand i know i know it just happened
it was an accident
you said whoops and accidentally fucked my wife
im sorry just isnt my week

beat i dont gotta understand anything
sarah speaks then
put the gun down
oh right the gun
sighs youre right sarah im acting nuts
he pulls the trigger
the shot is deafening in the closed room
mike miller screams and clutches at himself
the bullet goes high and wide
over his head
on the wall is a framed wedding photo
the twin of the one in hallenbecks office
the bullet strikes it dead center
blows it to pieces
the tinkle of glass hitting the floor
regards his wife with hooded lifeless eyes
where was darian
she stayed at cindys last night
turns and waves the gun at miller
lets take a walk buddy
the two men come out the back door and cut through the hedge
millers car a pontiac sunbird is parked at the curb
hallenbeck stops in the middle of someones yard
holsters his gun
a neighbors dog approaches happily wagging its tail
hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur
where you want it mike
head or gut
listen joe i stops sighs gut
hallenbeck pats the dog
plants his back foot and spins
punches like a sledgehammer into millers gut
miller drops to his knees
begins to retch
hallenbeck takes out a cigarette
if i see you again ill kill you
miller nods weakly
gasping for breath
west hollywood at seven right
seven oclock right
want the job
its two hundred bucks
i guess it is
he climbs to his feet still doubled over
im sorry joe
hallenbeck says nothing
miller turns and stumbles to his car
hallenbecks face betrays nothing
a dead mask
he walks back toward the hedge
the neighbors dog runs up a tennis ball in its mouth
behind him mike miller gets into the sunbird
hallenbeck takes the tennis ball
the dog barks and bounds after it
mike miller turns the key in the ignition
the car blows to pieces
an eruption of flame
flying glass and metal
the car becomes airborne
engulfed in fire
does a lazy spin
the shockwave catches hallenbeck
slams him ass over teacups
windows blow in up and down the street
smoke and fire roll to the sky
the dog cowers howling in fear
beside it on the grass the tennis ball is on fire
hallenbeck rolls to his feet
covered with twigs and leaves
a mobile crane hoists whats left of mike miller and his pontiac
policemen direct traffic curb bystanders
a uniform cop questions hallenbeck and sarah who stand stiffly
not looking at each other
why did mr
miller visit your home this morning mr
joe lies easily
he came by to talk business
he had a case he was to busy to continue with a routine surveillance
he farmed it out to me
is that all you talked about
he looks the officer in the eye
female for the record
signaling us that we are now rowdy strip club in west hollywood
just like the name suggests if its a virus youre sitting on it
after three drinks every girl on stage looks like your high school sweetheart
was your sweetheart fat
did she have excessive body hair
funk music played loud
the monday crowd stomps and claps
onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the dmv
jimmy dix sits at the bar hooting and whistling
behind the bar a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks
his name is harp
off to one side a twenty five year old beanpole speaks into a microphone flash of green buys a flash of pink gentlemen
so reach into your pockets if you arent there already and reward the lovely and talented ms
the black man shakes his head
he writes his own material hes proud of that
some people are proud they cured leukemia
old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh my son thinks hes eddie murphy
jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast
alex the astronaut
harp raises his own glass
alex the astronaut
it seems to be a common ritual between them
jimmy drinks thumps the bottle down
says resolutely ive had it harp
ive had it
takes a swig i dont remember what i did last night
im an idiot harp i act like a complete dickhead
i dont have friends
i drink too much
i fuck anything thats warm and breathing
stay on that side of the bar
sighs i cheated on my girl friend again
you cheated on her
you must be crazy
maybe so harp
his gaze wanders across the crowded room fixating on
who makes her way between the tables
she is beautiful
stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally
deep green eyes
her name is cory
she stops at a table against the wall
puts down a seagrams v
in a rocks glass
seated at the table is a broad shouldered man in a bad suit
the essence of boredom
looks like hes been there three days
a cloud of smoke hangs around his head
joe hallenbeck no less
the police wont help you huh
after im dead theyll perform the autopsy
guess you dont want to wait that long
scowls they only play this kind of music
what did you expect
the four freshmen
what are you my father
yes im your father
get your clothes on
beat i hate this funk shit
its gonna be an extra hundred bucks
sit next to the speaker youll get used to it
after a while youll be screaming play that funky music white boy
the screaming part i believe
she smiles and moves away
hallenbeck sips his drink
scans the crowd with shrewd eyes
the lovely cory approaches jimmy at the bar
harp looks on
seductive hello handsome
howd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne
how much for a bottle
nothing personal my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver
thats the one
i had to swerve three times to get him
so no bottle then
for forty bucks id rather drink my own piss
and with that she leans over and moulds her lips to his
these two know each other it would seem
cory pulls away
ive had it to here
grins ill bet you have
she slaps his face
he feigns innocence
points to hallenbeck
whos the stiff
beat i have to get ready to dance
come back soon
i want to buy you a drink
she smiles and moves off swishingly
jimmy watches her go
his gaze wanders across the room to hallenbeck
near the stage the would be eddie murphy steps up to the mike and says you know crowd these ladies are fine but let me tell you the three reasons
men prefer sheep theyre always in the mood they never bitch and after you fuck em you can eat em
a few chuckles
more coughs than chuckles
plowing ahead and now heres a lady thats always in the mood put your hands together for the lovely and talented ms
a syncopated drum beat kicks in
aerosmiths latest erupts from the speakers
and then she comes on
and even joe hallenbeck must draw in a sharp breath
her body is exquisite
she moves like breath
her eyes can put you under
she is simply that beautiful
sits with his drink untouched before him
pats his suit pockets searching for a smoke
removes a crumpled empty pack as saunters up looking less than friendly
he looks at hallenbeck
hallenbeck does not look at him
dont tell anyone
thats what cory said
she said you were nobody
only hallenbecks eyes move
he looks up regards jimmy coolly
they size each other up
easy junior im not raining on your parade
shes too young for me
im just keeping an eye on her for a few days
what are you some kind of bodyguard
something like that
you got a cigarette
is cory in trouble
i hope not
you tell me
she didnt mention anything to me
that bothers you doesnt it
dont sweat it
women have secrets
water is wet the sky is blue and women have secrets
beat ill buy you a beer
jimmy remains standing
she hired you huh
what you in the phonebook
actually she hired my buddy mike
im filling in
sorry to hear it
he was a lousy surveillance man
jimmy leans forward palms flat on the table
look friend i dont know who you are or whats going on
but cory is my girl friend and if shes in trouble i want to hear about it
thats client confidential
tell me anyway
i say two words to cory and you dont get paid asshole
im looking at your suit you could use the dough
you dont like my suit guess what
i dont like your money
good cause youre not getting any
story of my life
not getting any
they stare each other down
hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon
you couldnt protect a cup of warm piss
nods hit me
bust me in the chops chickenshit
beat youre not afraid are you jimmy
freezes you know who i am
james alexander dix l
barred from the n
on gambling charges
allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit never proven
busted once for possession
you had the makings of a first class dumbshit
you are now pissing me off
about fucking time
extends his hand joe hallenbeck
im a private detective
ignores the hand i dont know joe
you look like a dumb wop to me
at least i didnt shit my talent away on coke motherfucker
can i hit you now
jimmy throws a short jab at hallenbecks chin
it never gets there
joe moves lightning quick and suddenly jimmys fist is trapped
fingers grinding into palm
sits down hard
hallenbeck releases him
please have a seat
gasping you think youre some kind of hot shit tough guy huh
shrugs its not a question of tough
im bigger than you and i was trained
so i can take you
thats just the way it is
you can throw a better pass
beat how about that beer
signals the waitress you were a great quarterback jimmy
i watched you play at washington state
red shirt freshman in
followed you with the stallions
good scrambling ability seventy percent completions from the pocket
you had the best gun in the n
jimmy looks at him puzzled
didnt they just swap punches
big smile hell
im a fan
onstage the music grinds to a close as cory dispenses with the last of her clothing
strikes a pose to wild applause and we hold on her radiant beauty and cory and jimmy are engaged in very hot sex
this is not a love scene this is a sex scene
im not even going to attempt to write this quote unquote steamy scene here for several good reasons a the things that i find steamy are none of your damn
business jack in addition to which b the two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most fat assed writers anyhow and finally c my mother reads this shit
i think we lost her back at the jacuzzi blowjob scene
suffice to say they fog the screen
at last jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses
lifts one in a toast
alex the pediatrician
giggles alex the pediatrician
and from this blissful affirmation of life we joe hallenbeck is pounding an already dented cigarette machine
it has eaten his money
he shakes his head muttering
looks at his watch
looks at the dressing room door
shakes his head again
walks to the end of the corridor
goes through the fire door
out into starry moonlit night
a chill breeze
joe draws a breath
in front of him on the wall of the club is a poster baynard for senate it reads
above the logo a picture of a benevolent looking gray haired man
hallenbeck regards it balefully
i didnt vote for you you bastard
he looks away and suddenly notices something on the ground a half smoked cigarette butt
just sitting there
joe stares at it
thinks it over
starts to walk away
youre a fuckin lowlife joe
he bends to pick up the butt
a steel sap whistles over his head missing by inches
hallenbeck spins startled
reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm
misses chops the air
two more men behind him
nowhere to go
a sap pops him behind the left ear
a sickening thud
the world spins out of focus
he goes down
hits the pavement like a ton of bricks
rolls over staring up
vision muddy indistinct
three silhouettes hover over him backlit by streetlamps
their voices are fuzzy
he was with her
shit hes packing
what should we do
get him away from here
then kill him
theres no contract for him
then do it for free
just do it elsewhere
the men disperse
one of them drags joe to his feet
a stocky crag faced man
he jams a silenced pistol in joes kidney and points him toward a vacant lot nearby
im right behind you
the two other hitmen return to their gray late model sedan
climb into the car and sit watching the nightclub
a rusty chain link fence separates the lot from the boule vard
choked with weeds
a rusted out car
a towering billboard looms overhead inviting people to drink scotch or get laid its hard to tell
hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot
the crag faced man follows behind him
wrong place at the wrong time buddy thats all it is
just want you to know its nothing personal
thats what you think
last night i fucked your wife
the gunman cracks up
hallenbeck grins drunkenly
oh you did huh
howd you know it was my wife
she said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath
the guy cracks up again
youre pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet
after fucking your wife ill take two
the hitman wheezes laughter
joe just grins
youre a funny guy
its a shame to take you off
here kneel down
are you kidding
we barely know each other
the hitman is now giggling shaking his head
this is wild
i never shot no funny guy before
you need a special funny bullet
come on cut it out
head or chest
thats what your wife said
would you quit with the wife
enough is enough
ask me how fat she is
how fat is she
shes so fat i had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot
you wanna fuck her you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in
the hitman loses it like the pillsbury doughboy except when you poke her in the stomach she farts
i got a buddy hes an archaeologist organized an expedition to her chin
they got lost in her nasal hair
but seriously her eyes are like the streets of paris crossed
theyre so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back
shes got back tearia
cant stop laughing oh thats awful
buddy youre a fucking rio from a kneeling position hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the mans eyes
the man cries out
and hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring
not drunk at all
he takes the broken bottle hes been clutching and cuts the guys throat like a knife through butter
the hitman stands with a shocked look on his face
fires the gun once into the ground
drops it from nerve less fingers
stares at hallenbeck aghast
hallenbeck meets his gaze
a savage feral gleam in his eye
and then some
the guy pitches over dead
hallenbeck kneels beside him
slips the hitmans pistol into his waistband
im playing tahoe on the th
he takes off running
cory and jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot
she scans the area shaking her head
i cant believe it
the bastard split on me
sighs im staying at a motel for a couple days
will you follow me
he heads for his car
the hitmen wait in the darkened sedan
watching jimmy and cory
the driver keys the ignition
starts the car
in his lap is an automatic rifle
joe hallenbeck is running full out
headlong down the sidewalk
gasping for breath
he slams into a man
knocks him flat
joe doesnt care
jimmy dix is behind the wheel of a silver jag
cory is driving a spanking new ford fiero
jimmy follows behind cory watchdogging
humming with joe cocker on the radio
cory comes to a red light
turns right onto a sidestreet
jimmy slows pausing at the intersection
jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car
its enough everyone inside is armed to the teeth
the sedan roars around the corner cutting in front of jimmy
this is a hit this is a fucking hit
comes up behind cory
comes up fast
rams her car
meanwhile frantically floors the pedal of his jag pops the clutch and stalls out
he roars with anger
flings open the door
leaps out and runs forward screaming cory get out of there
cory is already out of her car yelling hey cant you fucking drive
her eyes go wide with shock
the hitmen burst from their car
open up on full auto
cory is cut down
blown backward over the hood of her ford
flung to the street
and without missing a beat the hitmen turn and open fire on jimmy
he takes a running start
clears the hood of his jag in a single leap
bullets dice the metal behind him
he lands hard
sucks the ground
huddled behind his car as move toward him triggering three shot bursts
the kid is dead meat
or so it seems until without warning charges into the intersection
screaming bloody murder
hes got a gun in each fist and both are blazing
one hitman dies immediately dances like a puppet racked by gunfire
bullets go through him
shatter the sedans windshield
the second hitman turns and opens up on hallenbeck
joe rolls behind a mailbox
bullets chase him blowing apart the metal box
the hitman swears
turns running for the sedan
he knows when a getaway is in order
just one problem
he forgot about jimmy dix
a screech of tires
as jimmys jag slews around the corner laying rubber
rockets toward the hitman pins him in its headlights the hitman screams as jimmy plows through him and crunches into the gray sedan
shatters the hitman between the two cars
and holy christ the guys still alive
pinned like a butterfly legs broken
he raises his rifle screaming
jimmy dives flat on the front seat
the windshield erupts
he fires shot after shot into jimmys car
hallenbeck walks up behind him
puts a bullet in his head
he stops screaming
is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass
hallenbeck walks up leans in the window
as jimmy looks up back up
jimmy puts it in reverse
the car backs up
steam pouring from the crumpled hood
the hitman now freed collapses to the street
like a sack of flour
hallenbeck limps toward him wheezing
he stops as stands outside a door marked office
holding a pump action shotgun leveled at hallenbeck
hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street
its all over compadre
get off my property mister
scowls sidewalk belongs to the government
he turns and looks at jimmy
the kid is in pain
staring at corys bullet riddled body
hallenbeck says nothing
he crosses to the shattered hitman
kneels down fishes through the guys coat pockets
comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes
sirens fill the air
and jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat takes out the vial of coke
drops it down a sewer grating out of sight
no one sees him do it
come squealing up flashers turning
surrounding jimmy who stands head down and motionless and joe who smokes and looks at the moon
sergeant benjamin bessalo sits behind his desk scanning a stack of typed pages
a tired looking cop named mccaskey lounges in the doorway
a christmas tree in the corner sheds needles
through the glass window we can see hallenbeck and jimmy seated outside in the squad room proper
bessalo stops reading
sniffs the air
frowns something stinks in here
widens his eyes my god its this statement
he flings the paper onto his desk
hallenbeck is hiding something
mccaskey how do you know
i know how the bastards mind works
every lie has eighty percent truth to it
guy scares me
mccaskey is staring out the window at hallenbeck
mccaskey we lookin at the same guy
smiles go ahead
tell me what you see
mccaskey i see a guy looks like he just slept in his suit
thats what most people see
mccaskey theres more
beat a long time ago that son of a bitch saved the presidents life
outside the office hallenbeck and jimmy are perched side by side on a wooden bench
jimmy is crumpling pieces of paper and tossing them at a wastebasket
he throws with unerring accuracy
beside him hallenbeck frowns deep in thought
finally jimmy speaks that stuff cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her
that was all bullshit wasnt it
i dont know what she was into but those were professional hitters tonight
beat tell me about cory
what was she like
none of your fucking business
listen up friend
im trying to get a handle on this
how was she fixed for money
pause i dont know
pretty strapped i guess
always kept an eye out for work
no hooking if thats what you mean
tell me what she did at the club besides dance
get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne
sit in a private booth let the poor fuck spill his troubles
used to say shed make a great psychiatrist
she get many high rollers
even rich guys get lonely
beat so suppose one night her guest gets a little too drunk and brags to her
reveals something about himself
something that could hurt if it came out
what would she do
i dont get it
would she blackmail him
jesus ive had about enough of you
would she consider the possibility of blackmail
sighs shed consider it
if she could get away with it
but shed need hard evidence
otherwise its i never said that his word against hers
so what does she do
i dont know
follow the guy
have him followed
kid this is making sense
she hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence
who does she hire
she hires my buddy mike
it makes sense
except except you told me that mike was a shitty surveillance man
he got spotted
they made him and they killed him
then they took out cory
christ what did the two of them stumble onto
whatever it was it was way over their heads
they knew they were in trouble
how you figure
because mike was scared
he bailed out and threw the case in my lap
he handed it to you
without telling you how dangerous it was
hallenbeck stares straight ahead
sighs and says he was fucking my wife jimmy
beat i die
he gets my wife
jimmy just looks at him
at that moment mccaskey pokes his head out of bessalos office
mccaskey okay you guys are cleared to go
pick up belongings at the property desk
hallenbeck is collecting his firearm from the property clerk
jimmy lounges against the wall
winks at a hooker as she goes by in the hall followed by a patrol cop
jimmy eyes his rumpled trousers
this shirt cost me eighty bucks
holsters his gun glad to see at a time like this at least you got your priorities straight
do me a favor and shut up
you think i dont care that corys dead
rubs tired eyes christ i feel like i been rode hard and put away wet
get some sleep
what stunning advice
i was gonna go hiking
they start down the hallway side by side
you know something joe for a private eye you sure dont go in for snappy comebacks
fuck you and the horse that looks like you
get some sleep
a passing patrolman stops
eyes jimmy thoughtfully
frowns you look real familiar
do i know you
jimmy grins shrugs
some people recognize me
used to sell hash in crenshaw district
i played football
jimmy dix l
free agents ruined the damn game
he walks away
grumbles to himself
we gotta cross the parking lot
you wanna borrow my sunglasses
hey snappy comeback
you a detective
as the two cross the muster room toward the front doors they pass the hooker we saw earlier
she is talking to her pimp
there is a heated exchange
the pimp slaps her
suddenly jimmy lunges forward
balling his fists
that son of a bitch
hes ready to clean the pimps clock when hallenbeck grabs him spins him bodily
propels him out the front doors
away from trouble
what the fuck are you trying to do tarzan
he hit the chick
you dont start a fight in a police station dickhead
are you really this stupid or did you take lessons
guy shouldnt treat a woman like that is all im saying
he just shouldnt okay
because theyre weak and need protecting
pause then yeah
hallenbeck starts to chuckle
shakes his head lights a cigarette
laughs through the smoke
this may be the funniest thing hes ever heard
hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car
jimmy trots behind him
mind if i catch a ride with you
my cars fucked up remember
take the bus
cut it out
look you sorta saved my life
let me buy you a beer
im not thirsty
he approaches his battered plymouth
get some sleep
what are you gonna do
im gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend
whats the message
that were out of it
that whatever theyre doing they dont have to worry about us
joe gets in the car
youre backing off youre not gonna do anything
i watch t
what the fuck kind of private eye doesnt do anything
the kind with a wife and kid
look its over
my job is done
fuck you your job is done
we witnessed a murder joe

he starts the car
dont drive away joe
joe puts it in gear
ill tell the cops joe
joe taps the brake
leans out the window says softly tell them what jimmy
that mike miller was fucking your wife
beat only reason youre not in the cooler tough guy is the cops got no motive for millers death
when they find out mikey was dickin your old lady seems to me you become suspect numero uno
im scared and im coming with you got it
joe gets out of the car and advances on jimmy
you little creep im gonna beat the shit out of you
go for it
then the copsll really love my story
smiles you dont start a fight in a police station dickhead
you and me is not a fight
you and me is a massacre
gosh youre tough
get in the fucking car
hallenbeck is in a foul mood
jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep chairman you got any hobbies
used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist
i hear ps and bs are the hardest
yeah well actually interrupts hey you got any tapes in here
leans forward man what is this shit
who the fuck is dick haymes
jeez you must be older than i thought
hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat
whats the matter
what kind of ear problems
the kind that wont shut up
he stops at a traffic light
sees a torn poster on a nearby telephone pole california has a voice baynard for senate
gives it the finger
whats the matter you got some kind of beef with the guy
you might say that
you wanna share with the class
sighs bastard got me fired from my old job
what were you cop or something
get outta here
you protected the man
holy shit you musta got laid every night
beat where did cory live
she had an apartment on the west side
i want to check it out
jimmy stares at him puzzled
i thought you were off the case
scowls look dipshit i told you that to keep you out of my hair
pause my clients dead and i havent earned my fee
whoa back up
you mean were gonna nail these fuckers after all
i knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior
yeah im a prince
shut the fuck up
jimmy and hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny palm shaded cottages
the moon casts a pale glow
bet these places run a fortune
tell me about it
im paying the fucking rent
sounds like a great girl
what else did you spring for
wasnt like that
cory couldve had lots of rich guys
me she loved
well forget about it then
let me guess
you dont believe in love
lights a cigarette i believe in cancer
i believe in love
what theyre both diseases
something like that
jimmy shakes his head sadly
man i dont want to meet the bitch that fucked you up
im sure shed love meeting you
probably blow you on the front porch
little bitter joe
the two men approach the door
jimmy takes out his key ring
the cops are gonna want to check this place out so dont disturb anything
jimmy opens the door
flips on the lights
stops in his tracks
the room has been systematically torn to pieces
a knife has been used to rip open the couch
broken furniture shredded clothing
it looks like a combat zone
i think someone disturbed some stuff joe
looks like somebody beat us to it
beat us to what
whatever evidence cory was holding
assuming there was any
stay here a minute
where you going
you wanna come with me
doctor said i shouldnt lift anything heavy
hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage
jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him
he scans the floor covered with clothes bottles etc
picks up a carelessly discarded can of right guard deodorant
turns it upside down and unscrews the bottom
inside the can is hollow and empty
the perfect hiding place
jimmy heaves a sigh of relief
removes a little plastic baggie filled with white powder
stashes it in his shorts
starts to replace the lid
reaches into the can a second time and pulls out a yellow envelope
he looks at it perplexed
puts it in his pocket
replaces the lid
tosses the can on the floor
flushes the toilet
hallenbeck meanwhile is prowling the living room looking at photographs on the walls
the girl in the photos seems young beautiful and naive
one shot depicts cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits
on it is scrawled good luck in hollywood baby
love hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage
looks like you made it baby
jimmy emerges from the bathroom
yeah theres some really nice rubble
i may have something
lets get out of here
the two men emerge from the house
joe heads for his car
jimmy peels off toward a battered gmc pacer parked at the curb
where the hell are you going
as long as were here i might as well take corys car
you got the keys
ill follow you
hallenbeck starts to turn away
jimmy gets in the car
cory has two cars
this ones just sitting here until she can sell it
the color drains from hallenbecks features
he sprints across the sidewalk and yanks jimmy out of the drivers seat before he can key the ignition
whats your problem
hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car
swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires glinting in the moonlight
they used a car bomb on mike it figures theyd try it on her too
stands except they wired the wrong car
jimmy pales noticeably
hallenbeck claps him on the back
no harm no foul
we caught it in time
he strolls toward his plymouth whistling
jimmy catches his breath
turns and bumps into hallenbeck coming back the other way
what are you doing
hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire cutters
gotta disconnect the fucker
um shouldnt we call the bomb squad or something
smiles relax junior i used to do this for a living
he isolates one wire
turns and offers the cutters to jimmy
you wanna do it
no man i
come on chickenshit
just snip the wire
jimmy hesitates then takes the cutters
reaches beneath the wheel well
plucks at the wire tentatively
oh shit not that one
jimmy screams and stumbles backward
lands on his ass
hallenbeck is chuckling softly
shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood
youre a fucking asshole
and then some junior
and then some
have been taped to the cars ignition system
hallenbeck removes the taped bundle
holds it up for inspection
well hand this over to the cops
they can analyze it
so what now
shrugs you tell me kid
go really far away
i got a better idea
lets check in with my family
they start walking toward hallenbecks plymouth
hallenbeck tosses the car keys to jimmy
you got kids
does she like you
not much no
and she likes prince so go figure
i like prince
great you can marry my daughter
or better yet fuck my wife
i hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid i
beat open the trunk
indicating bomb youre just gonna stick that in your trunk
nods youre right
lets leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with
jimmy opens the trunk
as he does however a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness
hold it right there gentlemen
slowly they turn
are approaching from out of the trees
one holds a flashlight trained on hallenbeck and jimmy
the other carries a silenced beretta
is it the cops
its not the cops
working quickly hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid
slams it shut
turns facing the new arrivals
the men wear tailored suits with matching ties
one is tall and lean
the other is a bruiser short and stout
they both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters
the taller man speaks gun held rock steady
good evening gentlemen
bit late for a stroll dont you think
yeah you two better be getting home
the streetlights are on
how delightful to find such amusing men so late at night
beat i dont believe ive had the pleasure
no i dont believe you have
to jimmy hed like to have the pleasure
tell him its not for sale
he says its whats your name fuckface
this from the shorter man who is clearly not happy
shakes his head im asshole
jake apprise rodney dangerfield here of his situation
jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles
steps up and delivers a looping right to hallenbecks face
a sickening crunch
a two inch gash streams blood
jake relieves hallenbeck of his gun
perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now yes
jimmy rushes forward snarling
the beretta swivels
jimmy stops the gun aimed at his gut
all they want is the evidence
see jake he knows when a situation is untenable
smiles you like that word
it occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question
spits out blood give up jimmy
were dealing with geniuses
another fist to the head
spits more blood
leave him alone you fuck
back off jimmy
the tall man turns and eyes jimmy
leave him alone
shrugs whatever you say
the short man steps away from hallenbeck
turns and launches a kick at jimmys groin
the kid drops to the ground retching
sighs ah my young friend
i neglected to tell you that jake attacks his job with a certain
im being beat up by the inventor of scrabble
hes still in a good mood jake
kick him again
jake steps forward
hallenbeck speaks through cracked bloody lips you want the fucking evidence that the stripper had
ive got it
so we can play games or i can hand it over
and then youll let us go right
well let you go
to hallenbeck where is it
hallenbeck meets the tall mans gaze
hand me the car keys jimmy
jimmy stumbles to his feet
looks at the tall man
walk over and hand him the keys
slow and easy
jimmy takes out the car keys
crosses to hallenbeck
gives him the keys
the evidence is in the trunk
shakes his head
i dont think so
he turns and throws the keys as far as he can
they fall out of sight behind a cottage
i guess nobody gets it
you dumb bastard youre going to pay for that
jake open the trunk
jake steps forward drawing a
he is going to shoot open the lock
this is what hes been waiting for
he tenses looking to one side next to him is a sloping hillside angling down and away
he grips jimmys wrist signalling to get ready
jake raises the pistol
take aim at the lock and fires
the shot is silenced
what follows is not
because the bullet blows through the trunk and hits three sticks of live dynamite
hallenbeck is already moving pitching to one side throwing himself and jimmy down the hillside
the night lights up like a sunburst
a tower of fire
climbs up and outward from the car
the trunk lid is blown fifty feet in the air
the tires are pulped
glass sprays for fifty yards in every direction
and most importantly both hitmen are engulfed in flame
flames rolling skyward
tinkle of raining glass
bits of falling metal
all in all a helluva blast and meanwhile continue to careen down the hillside
bouncing like rag puppets
out of control
lurch to stop at the bottom
covered head to toe with dirt
they lie side by side sucking air until they both hear an odd noise the sound of crumpling metal
the sound is getting louder
they both crane their necks in time to see the flaming car tumbling end over end coming down the hill
heading straight for them
jesus fucking christ
they both dive for cover out of the way
barely make it
the car plows past them in a shower of dirt
finally slams to a halt against a palm tree
the night is filled with shouts and curses
the sound of doors opening
the crackle of flames
joe rolls over
looks at jimmy
jimmy looks at joe
dont know yet
they crawl to their feet inspecting for broken bones
either that or were looking at a major factory recall
dont make bad jokes right
so were alive
he spits blood as sirens once more fill the night air go
get out of here
get the fuck out of here ill take the heat on this one
rent a car
then go home and wait for my call
jimmy meets joes eyes
dashes off into the night
sergeant benjamin bessalo is in the mood to kick things
a metal trashcan is booted across the room with a clang as he whirls glaring at joe hallenbeck who is seated before him
goddammit this is a police matter you son of a bitch
im sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies joe and the next time i see your ugly mug im puttin a bullet in it
you got that
you are off the case buddy
is that clear
hallenbeck stares at him
jimmys at the wheel of a rented subaru
hallenbeck beside him
he hands joe the envelope he found in corys apartment
if you thought there was dynamite in the trunk waitll you see this
hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph two men having lunch together on a secluded patio
both are older distinguished looking
joe suddenly looks very pale
the guy on the left is connie marcon the owner of the l
forget about him
look at the guy on the right
sort of familiar
who is he
senator calvin baynard
jimmy draws a sharp breath
pause then lets go back to the cops
take it easy kid
its not so bad
not so bad
excuse me did you just say the words not so bad
you dont understand joe see if a guy vomits on the sidewalk you dont say oh hey its not so bad theres some ham in there
its fucking vomit okay
this is bad
hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette
stares straight ahead through the windshield
begins to talk when i was thirty i was on the presidents personal security force
once night i was on the way home from a late session
im on the highway just outside of georgetown when i see something up ahead
a younger looking hallenbeck
clipped military haircut
he is driving
down a turnpike squinting through dense evening mist
up ahead a shape materializes out of the fog is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass
he screeches to a stop
in a dream like slow motion he approaches the overturned car
there are two dead bodies inside
a little boy
in the window a stuffed garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass
the furry cat is splattered with blood
it was a high speed collision
both cars were totaled
the woman and the boy were dead
the driver of the other car wasnt
is weaving toward hallenbeck
leaving behind his crumpled mercedes
he wears an suit
tan cordovan loafers
she got in front of me man
my fuckin car
stupid bitch wrecked my car
he stumbles toward hallenbeck eyes attempting to focus
do you know who i am
im louis baynard my father is calvin d
call my father hell take care of it
the man lurches to a stop in front of hallenbeck
clutching at joes lapels
wheezing liquor fumes
he presses a hundred dollar bill into joes hand
youll tell em what happened right
bitch swerved in front of me man
wrecked my fuckin mercedes
i could smell bourbon on him big time
he was standing there not a scratch on him
i went a little nuts
i hit him
in slow motion hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk with a head snapping impact that bursts lips
we see the drunks head slowly strike the asphalt
a sickening concussion
the blow was non lethal
but when he fell his head hit the pavement funny
put him in a coma
the younger hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past staring at the drunk with fierce blazing eyes as we driving
even when he came out of it he was never right in the head
his dad fixed everything with the cops
the accident report disappeared
a week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house
acting on an anonymous tip
the senator fucked your job
and my pension
and my marriage
only reason im still licensed to carry a gun the man himself made a few calls
since then im just playing it out
day by day
jimmy is silent for a moment
then cory tumbled to some sort of deal between marcon and the senator and they had her killed
beat we gotta show this photo to the cops
i need more evidence
beat i want baynard jimmy
i want to bring him down
i could use your help
why should i help you
because if baynard takes a fall so does marcon
the man who kicked you out of professional football
a tall thin almost effeminate man is seated on a couch
a shock of blond hair
glittering malignant eyes
he is directing a pornographic film
is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed
around her the room is filled with kleig lights
the girl is scowling furiously
she speaks to the director i want the sheets changed milo
of course you do but were running behind dearest
i dont give a shit
im an actress not a piece of meat and i want clean sheets
right after this next shot
a strident beeper goes off on milos belt
he turns to the two man crew and claps his hands for attention
okay lets do it
beat roll camera
the closet door opens
a hulking man emerges
he is carrying a chainsaw
the girl on the bed stares incredulous
what the fuck is this some kind of joke
not at all dearest
its whats known as a snuff film
the hulking man pulls the starter cord
the saw roars to life
oh god milo please oh god oh no please miloooo
a smile twitches milos upper lip
shes not a piece of meat
closes a sound proofed door behind him
milo enters all business
crosses to a telephone with a blinking light
stabs a button
scoops up the receiver
how can i help you
is this line secure
one hundred percent sir
i wouldnt have used your name otherwise
sid and jake are dead milo
killed in an explosion
looks like we got a new player in the game
who is he working for
from available information he appears to be a free agent
guy by the name of joe hallenbeck
milo sits and begins punching keys on a computer
get me everything you can on this fucker milo
i want it on my computer screen in fifteen minutes
and then youll be handling it personally
dawn is a ghost on the horizon as jimmy parks the rental subaru outside
the two men emerge
head for the front door
so i get to meet your family huh
whats your daughter like
shes like thirteen
and if you even look at her funny ill shove an umbrella up your ass and open it
as they come through the front door joes daughter darian is slumped in a big lazy boy staring sullenly at a movie on tv
cute kid cursed to wear ridiculous looking dental headgear
she doesnt bother to look up
first things first
notices darian hey kiddo
why arent you in bed
im watching television
i can see that
i hate you
leave me alone
she still wont look at him
the two men cross to the kitchen
hallenbeck opens the refrigerator takes out some lunchmeat
shes pissed off because i wouldnt let her go out on a date with her friend billy
i missed the biggest party of the year
why couldnt she go
incredulous because shes thirteen thats why

im not talking to you
gee thats a shame

toward her room
goddammit you are my daughter and you will respect me got that

he looks at her stricken
your mother called me a fuck up

ohh christ im a fuck up but uncle jay now theres a real stand up guy
shit the bastard cheats on his tax form im surprised he hasnt done time
why dont you ask your mother why mister wonderful isnt in jail for tax evasion
smiles because he doesnt fuck up
she goes into her room and shuts the door
hallenbeck rubs his eyes
leans against the wall exhausted
you know for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers
anything that much fun id want to do myself
i think we could both use a drink
hallenbeck crosses to a cabinet breaks out a bottle of seagrams
hands it to jimmy
as jimmy drinks he notices a photo on the wall hallenbeck shaking hands with george bush
you look like the dad on the brady bunch
yeah i was a regular boy scout
joe starts to fix a sandwich
jimmy takes nips from the bottle
you gonna get a divorce
he bites into the sandwich
not really tasting it
you dont like women much do you joe
mouth full mike miller wasnt the first time
sarah has cheated on me before
i never told her i knew
at first my opinion of women took a real dip yeah
now im content if i like the guy shes fucking
this last one was my best friend
horseshit he was a scumbag private eye

he tried to get you killed
friends cant be perfect
sighs i wish the sky wasnt blue
i wish water wasnt wet
i wish i didnt still love my wife
he eats in silence
jimmy says you know what i did last night
i went to a party and shit on a car
im a complete loser
all i ever wanted
was to be somebodys hero you know it
now i mostly sit around
im a fucking slug throw salt on me id curl up
life doesnt suck
no life sucks
but youre not a loser
cory loved you
yeah and the last thing i did was cheat on her
beat why do people cheat joe
because its easier than paying the tax junior
so deep i dont know what the fuck it means
it means another drink is required
he raises the bottle
alex the accountant
hallenbeck frowns watching him
is alex your accountant
but he could have been
beat alex was my son
hallenbeck stares at him
i was married at
sweet young thing looking to get out from under daddys thumb
i didnt know she was a junkie
all during her pregnancy
there were complications
alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator
died before he woke up
takes a drink he was born
he had time for one dream
and then he died
i wonder what his dream was about
i think about him a lot
i mean who was this
this little guy who only got seventeen minutes who was he joe
what was he like
beat what would he have been
he would have been a great ball player
like his dad
shakes his head no
he had to die joe
dont you see
why did he have to die
softly because he came out of me
he puts aside the bottle
im gonna borrow your shower
hallenbeck watches him go
jimmy enters and shuts the door
turns on the shower
makes no move to undress
instead he reaches inside the waistband on his pants
removes a vial of coke
dips a spoon
the door opens
hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels
staring at jimmy
they freeze in tableau
then hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs jimmy with all his might
the kid goes over backward into the shower head striking the porcelain
claws his way out drenched
not in my house you dumb motherfucker
joe man you dont get it shut up
he picks up the vial of powder
this is what you went looking for in corys apartment isnt it
you found this when you found that envelope
he crosses to the toilet
jimmy cries out
joe drops the vial in the water
jimmy darts forward
joe shoves him back
you stupid bastard do you know what youve done
that was a thousand bucks worth of shit
you got it son
im just mixing it in with all the other shit
beat get the fuck out of my house
you dont understand
i said get out

jimmy glares at him
go ahead tough guy
beat im trying to survive man
i use that stuff to get by so fuck you
i dont use it

oh sure dudley fucking do right you stand there and judge me and meanwhile you never had your old lady die on you did you pal
and your fucking kid
and i said to god hey buddy what gives
i go to church i give to the united way what is this dead wife and kid shit
and he didnt say nothin joe
he grabs a towel
scrubs savagely at his wet torso
and then i lose my job my fucking life okay and why
you know why
because i gambled
whoa hold on stop the presses jimmy gambled well shit of course i gambled everybody does and the fucking league knows it
he advances on joe trembling with anger
why is there an injury report in pro football huh
nobody else has a fucking injury report but the n
does so the fucking gamblers will know the spread
the commissioner those fucking hypocrites
killed the last thing i could do joe
i cant do anything
and suddenly he is crying
i couldnt save my wife
she died screaming and i couldnt do a goddamn thing
and my baby came out
and he was so fuckin small joe
he was too fuckin small
he collapses against the wall
slides down to a sitting position
huddled on the floor
hallenbeck watches him
for a moment he seems moved to compassion
then his gaze hardens
he kneels next to jimmy
when youre through feeling sorry for yourself the front doors that way
wipes his eyes youre a total bastard
you brought cocaine in my house
end of story
jimmy is silent
exits into the hall
joes daughter darian is standing there
youre jimmy dix arent you
there is an awkward pause
darian holds out a football card
young smiling jimmy
the card is old
im sorry i acted like a bitch
would you sign my card
hallenbeck steps forward
i told you to go to your room
go to bed
this guys not signing anything
aw come off it
forget it darian
beat the guys a loser
darians face is a mask of confusion
jimmy walks past her to the front door
stops with his hand on the knob
i never shaved points joe
i never did
joe is silent
if you want my help im at the casa loma apartments on ventura
shuts the door behind him
darian goes into her room fuming
shuts the door
joe is alone
sees his reflection in the hall mirror
smile you fuck
the first light of day streams through the window
hallenbeck pushes furry tom to one side
sits on the bed
regards his sleeping wife with hooded lifeless eyes
she is peaceful
he reaches out to touch her
withdraws his hand
crushes out the cigarette
crosses to darians bed
she is asleep
she looks vulnerable
he leans over and kisses her
she stirs in her sleep
stares at her
the doorbell rings
he mutters under his breath
stalks out of the room
down the hall to the front door
flings it open pissed off
goddammit jimmy i told you
it isnt jimmy
standing on the porch is a tall thin man with blond hair
the man removes a taser gun from his overcoat
good morning joseph
he fires point blank
the electrode hits hallenbeck in the chest
a crackle of electric current
hallenbeck jerks spastically
the world spirals away
he plunges down into darkness
jimmy looks bad
sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets
staring at a football card
a duplicate of the one darian showed him
he swings his legs off the bed
stands crushes out his cigarette
moves into the bathroom
the baggie of coke is on the counter
he stares at it with bloodshot eyes
acts before he can think
grabs the baggie
tosses it in the toilet
watches as it goes down the drain
another goddamned day
a chill drizzle
the palm trees look forlorn
jimmy buys a paper
trudges along ventura boulevard
huddled against the chill
slides to the curb in front of him
two men get out one is pablo who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in milos snuff film the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who well call
the two men flank jimmy and walk alongside him
he looks up startled
good morning jimmy
who are you and how the fuck do you know my name
frowns this is the guy
you sure its the guy
this is him
the kid with the million dollar arm
he dont look like much
i wouldnt pay no million dollars for this bozo
neither will anyone else anymore
im growing whiskers here guys
you got something to say fucking say it
tough guy stuff
must have caught it from his buddy hallenbeck
dont play dumb shithead
you were with him last night at the club
marcon sent us to teach you a lesson jimmy
something about keeping your big coked up nose out of his fucking business
get ready kid
this ones an e ticket
and with that they grab jimmy under the arms
carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence
please guys dont do this
jesus christ i was just her boyfriend i swear to god please
they toss jimmy over the fence
not a terrible fate under normal circumstances
in this case however a fifty foot drop
awaits him beyond the fence
a huge looming pit dug into the earth
foundation for a new parking garage
jimmy plummets like a stone
under normal circumstances hed be dead
but since it rained last night hes got three feet of water to land in
he hits with a splash
disappears beneath the water
surfaces screaming in pain
thrashes in the muddy water and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle
his million dollar arm
his throwing arm
he clutches at cracked ribs screaming oh god my arm my fucking arm oh jesus christ
he kneels in the muddy water rocking back and forth
alone in the pit
huddled in a pool of muddy water
his screams of pain echo in the chill morning air
ben bessalos office to be precise
bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk
mccaskey hangs up the phone and calls across the room mccaskey i got bad news and bad news
gimmee the bad news first
mccaskey bad news is they just pulled jimmy dix out of a construction site on ventura
hes busted up
okay now gimme the bad news
mccaskey i just got a call from hallenbecks neighbor
bessalo looks up intrigued
mccaskey continues mccaskey now according to hallenbeck mike miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case right
so how come hallenbecks neighbor claims that millers car was parked there all night in the same spot
bessalo sits bolt upright
why did he lie
realization hits him like a thunderbolt
miller was fucking his wife
thats why the car was there miller was fucking hallenbecks wife hallenbeck just got back from out of town remember
beat christ joe wasted the bastard himself
he stabs a button on the phone
barks into the receiver i want an a
out on joe hallenbeck
find him and if he resists arrest shoot the bastard
he slams down the phone
stares stricken at mccaskey
i let him go mick
he wasted mike miller and waltzed right out of my office i let him go goddammit
mccaskey relax ben
well bring him in
hes not that good
you wanna bet
and with that we promptly
dark circles under the eyes
comes into frame and slaps him
rocks his head to one side
polished wood furniture
outside the sea is angry and grey
are standing over hallenbeck who is slumped in a chair
both hitmen wear holstered sidearms
chet leans over and slaps hallenbeck again
the big detective begins to stir
his eyelids flutter
i think hes awake
chets hand flashes out for a third slap and from nowhere joe hallenbecks hand magically appears
intercepts the blow
clamps onto chets hand and wrenches it
a cry of pain
chet stumbles backward cradling the wrist
his eyelids creak open
he squints adjusting to the light
studies his captors
you nearly broke my wrist man
lifes a bitch
he starts pawing his coat pockets looking for a cigarette
in the corner pablo chuckles milo warned us to watch out for this guy
chet is seething
he glares at hallenbeck
look at him
guys a piece of shit
hallenbeck ignores him
rubs tired eyes
anybody got a cigarette
chet steps forward
i got a cigarette
he reaches into his shirt pocket
extracts a marlboro
hands it to hallenbeck
takes out a lighter
hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips
leans forward for a light and chet slugs him in the face
the cigarette goes flying
hallenbecks head snaps back
blood creeps from his lower lip
guffaws hey baby i thought you were tough
see pablo he aint so bad
hallenbecks eyes glint fiercely
he takes a breath
leans forward and says i seem to have dropped my cigarette
may i have another
chet turns meets his gaze
the grin falters a bit
sure thing buddy
he hands hallenbeck another smoke
hallenbeck puts it between his lips
i need a light
beat and if you touch me again
ill kill you
a pregnant pause
the challenge hangs in the air
slowly chet takes the lighter from his pocket
pablo looks on a smile twisting his features
hallenbeck leans forward for a light
chet extends his arm and slugs hallenbeck in the face again
chet howls with laughter
two for two
the laughter continues
hallenbeck takes a deep breath
strikes with a flattened palm
breaks chets nose
drives it up into the brain
chet stands pole axed
pitches over dead
and suddenly pablo isnt laughing
he stares at hallenbeck incredulous
stares at chet lying on the carpet
draws his gun you son of a bitch
he rushes to chet
kneels beside him
hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat
you killed him
fuckin a you killed him hes fuckin dead
hallenbeck says nothing
at that moment a door opens and milo enters
is there a problem
still dazed he killed chet milo
the mother fucker just killed him
milo looks toward hallenbeck
hallenbeck says nothing
instead he calmly leans forward and picks up chets lighter from the carpet
lights his cigarette
a tense moment
and then milo does something un expected he starts to laugh
advances into the room chuckling
joseph joseph you dont disappoint me
he draws a walther ppk and approaches hallenbeck
smiling and cheerful
you seem to have killed one of my men
shrugs i needed a light
milo nods as if this makes perfect sense
you took an awful risk
pablo here could have shot you dead
if you wanted me dead youd have already killed me
yes thats true
sits down i suppose introductions are in order
waves his hand fuck it
youre the bad guy right
im the bad guy
and youve got the gun and im supposed to tremble in fear something like that
something like that
ill start trembling in a minute
mind if i have a drink first
smiles i dont see why not
pablo please take chets corpse into the other room and then fix mr
hallenbeck a drink
suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway make that two
hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival
hey look whos here
connie marcon himself
sure enough conrad marcon saunters in just like he owns the place
which by the way he does
tall strong texas tough
dressed in a saville row suit
he frowns at hallenbeck careful son
only my friends call me connie
you got friends
when did this happen
chuckles ill give you one thing
youre pretty calm for a man in your position
youre pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year
theyre having some problems
marcons composure falters but only for a moment
im glad youre here joe
we got a few things to discuss
he takes a moment to gather his thoughts
for starters im sure youre aware that professional football is changing and not for better
lights a cigar used to be you went to the local stadium come sunday you saw heroes
guys who fought for their hometown
anymore no one gives a shit
ever since sonny werblin paid to joe namath back in the sons of bitches just got greedier
playing only for themselves
giving nothing back to the game
pablo hands him a double bourbon
this year the final blow the n
votes to decertify the players organization
eliminates the draft reduces all athletes to free agents
reduces football once and for all to commerce
to greed you follow
when do i say the pledge of allegiance
marcon looks directly at hallenbeck
do you know how many ratings points monday night football lost this year
an average of two point eight
oh for chrissake
youre telling me this whole thing is about tv ratings
people have stopped watching joe
everybodys turning the channel theyre still looking for heroes you follow
guys like you
milo here tells me you took a bullet for the president jumped in front of a sniper rifle
hallenbeck reacts startled
looks at milo
we took the liberty of researching your background
how about it joe
is it truth or hype
shrugs i got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir
there you go thats what im saying
the public wants real heroes
not a bunch of football prima donnas jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers
beat in fact joe and this is my point theres only one reason left nowadays to watch pro football
can you guess
it begins to dawn on hallenbeck
puffs his cigar just one problem football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states
and that joe boy is where i come in
sudden realization shit thats what this is about
youre bribing united states senators
paying them to pass legislation legalizing football gambling in all fifty states
attendance goes up again
tv ratings go up again
you got it son
the networks are happy
before we get too fucking happy lets get a couple things straight first im not your fucking son and second
why am i still alive
marcon stops pacing
sighs and sits down facing hallenbeck
its like this joe everything was going great until a couple weeks ago and then i hit a snag senator calvin baynard
takes a sip of bourbon i dont get it
whats the snag
i offered him the bribe and he wouldnt take it
hallenbeck actually does a spit take
are you nuts
the guys so crooked he shits slinkies
allow me to clarify i offered him the bribe and he turned it down because he wanted more money
sighs with relief thank god
for a minute there i felt hell freezing over
did he ask for more than a million
does the pope shit in the woods
he wants two million or hell blow the lid off my whole plan
i dont feel like paying no two mil so basically that good ole boys gotta die
taking off a u
senator thats pretty ballsy
even for an asshole like you
oh im not going to kill baynard joe
marcon says nothing
just looks at hallenbeck and smiles
he rubs tired eyes
im the perfect fall guy
everyone and his uncle max knows i hate baynard
nods anything goes wrong all the heat lands on you joe boy
my hands are clean
any particular reason i should go along with this prize winning scheme
smiles just one
he motions to milo who disappears through a doorway
reappears a moment later
hes got joes wife
rage courses through him like an electric current
marcon cocks his gun
sit down joe
joe stands smouldering
sarah speaks do what he says joe
eyes locked on milo
are you alright sarah
thats a temporary condition joseph
as you may be aware there are distributors in mexico who positively crave snuff films
and unless you do every fucking thing mr
marcon tells you
your wife will make her motion picture debut
he meets joes murderous gaze
meanwhile back at the ranch jimmy is seated shirtless on a metal examining table
his ribs are taped
his arm in a cast
two men loom over him sour expressions on their faces sergeants mccaskey and bessalo
jimmy shakes his head exasperated look ill say it again for the cheap seats i dont know anything and i cant help you
can i go now
bessalo grimaces in disgust
let me get this straight youre walking along minding your own business when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason
is that it
youre full of shit kid
beat tell me where hallenbeck is
how the fuck should i know
try his house
where is he
for chrissake i just met the guy
beat look sergeant
i dont give a shit about joe hallenbeck
i just busted my throwing arm and im in a real pissy mood so you got two choices either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here
he glares defiantly at bessalo
the grey day wears on
jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit
pulls up short staring ahead slumped outside the door to his apartment
a crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand
he kneels beside her
touches her shoulder
awakens looking at him
her eyes are puffy and red from crying
her hair is a tangled mess
she hands him the piece of paper and promptly bursts into tears
buries her head in his chest sobbing
he cradles her with his good arm
awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads he stares at the note dumbstruck
a savage wind sweeps in off the ocean
gulls wheel overhead
is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house
milo and his crew prepare to cast off
meanwhile approaches along the dock looking lean and mean in an izod shirt
he stops in front of sarah and joe hallenbeck
they are seated on the dock
each handcuffed to a metal railing
pablo kneels and unfastens joes cuffs
go fuck yourself
pablo delivers a savage kick to hallenbecks ribs
hallenbeck gasps in pain
i meant that
in a good way
pablo hauls him to his feet
props him against the railing
time for a little payback joe
call it a service to dear departed chet
he slams a fist into hallenbecks middle
sarah cries out in alarm
hows that feel fuckhead
weakly im asshole
and with that pablo lets him have it
rains punches on his chest and gut
slams an elbow into his kidneys
drives a knee into his groin
joe hits the deck
milo calls out from the boat easy pablo
i want him conscious
pablo is kicking joes prone form
goddamn you stop it
oh jesus leave him alone
pablo gives joe a last swift kick
spits on him
lies bleeding on the dock
sarah crawls over to him
as far as the cuffs will allow
cradles his head in her lap
look at me
its okay joe
im here its okay
strokes his hair i love you joe
hallenbeck looks at her like shes just grown three heads
i get the shit beat out of me
puke all over myself
and now you love me
i never stopped loving you joe
christ you slept with three guys
you knew about the others
you never said anything
you needed them
joe goddammit why didnt you say something
fuck you sarah
fuck you sarah
anything to show that you
that you had some pride left
then hallenbeck heaves a sigh
im fresh out
im scared joe
get me out of this
must be my trick ear
sounded like you said get me out of this
you can take these guys joe
ive got cracked ribs and a concussion
save me joe
be a hero
i dont believe in heroes
thats no excuse
he stares up at her for a moment
then through bloody lips fuck you sarah
and he smiles
just then milo signals from the boat
seeing this pablo approaches the couple again
all right lovebirds break it up
he yanks sarah to her feet
lets his gaze roam up and down her body
he rips open her blouse
roughly fondles her breasts
on the ground
he growls with fury
starts to push himself up
stay down fucker
dont you move
at that moment milo comes striding down the dock
we dont want to get mrs
hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby
he squats next to joe
hello joseph guess what
time to go and remember you follow orders or the missus pays the price
youre gonna kill us both anyway
but there are ways to die and then there are
ways to die
you determine your wifes fate
he yanks hallenbeck to his feet
propels him toward the boat
as her husband is being led away sarah calls out joe
looks at her
boys and girls there is within joe hallenbeck a spark tiny
but now looking at his wife that spark unexpectedly kindles and eight years melt away
just like that
the old joe hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says with deadly calm
ill be back
beat thats a promise
milo clubs joe in the head with his pistol
youre wasting my time joseph
he looks at milo
and grins if you touch me again
ill kill you
they stare into each others eyes
hallenbeck does not give an inch
milo hits him again
remember jimmys friend henry who we met briefly near the opening of the film
of course you do youre a highly paid reader or development person
well henry is seated in a big lived in den watching football films
the walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia
there is a knock at the door
he gets up
crosses to the door
and jimmy dix is there
he gets right to the point i need to borrow a gun henry
conrad marcon sits behind a huge teak desk
surrounded by football paraphernalia
the phone chirps
he picks up the receiver
stabs a button
its milo sir
were now underway and should be lying off catalina within two hours
good boy milo
the commissioners party starts at six
ill put in a token appearance around six thirty
very good sir
any problems with hallenbeck
no were getting along famously
glad to hear it
no fuckups milo
i want him deep sixed
i assure you neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise
christ milo how come you always have to talk like a fruit
if it annoys you i could always adopt a texas drawl though im afraid i dont know any stories about fucking pigs
ill remember that sir
he hangs up
marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles
he turns and suddenly we realize hes not alone in the room a strange man is seated in the shadows off to one side
his face is obscured
marcon addresses him
so far so good
the man in the corner nods then speaks
as he does we notice he has a speech impediment it sounds like hes talking with his mouth full
weve worked too hard con
theres no margin for error
take it easy buddy
youre using the first team yes
sighs actually i have no choice
fuckin hallenbeck killed the second and third teams
a sign reads boat rentals day and week
jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a hatteras sport charter
he is obsessed
darian trots along behind him
shes holding up pretty well considering
what do you need a boat for
im gonna crash a party out on catalina
marcon will be there
he swings a bag of gear onto the boat
starts to store it
we should call the police
theres some big shots involved in this mess and its my word against theirs
if i blab to the cops your mom and dad will disappear and theyll never find the bodies
beat im sorry darian
about to cry so
what do we do
what i do
is confront conrad marcon and threaten to go to the cops unless he gives them back
is that gonna work
beats me but i think its what your dad would do
me too honey
his gear stashed he turns to darian
tries a smile
whyd you come to me anyhow
i dont know
i thought youd
know what happened know what to do
beat i mean you were one of my dads big heroes
jimmy almost chokes
when i was little he used to talk about you all the time
best football player in the game
you shoulda seen him when you got busted
jimmy stares straight ahead
takes a deep breath
ill get them back kiddo
ill get them back
the island sits beneath a dark cloud filled sky
fog nestles in the foothills rolling in off the ocean
slices through the murk filled with light laughter boats are arriving at a private dock
a steady stream of guests
tuxedoes and evening gowns
a parade of phony hair and phony boobs
all mounting the stairs to a huge chalet
inside a dinner party is in progress
people with six figure incomes
pretending theyre important
at a raised bar conrad marcon bends the ear of a japanese businessman
a lot of laughter
a sudden commotion near the front door
people crane their necks
marcon turns to look as
enters the party surrounded by an entourage of men in armani suits
seeing this marcons face changes
gone is the affable texan
in his place a ruthless murderer
as a thirty shot clip is snapped into place
milo is preparing the weapon
he works the action
pumps a round into the chamber
looks up at hallenbeck who is bound hand and foot
seated across from him in the boats cabin
your wifes very pretty
fuck you cocksucker
little testy this evening
he pulls a switchblade out of his windbreaker
thats not very polite you know calling someone a cocksucker
a lot of hard ks
very abusive sounding
hallenbeck says nothing
what would you do joseph if someone called you that
would you cut out one of his eyes
what would you do
id go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone
milo studies hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish
it occurs to me joseph that i would very much like to hear you scream
youre so cool arent you
if youll pardon the expression
id like just once to hear you scream in pain
play some rap music
milo chuckles shakes his head
when do i kill baynard
laughs come now joseph did you really think that id hand you a loaded gun
beat youre not really going to kill anyone
he leans forward
youre going to be framed for the senators murder
when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime
boats lots of them
money money everywhere and plenty of drinks to drop
purrs quietly into the harbor
jimmy at the rudder
nudges up to the dock
in the chalet above the party rages
jimmy lashes the boat
grabs a tuxedo from the closet
stands dressed in front of the mirror
opens a box
removes a millimeter baretta
works the slide
jacks a bullet into the cylinder
stashes it in the waistband of his pants in back
concealed by the tuxedo
studies his own grim face in the mirror
okay hot shit lets do it
jimmy emerges from the cabin
heads for the rail
a voice calls out nice tux
he turns and sees darian hallenbeck
peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin
goddammit i told you to go home
fuck you i stowed away
theyre my parents okay
jimmy shakes his head
just stay here
with the boat
darian starts to protest
he throws her the keys
anything funny happens get the fuck out of here
darian takes the keys
frowns says you look terrible
i feel terrible
are you really a drug addict
i kicked the habit
he swings over the side onto the dock
dont let them break your other arm
youre a fuckin inspiration
milo speaks to hallenbeck
at eight fifteen senator baynard will leave the party hopefully unobserved
he and his entourage will board a fast boat and rendezvous with us at sea
he thinks hes geting his two million dollar payoff
points to two identical suitcases in the corner
baynard will not leave his boat
one of his men will board us and inspect the contents of the suitcase
he opens one of the cases
twenty thousand of them to be precise
then we pull a simple switch
when the man returns to his boat hes carrying this suitcase
he points to the identical twin
nods detonation upon opening
enough to kill the passengers not enough to sink the craft
smiles and when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage the police will draw the inevitable conclusion a down on his luck p
makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career
that sounds lovely but how is my body gonna get charred
with a flourish milo pulls aside a tablecloth
under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline
maybe ill get to hear you scream after all
just then one of milos crew sticks his head in the door
you better get up here we got a problem
milos yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore
island lights blink in the distance
fog rolls in
milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck
crosses to the railing looks down at bobbing in the water about thirty yards away
a fisherman is waving his arms
beside him his wife and seventeen year old son
buddy i got a cracked engine casing im dead in the water
can i get a tow
milo swears under his breath
calls out im sorry sir
this boat is island security were under strict orders to stay within this sector
look itll take ten minutes
im sorry we cant help you
goddammit now i gotta call the coast guard
milos crewman steps up to the rail
speaks urgently milo hes gonna bring the coast guard down on top of us
milo ponders for maybe three seconds
then he calls out excuse me
the fisherman turns
his family beside him
fuck you sir
he reaches under his windbreaker
pulls out an ingram model machine gun
the entire family is blown away
wood splingers pop and fly
the bodies topple like broken toys
milo ceases fire
turns to his crewman
get over there and put the bodies below where they cant be seen
he saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred
jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house
looking for a back entrance
he hears voices approaching
pulls up short
ducks into the shadows
senator baynard goes by with two bodyguards
christ i cant believe i agreed to this dog and pony show
lets get it over with
the head for the boats
jimmy stares after them mind racing
makes a decision heads for the boats
jimmy casts off the lines
heads for the cockpit
darian is inside
gimmee the keys kiddo
where are you going
the senators here and hes leaving by the back door
im gonna follow him
he keys the ignition
get off the boat
fuck you man
darian goddammit she runs below decks
im not coming out
jimmy looks up the senators boat a sleek powerful marlineer is even now pulling out of the cove
he throttles forward
the hatteras pulls away from the dock
the sound of thundering rotors as a refitted bell cobra helicopter cuts through the night sky over catalina
banks sharply cruises offshore
the pilot works the stick while the co pilot searches the water below through infra red binoculars
he speaks into a microphone
this is air one over
roger air one over
the drop zone is clear repeat the drop zone is clear over
milo is at the other end of the connection
beside him two crewmen
roger air one over and out
replaces the mike up anchor gentlemen we have a go
points to hallenbeck gag him and stash him
as milo goes topside one of the men tapes joes mouth
the other opens a cramped storage compartment
they stuff him inside
shut and lock the door
about two miles offshore
the senators marlineer cuts through the waves converging with milos yacht
the two boats pull up alongside
the lines are made fast
one of milos crewmen greets senator baynards aide a slick looking italian in a overcoat
baynards man hops from one boat to the other
boarding milos yacht
meanwhile jimmy dix is clearly lost
he bangs his fist in frustration
goddammit i lost him
i cant see a fucking thing
see if this boat has sonar
oh yeah little miss know it all
watch your mouth
take a bath in my ass
theyre clearly having no fun
the payoff is in progress
one of milos crewmen carries the suitcase over to the wall
places it on a built in counter
underneath the suitcase is a half finished jigsaw puzzle
off to one side is a half empty coffee container
the case is opened
baynards aide whistles softly
examines the stacks of bills
just then milo enters the cabin
adopts a harsh new york accent as he angrily barks hey
any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah
no sir we didnt think exactly you didnt think
goddammit thats two million bucks there now frisk the fuckin guy
hey baby im clean take it easy fuck easy
against the wall spread em
as baynards man assumes the position milo hits a concealed button
it happen in less than a second the built in counter rotates into the wall only to be replaced by an indentical counter
identical half finished jigsaw puzzle
identical coffee cup
and of course the identical suitcase
the indignant aide turns around pat down concluded
milo smiles apologetically
were cool baby
he hands over the suitcase
baynards man emerges onto the deck carrying the suitcase
steps over the rail crossing to the senators boat
gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there
they cast off the lines
freeing the two boats
milo watches tense
as the lines are freed he says hard to starboard get us out of here
back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast
the go between heads below deck carrying the suitcase
senator baynard puts down his wine glass
looks up expectant
the aide flashes an a okay grin
sets the suitcase on a table
meanwhile jimmy has had about enough
he sighs with frustration
stares ahead into the fog
all were doing is burning gas
sorry kid im turning back
the words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing noise growing louder
darian looks up puzzled
do you hear that
and with that bursts from the fog
directly in front of them
hovers like an avenging angel turbines screaming holy fucking shit
rotor wash sprays in every direction
the noise is deafening
the pilot grabs the mike and shouts into it code yellow code yellow we got a bogie repeat we got a bogie over
milo snaps his head to one side hearing this
grabs the mike air one air one where the fuck is he
nine oclock repeat on your nine and closing fast
jimmys boat roars out of the fog
and suddenly hes in a world of shit
less than fifty yards to port is milos yacht
fifty years to starboard is the senators marlineer
he guns the engine
spins the wheel banks to port
screams past cutting across the bow nearly taking off the roof jimmy wrestling the wheel and meanwhile the senator actually has his hands on the suitcase to open it when
one of his men yells shit
somethings going on
what is it
its a fucking setup
get us out of here now
the guy relays the order and baynards marlineer surges forward
full throttle heading for shore as milo skids out on deck grabbing for his machine gun
calls out who the fuck is he
a crewman grabs a pair of binoculars
hallenbeck has no fucking idea whats going on but he can hear everthing thats said as the crewman lowers the binoculars in disbelief son of a bitch
its dix the goddamn quarterback
hallenbecks face goes through various stages of shock
its nothing compared to when he hears theres a little girl with him
with that he goes berserk
draws his legs back thunders them against the compart ment doors
kicks with all his might
over and over like a crazed horse as air one does a flyby circling awaiting instructions
milo grabs the hand mike and says air one air one follow the senator roger
ill take the sport boat you take baynard over
thats a roger
over and out
turns to his men okay lets go
with a final resounding crash hallenbeck kicks open the compartment
topples out onto the cabin floor
works his bound hands over his knees so theyre now tied in front of him
everybodys topside for the moment at least he is forgotten
he half crawls half lurches over to the kitchen nook
worms beneath the table
drags out the can of gasoline
tries to unscrew the top
cant get a grip
finally in frustration he tips the can on its side
brings his legs up in the air slams them down on the can
over and over until with a metallic pop
floods gasoline over the carpet meanwhile milos yacht is plowing ahead gaining on jimmys hatteras
the crew members take up positions on the prow
as he throws darian to the deck shields her with his body
the wheelhouse is raked by gunfire
he grits his teeth
reaches beneath his tux
yanks out the beretta and returns fire bam bam
and meanwhile hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his teeth
dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet
he releases the box
picks up a single match in his teeth
presses his face to the wall
gives his neck a wrench lights the match
he drops the match on top of the gas can
a whoosh of combustion
it bursts into flame
joe swivels around
balancing on his backside
thrusts his legs into the fire
sweat runs in rivers
until the ropes binding his legs snap
he lurches to his feet lets free
now theres only one problem hes on fire
the legs of his pants are soaked with gas
flames race up his legs
he plunges headlong up the stairs
where he hurtles toward the rail dives into the sea swallowed by the waves
a crewman suddenly screams fire in the hole
its a rapidly spreading blaze
the pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire and meanwhile surfaces gasping for air
trying to swim with his hands tied
spots him first
sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean screams daddy
jimmy whirls around startled
i dont believe it
jimmy spins the wheel
banks hard to port
brings the boat around in an arc
yells to darian keep the wheel like this
dont let it move
she grabs the wheel
jimmy bends down
opens a compart ment
takes out the boats anchor
metal hook attached to seventy yards of chain
he hefts it like a grappling hook
third and long baby lets go
and sure his left arm isnt his good arm but boy does he heave that anchor
it soars through space chain playing out behind it
hits water thirty yards past hallenbeck who turns sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves
milo meanwhile has also spotted hallenbeck
he growls in rage
hefts the ingram machine gun as hallenbeck thrusts forward hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh
he is catapulted forward jerked like a rag puppet
bullets chop the water where he just was
he skims over the waves
trailing behind jimmy at fifty miles an hour
jimmy and darian begin to haul him in
the boat rushing headlong driverless
with a last desperate surge of energy they drag hallenbeck over the side
into the boat
she collapses weeping atop her father
hugs him for all shes worth
what the hells she doing here
i stowed away
gunfire splits the air
reminds them theyre not out of the woods
is behind them again
the fire is out
the chase is on
it steadily cuts the distance
hallenbeck staggers to his feet
get below darian
and stay there
he stumbles into the wheelhouse
got any ideas
go really fast and hope they dont catch us
beat oh shit
fog bank dead ahead
into the fog they go and folks this is really scary
because you cant see a foot in front of your face
they plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour
hallenbeck sweats eyes glued to the windshield
and then a shape materializes off to port milos yacht
hallenbeck wrestles the wheel
the yacht draws ever closer
men on deck
joe looks over
and his face tells the story were dead
except just then a strange thing happens milos yacht veers off to the left
away from hallenbeck
jimmy stares dumbfounded
what the fuck
theyre peeling off
then it hits joe like a thunderbolt cause they got sonar thats why
hard to port
the boat slews to the left as from out of the fog the catalina ferry looms right in front of them
shit fuck piss
they almost make it
as it is they avoid a head on
instead they hit broadside
a sickening crunch
jimmy and joe are thrown from their feet
a momentary glimpse of faces rushing past horrified tourists and then the ferry is behind them
jimmy gets up
staggers to the controls
pushes the throttle
the boat lurches forward then sputters
he swears violently
were on half power we lost an engine
the crippled boat chugs through the mist
bangs his fist
were sitting ducks
they got sonar
they can find us
kill the running lights and radio the coast guard
jimmy flicks off the lights
grabs the mike
as he does a vibrating rumble fills the cockpit causing him to pause
and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog and air one hovers directly overhead
the two men watch helpless as the helicopter descends the co pilot taking aim with a laws rocket
they both hit the floor
hands over their heads and then the pilot makes a costly error he descends right into the path of milos yacht
with no warning whatsoever the boat comes bursting out of the fog plows right into the helicopter
second number one the boat pierces the chopper rips it to shreds
second number two the whole boat slash chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass
turns night into day
are still huddled on the floor
they look up
there was a big light
why arent they dead
they move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window
stare in disbelief
joe looks at jimmy
jimmy at joe
debris rains down
jimmy joe and darian are on deck chugging through the wreckage
darian clings to her fathers arm in shock
hallenbeck sees something in the distance
squints whats that
jimmy looks a bright object
going in circles
thats baynards boat
nods it can get us to shore faster than this one dont you think
he starts to turn away
notices something in the water
speaks over his shoulder to jimmy
hand me the pole
jimmy hands him a long wooden pole with a hooked end
he fishes in the water
snares a large floating object
swings it aboard
drops it at jimmys feet
what is it
he turns away
jimmy bends to open the suitcase
joe heads into the cockpit darian beside him
steers the boat away from the crash site
toward the senators boat
chugs forward on half an engine
jimmy suddenly yells holy fucking shit
the once mighty marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist
half the cockpit is blown away probably by a laws rocket
the hatteras pulls up alongside and hallenbeck steps to the rail carrying the baretta
he swings aboard the senators boat
enters the cockpit
whats left of the roof is bullet pocked
the navigator is dead
slumped over the controls
joe pulls him off the panel
kills the engine
joe bursts inside
hard and fast
its a slaughterhouse
the walls are perforated
baynard and his men are dead
the suitcases evil twin lies unopened on the table
hallenbeck walks over to baynards lifeless body
stares into the wide open eyes
life in the big city
the senators boat pulls up to the dock
no one is around
hallenbeck crouches next to darian looks her in the eye
im gonna go get your mom back okay
youre gonna go in the dennys restaurant and stay there
talk to the waitress but dont mention me
mom and i will come pick you up later got it
crying theyre gonna kill you
are you kidding
i do this for a living
hands her a twenty buy me an ice cream
ill be back
beat i love you
she throws her arms around him
all business now
jimmy and joe stare ahead through the windshield
in the back seat sits the coveted suitcase
your prints are all over that boat
what happens when they find the bodies inside
quit being a fuckin killjoy
he cuts the headlights
cruises to a stop behind a road side dumpster
weve got some things to pick up
they creep across a suburban lawn hugging the shadows
across the street hallenbecks house is dark
truly a sight jimmy in a white shirt and tuxedo pants nursing a broken arm and joe drenched to the skin pants hanging in scorched tatters
joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand
crouched behind a eucalyptus tree
joe points a late model buick is parked just up the street from his house
there is a man slouched inside
someones staking me out
clears his throat oh i forgot to tell you
the police want you for killing mike miller
hallenbeck shoots him a withering look
a coast guard cutter is circling the site of the boat chopper crash
a uniformed ensign shines a light on the dark waters
i think i got someone
is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage
half his hair is burned away
his face is blistered
he looks up pleading at the ensign as he hides the ingram beneath his body cocked and ready
the sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity the pot to piss in
he undoes his fly
pees into an old maxwell house coffee can
opens the door to dump it out
a hand reaches in lightning quick
grabs the can throws it back in his face
as he jerks backward blinded the hand knocks him cold
hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car
lets get him inside and tie him up
are you crazy
thats a cop
you dont punch cops
the cop is bound and gagged in the corner
hallenbeck moves hurriedly
not a second to waste
pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer
rips off the sleeve
throws it to jimmy
he strips off his own shirt
crosses to the closet
you know how to use a gun
the triggers the little black thing
he hands jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd black cylinders
equipped with an explosive charge
when you fire the gun they spray on impact
take out anything within ten yards
what are you gonna use
a little souvenir
he reaches into the closet
pulls out a sniper rifle
the one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest
go bring the car around
jimmy emerges starts across the lawn
pulls up short
stares ahead at parked at the curb
he starts to cry out and a dark figure looms behind him
clubs him in the head
hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle
stuffs extras into a black windbreaker
hears a noise
looks up expecting jimmy draws a sharp breath standing in the doorway
all of them have guns
pablo grins shakes his head face it pal
youre fucked by god
as theyre placed in front of hallenbeck
he is seated on the bed
three guns covering him
beside him sits furry tom grinning his stuffed toy grin
are you a literate man joe
i got a subscription to jugs magazine
see joe what youre gonna do youre gonna write a little story
a goon sticks his head in the door
weve got jimmy dix in the trunk
get him out of here
take him to mr
ill follow you as soon as my business here is finished
the goon departs leaving hallenbeck with pablo and two others
he studies them
calculates the odds
yeah youre gonna write a little story joe
about how guilt stricken you are over senator baynards death which is all over the air waves by the way
youre so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him that youre gonna kill yourself
hey whos writing this story
youre doing all the good parts
oh and joe
dont forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered
pablo draws his pistol
pumps two shots into the unconscious cop in the corner
you son of a bitch
pablo is making a big mistake but he doesnt know it
he is fueling joe hallenbecks rage
pity the fool
hallenbeck regards him with dead lifeless eyes
a thoroughly unnerving stare
then joe does something very odd
he says softly we dont like pablo very much do we furry tom
there is a pause
and then incredibly furry tom answers
a high pitched squeaky stuffed cat voice
as furry tom no mr
hallenbeck we think pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass
pablo is completely thrown so are we for that matter
and then it hits us joe is doing ven triloquism
and the funny thing is hes really good
pablo overcomes his shock
shit is he doing that
hallenbecks face remains cold
furry tom tell pablo what im gonna do to him
as furry tom youre gong to make pablo eat all his teeth mr
pablo cant help it
he bursts out laughing
thats amazing man
hallenbeck picks up furry tom
inserts his hand makes the furry head bob back and forth
as furry tom hey mr
hallenbeck theyre laughin at me
thats not very nice
by now all three hoods are in hysterics
are you mad furry tom
as furry tom i dont get mad
i get even
and with that furry toms mouth opens and explodes showering stuffing
one of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone
and furry thomas belches fire again and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood and if you havent guessed already joe has a gun hidden inside furry
pablo is a little sharper
a little quicker
he dives forward knocks the puppet from joes hand
joe drives upward into pablos gut
they reel across the room
locked in combat
pablo slams joes head into the wall
leaves a dent
does it again a sickening impact
starts to strangle joe and the truth is joes not thirty anymore
hes not going to make it
the world swims away
then as if through a tunnel joe notices something beside him
something hanging on the wall
fights to focus
identifies the object
his presidential medal of valor
it hits him quite suddenly the medal has sharp edges
with the last of his strength he plucks it from the wall
drives it into pablos throat
the big man stumbles backward
he thrashes the red white blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck
drops to the dusty carpet
hallenbeck takes a deep breath
he is surrounded by corpses
he takes another deep breath
picks up the sniper rifle
slings it over his shoulder
heads for the door
jimmy dix is on the floor and marcon is kicking him savagely
pointed alligator boots lashing out
again and again
you know i dont enjoy doin this jim
jimmy curls up in a fetal ball
marcon paces shaking his head
i remember how much you hated the pain
you got hooked on demerol didnt you
ill make a deal with you
tell me who you talked to and ill give you all the painkillers you can swallow
now see id love to believe you
but we are talking about the future of my football team
he crosses to the fireplace
removes a poker
and aint nothin more important than my ball club cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs
got one of yours you know
softly whod you talk to jimmy
marcon raises the poker
brings it down on jimmys broken arm
hallenbeck leaves the rented subaru by the side of the road
he is dressed in combat black
rifle over one shoulder
hunting knife in a hip scabbard
like an angel of death he moves into the brush
heading down the canyon
an armed sentry patrols the grounds
below him nighttime l
stretches to the pacific
joe hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees
clamps a gloved hand over the sentrys mouth
drives the hunting knife into his back
marcon stirs the fireplace logs stoking the blaze
replaces the poker
crosses to his desk and sits
jimmy is on the carpet delirious
out of it
marcon presses a button
an armed hardguy appears
hes nothing he cant hurt us
take him somewhere and kill him
the hardguy crosses the room
grips jimmy by the shoulders
with a soft spit of sound his forehead blooms crimson
he collapses lifeless
at his desk marcon whirls stunned as steps through the french doors behind him
he resembles nothing human
a demon in black
gun held loosely
an extension of his arm
marcon reaches for the button to summon help
he jams the rifle barrel into marcons throat nearly crushing his larynx
hisses the gun is silenced ill fuckin kill you
wheres my wife
i dont remember i
joe shoves on the gun
the barrel chokes him
grabs a pen
shoves it in marcons hand
milos film studio
write it down dumbfuck
he speaks over his shoulder jimmy you okay
hurts like hell
marcon finishes writing
hallenbeck snatches up the address
stows it in his pocket
okay connie youre gonna walk us out of here nice and easy got it
beat can you walk jimmy
i think so joe behind you
a revolver is cocked a foot from joes head
its the same odd voice we heard earlier
the man with the speech impediment
you drop it asshole or i kill marcon
the strange man chuckles
sorry but that wont work
i dont care if he lives or dies now drop the gun
once more joe calculates the odds
he places the rifle on the desk
walk over there by your friend joe
hallenbeck turns around
and for once his jaw drops
hes looking at a man he never thought hed see again
a man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the georgetown turnpike eight years ago
son of the late senator
the right side of his face doesnt quite match the left
the muscles dont work
hallenbeck recovers his composure
as jimmy climbs to his feet joe walks over and stands next to him
two gunmen appear behind them covering the rear
hows the head lou
aside from permanent facial neuralgia just lovely
next time lou just say no
this is the drunk guy you slugged look what you did to his face
marcon meanwhile is positively livid
he snaps at baynard you son of a bitch you were gonna let him kill me
nothing more or less than youd do for me conrad
turns i never thought id see you again joe
speaking of which what the fuck are you doing here
call it a financial partnership
for a price i agreed to connect mr
marcon to the necessary people in washington
in other words you dropped your fathers name a bunch of times
ignores him but imagine my delight this morning joe when mr
marcon informed me of a golden opportunity a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime
what can i say inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain who could resist
do i also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess
sighs it was i unfortunately who bought a forty dollar bottle of champagne
spoke a little too freely to that hooker
she wasnt a hooker dickhead
he should know jimmy
with a face like that hes gotta be paying for it
you can die fast or slow so watch your mouth
jimmy chimes in wed rather watch yours
its goofy lookin
marcon has had enough
he pounds his fist on the desk
kill them goddammit waste em both
any bright ideas joe
gimmee a minute
excuse me could you give him a minute
hes trying to think of a way out of this
behind them the two hardguys cock their guns
hes scared shitless underneath
hallenbeck clears his throat you know of course connie that youre a dead man
marcon holds up his hand
the gunmen lower their weapons
lets humor this asshole
what are you talking about
shrugs nothing much just that i made a phone call from the boat on the way in
you called the cops
fuck it they cant prove a thing
oh but i didnt call the cops
i called the mob
marcon stares at him
see connie every year the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking
if you succeed in making gambling legal all that money goes to the government
beat i wouldnt be surprised if they put out a contract on you
of course i might be able to call it off
marcon stares him down
then marcon smiles
hes not connected to the mob what a load of horseshit
nice try asshole
waves his hand kill them
plowing ahead then theres the matter of two million dollars
or didnt you know that watertight suitcases float
he once again looks marcon in the eye
ive got your money connie
stashed in the back of a rented subaru
well take you to it
laughing jesus i dont believe it
this guys a riot
sotto i dont think its working joe
try another one
hell im fresh out
you wanna try one kid go for it
then without warning jimmy turns and slugs hallenbeck with his good arm
fuck you joe im not just gonna stand here and die
marcon hes lying
we do have the money but its not in a car its in a storage locker
i have the key on me
il hand it over if you let me go
hallenbeck stares in disbelief
the kids actually trying something
where is the key jimmy
its stashed in my shorts
nods all right
slow and easy
slow and easy
jimmy reaches inside his jeans
slowly cautiously pulls something out concealed in his fist
we see but marcon doesnt its a shredder shell
he holds it in his fist
promise youll let me go
hell with that son
hand it over or ill have you kneecapped
well thats too bad
see its one of those new plastic keys
the kind that melt
and with that he hurls it into the fire
so fast that nobody can see just what he threw
i guess nobody gets the money
the two hardguys rush to the fireplace
pull it out of there
one of them grabs a pair of tongs and the shredder explodes
sprays the two hardguys
cuts them to ribbons
then several things happen at once everybody goes for a gun
hallenbeck lunges scoops up a fallen pistol as marcon draws his gun and fires missing joe returns fire bam bam
catches marcon in the shoulder and meanwhile
baynard draws down on jimmy who picks up a flaming log and hurls it knocks the shot wild as marcon darts out the french doors into the night so hallenbeck
spins fires at baynard blows him backward in a bloody spray
baynard sags against the mantel
jimmy and joe are alone with three corpses
jimmy snatches up a pistol
joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder
stares at jimmy plastic keys
the kind that melt
short notice best i could do
you did fine junior
learned it from a pro
the wooden garage doors explode outward bursting to splinters as a ford bronco drives right through them conrad marcon at the wheel
he careens off into the night
makes a getaway
jimmy and joe come racing out of the house just in time to see marcons taillights disappearing up the canyon
son of a bitch
forget about him
lets get my wife
he crosses to a parked mercedes
shoots open the door
pops the ignition package
the car roars to life
hes so slick its scary
the mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage doors
burns rubber down the hill
they stare straight ahead
on my way honey on my way
conrad marcon meanwhile is rocketing along the winding road heading up the canyon when he sees something ahead sitting abandoned in the roadside brush
acting on a sudden hunch he slams on the brakes
stops the car
gets out crosses to the rental
a two million dollar suitcase sits pretty as punch on the back seat
shit joe boy you wasnt bluffing
he draws his gun
blows out the glass
opens the car door
snatches up the briefcase
a block of seedy looking brick buildings
not many people at this hour
slews around the corner races down the street running without headlights
lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley
jimmy and joe burst from the car guns in hand
hellenbeck is grim purposeful
jimmy is nervous
im new at this joe
how do we do it
we get in we get out
shoot anyone whos not my wife
check that dont shoot me
he jacks a fresh clip into his rifle
inserted in the latch of a back door
hallenback finds the tumblers
springs the lock in seconds
jimmy and joe
side by side
they round a bend in the hall
seated outside a wooden door
special in a shoulder rig
sees them leaps to his feet gun clearing leather joe blows him out of his socks
two shot burst
guy hits the wall
paints it with blood
jimmy and joe step over him
joe braces himself
draws back his foot
kicks the door as
the door flies open
doesnt hit the wall
something stops it
joe doesnt blink
he puts the rifle against the panel
fires three shots through the wood
a body falls out from behind the door
joe doesnt even look
the body sits up
not dead yet
jimmy comes through the door
one more door to go
it isnt locked
joe yanks it open
the wrong kind of action
on a bed naked
bright lights on her
around her a director
with a chainsaw
and hes standing right over her
jimmy blows down the two artistes
joe takes the actor
he throws the hunting knife
it pierces the guys neck
the chainsaw clatters to the floor
he does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks
and then mercifully its over
joe crosses to the bed puts out an arm and sarah collapses against him shaking with sobs
he strokes her hair
speaking to the only woman hes ever loved im here
its all right
he cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse
sarah is now dressed as joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen mercedes
he turns to jimmy
hands him a set of keys
drive one of their cars
they wont be needing them
where do you want me to go
the two million bucks is still in the subaru
parked on mulholland above marcons house
go pick it up and bring it to the office
were gonna go get darian
he moves off into the parking lot
hallenbeck says to sarah
ill take you and darian to the office
you can sleep there
why cant we go home
theres four corpses in the bedroom
its a very tiny oh
in the shadow of the freeway
the night wears on
from the billboard gorgeous continues to entice
darian is asleep cradled in her mothers arms
her mother is awake cradled in joes arms
jimmy should be here any minute
then we gotta talk to the cops
sarah nestles into the crook of his arm
will the police catch marcon
hes probably in some secret crash pad packing to leave town
a pause then sarah says i remember when we got married
my friends would talk about their husbands
theyd say oh my husband is a big time publisher or my husband is a brilliant lawyer
i used to say my husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking
dont knock it
its a skill
looks into his eyes
i want to try joe
do you still want to try
he leans in and kisses her tenderly
and with typically swell timing a set of headlights rakes across the window accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher
looks like the local constable has come to chat
shall we invite him in
ill deal with it
he gets up throws on a jacket
joe exits the office starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light
realizes with a sudden shock somethings wrong
thats not l
the insignia on the door panel reads long beach shore in the same glance he sees theres a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat and worse much worse than
that milo is in the drivers seat
milo who steps out of the car and promptly opens fire on joe
son of a bitch
he dives for cover the turf erupting all around him as sarah sits bolt upright
darian comes awake screaming mommy whats happening
sarah leaps off the couch cradling darian and meanwhile hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support legs as bullets chop it to splinters
like a robot
he is obsessed
all vestige of sanity gone
you fucked up my face joseph
joe starts to climb
scales the wooden structure
swings himself onto the raised platform
flattens behind the billboard
dont try to hide joseph
ive got all night you fucked up my face
he sprays a burst of gunfire up at the billboard
huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward
through the wooden frame
a hot slug rips through joes arm
an eruption of blood
he hisses in pain
rolls away from the gunfire
sees a painters bucket lying nearby
he counts to three
milo calmly changes clips
hallenbeck bursts from cover
hurls the bucket down at milo dashes across the front of the billboard hard and fast bullets chopping the board right behind him blowing holes in gorgeouss derrierre and then
joe does a risky thing he sprints to the end of the billboard running full tilt and he leaps out into space what the hell is he doing
hes trying to make the freeway
its a good fifteen feet
try it sometime
he flies through open air milos gun chattering below seeking him out and just does make it
hits the freeway surface and collapses forward screaming as he rolls on his injured arm
looks up is headed straight for him bearing down
he rolls aside just in time
it thunders past
staggers to his feet frantic and milo is climbing the billboard
hallenbeck looks for a place to hide
there isnt any
hes going to have to run through traffic
he shifts from foot to foot searching for an opening and meanwhile jimmy dix is actually on the freeway driving when he looks across the center divider and sees hallenbeck
i dont fucking believe it
he swerves over to the side and meanwhile watches in dismay as milo climbs onto the platform
walks across the front of the billboard
toward the freeway
joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground
milo puts up an arm catches a glancing blow
all it does is piss him off
you ruined my flesh
hallenbeck dives flat to the road as milo opens up again a chattering burst of gunfire
the muzzle flash is blinding
the windshield of a passing car shatters the driver panics the car spins out of control slews across the road in the middle of traffic
explosions of glass
slides straight toward hallenbeck
he dives aside rolls to his feet and hes right in milos sights
my friends the fat lady just sang
except another lady says different a single gunshot splits the air
milos chest explodes with bubbling blood
turns staring in disbelief at below on the lawn
she aims joes service revolver and says you just fucking die
she fires again and milo reels backward
leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard
she drops the hammer again and again
empties the gun
milo jerks and twitches
racked by gunfire
paints a bloody stripe across the billboard making gorgeouss bloody buns even bloodier clutches himself
looks over at hallenbeck
shes something isnt she
milo pitches forward
falls to his death
stares dumbfounded at sarah
she look up at him
a moment passes between them
around hallenbeck a sea of crumpled cars
amidst it all he stands
jimmy winds his way through the cars
walks up to joe
they stand in silence for a moment then jimmy says the cars over on the other side
cmere i want to show you something
jimmy and joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented subaru
jimmy points to the shattered window
somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat
had to be marcon right
there is a pause
they both stare at the car
down the drain
except after a beat
they begin to laugh
first chuckling then chortling
now its go for broke
jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk you can guess whats inside
son of a bitch got the wrong one
on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite
signed by joe montana no less
bustles back and forth shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag
puts it near the door
crosses to the bed where the other suitcase lies
looks at it
cant help himself
he reaches out
flicks the latch
there is a note taped to the inside marcons flaming corpse is blown out through the glass along with his earthly possessions
he plummets like a meteor
two ten year old black boys are walking down the street
out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers
quite suddenly without warning a football drops out of the sky
hits and bounces very high comes down
rocks back and forth
the kids look up puzzled
searching the sky
the ball sits there
only slightly scorched
tentatively almost like hes afraid of being caught one of the boys bends down
looks both ways
picks up the ball
then as if by some unspoken agreement the other boy starts to run
slowly at first then faster
a slant pattern heading for the mailbox
and at midnight on december nd the san pedro street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass
their laughter is joyful
they will grow up to be sports heroes
hallenbeck sits impassively while bessalo paces fuming
you got a lot of questions to answer
youll probably lose your license
bessalo glares at him
do you care
my wife loves me
bessalo looks at him like hes grown a tail
another blistering hot december day
gorgeous looks on from her perch cheerful as ever despite the crusted brown stripe on her ass
the suitcase sits on a table
jimmy and joe contemplate it over a bottle of seagrams v
clears his throat you gonna keep it
some of it
opens the case
reaches in and plucks out two crisp bills
stuffs them in a pocket
jimmy stares at him
shrugs my fee
he shuts the case
shoves it toward jimmy
jimmy leans forward eyeing the suitcase
i got all the money i need
he shoves it back into the center
im thinkin i could use a partner
beat think you could handle that for awhile
i maybe could handle that
he pours a drink
raises his glass on high alex the detective
a uniformed man is emptying the please give jar when he notices a suitcase lying against the wall
under a poster that says the goal a cure in our lifetime
he bends down
opens the suitcase
when the money is counted there will be
a note is taped to the inside
jimmy and joe walk side by side
away from us
palms wave lazily
a sweaty santa rings a bell
see jim the thing is life sucks
but you still cant be hangin around satan claus you know why
cause someday compadre
satan claus and santa claus are gonna have a big fight and you know what
beat santas gonna kick some royal ass
he puts a fatherly arm around jimmys shoulder grins hey
smile you fuck
