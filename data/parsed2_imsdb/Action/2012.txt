written by roland emmerich harald kloser second draft february th we listen to the immortal music of mozarts adagio of the clarinet concerto in a
space infinite and empty
but then slowly all nine planets of our solar system move into frame and align
the last of them is the giant burning sphere of the sun
just as the sun enters frame a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds
the eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space
mozarts concerto filters from a jeeps stereo fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain
frederic west listens to the music
an indian boy playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle
the professor turns to his driver pointing to the boy
but its too late
the jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed sinking the boys toy ship
in the background the jeep stops in front of a building
the driver jumps out leading the professor towards its entrance
the sign at the door reads institute for astrophysics university of new delhi
an endless mine shaft
an old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt
west steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous dr
how deep are we
used to be an old copper mine professor sir
west follows satnam he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab
helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions
but that is not what worries me
they enter a large room with low hanging ceilings
a small group of white coats look up from their computers which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier
there was a new solar storm so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe
how can that be
we dont know professor sir
satnam walks over into another room
there he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises
the neutrinos suddenly act like
west slowly steps closer
when he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling his face goes pale
a major fund raising party is under way
the setting is spectacular
a terrace overlooking the washington mall and the capitol building
adrian helmsley stands with a group of young political aides
he is the only african american among them
one of the aides spots carl anheuser white house chief of staff working the crowd
look at anheuser
anyone would think he was president
did you hear he wants us to sign in and out like school boys
i still cant believe that wilson chose him of all people to run the white house
anheuser owns the senate and the congress
shame hes such a pompous ass
somebody mention my name
adrian turns to see anheuser smiling
which one is it
we were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight
well done sir
its helmsley right
ill remember that
anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile
that guy scares the shit out of me
at that moment adrians cell phone rings
into the phone professor west
ive been trying to reach you
west is on the phone
in the background we make out satnams family around the dining room table
the situation is much worse than we thought
satnam quiets his little son
it is the boy we saw earlier with his toy ship
adrian follows anheuser through a hallway of the white house papers in hand
sir the president needs to know this
helmsley how long have you been on the job as science advisor
four months this week
i would say thats enough time to learn that we have rules here
youll just have to wait until the quarterly science briefing
if this is about what i said last night i am truly sorry sir
so you didnt like my speech
exasperated adrian holds out the papers to him
can you please have a look at this sir
its really important
finally anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts to walk away reading
suddenly he slows down
who wrote this
an indian astrophysicist i graduated with from harvard and prof
west the preeminent geologist in the us
who else knows about it
no one sir
lets keep it that way helmsley
anheuser walks away
riot police control the unruly crowd with water cannons
we see protesters with anti globalization signs behind a fence
a convoy of limousines is approaching a historic building
we follow the american delegation into the conference room where the other g delegations are seated around an enormous table
the president of the united states thomas f
wilson doesnt sit down
he addresses the room and everybody goes quiet
for the first time we see the presidents face
he is african american
i hereby present a motion to meet privately with my seven fellow heads of state kindly excluding the rest of the delegates
a murmur erupts
the russian president sergey makarenko whispers to one of his interpreters
makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present
president wilson looks over to the russian colleague
president judging from the conversations weve had in the past i can assure you your english is absolutely fine for what i have to say
as the russian president waves his interpreter away all the international delegates leave as well
the huge doors of the hall close
a secret service officer in the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the chamber
the president gathers himself
six months ago i was made aware of a situation so devastating that at first i refused to believe it
however through the concerted efforts of the brightest scientists of several nations we have now confirmed its validity
the world as we know it will soon come to an end
a huge chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic mountain valley in tibet
we are at the top of the world
a chinese colonel wearing dark sun glasses watches from the chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and monasteries
in chinese you will have new houses electricity and running water
someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks
some among you will even have the chance to work for the glorious peoples republic of china building the biggest dam project in the world
neng pang a young monk is loaded into a truck together with his parents both in their s
nengs older brother lin pang is part of a huge crowd of young men and women staying behind by a tibetan school building
he turns and yells after the truck
i will send you money mother
the colonel with the dark glasses steps up addressing the masses
who can read and write
eager hands fly up in the air
an official makes notes
who can weld
lins hand shoots up in the air
we hear a siren echoing through the mountains and suddenly an explosion
in the background a series of explosions punch enormous holes into the side of the mountain showering rock everywhere
a man in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the dorchester looking like your typical mi agent
the decor is plush and luxurious
hes stopped by two security men who frisk him
heavily ringed fingers flip through a folder
has his highness had the opportunity to study the dossier
a saudi prince looks up and nods without expression
you must understand i have a very big family
mister isaacs one billion dollars is a lot of money
im afraid the amount is in euros your highness
a group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous renaissance paintings
they stop at the mona lisa
manfred picard head of the french national museums stands by laura a young african american woman in her late s
they observe the specialists opening the case of the famous painting
a whoosh of air as the vacuum seal breaks
laura im putting a lot of trust in your people
laura answers in almost perfect french
there are too many crazy people who could hurt her manfred
the world heritage foundation has done this all over the world
in the background the mona lisa is taken off the wall and replaced with a perfect replica
picard still looks uneasy
he watches as the real mona lisa is sealed into an airtight case
and shell be safe now
tucked away in the swiss alps
picard looks suspicious but says nothing
the camera moves in on the face of the fake mona lisa until all we see is her mysterious smile
lifeless bodies encircle a huge fire pit
they resemble the rays of the sun
in the background we see the famous step pyramids of tikal
the mass suicide was discovered by a bbc documentary crew in the ancient mayan city of tikal
many of the dead are women and children looking peaceful and are surrounded by colorful flowers
the victims were said to have adhered to the mayan quiche calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the st of december this year due to the
suns destructive forces
the camera slowly pulls out and we are in
a shabby apartment in silverlake
the tv is on
strangely enough scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history
a small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face of jackson curtis pops up from behind the couch
he fell asleep at his laptop last night
one look at his watch and he is off running
he throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag
his cell phone rings
what do you mean
im not late
its not even
jackson turns off the tv and darts towards the door stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack
as he turns he stumbles over a stack of books all shrink wrapped and identically titled farewell atlantis
into the phone kate im on my way
for gods sake
frustrated he kicks them out of his way and exits
we hold on the books and realize that jacksons photograph is on their back covers
the phone call continues as jackson opens the garage door struggling to pack his old suv with camping equipment
theyre kids kate going on vacation
its not a doctors appointment
its supposed to be fun
you remember that right
he tries to start the engine but the battery is dead
frustrated he hits the steering wheel
jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the curb
i know its mosquito season at yellowstone kate
ill pick some up on the way
he notices a deep crack in the asphalt
his neighbors an elderly couple stand there and stare at it
merrill we should move back to wisconsin
jackson gets into the limo and speeds off
jackson drives through la with the radio on
those shake proof coffee mugs are a genius idea and they just show the true nature of us californians
we pass a family frantically loading boxes into a van
well not bow to little inconveniences like these so called mini quakes
jackson passes a man in a wheelchair
hes holding up a cardboard sign repent the end is near
jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale westwood home
if you have a funny mini quake story you wanna share call lisa randy at
jackson switches the radio off
two kids noah and lilly come running down the driveway
they slow down as they see the limo
jackson what is this
dont call me jackson noah im your father
lilly yells from inside the limo
daddys got space busters in the car
and space busters
their mother kate curtis a beautiful woman appears
so what youre a chauffeur now
what happened to the temp work
this is better hours for me
means i can still write
kates new boyfriend gordon silberman pulls out of the garage in his porsche wearing his bluetooth
on the phone simone how many times have i told you we dont do lipo on fridays
its too messy
jackson smiles bitterly
gordon waves at the kids
have fun guys
and watch out for those bears
to jackson nice car
jackson waves grudgingly as gordon pulls away
noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day
she follows jackson to the car with a bag of pull up diapers
and lilly has to put these on before she goes to sleep
he shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel
she looks at him seriously
jackson theyve been really looking forward to this you know
dont let them down
he nods as the car pulls away
harry helmsley and his partner tony delgado board an enormous cruise ship the freedom of the seas
harry is african american tony is italian
he carries a large case
they pass a poster jazz night with harry helmsley tony delgado
so this time well hit the japs
well tony electronics are cheap there and
you could visit your boy will
tony shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single ladies on sun loungers
they smile back coyly
are you even listening to me
yes unfortunately i am harry
i heard from audrey youre a grandpa now
why dont you keep your nose out of my family
youre cramping my style
he married a japanese girl how is that the end of the world
you should at least go see him
do you see your boy
not as much as id like
dc is a long way
but at least we talk
life how short it is
suddenly theyre thrown off balance by a large swell that pulls the massive freedom of the seas away from the landing about ten yards
the next moment the ship slams back against the dock with an earthshaking boom
what the hell was that
a murmur goes through the crowd
luckily nobody is injured
the phone rings twice before laura switches on a light
we catch a glimpse of a framed photo of her and adrian
she answers the phone
they lied to us
manfred is that you
picard is speeding in his peugeot anxiously checking his rear view mirror
i had my suspicions
i should have said something
they are following me
they may be listening to us too
laura the heritage foundation is a sham
picards car approaches a tunnel
the art you collected its not in the alps
the peugeot enters a tunnel
then where is it
a huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes
singing along to the we all live in a yellow submarine
theyre driving through the glorious landscape of yellowstone national park
noah sits in the back with headphones on playing space busters
as they pass over a ridge the music station is overpowered by a talk show filtering through
we hear a raspy and excitable voice
after what is going on in la la land with all those surface cracks i told myself get your stupid ass to yellowstone
i dont want to miss all the great fun when it finally blows
lilly reaches for the dial of the radio
what happened to the music
hang on sweet pea let daddy listen to this for a moment
jackson corrects the dial to get better reception
theres been government people flying in and out all morning
and trust me they did not look happy
a huge black helicopter brushes over the limo
folks always remember you heard it first from charlie
they watch in awe as the chopper disappears behind a ridge
laura bursts in and heads straight for the tv
the president looks up from his desk
you have to see this
sally the presidents secretary enters flustered
its alright sally
sally closes the door as laura turns up the tv
picard had been the director of the french national museums for years
as fate would have it his assassination took place in the same paris tunnel where princess diana died in
the president comes around his desk
laura looks at him distraught
i just talked to him dad
he told me the world heritage foundation is a sham
is that true
the president shoots an anxious look across the room
laura turns and suddenly realizes that adrian is standing in the corner
you knew too
you sleep with me and you didnt say anything
adrian looks ashamed
i cant even look at you
either of you
honey calm down
a man was killed
i want the truth dad
a dense forest trail
we hear lilly before we see her
daddy where are we going
to a very special place lilbee
its a lake
a place where mommy and daddy fell in love
winking to noah remember the book i gave you
i dont want to know where you and mom had sex
im not ready for that jackson
im your dad noah
jackson runs to catch up with lilly who has reached a fence with a keep out sign posted
this wasnt here before
jackson starts to climb the fence
dont you see the signs
its fine guys
jackson and his kids crest a ridge
they look down on a parched basin with cracked terrain
the whole darn lake is gone
i swear you guys there was a lake here
the kids roll their eyes
a puddle of water is all that remains of the lake
jackson and the kids walk into the basin unaware of being watched jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to have a closer look
elsewhere in the lake bed we see sand seeping through cracks in the ground
when he looks up he sees heavily armed soldiers coming towards them from all sides
its okay noh
through the binoculars we see jackson and his kids arrested and led over a ridge
with this we reveal an enormous research facility with hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling tower
adrian helmsley and prof
west exit the drilling tower both studying papers
adrian notices jackson and his kids nearby being interrogated by an officer
ill be with you in a second professor
adrian walks towards them
jackson stares at the officer with defiance
and then you climbed over a posted fence
just like that
i told you
isnt this supposed to be a national park
there shouldnt be fences
what are you guys doing around here anyway
jackson turns and sees adrian standing there
ill handle this officer
the officer reluctantly hands him jacksons license
so where did the lake go
thats what were trying to find out
we think this whole area has become potentially unstable
i would advise you to take your kids and leave mr
he throws a look at jacksons drivers license
he looks up at jackson with renewed interest
are you by any chance the jackson curtis the author of farewell atlantis
yeah thats me
jackson straightens up proudly
what a coincidence
im reading your book as we speak
first third around day when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space
youre one of lucky who bought it
actually i didnt buy it
my father gave it to me
oh i see
west waves at adrian from one of the container labs
adrian hands back jackson his drivers license
officer can you return them to the campgrounds please
to jackson pleasure to meet you mr
jackson and his kids look after adrian hurrying away
he was very nice
yes he was lilbee
jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when suddenly charlie frost a crazy looking guy with binoculars around his neck stands in their way
what did the government guys tell you
jackson looks at him instinctively picking up lilly
they think its not such a good idea to climb over their fences
they feel the area is unstable
charlie bursts out laughing
they say its unstable
with this he turns around and leaves
jackson is sitting on a camp chair right outside the tent
hes on his laptop looking enquiringly at an aerial picture of yellowstone on google earth
in the background we see the kids are in the tent
there are mosquitos in here
did anybody spray the tent
jackson looks up remembering he forgot the spray
well get some of that tomorrow
for tonight just put your head under the blankie
daddy you said you werent gonna work on your book
im not honey i promise
are you wearing your pull ups
lilly nods as jackson walks over and tucks her into bed
he kisses her good night
he turns and is surprised to see noah typing a text on his cell phone
did mommy buy you that
gordon gave it to me for my birthday
jackson takes the phone from out of noahs hands
things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family
jackson reads the message noah has typed hey gordon camping sucks
hurt jackson hands back the phone
go to sleep guys
the base packs up
adrian and prof
west duck low as they board a chopper
adrian is on the phone
you have to immediately inform the president mr anheuser
the readings look much worse than i expected
plus satnams neutrino figures from india confirm
we hear anheuser yelling
but you guys said
we were wrong
by five or six months
a second later the chopper lifts off
jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on the words chapter seven
but he cant concentrate on writing after what noah has said
a chopper flies overhead
jackson follows its path over the campsite and his eyes fall on an american flag fluttering on top of a massive radio antennae
this belongs to an rv truck
through the rvs window jackson sees the silhouette of charlie frost the guy with the binoculars speaking into a microphone
curious jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial
charlies voice we have a listener calling in
bill from cooke city youre on the charlie frost show
bills voice i wanted to know where will this all start
jackson is intrigued
he puts his laptop down
charlies voice well something like this could only originate in hollywood ha ha
but seriously theyve got the earth cracking under their asses already bill
jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the rv
he can still hear the radio
bills voice our family believes in the gospel of our lord jesus
we have nothing to fear charlie
charlies voice good for you bill good for you
charlie hits a switch
music starts playing
the doors the end
this is charlie frost reporting live from yellowstone national park soon to become the worlds largest active volcano
charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich when theres a knock on the door
jackson sticks his head in
mind if i join you
i only got a few minutes
charlie bites into his sandwich as jackson looks around at all the equipment
i just heard part of your broadcast
mind me asking a question
what exactly is it
that will start in hollywood
actually its gonna be the whole west coast
what are you talking about
the apocalypse the end of days
the mayans knew it the i ching and the bible kind of
charlie looks at his watch
i got to eat
just check my blog
you can download it for free
charlie clicks on his laptop
however we do take donations
a crudely animated film starts to play
charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion
in the year a cataclysmic event will unfold
caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every years
just imagine the earth as an orange
charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange
our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation that the core of the earth will melt thats the inside part of the orange leaving the crust of
our planet free to shift
on screen the middle of the orange shrinks now the skin moves freely around it
hapgood named it earth crust displacement
a faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen
and albert einstein endorsed it
the infamous photo of einstein sticking out his tongue
the forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice
the film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with water
charlie shuts the laptop
pretty neat huh
its a big hit on youtube
i did the animation myself
i know what youre thinking
but all the governments know about this
if they all knew dont you think somebody would tell us
just think about it
first the stockmarket would crash
charlie opens a can of beer
then the economy
and then the people in the streets
mimicking gun fire boom boom
pandemonium revolution war
they would never tell us
jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this
only if youre some sheik bill gates or maybe one of those russian billionaires do you stand a chance to buy a seat
theyre building spaceships man
one of my listeners a geography professor at utsc has even figured out where theyre building them
he sent me a map
charlie i think i gotta go
my kids are sleeping
charlie looks at him bug eyed
get them out of yellowstone man
its gonna get ugly here
as jackson exits charlie gets back on the air
sorry for the delay folks
but even in times like these a man has got to eat
the parking lot of gelsons is nearly empty
suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in place from an unseen force
a small crack creases the asphalt and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket
muzak is playing
kate and her boyfriend gordon are shopping late
she picks up some pull ups for lilly gordon steps up behind her wrapping his arms around her waist
why dont we make a baby
he reaches up and touches her breasts
were in public
gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment
honey i created them
and now suddenly i cant touch them
kate pushes him away and moves on
a few customers are paying at the checkout stand
behind them huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding into the ever widening crack in the parking lot
nobody inside notices
gordon catches up with kate
you always act strange after he shows up
just because i dont care for your arrogant humor doesnt mean im acting strange
he is the father of my kids
can i remind you what that guy did
first you gave up med school to have noah
then you practically raise him and lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk
some of his stuff is actually
hes published gordon
you know your mother was right
youve always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets
but not this time right sweetheart
kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup
the shelf in front of her shakes for a moment
did you see that
kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks around
gordon senses a problem between them
you know kate we have to keep working at this
because i wont end up being just a re run of you and jackson
i mean honey i feel like
something is pulling us apart
before gordon finishes his sentence a violent roar
from front to back the entire supermarket rips open right between kate and gordon
the few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge crevasse forming beneath them
kate and gordon are thrown up against opposite aisles holding on for dear life
they cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever widening crack
jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout
just stop scratching
youll get them infected
he smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does not look friendly
something for mosquito bites please
before or after
the woman looks at lilly and noah with their red lumps
id get before and after
she slams two mosquito products on the counter
birnbaum my teacher is on on the stores tv a heavy set blonde woman speaking to a reporter in front of gelsons
thats our supermarket
the gap in the ground is enormous now at least half a mile long and feet wide
kids we have to pack up and go find mommy
president wilson and anheuser walk towards the situation room
sir you have to initiate the boarding process immediately
is this even possible
whats our information from china
they estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch
the president is shocked by this news
if its alright with you sir ill brief the panel about the new development
id rather have adrian do that
they trust him
i told him to be in on the meeting
anheuser fumes as they enter the situation room
flat screens line the walls
a video conference is under way with each of the g members represented
ladies and gentlemen we all knew this day would come
but we never imagined it would come this soon
he looks over to adrian
i would like to pass this over to my science advisor adrian helmsley
adrian steps up and gathers himself
ill make this brief
pointing to a set of charts
according to our latest data from yellowstone the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth the cement that holds our landmass in place is increasing at a rapid rate
much faster than anticipated
all the heads of state are glued to his words
this causes extreme polar instability
the magnetic fields have decreased by more than over the last hours
the german chancellor a woman interrupts
how much time do we have mr
adrian glances to professor west standing in the back
two maybe three days if were lucky
the prime minister of italy breaks in upset
how can you speak about luck in such a situation
apologies prime minster
hes still new to the job
president wilson steps up
antonioni we have to make an immediate decision
we hear cheering and applause
introducing the pound muscle machine from the ukraine
the arena is filled to its max
the crowd is on its feet
and tonights challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world
here he is
mister zultan balashin
the crowd roars as the boxer and his entourage enter
the camera moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair
he is well built wearing designer clothing from head to toe
yuri karpov stereotypical russian oligarch
he approaches the ringside corner and whistles
the nervous boxer turns
in russian ah finally yuri
i thought i would not see you
yuri hits the boxers gloves
zultan is nervous
his coach steps in
he needs to concentrate now mister karpov
you shut up
when i talk to my boy understand
that is good
in russian to the zultan my friend
do not forget
we are fighters
we never go down
we always stay on our feet
zultan just keeps nodding pumping himself up
no matter who is hitting us
no matter how hard
the fight is on
now go kill the bastard
yuri walks to his seat sitting down next to his trophy tamara blonde wears the shortest mini one can imagine designer shoes handbag glasses and boobs
in her lap she holds caesar a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar
in the ring the boxers maul at each other
yuris cell phone beeps
its a text message yuris whole demeanor changes
without a word he gets up and walks out of the arena
where are you going
yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd
zultan the boxer notices yuri leave
in that split second distraction he is hit hard and goes down for the count
the crowd roars
jackson has driven all night
the sun rises a giant glowing orb
caltech believes that the incident in the westwood supermarket has released most of the surface tension
jackson pulls up
the kids are asleep
it looks like life in the city will soon be back to normal mayor gonzales said at an early morning news conference from his home in hancock park
jackson switches off the radio and wakes his kids gently
lilly were home sweetie
to noah wake up big man
kate heads to the car
still sleepy the kids grab their stuff and run into her arms
oh honey im so glad youre back
and you too darling
we tried calling but im hungry mummy
at least it looks like the mosquitos ate well
she looks at jackson and softens
wanna come in
gordon appears at the door
jackson watches painfully as noah runs and gives gordon a big hug
his cellphone beeps with a message
where are you curtis
yuri stands at a huge window overlooking the strip talking into his phone
back in westwood mister karpov
that is good
im sending the gulfstream to pick up alec and oleg
tamara hovers in the background packing her louis vuitton luggage
caesar her little dog watches from the bed
in russian tell him to bring caesars raincoat its in the range rover
yuri brushes her off
while talking to yuri jackson is standing in front of the open trunk changing into his chauffeur suit
curtis make sure you get my boys as fast you can
a palatial home
the twins alec and oleg wait impatiently
they are years old and wear identical clothing by dior
curtis you are late
jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the limo
the other twin notices his muddy sneakers
careful with our stuff
dont get it dirty
ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets singing songs and chanting about the end of days
a skinny man with a ponytail preaches from the scriptures
there will be famines pestilences and earthquakes sayeth the lord
jackson has to maneuver through the people
banners read prepare for the end you cannot escape his judgement alec looks up from his video game annoyed
curtis cant you go faster
are you guys blind
i cant run people over
theyre idiots anyway
jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look
jackson stops in front of the gulfstream
sasha yuris russian pilot is expecting them
took you a while
jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage dropping one of them on alecs foot on purpose
be more careful
the other twin has noticed jacksons intensions
he gets into his face
now youre laughing curtis
but we are going on a big ship
we will live
and you will die
oleg grins back at jackson as the jet door closes
the gulfstream taxis onto the runway
as jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots across the tarmac
we hold on his face as it hits him like a ton of bricks frantically jackson looks around and spots a man in overalls working on a twin engine cessna
he runs to him
where can i rent a plane
the man points to a shabby office building
kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids
gordon watches the governor on the news
with austrian just this morning my people at caltech told me that in the last hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in southern california which is very rare
the phone rings
kate picks up
jackson drives like crazy
kate we have to get out of la
ive rented a plane for us
get the kids ready
ill be there in five
the kids have plans today
are you kidding me
no im not
noah has music at and lil has karate
gordon rolls his eyes and mutters
not that wed expect him to remember
california is going down
pack up the kids
the governor just said were fine now
the governors a meathead how would he know anything
you gotta trust me over some politician
kate slams the phone down
lilly stops eating
mommy why are you so angry with daddy
because your daddy is a lunatic darling
on the tv the interview comes to an end
it looks to me like the worst is over
that moment a massive quake hits los angeles
everybody dives under the table
on tv the news casters and the governor do the same
a few seconds later the signal cuts out
gordon pulls kate and the kids close as the earth shakes violently for seconds
jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house
when he enters lilly immediately runs into his arms
the next tremor hits
cracks form on the kitchen floor
we have to leave
noah lets go
i think were safer here
the whole house rides up and down like on a wave
i think hes right
finally kate pushes her son out from under the table
they all scramble out of the house in a panic
kate is cut on the shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices
as they storm out of their front door the house crumbles behind them
get in the car
the whole street starts to buckle
left and right the houses are shaken and smashed like toys
just before the wave of destruction can reach them jackson tears out of the driveway
jackson maneuvers the limo through the crumbling neighborhood
right in front of their eyes streets disappear trees fall electrical lines snap
sewer pipes burst in front of the car
jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers
the limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac coming to a stop in front of a twin engine cessna
wheres the pilot
kate turns to gordon
gordon you know how to fly
had a couple lessons
did you cover taking off
thats good enough for me
they start running when jackson remembers something and heads back to the limo
he grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his laptop back inside it
jackson what are you doing
he jumps out of the car and races back after them
behind jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate
a gigantic fissure forms in the earth shooting towards santa monica airport
gordon fumbles with the controls jackson yells from the copilot seat
come on come on
pointing at the but im supposed to check all these first
jackson reaches over and slams gordons hand down and the plane lurches forward
as the cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes down and explodes
noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them
guys behind us
as the plane accelerates the giant crack closes in on them
gordons hand trembles on the throttle control
everybody screams on top of each other
gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever
the plane almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them gives way
they hover for a moment almost caught in mid air as the widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the bowels of the earth
gordon fights to maintain control but they begin to be pulled down
the daylight vanishes
debris and mud smashes into the plane from all sides
the canyon walls erupt
i cant get it up
taking desperate measures gordon nearly rips the control stick out of its joint with a lurch the cessna lifts out of the abyss
they all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown los angeles
like a roller coaster gordon manages to weave the little plane through the tumbling high rises
they dive one last time to evade the plummeting us bank tower the tallest building on the west coast
all are dead silent as they watch the whole of los angeles crumble beneath them
kate covers lillys eyes
in total shock that was amazing gordon
jackson looks at kate and notices her cut
are you okay
brushing it off im fine
how did you know this was gonna happen
to gordon do we have enough fuel to make it to yellowstone
the plane veers off in a northeasterly direction
behind them the destruction of los angeles continues
the gigantic cruise ship plows through the pacific
we hear lounge music
adrians father harry and his partner tony are on stage
harry on the piano singing tony playing the bass
a waiter brings drinks
water for harry and a brightly colored cocktail for tony
you got fans tony
tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at the bar
theres a call for you harry
want me to take a message
while still playing ill be right there
the waiter nods
a few more bars of music then applause
into the microphone thank you ladies and gentlemen
lets hear it for the one and only tony delgado
and im harry helmsley and well be back after a short pit stop
harry rushes off stage
what i have to tell you is very serious
adrian is standing in a dark corner
behind him people are packing up carrying boxes
you remember when i told you about the dam in china
well its happening much sooner than we anticipated
harrys face has turned serious
the president has ordered us to clear out the white house
about time someone cleaned up that mess
adrian fights back the tears
where are you dad
what exactly is the course of the freedom right now
its all good adrian
dont worry about your old man
you have more important things to do now
theres a tremor in harrys voice
you know your mom and i we had a hell of a great life
and a hell of a great kid too
and the freedom is a pretty big ship you know
dont write your old man off just yet
a tear runs down adrians face
besides i could never leave tony alone
you know how he cant keep decent time by himself
i love you dad
harry bites his lip
love you too son
back in the lounge tony has finished his cocktail
harry walks up and hollers at the barkeeper
get me a double jack on the rocks
after twenty five years on the wagon
who cares how long we do certain things
how long we drink booze how long we talk to people
or how long we dont talk to people
harry grabs tony by his shirt
harry whats the matter with you

harry pulls him even closer
call your kid you stubborn old ass
im not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him
tony the ladies are waiting for you
promise me tony
harry stares him down
yeah maybe i should call him
harry smiles downs his bourbon and walks back on stage
adrian enters his office
the tv is on
there is little we know at this point but the earthquake registered at
on the richter scale
the whole of the western seaboard was hit
assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief some of them are crying
west appears at the door
pointing at the tv have you seen this
west silently nods and beckons adrian who follows him down the hall into a dark control room
they look at a wall sized high def monitor
we have satellite images
heres the sequence weve got so far
on the monitors detailed satellite imagery displays how the monstrous quake unfolds leaving california sliding into the sea
any news from yellowstone
the base is abandoned but for a few structures and the enormous drilling tower
gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a fueling station
jackson leaps out checking the pump
guys theres fuel
fill her up and ill look for charlie
youre sure about this
kate everything this guy said so far has happened
ill be right back
jackson runs off towards the hills
i wanna come with you
lilly runs after him
jackson picks her up
ill take her
kate watches as they disappear worried
noah and gordon have started to fuel the plane
jackson and lilly find charlies rv with its door hanging open
the key is in the ignition
the radio transmitters are on but charlie is gone
jackson fiddles with the switches and charlies voice comes on
i am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano
hes got to be close by lilbee
jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition
lets go back daddy
listen to me
we have to find charlie
hes got a secret map you know like jack sparrow in pirates
that catches her interest
lil we have to work as a team now okay
you have to help me
jackson passes her his mobile phone
he throws the rv into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain
in their dust we see the earth fissuring
jackson drives like a bat out of hell
the last time this baby blew was years ago
dial mommys number sweetheart
jackson tears up the mountain looking for charlie
kates phone rings
where are you honey
jackson hears the stress in kates voice
he hisses at lilly
tell her well be back in ten minutes
were looking for a secret map mommy
kate tries to keep it together for lilly
let me speak to your daddy darling
daddy cant talk right now hes driving really fast
the rv runs over a boulder
lilly hits the roof
in the background kate hears the voice of charlie frost
i tell you guys any minute now
any minute the fireworks will start
whos in the car with you
whos that man screaming
hes not in the car
hes on a mountain waiting for fireworks
lilly spots charlie way up on a ridge
he has erected his ten foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top
to jackson there he is
youre the best darling
give daddy the phone
into the phone kate i am sorry i cant talk
the road ends just below the mountain peak
bring back my child jackson
jackson sees charlie up above broadcasting
he hangs up the phone and jumps out of the rv
you wait here for me
you watch the ship while captain curtis talks to the pirate
jackson climbs up to charlie
charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body
the antennas flag is whipping in the wind
into his mic i wish you guys at home could see this on tv
he notices jackson and muffles the microphone
how did you make it up here
thought you were toast
the spaceships charlie where are they
you cant make it there
we have a plane
we can get you out of here too
lets go charlie
all around the landscape begins to collapse
a three mile crater forms revealing the awe inspiring sight of the super volcano
youll never make it out in time
just stay and enjoy the big bang
that your kid
jackson discovers lilly standing behind him staring at charlie with her big brown eyes
jackson grabs charlie lifting him off the ground
where is that god damn map
watch the mic
i dont know
somewhere in my camper
a low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as millions of birds tear into flight
look at that
into his mic fly birdies fly
this marks the last day of the united states of america folks and by tomorrow
the mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing molten lava underneath
the last of mankind
soon theyll see us from a million miles away out there in the milky way
jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the mountain
jackson and lilly jump into the rv and races off with charlies broadcast still playing
the ash cloud will travel everywhere
first the lights will go out in vegas then dallas st
louis and then washington dc
jacksons cell phone rings and he picks up
were on our way
jackson things are really looking bad here
in that instant the air around them vanishes as if sucked from the landscape into a vacuum
the biggest explosion the world has ever seen
at least in the last years
to them all this occurs in total silence
the sound of the eruption has not reached them yet
they are frozen unable to comprehend what is happening
the explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom
its beautiful kids
the sound waves reach charlie throwing him to the ground
the rv flies over the rugged terrain
everywhere the earth is cracking falling apart
jackson struggles to swerve around the disappearing landscape
its following us
lilly has discovered the expanding ash cloud behind them
just dont look back lilbee
the thundering sound envelopes them
on the radio the voice of charlie is getting shrill
charlie slowly tries to stand again silhouetted against the cloud of dust and fire towering above him
flaming rocks fly towards him
when they hit the ground they detonate like fire bombs
rocks plummet like comets around the rv as jackson races over a collapsing bridge
on the radio in his delirious state charlie begins to sing
this is the end my friend
yellowstone looks like a war zone
the rv dodges the bombardment of fire and rock
huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at charlie through the ashes
he screams at the top of his lungs
folks always remember you heard it first from charlie
a second later charlies radio antenna comes spinning like a scythe through the air
it decapitates charlie in an instant
the radio cuts out
the forest and the camp grounds are mown flat by the extreme force of the ash cloud
in the rear view mirror jackson sees it gaining on them
a firebomb hits the rv ripping half the roof off
lilly barely makes it under the dashboard
stay down there lil
were almost there
just keep looking at daddy
jackson spots the little cessna in the distance
at the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms cutting the rv off from reaching the plane
lilly sticks out her head
jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack sending lilly flying out
without thinking he lets go of the wheel lunging after her and pulling her back inside
stay down darling
jackson races the rv alongside the forming crack
spotting a narrow point in the crevasse he makes a decision
slamming the accelerator down he races towards it at full speed
moments later the rv is airborne
kate watches too shocked to scream
a few drawn out seconds
then the rv touches down crashing feet from the plane
kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper
lilly jumps out racing into her moms arms
jackson turns and sees the cloud approaching
you guys go
ill be right there
kate pulls lilly back to the plane
jackson jumps into the back of the rv scavenging through the shelves looking for charlies map
kate lifts lilly onto the wing of the plane
gordon revs up the engines
give me your hand lil
noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit
fiery rocks rain from the sky detonating to the right and left of their plane as kate climbs in
we have to take off
kate im sorry but if we wait well all die
gordon pushes the throttle
the plane starts to move
back in the rv jackson is frantically going through the masses of books and papers on the shelves
finally a map
he unfolds it
but its only of the london underground system
he throws it to the ground and finds another
this time hes lucky
there are markings everywhere
as he races to the door the ground gives way beneath the rv
kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight
noah begins to cry and lilly clings to her mom
gordon just stares paralyzed
the ash cloud is almost upon them
gordon takes action and accelerates the plane
kate turns back
a hand emerges from the crevasse
then another holding a map
her face lights up
jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them the map in his hand
kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him
you can make it
kate grab him for god sake
were almost out of runway
using every last ounce of energy jackson leaps onto the wing and is yanked into the plane by kate
just at that moment the plane lifts off
jackson falls into the cockpit completely out of breath
lilly crawls over and hugs him
thanks for waiting guys
now all eyes are glued to the speedometer
the violent ash cloud is hitting their tail rudder
the plane swerves wildly
gordon gets it back under control
the speedometer finally creeps towards mph and the cloud slowly falls back
everybody breathes a sigh of relief
so now that you got your map where are we going
jackson unfolds it and takes a look
hundreds of markings clutter the map
in the left corner he discovers a large letter c followed by h i n a
he looks up
were gonna need a bigger plane
the white house is being evacuated
amidst the chaos stands anheuser
adrian puts down a phone and looks at him
just a few minutes ago yellowstone erupted sir
the ash cloud will reach washington in roughly hours
we have strong easterly winds
and the crustal displacement
no one knows sir
anheuser starts walking adrian trails behind
lets get the government airborne and
i mean now
anheuser and adrian burst into the anteroom of the oval office
the presidents secretary sally is packing
where is the president sally
sally looks up stone faced
he said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone
i think hes over at the chapel
the whole north american continent is about to perish and wilson decides to go to church
adrian shoots an angry look at anheuser
hes praying sir
which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea
but right now i need the leader of the free world off his knees and on air force one
wheels up hours
can i leave that with you helmsley
anheuser walks away
adrian and sally exchange a look
i really dont like that man
adrian finds the president standing near the front of the chapel
we need to get you out of washington immediately
president wilson stays with his head bowed
now matter how idealistic you are taking office
you lose your innocence behind that desk
laura was right
people have died because of the decisions i made
thats not your fault sir
he turns to face adrian
you sound like anheuser
this quietly affects adrian
lauras never looked at me like that before
when i told her her mother had died
you knew the first lady
you know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital
i think you should do a lottery
every one should have a chance to go
thats what dorothy said to me
thats what we should have done
there would have been chaos sir
president wilson looks adrian in the eyes
you know what i believe adrian
i believe nature should choose for itself from itself
adrian takes this in
dont let her go
youll regret it if you do
prove to laura what kind of a man you are
and ill do the same
you go now
and watch your back for anheuser
adrian stares at the president in disbelief
thats an order helmsley
a tense moment before adrian starts to walk away
just as he exits the chapel wilson calls after him
would you tell my daughter
theres nothing on earth that i cherish more than her
we hold on president wilsons face
most of las vegas is destroyed
a foot wide canyon now divides sin city along its famous strip
the towering casinos still teeter along the canyons rim
all forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around the city
in the foreground we see las vegas international airport its runway cut dramatically short
large pieces of tarmac continue to break off into the crevasse
gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos
airplanes are strewn about the runway
i told you we should have gone to my parents in the rockies
look at this mess
jackson looks around frantically
you dont understand its our only chance
this isnt one of your crazy stories now
how the hell are we gonna make it to china
gordon without jackson wed never have made it out of california
noah is right and they know it
they taxi past a private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the tarmac
we hear a dog barking and the camera finds tamara with caesar in her arms
careful with the landing gear
in russian tamara get the boys out of the way
an airport tow truck attempts to pull yuris gulfstream jet out
sasha the pilot helps
a safety announcement echoes through the whole area
over loudspeaker attention
the us national guard has informed us that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of las vegas
tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for sashas hand
they share an intimate look no one else sees
we strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately
the tow truck driver panics and runs inside
we move in on yuri
for the first time he looks helpless
in the background jackson and his family join the panicked crowd heading towards the terminal building
firemen and rescue workers usher them forward
lets move people
inside the terminal
jackson and his family are swept along
adrian rushes up the stairs of air force one approaching one of the flight officers
in the command center sir
adrian moves on
anheuser immediately senses something is amiss
the president is not coming
i couldnt convince him to
everyone in the room looks up speechless
so the captain doesnt want to leave his sinking ship
helmsley we just learned that the vice presidents chopper crashed miles north of atlanta
adrian is shocked
what about the speaker of the house
in this chaos
i have no idea
but shes commander in chief now
sir i just think anheuser moves in dangerously close
i dont care what you think helmsley
laura quietly enters the command center as anheuser and adrian stare each other down
your ass only made it into the white house because your old man knew the first lady
and because of all that affirmative action bullshit
anheuser takes it even further
there was a white kid much more qualified than you
just so you know
adrians face is ashen
where is my father
everyone turns to laura
he wanted to stay with his people
suddenly the engines of air force one turn over
we have to go back
adrian tries to hold her close to him
anheuser sees this intimate moment and gives a suspicious questioning look
a second later laura pushes adrian away
let me get out
anheuser tell the captain
there is a protocol for just this situation ms
wilson and im afraid well have to follow it to the letter
anheuser turns to an officer
tell the captain to take off immediately
laura looks at him incredulously
emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal
people stay away from the windows
one of the rescue workers yells pushing jackson and his family back
frustrated jackson turns to kate and gordon
we cant get stuck here
suddenly a voice
what are you doing here
they all turn and stare at tamara holding her little dog against her plump breasts
kate gives gordon a look
shes a patient honey
but when jackson discovers yuri behind her his tone suddenly changes
he gets in yuris face
you knew it all along
at the twins you and those spoiled rotten sons of yours
sasha comes running in and cuts through this
i found us a plane an antonov
they were just about to take off but the tower didnt let them
can you still fly that thing
but i need a copilot
lilly chimes in
gordon is a pilot
before gordon can protest jackson picks up lilly
they burst through the emergency exit setting off an alarm
emergency personnel yell after them
you cant go out there
but they keep on running
sasha now leads the way
they race around the corner and come to a halt
before them a russian freight plane of enormous size the antonov the biggest aircraft in the world
wow that is a big plane
sasha who has run ahead turns back and sees a massive grey wall of ash moving towards the airport
guys follow me
they all run after him up the stairs
sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while readying the plane for takeoff
into the mic youll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold
sit down and buckle up
they all scramble to get into their seats
look at those
they discover the cargo they are carrying sports cars suvs concept cars and luxury models some of them are labeled las vegas auto show
we had vip tickets for that
the six engines of the antonov come roaring to life
the plane is starting to move
gordon sits uncomfortably in the copilots seat
you check the main bus for the hydraulics
ill balance the tanks
sasha reaches over and does it himself
work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel okay
gordon nods and puts on the headset trying to focus
people start screaming when they discover the menacing wall of ash racing towards them
move back people
down on the floor
the nose of the antonov turns onto the runway
this humongous plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash
gordon is panicking
we have to get going
sasha hits the throttle
were going were going
a deafening thunder emanates from the engines
everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft builds
the antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the cracked and uneven runway
the canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead
and behind them the volcanic cloud bears down
sasha stares down the gap ahead determined
gordons face is as white as a sheet
were not gonna make it
the violent cloud has finally reached the airport
the terminals are hit by flying debris
seconds later yuris gulfstream is whipped through the air shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces
people are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a massive fireball
kate and jackson hold their kids tight
tamara clings to little caesar and yuri to his twins
the antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off on the horizon
the runway is way too short
and to make matters worse the ground begins to move again slowly arching the tarmac upwards creating a crooked ramp at the end of it
a drop of sweat trickles down sashas forehead as he pulls back the wheel
gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts off veering sideways
the antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling casino towers along the other side of the rim
help me pull
gordon grabs the wheel on his side helping sasha pull up the beast of a plane
very slowly the plane starts to rise and sashas face lights up
they barely make it over a casino called paris las vegas
but the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure right behind it ripping away part of the landing gear
after some struggle sasha manages to steady the antonov
gordons face is green as he looks back
was that the eiffel tower
sasha looks over and grins
he grabs the microphone
ladies and gentlemen we are on our way to china
an ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock
in the distance the sun glistens off the peaks of the himalayas
neng pang a young monk sits with his superior and teacher lama yak la
they have tea beneath a huge bronze bell
in chinese do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it neng
but lin is my brother
he is working inside the big tunnels where the ships are made
the lama remains silent
what is in your wisdom for us to do great lama
if lin is right if our world is indeed coming to an end
instead of answering the lama serves him more tea
when the cup is full the lama doesnt stop pouring
neng watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain himself
its full great lama
it can hold no more
the lama stops pouring and looks at neng
like this cup neng you are full of your own opinions and speculations
how can i show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup
neng bows his head in embarrassment
the lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his neck
on it hangs a set of rusty car keys
be careful with the clutch
it tends to slide
the lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them smiling from ear to ear
they bow to each other and neng runs off
lama yak la looks after him as a father would
he gets up and strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet
as far as you can see is a series of identical little houses
the house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden
pang enters the coop
we last saw her when the village was being evacuated
she grabs one of the hens
she places its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet
just about to strike she hears a strange rattling noise
an old truck comes driving towards the house
behind the wheel sits her son neng
she puts down the hatchet yelling
in chinese bata
neng is coming
the young monk jumps out quickly bowing
mother i got a message from lin
he wants us to meet him in cho ming at the west gate
he says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on
pang is still holding the chicken by its throat
i thought lin is working on the dam
the dam is a ship mother
the government lied to us
there will be a big flood
the chicken hangs limp in mrs
not here in the mountains
lets eat first
the hen panics as she puts its head back on the block raising the hatchet again
we must pack up right away
we took a trip with the laem song ferry once
your father was throwing up the whole way
the door opens and mr
neng i did not know you were coming for dinner
at that moment the hatchet drops with a thud
the majestic antonov is flying high in the pacific skies
look the new bentley
the boys are exploring the huge freight deck
caesar the little dog is traipsing along
alec oleg and noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and performance cars
our dad had one on order
we were supposed to get it next year
but then he cancelled it again because of the ships
noah points to a aston martin parked further back
if i was rich id get one of those
we have one
how many cars does your family have
my moms boyfriend has a porsche a carrera
our parents are divorced too
the boys share a moment of understanding
nothing we can do about that
noah reaches for the door of the bentley
to his surprise it opens
look at this
noah jumps into the car
be careful noh
kate and lilly are still belted in next to tamara
jackson and yuri sit on the other side of the antonov
how did you meet dr
hes great isnt he
i think for the same reasons you did
you know after breast feeding two kids
kate looks at tamara
did your husband ask you to get yours done
we are not married
and we probably never will
but he paid for them
i bet he did
what did the man pay for mommy
kate looks over at jackson whos trying to make sense of charlies map
tamara catches her looking
whats your situation
kate lets out a sigh
way too complicated
on the other side of the plane yuri has been watching the two women talk
they seem to like each other
so tell me mr
karpov how much did you pay
one billion euro per seat
you know curtis i wasnt always businessman
i am a boxer
was my only playing when i was a boy back in murmansk
his name also yuri
he always said someone wants to beat you
he has to kill you first
yuri puts his hand on jacksons shoulder
what would you have done if you rich like me
just look at your gorgeous kids
and call me yuri
yuri offers his hand but jackson doesnt shake it
sashas voice comes over the radio
the plan is to refuel in hawaii
so buckle up
gordon and i will do the rest
gordon turns to sasha
lets get this straight sasha
im not a pilot
im a plastic surgeon
i just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying
why did you give up
it didnt work
gordon points to the declining altimeter
what about the wheels we lost at take off
theres on each side
some of them must still be there
with that sasha commences the landing procedure
the antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds
still nothing from the tower
gordon shakes his head
the two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly change color from yellow
they stare out the window in disbelief
gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to jackson and yuri
guys you really oughta take a look at this
jackson and yuri follow gordon back into the cockpit
the women exchange a worried glance
when jackson and yuri enter they dont believe their eyes
what is that
the state of hawaii
that is not good
from above we watch as the antonov flies over an endless ocean of fiery red lava
the islands of hawaii have turned into one big volcano
how much fuel do we have
well have to make a water landing somewhere in the south china sea
at least we wont need our landing gear
what about it
we lost it all
the damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly of the antonov as it veers off to the east
adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door
laura is sitting in her fathers chair
can i come in
ive got nothing to say to you
but i do
he has his travel bag in one hand
he looks at laura and gathers himself
your dad and i
we were trying to protect you
im a big girl adrian
i dont need protection
you used me
you guys had me gallivanting around the world as part of your little cover up
but you were doing a good job
sure if your names da vinci or picasso
but if youre some young talent in podunk texas sorry youre not famous enough
people like you and anheuser and my father you think you can play god
adrian takes a moment hes desperate to make her see
you know what your father believed
that nature will choose itself from itself
thats bullshit and you know it
its the fittest the richest and the strongest that survive
thats not true
adrian glances down and spots jacksons book poking out of his bag
what would you say were the chances of a first time middle aged writer who barely sold copies of his novel making it on board this plane
whats your point
adrian pulls out the book from his bag
he shows her
its called farewell atlantis and its a fantastic read
its part of our legacy now
laura takes this in
the planes intercom cuts through the moment
west requests your presence immediately
adrian takes a breath but before he leaves what if i tried to sort some of this mess out
i need to know you can forgive me
laura looks at him sadly but with a little hope
i need to know that too adrian
adrian moves for the door
one more thing
your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world
you are to me too
as adrian exits we hold on lauras conflicted face
the cloud from the yellowstone eruption has hit washington d
pennsylvania avenue resembles a war zone
a ten inch layer of ash lies on the ground
the gates of the white house are wide open with ash covered rescue workers running about resembling ghosts
the president has turned the whole west wing into a shelter
he walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can
an old african american lady holds a crying young girl
president wilson kneels down to her
she cant find her mother
why dont you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch
ill see what i can do
the child nods
the president gets up
sally can you take care of them
ill go check with the red cross
as he leaves the old lady looks up at sally and smiles
no wonder the first lady fell for him
i knew miss dorothy jones long before the president when she was still singing jazz down in atlanta with harry helmsley
i know she was amazing
the president walks up to the red cross tents placed on the front lawn
he stops one of the red cross volunteers
who can help me with missing persons
without looking up the young guy responds
sorry man im busy right now
he then recognizes who hes talking to
i mean of course sir
i didnt realize
what can i do for you mr
the president pats him on the shoulder
dont worry about it
youre doing a great job son
a deep low rumble begins stopping everybody in place
as it builds the president grabs onto a tent pole to secure himself
he looks out over washington d
his eyes grow wide
the national mall bends like rubber
the towering washington monument breaks into pieces
an even more deafening sound makes him turn the capitol building rises from behind the trees lifted up by earths incredible force
as the whole building breaks apart the president is thrown to the ground
all the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that show satellite images from all over the globe
adrian and prof
west stare in disbelief
the capitol was hit by a
laura enters the command center unnoticed
we lost communication with the white house sir
she stands there frozen emotionless
she looks over to anheuser who is shouting orders
another officer hands him a phone
president makarenko for you sir
hes just entered chinese air space
anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers
thats affirmative mr
until communication is restored i am in command
adrian and laura look to each other baffled
it seems all other heads of state are en route however there are unconfirmed reports that the italian prime minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer
rather than action
pope benedict xvi holds mass in st
millions of followers flood vatican city
its a sea of candles
amidst the mass of believers we see the italian prime minister antonioni with his family clinging to him
they all are praying
a low rumble
people look around frightened
in the distance we hear screaming
a few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under michelangelos famous fresco
most prominent above them is the creation of adam
the cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies
a crack forms on the ceiling shooting straight through god touching the finger of adam
then the whole fresco breaks apart
the people in st
peters square begin to panic the entire vatican is lifted up in the air
we hold on the prime minister and his family as the basilica collapses onto the fleeing masses
the giant statue of christ the redeemer on mount corcovado
behind it we see rio de janeiro being obliterated by violent quakes
the famous statue of jesus christ begins to topple over and crashes down the mountain
neng pang the young tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy mountain pass
his parents huddle in the back of the pick up
the steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he slides the clutch and downshifts
as the vehicle slows on the steep incline the vibrations become much worse
neng worries that the truck may be breaking down
he pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise the steering wheel continues to vibrate
looking out the windshield he sees the whole earth shaking violently
in chinese hold on back there
rocks fall all around them
jackson sits inside one of the luxury cars and tries the radio
kate opens the passenger door and gets in
couldnt sleep huh
nothing just static
not even an emergency signal
i cant think about whats going on down there
jackson switches off the radio
i wanted to thank you
for coming back for us
i couldnt have left you
they both look out through the front windshield at lilly and noah curled up together
do you think people change
by people are we talking about me
do you think youve changed since we separated
well i certainly eat a lot more cereal now
you know you always had tunnel vision
you could always just block things out and write
you blocked all of us out jackson
he thinks about this and cant help asking
do you love him
i love him enough
kate gets out of the car and shuts the door
he watches her go
the computers buzz with the incoming data
cho ming reports the first tremors however none higher than
anheuser looks relieved
then the big news hits
the crust has begun to shift prof
by what degree
percent but still moving
any clue what to expect next professor
once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt we expect the formation of tidal waves sir
proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes
adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers
do we have any news from the japanese seaboard
laura notices adrians concern
weve recorded two quakes averaging
she grabs adrians hand
anheuser sees this and his suspicions about them are confirmed
a cold little smile appears on his face
tony is watching tv with a group of passengers
harry has just entered and stands near the back of the room
a teenage boy with bad acne searches for an available channel that is still broadcasting
he finds a news program with lousy reception
tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit
unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of japan is below water
the signal gets weaker
harry watches tony slowly stand up
as he turns to his friend his knees begin to buckle
his face is pale
but i never got through
im so sorry
tony only stares back at him
behind them the tv rolls to the side as the whole room begins to tilt
harry grabs on to the door frame as the passengers along with tony fall like dominoes
as the ship rolls to the side harry finds himself hanging from the door frame now feet off the ground
hes barely able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck
on his back harry is shocked to see the star field and the moon shifting across the sky
an eerie sound fills the air
a gigantic swell has formed off to his right
its a mountain of water
harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the other side of the freedom of the seas
the old walled city of shibam is in ruins
the year old towers lie on the desert ground
hundreds of believers have gathered to pray towards mecca
as they raise their hands to heaven in unison they slow their motion and the chanting dissipates
they stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is reality or only a mirage
a monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering towards them
president wilsons body lays between the rubble
as he slowly regains consciousness all he can hear is the flapping sound of the collapsed red cross tents
as president wilson gets to his feet he sees a tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the washington mall and it carries with it the battleships of the
th fleet of the us navy that were anchored in chesapeake bay
the president looks ahead calm and peaceful
im coming home dorothy
the camera follows the aircraft carrier uss john f
kennedy as it slams broadside into the white house
anheuser adrian and prof
west stand amongst a group of officers and analysts
all global ground communication has ceased sir
the only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in cho ming
at least some good news
anheuser turns to adrian
would our science advisor care to give us his assessment
we expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent
the cho ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours
he nods to one of the analysts who types in a couple of commands
and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly degrees in a south westerly direction
heres the computer simulation
everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet earth
our data also shows that our earths poles have reversed their magnetic fields
these are their new positions
anheuser looks at the monitor then turns to adrian
so helmsley what youre telling us here is that
the north pole is now somewhere in wisconsin
adrian clears his throat
its the south pole sir
an alarm signal goes off a red light blinks on the planes instrument panel
two of six are down
we must get ready
yuri and jackson are standing behind the pilots
lets go wake up the kids
yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck
jacksons family are all asleep in their seats lilly in her moms lap
she looks like a little angel
jackson cant bear to wake them
he caresses lillys face
why do you hate gordon
jackson turns to see noah is awake
what are you talking about
i dont hate gordon
but you dont like him either
i dont know him that well
but i know him
hes really nice
you should talk to him more often
you guys would get along really well
this breaks jacksons heart
he pulls noah tightly to his chest
ill give it a try noah
kate opens her eyes
is it time
wake up lilbee
were getting ready to land
on the opposite side of the aircraft yuri and tamara help the twins get into their life vests
noah is suspicious
jackson looks at his kids
they both look scared
sasha told us it could get a little bumpy
the antonov jerks to the side
two more engines out
alarm signals flash
the remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as it dives into the clouds
jackson and his family huddle together
he puts his arms around lilly and noah
your daddy has to tell you something
in the background gordon climbs down from the cockpit
he is about to speak when he hears jacksons voice
i know that with my writing and work i didnt have a lot of time for you both
jackson glances at kate
i wasnt there for you the way i should have been
jackson looks kate directly in the eyes
and i am so very sorry for that
gordon watches as kate pulls the kids and jackson tight
for the first time they seem a little like the family they once were
i think you guys should come back up here
first jackson and then yuri enter the cockpit
sasha points out of the window
dont ask me how that happened
behind them yuri and jackson stare at the snow covered mountains of the himalayas
theres no more ocean and it looks like were pretty close to where we wanted to go
its as if the whole earth shifted by miles
its called earth crust displacement gordon
jackson brims with joy
way to go charlie
we lost our last two engines
the plane drops rapidly nearly scraping the tip of a mountain
sasha and gordon are doing all they can to keep the antonov in the air
a vast glacier spreads out in front of them
ill shoot for that glacier
drain the brake fluids
its going to get rocky
there the blue levers
the plane plummets loosing altitude fast
listen up guys
this may sound a little crazy but heres what you got to do
jackson and yuri come running
yuri yells at his boys
in russian get up
yuri bear what are we doing
were taking the bentley
sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel
the glittering snow field comes flying towards them
were still too fast
sasha pulls the antonov back up
gordon yanks with all his might
a loud noise
the cargo door drops open
the antonov is extremely close to the glaciers surface
jackson tries to start the bentley but nothing happens
everyone screams in panic
they all go quiet except for a few muffled barks from caesar
yuri speaks towards the dashboard slowly and clearly
the motor revs to life
yuri looks at jackson
sold me on it
sasha barely holds on
he yells at gordon
your turn gordon
make sure that they make it out of here before i touch down
what about you
ill be fine
i have to land this thing
what are you waiting for
sasha nods at him reassuringly
gordon bolts out
the cargo door scrapes against the glacier hurling ice everywhere
the bentley roars
push it curtis
were waiting for sasha and gordon
noah turns and sees gordon
open the door
gordon jumps in
tamara yells at him in desperation
he said hell be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down
yuri notices tamaras distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit
jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing
the bentley shoots out the back of the plane
as it hits the snow the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers
the antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold
they barrel past the bentley like skittles narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions
the plane skids across the glacier clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart
sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the antonov plunging into the deep
the plane crashes and explodes
as the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb stoned in the snow
the bentley is half buried
we hear caesar barking
everybody okay back there
were all fine
the door opens and jackson climbs out looking around
just above the wind he hears the sound of helicopter blades
one by one the others appear behind jackson and stare at a surreal sight several chinese mil choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass
giraffes zebras even elephants hang by huge straps from these flying machines
one of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the bentley
armed soldiers jump out
their commander speaks to them in a sharp tone
welcome to the peoples republic of china
jackson nods to them
to lilly and noah say thank you kids
the others acknowledge the soldiers as well
what color are your passes
jackson stands dumbfounded
the commander repeats
what color are your boarding passes
still no answer
he yells an order
the soldiers point their guns at them
i have green card
surprised jackson turns to yuri whos holding up three green plastic cards
for my boys and me
tamara cant believe what shes hearing
its a joke
tamara lunges at him
in russian you disgust me
yuri brushes her off coldly
and then speaks so they can all understand him
you think i did not know about you and sasha
may god rest that poor bastards soul
with that yuri turns to the others
i am sorry guys
and jackson remember if someone wants to beat you
he has to kill you first
the twins grab caesar and climb into the helicopter
the dog barks furiously wanting to stay with tamara
the next moment the helicopter takes off
did that just happen
air force one is in the background as laura anheuser and other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of waiting helicopters
adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack
a chinese officer with a list shouts over the noise
anheuser youre in chopper
wilson the same
laura and anheuser reach the chopper
an authoritative naval officer greets them and raises his voice
im captain richard michaels
im the skipper of the american boat sir
anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper
captain michaels helps laura in
adrian arrives just as the chopper door slides shut and it lifts off
laura catches adrians look of unease before they soar away
my sincerest condolences dr
wilson for your father
lauras look thanks him for this
he turns to anheuser
your party is the last to arrive
ive been told of damages
we havent completed the assessment but it looks like we lost number when the crust shifted
captain michaels looks up and points into the distance
there it is
the camera follows the choppers revealing nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least stories built into the face of a mountain
in front of every gate there is a line of huge y shaped metal support structures which are the launching towers for the ships
they are each at least feet high
its an unparalleled feat of engineering
the lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates dwarfed against this majestic setting
the door slides open and anheuser jumps out
she looks around in awe
even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense
the captain guides them into the hollow mountain
in the background we see an angry yuri scream and argue with military personnel waving his tickets
what do mean we cant board number
i want to speak to your supervisor
i am the supervisor
now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements
i want your name
pointing to his can you read
now get the hell back with the other green cards or ill have you detained
the twins stand nearby holding caesar
they look afraid
jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape
they have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field
it is hard going
jackson carries lilly
keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart
youre doing great
kate holds noah by the hand
gordon and tamara trail behind
shes still very upset
i should have listened to you dr
i actually liked the way i looked before that monster talked me into it
did you know he asked for a discount
and he paid in installments
youre better off without him
what he said about you and sasha is it true
tamara nods silently
now that hes gone i think he was worth a hundred times a man like yuri
suddenly they hear the puttering of an engine
you guys hear that
in the distance an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road
jackson puts down lilly and chases after it
neng and his parents drive past billowing a huge cloud of dust just as jackson reaches the road
out of breath hey
wait for us
but neng doesnt hear him over the rattling truck
jackson pissed kicks at the rocks on the road
just then nengs mother sitting in the back of the truck turns and sees his tantrum
she bangs on the rear window of the cabin
neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes
jackson cant believe his luck
the others show up and they all run towards the truck
anheuser and laura follow captain michaels and a chinese steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks
laura stops halfway gazing in awe deep down below thousands of workers are swarming over the ship readying it for launch
laura looks up and sees the contrast spotting the sheik we met in the dorchester hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family
laura points down at the workers
what happens to all those people
the captain doesnt know what to say
wilson theres a protocol for all that
you just stick to your art
well handle the rest
laura hates him in that moment
where is the bridge
anheuser and captain michaels move away as laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains
your cabin is this way
laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward
thousands are on the march up the mountains
behind them a valley stretches into the horizon
plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance
amongst the refugees we discover satnam the young astrophysicist holding his little son
the rest of satnams family trails behind
distant warning sirens pierce the silent march coming from the cities below
people start to scream and run but satnam stands there frozen
he fumbles for his satellite phone then hits a number on its speed dial
adrian is unpacking
he lays down his copy of farewell atlantis just as his cell phone rings
where are you
on the nampan plateau
adrians face goes pale
theres a tidal wave coming from the east
satnam what happened
we never got picked up adrian the airlift never came
adrian closes his eyes
satnam swallows hard
he stares out into the valley
i have to go
a wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him
a tidal wave of gigantic height
everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation
but for satnam it is clear they do not stand a chance
he picks up his little son squeezing him tightly to his chest humming an indian lullaby for the scared child
adrian hears screaming on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave
he tenses up desperate but unable to do anything
as the noise reaches its height the line goes dead
adrian is left breathless
adrian storms onto the bridge
many officers and analysts are at work under captain michaels
do we have the latest satellite images of napam india
one moment sir
anheuser and prof
west step over and join him
helmsley whats going on here
looks like our model was wrong
they all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves coming in from the south
satnam was talking about a wave from the east
a science officer selects a different quadrant on the satellite display
they all stare at the new tidal wave thats coming from the east of the cho ming valley
anheuser is shocked
what does this mean
the flooding will happen earlier
bobby can you plug in the new data please
as the officer does this prof
west looks at adrian with questioning eyes
satnam didnt get picked up
west is horrified
adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave that is coming towards the cho ming valley
this one is at least meters high
talk to me helmsley
what does this mean for us
bobby plug in the new data and adjust the count down
every one on the bridge stares at a display
it reads hrs min sec the science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display changes to hrs min sec
we see the shock on anheusers face
get me the other heads of state
nengs truck loaded with jackson and the others creeps up to the service entrance of the launch site
a lone figure awaits them
this is nengs older brother lin who we saw signing up for the chinese dam project
lin notices the strangers in the pick up truck
in chinese who are they
neng answers hesitantly
we found them by the side of the road my brother
you must send them back
i am a follower of the great lama yak la
you know i cannot do that
the others watch the interaction but do not understand
jackson senses a problem
he grabs lilly and noah
come with daddy
gordon and tamara stare perplexed as jackson approaches lin with his kids
at least take our children with you
lin answers in broken english
why should i do that
for the same reason you sent for your parents
lin stares at him stone faced
in desperation kate turns to mrs
i have no clue if you understand what im saying but i ask you as a mother please take my kids with you
the old chinese lady turns to lin
in chinese we are all children of this earth
my plan will not work for so many mother
she looks up at her son determined
we will take them all
pang nods and reluctantly lin motions to jackson to follow
kate bows to mrs
thank you maam
thank you so much
jackson and the others acknowledge what kate has done
we finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard built into the hollow belly of the mountains
nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other
their size is at least four times that of the freedom of the seas
however they look more like spaceships than anything having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature
but only three of these monstrous arks are complete
number is being repaired all the others are still under construction surrounded by scaffolding
suddenly sirens goes off
the boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract
theres growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel
opposite the boarding bridges on a large platform yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers
they watch as massive stern gates begin to close
yuri jumps up and yells to the others
theyre leaving without us
the soldier from earlier points his gun at him
what did i tell you
caesar barks at the guy
they are leaving you behind too
the soldier turns to the ships and yuri knocks him out
he grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates
all the other passengers surge forward with him
in the distance on the bow side of the ships the huge mountain gates of the bay open revealing a stunning view of cho ming valley
lin leads his group over a ridge
in front of their eyes the gates to the mountain open
in chinese we have to hurry
to jackson they launch
we run out of time
they follow lin rushing down the hill towards one of the many y shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates
neng and kate help mr
pang down the rocky terrain
a screeching and thundering noise
the three completed vessels begin to inch forward on metal girders connecting the y shaped launch towers
laura feels a jolt
she rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor
she struggles to fight her way through
a digital voice blares over the speakers
countdown to departure
launch in minutes seconds
laura bumps into one of adrians science officers
where can i find adrian helmsley
hes in the technical command centre
the three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain into the open
support helicopters swarm around them like flies
lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers
verbal commands fly back and forth
anheuser watches the preparations from a large window
he looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place
we cut to the various heads of state all at their command posts
a hatch opens at the top of the launch tower
lin is the first to climb out
right before his eyes the hull of the american ship slowly creeps towards him
hes but a speck against this man made behemoth
lin hastily pulls the others up
in chinese faster neng
mother give me your hand
its a race against time
the huge ships hull closes in fast
lin and his family crawl up the side arm while jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group
lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship
jackson rips her out of harms way just in time
in a frenzy he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform
as the towering wall of steel passes by them inches from their faces mr
pang loses his balance
jackson and lin both see this but jackson is closer he grabs the old man by his arm saving him from falling to his death
for the first time lin acknowledges jackson with a nod
the three completed ships are half way out grinding to their final launching position
a mob of passengers led by yuri has fought their way to the ship
more and more people join them including soldiers
lin jackson and the group are huddled on the platform
the sound of screaming people makes them turn
the storming masses have arrived at the access platform
there is now a huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships
oh my god thats yuri
next to yuri are his twins holding caesar
the little dog hears tamara and jumps out of olegs arms leaping onto one of the thick cables that connects the platform with the launching towers
alec and oleg attempt to run after caesar but yuri grabs them by their necks
let that stupid dog go
the arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform
the ship has reached its targeted position
a small hatch lines up directly in front of lin and his group
in chinese okay
one by one they all climb into the hatch
jackson being the last in notices that tamara has stayed back
she doesnt move anxiously waiting for her beloved dog darting towards her
the mob pushes at yuri and his boys
passengers on either side tumble off the platform
yuri watches one of them fall hitting his head against a tiny ledge feet below
to his right he sees a small ladder leading down
in russian down there
oleg you go first
as they hurry down the ladder people keep tumbling into the deep
reaching the ledge oleg discovers caesar running towards tamara
daddy look tamara
yuri cannot believe his eyes
the hatch behind tamara begins to move
the hydraulic supports are being lifted sealing up the vessel
jackson reaches out from the closing hatch
tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns
come to mommy
caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch seals
as a last gesture tamara sticks out her arm and gives yuri the finger
lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located
he opens a tool cabinet retrieving a giant electrical power drill almost too big to be carried by one person
lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts
he looks at jackson
i need your help
laura and the science officer enter the technical command center
she finds adrian staring at a wall of monitors showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms
people are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their desperation to board the ship
what in gods name is happening adrian
anheuser convinced them all to launch
outside panicking workers screaming for their life
deserted passengers waving their green cards
adrian makes a decision and rushes out
anheuser turns hearing adrian storming onto the bridge
we have to stop this madness
with that adrian turns to the communication officer
bobby make sure the other bridges can hear this
the officer hesitates as laura enters in the background
what do you think youre doing
i know exactly what im doing
to bobby turn it on
bobby flicks a switch
adrians voice echoes through all the ships
this is adrian helmsley science advisor to president wilson
the german chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the european ship
can you please turn up the volume mr
next to her stand the british and french prime ministers
i know weve all been involved in making difficult decisions
to save our human civilization
anheuser looks on stoney faced
but to be human means to care for each other and civilization means to work together to create a better life
if thats true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what were doing here
can we really stand by and let all those people out there die
laura watches him proudly
a civilization that allows that does not deserve to survive
or at least i dont want to be part of it
anheuser cuts in with sarcasm
well miss you helmsley but somehow well get by
officer switch that off
the communications officer looks at adrian
thats an order soldier
dont do it
the russian president together with the heads of state from china and japan listen in as adrian responds
we have to open our gates and let these people in
all of them
anheuser has had enough
have you lost your mind
look at the countdown
we have less than five minutes left
and none of our ships have the resources to feed those people
if you save them today we all starve tomorrow
hes almost screaming now
do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race
can you handle that adrian
adrians battle seems lost
but he doesnt give up and instead speaks softly now
there is a young astrophysicist from india who is the reason we are all here trying to give mankind a second chance
hes the one who discovered it all the one who connected the dots
we all owe him our lives
all eyes are glued to adrian
i just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern india
you know why
adrian stares anheuser in the eyes as he continues
he died because we forgot to pick him up
i beg you
whatever our future holds dont let us start it with an act of cruelty
what will you tell your children
and their children
laura steps up alongside adrian
if my father were here he would open the gates
adrian and laura share a look
the people of russia along with
his asian colleagues nod in approval
china and japan agree to open the gates
the german chancellor speaks up
the united kingdom spain france and germany and i believe i can also speak for the italian prime minister
we vote to open the gates
laura and adrian watch anheuser shaking his head in defeat
bobby the communications officer smiles with relief
adrian turns to the captain
captain michaels you heard them
one by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open
the masses gathered on the platform cheer wildly
lilly crawls through the connecting tunnel meeting up with kate in a large bay on the other side
it stinks in here
together with neng and his parents they all look up in a giraffe chewing her cud smiles down at them
caesar barks at her
a second later hundreds of different animals respond
they are in the zoological bay
gordon helps noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel
just as he goes to hand him jacksons backpack the hydraulic motors begin to growl
lin looks up in panic
theyre opening the gate
it will crush us
the whole ceiling begins to lower towards them
from down below jackson sees his son about to be hit by it
gordon makes a split second decision
with all his strength he shoves the boy into the tunnel
from the other side of the tunnel kate watches as the metal ceiling misses noah by a hair but catches gordon wiping him off the ladder
jackson watches helplessly as gordon falls past him
he survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface but he cant
gordon is crushed between the gears sharing his last look with jackson before he dies
kate helps a trembling noah out of the tunnel
something happened mom
kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly
she fights back the tears
jackson and lin know theyre running out of time their remaining space is shrinking every second
we have to stop it
lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall
as it digs deeper into the metal the hydraulic starts to slow down
still on the ledge yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them
they are trapped
just then the gates begin to slow but surely they will be crushed
back in the chamber lin still struggles with the drill
suddenly he slips
jackson manages to catch his fall
but in the process lins foot gets caught between the gears mangling it
he screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt
you did it man
you did it
in great pain lin grins back at him
the gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise
people begin to rush on board
alarm signals go off
the captain turns to one of his officers
whats wrong with the gate
i dont know
maybe theres something jamming it sir
the countdown on the monitor reads min
laura and adrian share a worried look
we hear a hollow bell ring
lama yak la rings the large bronze bell of his monastery
the booming sound echoes through the cho ming valley
as a gentle wind catches the lamas clothes he looks up a tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains
the lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth
the technicians desperately try to figure out whats wrong
an officer waves adrian over
sir we have a breach in the zoological bay
can you zoom in
the video camera moves in on kate noah and lilly
adrian cant believe his eyes
he turns to laura
i know those kids
remember the book i told you about
their father wrote it
captain michaels shouts across the room
we can close the gates sir
anheuser looks nervously at the countdown
it reads above yuri and the boys people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the american ship
yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up
in russian pull yourself up
oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate
inside the ship officers yell
to the lower decks people
the gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close
yuri doubles his efforts lifting alec higher but alec cannot quite reach
yuri strains with all his effort before deciding
catch your brother
yuri leaps forward holding alec out in his arms
oleg manages to grab his brothers hands as yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below
he makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath
oleg pulls his brother from above
a siren blasts
both of yuris sons are now on deck
a loading officer pulls them back away from the gate
boys you gotta move
we wait for our father
hes still down there
the loading officer attempts to comfort them
theres no one down there
come on boys come
the officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes
but with a screeching sound it grinds to a halt
the gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap
anheuser and the captain stare at the monitors
why is the stern gate not closing
somethings wrong with the hydraulics sir
captain over here
they race over
adrian points to a monitor
i think we found the problem
on the monitor they see sarah and the others desperately waiting for jackson and lin
how did they get in there
they must have come through the hydraulic chamber
bobby the surveillance officer selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which jackson is pulling along a wounded lin
that guy is injured
something must have gone wrong
youre damn right something went wrong
congratulations helmsley you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean
adrian tries to ignore this
lets get an emergency crew there right now
ill meet them at the hydraulic chamber
anheuser sneers him shooting a look to laura
you think youre the main man now just because your fucking the presidents daughter
without thinking adrian turns and punches anheuser hard in the face
he drops to the floor out cold
everyone stands in stunned silence
adrian looks around
what are you all waiting for
they speed off
the countdown reads min
further down in the valley the tidal wave has reached the cho ming airfield blasting away the planes with overwhelming force
the massive propellers of the ships begin to turn
however the props of the american ship dont move
in the background the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them
an impact warning sounds as adrian and laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew
one of the officers explains
if we cant close the stern gate then the engines wont start
theres no way to override it
no sir it has to be done manually
kate noah and lilly watch as jackson nears the end of the tunnel with lin
neng comforts his brother whos about to pass out
in chinese almost there lin
all three vessels are now engulfed in churning water
they rock back and forth
only the huge support towers theyre resting on keep them anchored
a new alarm sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the american ship
the people on the loading bay panic among them we see alec and oleg
the same alarm rings out in the hallways of the ship
laura adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor as the vessel undulates back and forth
water has penetrated the stern
laura looks unsure
the rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time
adrian looks at him
then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber
if we dont hurry we wont be able to
despite the violent movement of the ship adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat
water is also now rushing into the zoological bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry
jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious lin
kate shouts across to tamara
take lilly and noah
kate reaches in to help jackson as tamara begins to move with lilly
noah remains back with his mother
jackson finally makes it through with lin
kate is almost tearful with relief to see him
i was so worried about you
suddenly the zoological bay begins to seal itself off
lilly already in the next compartment with tamara and her dog screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up from the floor to the ceiling
it separates lilly from her family
jackson and kate turn but its too late
they only catch a glimpse of lilly before they are sealed in
the water level continues to rise
panicked tamara turns and looks around
down the corridor in the distance she sees adrian laura and the rescue crew approaching
but between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly
lilly starts moving as tamara turns and picks up caesar
moving quickly lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door
but as she dangles from the other side she looks down and is too scared to jump
lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold caesar above the quickly narrowing gap
in a courageous move lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground
back on the other side of the chamber door tamara looks around
she is trapped now as the water continues to rush in
laura picks lilly up and comforts her
adrian realizes they are too late
he turns to the rescue crew
is there any way to talk to them
lilly is close to tears
the water continues to flood in as jackson helps neng with his unconscious brother
we have to move him higher
looks around over there
suddenly a violent shake throws them all off balance pitching them into the water
in the debris filled murky waters we see that the fuselage of air force one has slammed against the first of the ships launch towers
slowly it begins to bend finally giving way
the other launch towers follow like dominos
the ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways rudderless
everybody holds on for dear life
the vessel is swept away over the mountain ridge
alec and oleg scream desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes
the giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless smashed around by the debris and raging waters
but then as it hits another ridge it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself
however the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the himalayas
the officers try to regain some control
moving at knots sir
what is our position
darjeeling valley heading south east sir
the captains face drops
you must be kidding
the water rises fast as kate sees the severity of lins wound for the first time
we need something to stop the bleeding or hell die
a split second later noah holds out his belt
mum will this do
suddenly jackson hears a voice over a speaker
over a speaker mr
im adrian helmsley
we met once before
your daughter is with me
kate screams with relief
adrian is using an emergency wall intercom with laura next to him holding lilly
im alright mom
tamara hears caesar over the speaker in her compartment and smiles with relief
she is struggling to stay afloat though and is running out of air
jackson discovers the wall speaker
he moves closer to it
we cant get to you
whatever you did jammed the hydraulics
if you cant get it out
none of us will make it
all eyes are on adrian as he speaks
youre our only hope
adrian looks at laura
ill go back
ill try my best
ill go with you
you stay with mommy
jackson looks at kate
ill be right back
the water is up to their chest now
jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater
back on the bridge anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet
his nose is bleeding
he looks around him
captain whats happening
the captain looks at him annoyed
were heading straight for the north face of mount everest mr
anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of mount everest in the distance
jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool pulling at it
but it doesnt budge
the water level in tamaras compartment is at its height now and she goes under
she struggles below the surface for a moment looking around desperately for a way out but there is none
jackson manages to find an air pocket
he fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard
as he strips off his jacket he seems to have a plan
he dives under again
lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents
kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight
noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater unnoticed to go and help his father
back under water jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet
jackson opens it retrieving a giant crowbar
he begins to use it to dislodge the tool but its hard work
anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of mount everest is almost upon them
kate and the pangs are desperately close to running out of air now but despite this kate still tends to lin
after a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that noah is nowhere to be found
jackson pulls with all his might but he cant quite shift the drill
to his surprise a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar
noah is alongside him now helping
working as father and son they manage little by little to loosen it before finally the drill comes free
adrian gives noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface
jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop
he dives back down for it
noah emerges from the water
mom we did it
kate pulls him to her relieved he is safe
noah smiles and calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker
lilly and laura wait nervously
they hear a muffled voice
we got it free
can you hear me
we did it
adrian leaps up when he hears this
he flicks a button on the intercom
captain michaels close the gate
hearing this the captain yells the eagerly awaited order
close the gate
ay ay sir
we hear a booming sound as the tail gate finally seals
jackson reaches his knapsack but when sees noahs cell phone lying next to it he makes a decision and reaches for that instead
he hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles
but as he turns to swim back his face freezes hes looking into the lifeless eyes of gordon who floats inches from his face
the gigantic propellers fight against the current hitting rock at the base of the mountain
the battle seems hopeless
captain michaels yells at the top of his lungs
engage starboard stabilizers
one is engaged
two is engaged
number three is out sir
the vessel scrapes against the rocks throwing anheuser to the floor
the giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare
everyone on the bridge watches in awe as mount everest earths highest peak drifts slowly past
after a long beat they begin to holler and cheer
kate hears the cheering coming from the speakers
the water level stops rising but she still looks around in panic
where is he
noah begins to cry
he was just behind me
jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull of wonderful air
kate and noah are overjoyed
the pangs smile to one another
jackson looks kate squarely in the eyes
if you would ever consider to give me another chance
i promise ill always be there when you need me
kate embraces him tightly
whatever you do
i will never let you go again
noah is all smiles
we hear a voice
no one is waiting for anything to happen
the camera moves over the last lines of jacksons novel
adrian sits in his cabin his copy of farewell atlantis in his lap
and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories hopes and ideas
opposite him laura sits listening to him read
and funny just today we found out that the entire crew of the atlantis somehow or another has relatives in wisconsin
adrian closes the book
theres a moment of silence
how many copies did you say that sold
with a smile its what you might call a cult classic
laura looks at him grinning
it seems we have very different tastes mr
well thats healthy dr
something we could maybe explore
unless you have other pressing engagements
actually my diarys pretty open
the intimate moment is cut short
over loudspeaker mr
helmsley to the bridge please
adrian and laura make their way to the bridge
ladies and gentlemen this is captain michaels speaking
in a few minutes i will be giving the orders to unseal the decks
jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other people who are gathering in anticipation
please be careful when you step out and of course
enjoy the fresh air
jackson kneels down and zips up lillys jacket
she is holding caesar whose still wearing his diamond collar
when can we go back home
theres nothing we can go back to lilbee
whatevers out there thats our home now
dont be scared
im not daddy
no more pull ups
thats my big girl
jackson squeezes lillys shoulder
can we pet him
lilly turns to see yuris boys standing next to her
of course you can
hes your doggie
the boys both smile at her
adrian and laura enter the bridge
you called for me sir
west has something to show you mr
the captain directs him to a monitor
looks like your scientific projections are way off again
the captain grins at prof
the water is receding much faster than we projected adrian
a monitor reveals an image of the african continent however its shape changed dramatically
the image of the southern tip is enlarged
its hard to believe but the himalayas are no longer the roof of the world
its now the drakensberg mountains of kwa zulu natal
the whole african continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely never even flooded
our european colleagues have already set course for it
captain michaels hands adrian a short wave radio
here somebody wants to talk to you
adrian curious grabs the mic
this is helmsley
we hear a muffled raspy voice through the speakers
harry helmsley stands beside the cruise ships captain
no this is helmsley
is that you
adrian is ecstatic
captain michaels explains
we should have a visual of the freedom of the seas shortly
were coming to pick you guys up
harry looks over at tony whos listening smiling
hes fine son
were all fine
see you guys soon
harry hangs up
he picks up tony embracing him wildly
adrian still excited from speaking with his dad grabs laura and kisses her on the lips
put that woman down helmsley
adrian looks at anheuser unsure of what he might say
young guys like you with your idealistic dreams you think you can change the world
adrian and laura exchange a look
i just pray to god that you keep on making the right calls
in this new world of ours
adrian nods and with a smile to laura turns to leave
helmsley one more thing
adrian turns back
there was no one
there was no white kid better than you
im terribly sorry i said that
anheuser puts out his hand
adrian takes it
this is your captain speaking
standby to open deck
standing by sir
neng pushes his brother lin in a wheelchair onto the deck next to his parents
pang turns to her husband
in chinese i wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars
do not fear
some things will never change
the old chinese man forces a little smile
closer to the front of this crowd jackson approaches noah
i thought you might want this
he takes noahs cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him
do you think ill still get a signal dad
jackson is touched to hear him use that word
he smiles and hugs him
adrian laura and anheuser arrive alongside them
i finally finished your book jackson
you may well be the first person who ever got to the end
jackson looks at her smiling playfully
excuse me i believe hes addressing the author
well what did you think
those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the south pole
suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air
a murmur goes through the crowd
everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in
the pang family try to see over peoples heads even anheuser looks hopeful
jackson pulls his family close as the first rays of daylight hit their faces
hatches unseal all around the ship
sun streams through the clouds
everywhere people emerge outside into the light of day
a majestic moment
they all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice covered mountain peaks
caesar lets out a yelp of joy
almost as soon as the doors have opened the ships helicopters take off flying towards a stunning site the freedom of the seas is perched on a mountain peak surrounded
by calm waters
behind it they see the most beautiful rainbow
this is the new world
and again we hear mozarts adagio
