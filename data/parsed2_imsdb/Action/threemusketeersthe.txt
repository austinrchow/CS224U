a verdant field in gascony
birds call from tree tops
the wind rustles through green leaves
a fox darts into a thick hedge
and last anti pastoral out of place the sound of clashing steel
suddenly two young men burst into view sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air
the first is girard bearded nearly thirty a man in every facet
the second dartagnan
younger in appearance and attitude
and at just this moment bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry
they battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew
girard is the more polished combatant
but dartagnan is nearly a force of nature
he whips his sword through the air with wild hearted abandon
he tumbles and somer saults
this is fun
girard and dartagnan cross the field pass over a wooden fence struggle toward a stable and hayloft
as they fight both men utilize a variety of props
handfuls of hay a wooden spar quick kicks from heavy boots
anything goes as the swords cut through the air
dartagnan gaining increasing advantage forces girard up against a peaceful country manor
girard seemingly cornered executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof fights from this high angle
dartagnan merely smiles
seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun girard and dartagnan scramble up the v shaped rooftop pause to exchange swipes at the peak then slide down the other side
attacking defending as they go
inside the manor house a handsome woman of forty glances up from her writing table hears footsteps on the roof
she reacts curious not afraid and steps to an open window
as if to follow the footsteps to the other side
girard leaps to the ground first landing in an en closure filled with squawking geese
dartagnan flies after
the geese scatter dartagnan whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt stumbles briefly
girard seeks advantage thrusts his sword toward the young mans heart
but dartagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand rolls over the offending goose glances deadpan apology and rises to fight again
the epic battle continues
girards modest success de volves into desperate flight
dartagnans seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down
then at the last possible moment girard spies escape a slow moving haycart ruimbling up the country road
he runs toward the cart leaps upon it turns back to dartagnan with a confident smirk an expression that vanishes when the young gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to
and still they battle the clash of swords a kind of music by now the men their exuberance the bright morn ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display
just then the haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge
girard backs from dartagnans sword weak from exhaustion he stumbles
dartagnan has his man and he knows it
he prepares one last blow and the haycart shifts deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below
a comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay
girard lands flat on his back stunned his sword out of reach
dartagnan lands similarly but recovers with grace or rather as much grace as the muddy situation will allow
he rolls toward girard sword in hand and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adams apple
a long beat
then a surprise
girard begins to laugh long and loud
dartagnan responds with a charmed smile
breathless deadpan i believe now would be a good time to end your uhm formal training
thank you sir
dartagnan leaps to his feet races off without another word
girard struggles upward peers at the shape of his clothing cut to ribbons muddy and soaked
and god have mercy on whomever you meet next
dartagnan races across the green fields triumphant
she stands at the open window watches his coltish high steps with love
dartagnan steps through the country manor calls out mother
but he does not see her
dartagnan continues chatter ing proudly as he goes
did you see us
you heard us ill bet
girard finally surrendered a compliment
though i almost had to kill him to get it
dartagnan comes upon an open door a small room beyond
he pauses then steps inside
a spartan interior
heraldic emblems upon the wall sou venirs from battles won and lost
a piece of parchment on it the words all for one and one for all
and in a place of honor a worn blue and gold tunic
below it the handsome woman dartagnans mother kneels at an open chest
she turns back to him
didnt you hear me
dartagnan sighs sits in a large wooden chair
his mother speaks quietly eyes turned back to the open chest
your father was a proud man
and he had a right to be
i never knew one as brave or as kind
he knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor
that is why he dedicated his life to his country and his king
that is why he gave his life for both
she reaches into the chest carefully extracts a beautiful saber
i watched you this morning and saw someone i knew
you have your fathers heart his will to fight his courage
but these gifts have no value unless they are given
she rises holds the sword out to him
its time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are
with the kings musketeers
re sword youll need this
quiet moved fathers sword
forged in the crusades handed from generation to generation
and now to me
dartagnan cant help it his eager reply leavens the nobility of the moment with warm humor youthful inno cence
his mother smiles as she repeats
and now to you
with that she holds out the beautiful saber
dartagnan takes it firmly into his hands
a huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment
mother and son stand in the vast expanse
dartagnan holds a restless horse by the reins his traveling satch el attached to the saddle
im not your mother now
im speaking for your father
and this is what he would have told you
never forget the code of the dartagnans
it is your special heritage
beat always seek out adventure
never run from a fight
never submit to insults
except from the king
and be wary of cardinal richelieu for he rules france through the king
a bittersweet moment
dartagnan posed before his first great adventure
but not completely certain that he wishes to leave home
maybe i should wait
until after harvest
dartganans mother smiles understands
and speaks gently to urge him forward
youve heard that every man in the musketeers is on the run from someone or something
but what am i running from
gentle humor a shrew of a mother and a drafty old house
and in this fashion she releases him
dartagnan sweeps his mother into an embrace now turns heroic and leaps into the saddle
the horse reacts with a start skitters in a half cicle
dartagnan struggles to gain control finally brings the horse to rein
he manages a charmed grin
his mother smiles scolds and for heavens sake practice your horsemanship
dartagnan digs his heels into the horses flanks shoots off across bright green fields
his mother shields her eyes from the sun feels a gathering of tears and watches him ride into the distance
dartagnans flight toward a new world
it fills the screen serves as background for the main titles
as the final credit appears and the music ends the blade of a sword enters frame
it slides beneath the emblem pries it off the wall
the emblem falls to the floor with an undignified thud
a fire blazes in a huge hearth behind it
a room in the musketeers headquarters
the fallen emblem is retrieved by jussac an officer who wears the bright red tunic of the cardinals guards
what should i do with this
jussac offers the emblem to a tall elegant wraith in black finery a patch covers one eye
this is the count de rochefort richelieus right hand one of the deadli est swordsmen in all of france
throw it on the fire with everything else
but this is the emblem of the musketeers
the musketeers no longer exist
or havent you heard
cold command throw it on the fire
jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze it is instantly consumed
rochefort watches it burn then walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard
grim funereal silence as a hundred musketeers remove their blue and gold tunics drop them into a pile that already contains their swords and muskets
the musketeers remain stoic throughout unwilling to reveal the depth of their despair
the latter is supervised by the cardinals guards who view their hated enemies plight with satisfaction
this is a sad day for the musketeers the end of an era
monsieur de treville forces a salute toward the captain of the cardinals guards hands over his own musket
treville is the respected leader of the musketeers
this is the saddest moment of all
rochefort watches from above a cruel smile twists his lips
he steps to the railing addresses the men below
a hundred faces turn upward to regard him
and on each the same expression absolute loathing for the man in black
rochefort is not intimidated by this sea of con tempt
he revels in it
by joint edict of his majesty king louis xiii and his eminence cardinal richelieu the musketeers are officially disbanded
in preparation for the coming war with england your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the infantry
you will be contacted and told where to report
until that time you are instructed to return to your homes
shouting to rochefort and who will protect the king
the cardinals guards are more than capable of assuming that
muttered curses and dissent throughout
rochefort raises his voice to be heard you are hereby ordered to disperse
should even one of you resist
the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned
with pleasure and disdain all for one and one for all
as rochefort intended the musketeers explode
but before they can attack the guards de trevilles com manding voice calls out above the clamor
and with that the musketeers freeze
their eyes go to de treville
there is a moment of silence as de treville chooses his words carefully
even in defeat de treville is stoic
go to your homes
our day will come again
de treville shoots a defiant look at rochefort who smiles in a patronizing manner
then de treville leads his musketeers out of the courtyard
he returns to the adjoining room where jussac stands by
rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely
he goes to a mirror and preens adjusting his eye patch to a more rak ish angle
thats when he catches a glimpse of something behind him
a tall powerfully built man stands in the shadows of the room a spectre in red
rochefort and jussac instantly fall to their knees
armand du pleiss the cardinal richelieu steps out of the darkness and into the light his long crimson robes swirling about him like clouds of blood
his face is long shrewd and intelligent
his eyes are penetrat ing
he smiles his crocodile smile
richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls
it contains the names of all the musketeers past and present
have they all been accounted for
hedging all but
on richelieus face a flicker of irritation
speaking up i sent a patrol to find them but it hasnt returned yet
i want those musketeers not excuses
bring them in at once
jussac leads a regiment of the cardinals gruards down paris most colorful and notorious street
they react to shouting and violent noises coming from a tavern ahead
the one called
the dead rat
the tavern door flies open and two of the cardinals guards are flung into the street bruised and bloody
just then a window on the second floor bursts open and a big musketeer dangles a struggling guard by his feet threatening to drop him into the street
the musketeer a man of enormous appetites wine women song is called porthos
jussac shouts release that man
happy to comply porthos lets go of the guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud
then with a wink and a piratical grin porthos ducks inside
jussac darkens signals his men and they rush toward the tavern
jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in a shambles the aftermath of a violent fight
but for now all is calm
a group of the cardinals guards is seated around a big table littered with flagons and bottles
on the floor around them are their swords and rifles
it appears the gruards are celebrating a victory
theres something wrong with this picture
on closer inspection we see that the guards have been stripped to their under clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes
they are all bruised and bloody
some are unconscious
presiding over the celebration are two musketeers
they sit at the head of the table relaxing with their boots up
one of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand kerchief
he is aramis the most handsome and dashing of the musketeers a poet and idealist a gentleman of great personal charm and style
his companion is athos the musketeers deadliest and most charismatic member also its most mysterious and tortured
athos is the unofficial leader of the three musketeers their planner and strategist
at the moment hes sewing up a nasty gash on his right arm
approaching what is this
athos greets him with a dark smile
a private party
athos is that any way to greet our guests
aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously
he is the epitome of politeness
dont be shy gentlemen
your friends have been expecting you
jussac is not amused
your presence is requested at musketeer headquarters by captain rochefort
athos and aramis exchange looks
the cyclops is a captain
he mustve made a pact with the devil
or the cardinal
whats the difference
with an edge of contempt the devil is more ethical than the cardinal
jussac takes a step forward fingering his saber
youre instructed to come with me and surrender your tunics
with a sweeping gesture athos indicates the bloody guards around him
these gentlemen made a similar request
are you refusing to come peaceably
but ill leave it up to my companions
we cant refuse rocheforts invitation
it would be impolite
athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward
and what do you say porthos
to the guards surprise porthos is balancing on the balcony rail above just about even with a large wagon wheel chandelier
ill be right down
with the grace of an aerialist porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier
his weight causes the chains suspending it to break
with a whoop of pleasure porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop jussacs guards squashing them
when the dust clears only jussac has been spared
he looks on in disbelief as porthos extricates himself from the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off
to athos and aramis cheerful ready when you are
athos and aramis sheathe their swords put on their hats wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join porthos
you brought down the house
my aim was off
i was trying to hit jussac
athos fixes jussac with a dark threatening look
about those tunics
jussac turns to watch athos porthos and aramis step to the street
he mutters as if to curse musketeers
dartagnan on horseback pauses on a bluff overlook ing the magnificent city on the seine
what he beholds is paris as it looked in the early part of the seven teenth century its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky
for a country boy like dartagnan paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true
dartagnans reverie is broken by the sound of thundering hoofbeats coming from behind
he turns in response and what he sees is this two women on horseback are riding for all theyre worth pursued by two men on horseback
his heroic blood stirs
women in danger
as the women gallop past dartagnan leaps from his horse
quickly formulating a plan he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road
as the two riders pass underneath dartagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them knocking him out of the saddle
the rider hits the ground and is knocked sense less
dartagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re verses direction and gallops back charging dartagnan
the rider draws his saber
dartagnan dodges the horse and the sword
he catches the second riders arm and yanks him right out of the saddle
the man lands with a painful thud at dartagnans feet
before he can recover dartagnan is upon him with flying fists
one swift punch and the second rider is senseless
dartagnan stands over his two victims out of breath but greatly pleased with his performance
he looks up as the two women ride back to see whats happened
the first woman is of noble breeding a beautiful dark haired girl in her late teens
her name is anne
her companion is roughly the same age titan haired and equally beautiful
her name is constance
anne regards the two men on the ground then dartagnan
she shakes her head laughs with delight and rides off
she smiles down at dartagnan from atop her horse
do you have any idea what youve done
ive saved you and your friend from these bandits
these bandits are the queens own bodyguards
dartagnan is stunned
constance points a finger in annes direction
if i were you id make myself scarce
these men are going to be very angry when they wake up
dartagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning to recover
then he looks up at constance feeling like a prize idiot
i didnt know
constance smiles at him her eyes twinkling
do you have a name
youre a very foolish boy dartagnan
but a very handsome one
constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with anne
calling after her wait
you didnt tell me your name
but constance is gone
dartagnan stands in the middle of the road feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time
the two bodyguards groan and grumble
a bright reflection catches dartagnans eye
he looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet
he picks it up and
the man who attacked you
pointing in the opposite direction went that way
with a guilty smile dartagnan spurs his horse and rides like hell
dartagnan rides to the top of the ridge stops suddenly sees something that takes his breath away
paris laid out for him like a jewel cloaked in mystery promising adventure and romance
dartagnan watches the women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance
athos aramis and porthos sweep into the now deserted courtyard
silence the last thing they expected stops them in their tracks
the place is a cemetery haunted by the ghosts of generations of musketeers
porthos is visibly distraught
rochefort enters from behind an archway
ill take those tunics musketeers
to aramis what did he say
he said hell take those tunics
coming right up
porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the cardinals guards
he drops it on the ground digs into a pocket and takes out another
he finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve
theres one in his hat
like a magician he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places
athos and aramis have a few guard tunics themselves
they pull them out and drop them into the growing pile
i was trying to remember the last time i saw you here
it was the day you were kicked out of the musketeers
conduct unbecoming a musketeer
wasnt that the charge
you ought to know
three witnesses stood against me
it was the least we could do
the bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment
you are hereby ordered to surrender your commissions and make yourselves available for reassignment in the kings army
and if we refuse
you will become outlaws
it doesnt matter where i go or what i do
sooner or later somebodys calling me outlaw
athos cuts him off with a look
hes familiar with porthos propensity for tall tales
but not here not now
athos turns back to the balcony
rochefort lobs a taunt
are you refusing to serve your king
we are refusing to serve the cardinal
same thing these days
france has one king too many
ill tell him you said that
athos who has remained silent speaks with quiet power do that rochefort
tell his emminence the cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the king
from enemies across the sea
from traitors who sit at his right hand
and tell him that he can take away our tunics our muskets even our swords
but he cannot stop us from being what we are
the gauntlet has been thrown
rochefort picks it up with glee
ill make sure his emminence the cardinal gets the message
but i cant promise hell be pleased
rochefort steps back disappears into the shadows
the musketeers regard each other
well if were going to be outlaws i suppose well have to get our affairs in order
are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference
when it comes to you and women fairness rarely applies
interrupts well meet at the columbier rouge at sundown
off their looks to celebrate
and to plan our new lives
citizens of france
the three musketeers
and that is all that remains
athos porthos and aramis step in different directions
dartagnan rides through the streets of paris
a country boy happily stunned by the sights sounds and smells of the city
merchants gossip and call to each other from shop doors
colorful vendors and pedestrians move along the crowded boulevard
acrobats puppeteers and jug glers perform on street corners
laughter and music drift from taverns and public houses
dartagnan views it all with great enthusiasm
he sees the exterior of the musketeer headquarters
the future belongs to him
he crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door
but as he reaches for the handle the door flies open and smacks him in his injured arm
as he enters look out
wincing in pain aaarrgghh
in a panic looking around where are they
where are the musketeers
im in the right place arent i
through gritted teeth not as far as im concerned
athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides his musketeer tunic
dartagnan has no idea who hes dealing with
but this is musketeer headquarters
this was musketeer headquarters
you mean its been moved
i mean the musketeers have been disbanded
feel free to poke around for souvenirs
what do you mean disbanded
some nonsense about being needed in the army
now if youll excuse me
dartagnan blocks athos path
but i just got here
how can i become a musketeer if theyve been disbanded
id say youve got a problem
dartagnan grabs athos by his injured arm
athos stif ling pain fixes dartagnan with a deadly look
you could use a lesson in manners
dartagnan touches his sword eyes flashing at the pos sibility of a duel
im in a hurry now but ill meet you at the carmes deshaux monastery at noon
calling after him ill be there ten minutes early
to himself an hour in paris and i already have my first duel
just then dartangnan spies two familiar figures on horseback distinctive cloaks hiding their faces
anne and constance though he does not yet know their names
dartagnan hurries after
start close on porthos his rogues grin the twinkle in his eye
but catherine dont you see
as an outlaw ill be constantly on the run from the cardinals guards a refugee
think of all the places you can hide me
im thinking of them now
reveals porthos leaning against an open window speaking amiably to a pretty woman on the other side
she dabs a tear from her eye manages a nod
meanwhile dartagnan races around another corner down a narrow lane and speeds after the ladies on horseback
he dashes through a muddy puddle spraying foul water all over porthos where he stands
dartagnan doesnt notice a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled into view blocking the lane
fellow travelers shout complaints the cart driver shakes his head makes an obscene gesture
its a seventeenth century traffic jam
dartagnan sees anne and constance dismount in the dis tance tie their horses and step into an alley
a man waits in the shadows to escort them
dartagnan leaps off his horse he means to continue his pursuit on foot
but he takes two quick steps and
runs directly into porthos outstretched hand
dartagnan looks up literally given porthos impres sive stature and sees the musketeers muddied tunic and worse a unique and expensive sash now thoroughly soiled
not a glimmer of a grin do you know where this sash comes from
it is a gift from the queen of america
porthos righteous indignation is more impressive than his knowledge of current affairs
there is no queen of america
to pretty woman madame augustine would you excuse me for a moment im going to kill him
back to dartagnan ever the gentleman now where were we
glancing at the ladies the alley i rode through a puddle muddied your sash the queen of america except there isnt one im in a hurry and you were about
to challenge me to a duel
amused i was
that seems to be the local custom
porthos lets out a weary sigh
he shakes his head
everywhere i go its always the same
theres always some kid who thinks hes hot with a sword
some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great porthos
the great who
the great porthos
when dartagnan isnt impressed me you idiot
dartagnan gives him a blank look
dont you know who i am
the worlds greatest talker
porthos couldnt be more insulted
he sputters with rage
all right you little puke
you want to die
so be it
one oclock behind the luxembourg
and bring a coffin
bring your own
dartagnan thinks he sees anne and constance races down the alley turns a corner down a short street makes a hasty decision runs down yet another alley
and tum bles into a shadowy lane
he stops looks left and right
and does see them
the ladies enter a chapels back door close the door behind them
dartagnan flies after skids across cob blestones rips the door open
and finds himself face to face with the man who has escorted anne and constance this far
let me pass
im afraid thats not possible
i must speak to those young women
the young women do not wish to be spoken to
i have something that belongs to the queen
ill deliver it for you
no youve been enough help already
would you be so kind as to point out the carmes deshaux monastery
the guard points to a large building in the distance with a large cross
pan across the virgin mary and many lit candles to a beautiful damsel sharing a love seat with the third musketeer the dashing aramis
aramis has a book open and is reading from it
the damsel suddenly grabs aramis and kisses him on the mouth
aramis politely extricates himself
hes not the least bit embarrassed only slightly amused
madam im flattered but i thought you wanted me to tutor you in theology
excuse me monsieur aramis
but when you started talking about original sin i lost control and became impassioned
it wont happen again
theres nothing unholy about expressing ones emotions
on the contrary
religion should be experienced in a passionate all embracing way
we should feel free to express our spirituality
the damsel attacks him again
suddenly a pounding on the door
a gasp of fear my husband
but aramis heart is too noble
he gets down on his knees
first we must pray to god for forgiveness
thats when the door bursts open and the ladys husband an irate marquis enters with a pistol
his eyes blaze with madness
he aims the pistol at aramis head
on second thought gods often busy
aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window
as the marquis aims and fires aramis puts one foot on the ledge and leaps into space
the shot misses him by inches
as dartagnan runs past
aramis lands on top of him and they go crashing to the cobblestones
as they untangle themselves and get up
you broke my fall perfectly
but i do apologize for the inconvenience
angry get off me
dartagnan pushes aramis aside
aramis grabs dartagnan by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back
if theres one thing i cant abide its rudeness
you fell on me
and i apologized for it
i suppose youd like to teach me a lesson in manners too
id be honored
hows two oclock behind the luxembourg
aramis bows politely
if thats where you wish to die i wont disappoint you
aramis takes off
dartagnan swells with pride
three duels in one day
i love this town
the royal palace of louis xiii
have you seen the king
no your majesty
anne or rather queen anne steps into the throne room a massive cathedral like chamber
twin thrones occupy a raised dais
an entire wall is covered with a spectac ular map of the world
the map contains every known country and continent including the new world
the seneschal exits closing the doors with a resounding boom
anne pauses all alone in the big drafty chamber
and for the first time she looks and acts her age
barely a woman chilled by the ghosts of all the french kings and queens who came before her
and a long way from home
anne steps to the great map of the world
she reaches out to touch her own country austria feels a pang of separation
we hear your majesty
anne reacts with a start
a tall powerfully built man stands in the shadows a spectre in red
cardinal richelieu you surprised me
cardinal richelieu steps out of the darkness
how was your ride
richelieus question takes her by surprise
he bows before anne
considering a reply she extends her hand
the cardinal kisses it
im not sure
rising up forgive me
but your welfare is more than a matter of personal interest
it is a matter of state
but rest assured your secret is safe with me
his manner is both charming and paternal
anne smart enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings is nonetheless touched by his concern
richelieu turns to the great map speaks gently
after a beat lonely
is that the same thing
richelieu brings his eyes back to anne continues austrias loss is frances gain
im not sure my new husband shares your opinion
hes young not blind
mostly he is absent
ive barely seen his majesty since our wedding and that was three months ago
whenever hes around me he has nothing to say
arranged marriages can be difficult
your father and i thought yours would bring austria and france closer together
countries align more swiftly than people im afraid
louis and i remain
may i advise you
he says it with seeming humility not condescension
anne nods assent
louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated
he lost his childhood forever that day
i have watched him grow toward manhood seen the toll his life demands
a boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man
he is shy yet boastful
giving yet stubborn
but most of all he is not yet sure exactly who he is
the boy who lost his father
or the king of france
but how can i
make the boy feel like a king
so that the king may be your husband
anne considers his eloquent advice formulates a reply
when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom the seneschal chants his majesty the king
the seneschal steps aside as louis xiii enters
he is surprisingly young no older than dartagnan
his face is handsome and intelligent
cardinal richelieu ive been looking for you
as louis strides toward them richelieu and anne bow
when louis sees anne he reacts with an almost imper ceptible start
her presence catches him off guard
i didnt know you were here
louis hides his nervousness not to mention his love behind a formal veneer
anne emboldened by richelieus confidences replies would you like me to go
louis suddenly remembers the reason hes here
determin ation breeds a more capable attitude
to richelieu aware that she is watching him your eminence i demand an answer
hiding his amusement perhaps if i knew the question
ive just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my musketeers
you approved the decision
but not the timing of the matter
i intended to address them myself explain the situation
your majesty france is on the brink of war
we dare not hesitate
but these men are my personal guards
they are the bravest fighters in france
well need them in the field if were to win this war with england
buckingham plans to invade la rochelle within the month
i thought it best to act quickly i will be the judge of what is best
for me and for france
he says it with newfound resolve
richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace
anne watches the latter closely suppresses a smile
the boy is nearer to king than richelieu imagined
a tense beat
anne feeling out of place steps toward the door
are you all right
you two should continue this discussion in private
hesitates seeks a reason for her to stay your thoughts on the matter interest me
it seems to me that
youre doing very well on your own
she means it
anne smiles exits
after a beat sometimes she scares me half to death
may i advise you
repetition reveals calculation
and the cardinal surprises with quiet humor she scares me too
as do all women who join beauty to intelligence
whats a man to do
enjoying the cardinals humor i have no idea
the course of love is full of frightful turns
but no matter how you feel no matter how hopelessly afraid
never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france
make that your starting point and everything else will fall
the bravest man in france
good advice for a shopkeeper
let alone a king
richelieu acting as the lost father
and louis appreciating it speaking as a son your eminence im sorry that i was sharp with you
its just that the musketeers
well theyre not just my guards
theyre my friends too
but dont worry
from now on ill take complete responsibility for your welfare
indeed he will
richelieu bursts out of the throne room and is joined by rochefort
walking quickly down a long hallway
hes a foolish boy
and barely that
that foolish boy is about to become a man
off rocheforts look which is all the more reason for us to act
reacts knows what this portends and the queen
he smiles lewd she will receive me in ways she never thought possible
hold on the cardinal and rochefort watching the king and queen below
dartagnan walks proudly toward the carmes deschaux monastery bold and brave his future at hand
get out of the way idiot
a speeding carriage bears down on him
dartagnan leaps from its path stumbles
he looks up in time to see the passenger inside and for a moment time seems to stop
she is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty her face framed by the carriage window
long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders languid blue eyes and skin as white as alabaster
she is known as milady de winter
she is to sex what constance is to innocence
dartagnan watches as if in a dream
the carriage the beautiful woman inside it
paris wraps its arms around the young mans heart
suddenly a second face enters the carriage window replacing hers jarring by contrast
it is the fierce visage of miladys indo chinese bodyguard parker
the bodyguard glares pulls at the carriage window curtains taking milady the dream from view
hold on dartagnan bewitched as the carriage rumbles off into the city
a beautiful house situated near the seine
miladys carriage stops before it
she steps to the street parker follows
after a brief spoken exchange the body guard departs on some errand
henri the driver a brutal looking fellow incongruous in his elegant coachmans uniform snaps the reins and guides the carriage away
milady steps inside
reveals this to have been the pov of two men standing in the shadows across the street
count de winter forty five a kind face etched with sadness and armand de winter twenty five his son
they are well dressed
but their manner and appearance suggests that they have traveled a long distance to find her
he will not consider otherwise
armand sighs stands in the shadows and watches his father cross toward miladys house
milady stands before a mirror reaches for one of the many ivory combs that adorn her hair
as she places the comb we notice a small flower like tattoo on her arm
she pauses to admire her beauty then to see the image of count de winter now standing behind her his eyes dark and cold
milady does not move from the reflecting glass she smiles
count de winter
as much happiness as the thought allows we found you
eyes on the mirror yes
now that you have what will you do
bring you back
to pay for what you did to my son
and if i resist
voice breaking with emotion i will kill you with my bare hands
the count steps closer close enough to touch
milady eyes bright with excitement the smile still playing about her lips replies well if thats the case id better start packing
but first my hair
milady who has been removing combs throughout reaches for the next and
armand keeps his eyes on miladys house opposite
no sign of his father
he looks about impatient
and steps across the street to enter
armand climbs a flight of stairs
still no sign of his father or milady
he calls out father
worry makes him hurry
armand takes hasty steps into miladys bedroom
the first thing he sees is his own face in the mirror
the second is his fathers inert body below it
armand gasps races to his side
a thin trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older mans ear
armand gathers his father up into his arms and begins to weep
the monastery is a windowless building bordered by a barren field a dueling ground for men who have little time to waste
athos sits on a stone bench waits for his adversary to arrive
his horse is hobbled nearby
dartagnan rides into view dismounts
ten minutes early
i have another appointment at one
youll miss it im afraid
ill try my best to be on time
athos appreciates the young mans retort takes a closer look
then he rises to his feet the pain in his arm makes him wince
i asked two of my friends to act as seconds but they are not as punctual
dartagnan notices athos pained expression the blood on his sleeve
but youre wounded
i fight just as well with my left hand
if youd rather kill me another time
thanks but i see my seconds coming now
porthos and aramis arrive on horseback
they dismount view dartagnan with amazement
dartagnan reacts with similar surprise smiles sheepishly
to athos whatre you doing
you cant fight this man
because im fighting him
excuse me monsieur
but not until one oclock
amused wait a minute
ive got a duel with him too
but not until two
to dartagnan how long have you been in paris
i arrived this morning
ive also fallen in love
gruff to a fault better to die for love than to live for it
athos gestures for aramis and porthos to stand aside
he draws his saber ready to fight
and in that moment dartagnans face reveals an emotion he has never felt before in his young life
athos sees it allows him a moment to withdraw his saber
dartagnan does so they square off touch sabers and
jussac leads a patrol of the cardinals guards into there they are
athos and dartagnan separate as jussac and his four swordsmen stride towards them
athos steps forward to meet him
i told you the next time we met id want an answer
but i didnt expect you so soon
the three of you are under arrest
the boys of no interest to me and is free to go
do you intend to resist
oh dont be stupid
of course we intend to resist
just give us a second
porthos huddles with athos and aramis
five of them and three of us
it hardly seems fair
lets give them the chance to surrender
interrupting excuse me but there are four of us
they turn and regard dartagnan
this is not your fight
youre not a musketeer
i may not wear the uniform but i believe i have the heart of a musketeer
the three musketters exchange smiles
dartagnans youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism
bold and brave
have you got a name boy
the name has meaning for all of them
the musketeers look at each other deadpan shake their heads
it couldnt be
athos knows that it is
he steps forward extends a hand
the others follow shake as well
athos intro duces each in turn
pleased to meet you
how do you do
good to see you again
meanwhile jussac and his guards look on with increasing impatience
he clears his throat draws his saber
the musketeers turn toward the guards dartagnan standing among them
now that were all acquainted
the cardinals guards
dartagnan and the musketeers draw their swords
suddenly nine men are locked in mortal combat
athos takes a guard named cahusac porthos battles biscarat and aramis battles with two adversaries at once
dartagnan looks for an opponent
and finds himself face to face with jussac
the fighting style of the musketeers is an exuberant mix ture of styles and techniques
athos is a brutal swords man his strokes overpowering and savage
his repertoire also includes swift kicks solid punches the occasional elbow when necessary
aramis is a seamless and graceful technician he handles his two opponents with balletic ease an artist working with steel and flesh rather than paint and canvas
and last and perhaps the most entertaining of all porthos
he is a walking arsenal carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body a crossbow daggers bolo nunchucks all of which he uses with the polished skill of a
add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength and you have a one man wrecking crew of epic proportions
dartagnans youthful energy is by now familiar
he bounds about like a newborn tiger encircles his adver sary changing stance and shifting his ground with alac rity
jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once
losing patience stand still
how do you expect me to kill you if you keep jumping around
a monk watches from the bell tower incensed by the battle raging on the field below
he grabs the bell rope gives it a mighty pull
and sounds a clamorous alarm
porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation
he produces a pair of nunchucks
biscarat looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity slight confusion
and porthos whacks him on the side of the head knocks him to the ground
eyes on the tower damn monks
always spoiling everybodys fun
aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next
they are nearer to god
theyre about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword
porthos slides over to handle one of aramis opponents
hed rather bicker from close range
but biscarat struggles to his feet grabs his saber
porthos sees him sighs
to aramis excuse me
im fine thank you
and porthos returns to his original foe
meanwhile athos heavy strokes take their toll
cahusac staggers wounded in arm shoulder grazed at the head and falls to the ground with a thud
aramis calls out to him indicates dartagnan take a look at our young friend
you mean hes still alive
not only is dartagnan alive but hes making a fool out of jussac
frustrated enraged jussac makes a full lunge at him but dartagnan ducks then slips under jussacs sword like a snake and runs him through
jussac falls to the ground lies still
he is dead
athos and aramis react impressed
then turn their full attention on weakening foes
they disarm and disable them with swift strokes
meanwhile porthos chases biscarat into a grove of trees
the guard has discovered the better part of valor now runs for his life
porthos who is at play as much as he is war takes a spanish bolo from his cloak and whips the balls over his head
biscarat hears the odd whizzing sound turns to face him
the color drains from his face
porthos lets the bolo fly it catches biscarat about the neck the balls slam into his head
the guard drops to the ground without a sound
god i love my work
a sudden silence save for the occasional dull groan
dartagnan scans the battlefield sees aramis bending over jussacs body speaking in solemn tones under his breath
to athos whats he doing
aramis takes death very seriously
porthos returns in high spirits stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak
dartagnan sees the other weapons there including a boomerang
maybe next time
re the bolo do you know where this bolo comes from
a bold jest given the circumstances the queen of america
porthos deadpans then grins acceptance
all for one and one for all
dont encourage him
by killing jussac the boys made himself an outlaw too
not if he leaves paris
which is exactly what hes going to do
i cant leave
i just got here
go home find a wench live long and prosper
why cant i stay with you
aramis and porthos look to athos
as always he will decide
because i do not want you to
its hard to say whether hes acting out of concern for the boy
or he simply doesnt give a damn
whatever the case dartagnan is crestfallen
the musketeers mount their horses porthos and aramis adopt a friendlier tone
i know athos may seem cold and unfriendly but dont let that fool you
he really is cold and unfriendly
but hes also right
this is our fight not yours
go on get out of here
whatever happened to the motto of the musketeers
all for one and one for all
wake up boy
the musketeers are just a dream
athos spurs his horse rides away
aramis and porthos follow
hold on dartagnan as he watches the musketeers grow small in the distance
then sadly he steps to his horse climbs into the saddle
it has been both the best and the worst day of his young life
thats when a group of horsemen come riding around the corner of the monastery five cardinals guards led by rochefort himself
they see their wounded comrades jussac dead and the three musketeers escaping in the distance
pointing there they go
but before rochefort and the guards can give chase dartagnan rides into the middle of the field to challenge them as if to further prove himself worthy of the blue
defiant long live the musketeers
and dartagnan draws his saber
the three muskeeters rein their horses look back to dartagnans bold charge
with admiration do you believe this kid
dartagnan gallops toward the guards to engage them
he races through pistol shots like a demon possessed
rochefort rides to the lead draws his sword
shouts to the others fall back
ill take him myself
and like two jousting knights dartagnan and rochefort meet in the middle of the field
their blades connect with a resounding clash dartagnan is knocked clear of his saddle
he hits the ground with a painful thud
rocheforts guards leap towards him
porthos and aramis are greatly moved by dartagnans courage
rocheforts got the boy
seemingly unmoved too bad
you cant just leave him
athos spurs his horse rides away
aramis and porthos exchange sad looks and hopeful comments
he has a plan
and with that they gallop after
meanwhile dartagnan is soon outnumbered and quickly subdued
this boy fights like a wildcat
exhausted thank you
the guard clobbers dartagnan with the scabbard of his sword
the last thing dartagnan sees is the three musketeers riding into the distance
then the world the walls and towers of frances most infamous prison rise to meet a starless sky
the portcullis is raised by men at arms admitting a spectacular crimson carriage pulled by a team of snow white stallions
the emblem of the cardinal of france is emblazoned on the carriage door and through its window we see the profile of richelieu
lovingly he fingers the upholstery of his extravagant carriage
a chamber in hell
spiders the size of rats rats the size of small dogs
a foul stench in the air
dartagnan is sprawled in a corner unconscious on a filthy matted floor
the sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest
dartagnan wakes with a start springs back into action
as if he was still battling jussac at the carmes deschaux
he slaps the sword away leaps to his feet and reaches for his own
but it is gone
my sword its magnificent
where did you get it
rochefort steps into view the familiar eyepatch admiring dartagnans sword in his hands
after a beat it belonged to my father
rochefort studies dartagnan for a long moment then
well now it belongs to me
i collect swords
i take them from the men i kill
im not dead yet
dartagnan starts forward
but rochefort raises the sword points it at his throat
dartagnan freezes feels the sharp tip of the blade
rochefort shoves dartagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot
dartagnan peers at his dismal surroundings
where am i
ill give you a hint
its not the louvre
realizing the bastille
im in the bastille
well youre the first person who was ever happy to be here
unfortunately your visit will be a short one
what do you mean
you killed one of the cardinals guards
an offense punishable by death
he interrupted a duel i was fighting
also punishable by death
it was a long day
you know them
dartagnan says nothing
he will not betray them
rochefort leans close
tell me where they are and i will be lenient
after a beat i will give you your fathers sword
a long beat
dartagnan eyes the gleaming saber forged in the crusades
he nods gestures for rochefort to come closer
as if to impart a secret
rochefort tilts downward dartagnan rises up
give me my fathers sword and ill cut out your heart
bold words bad timing
rochefort snarls slams the hilt of the sword into dartagnans head
the youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor unconscious
like your father
rochefort storms from the cell
he nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall
the jailer scurries over to dartagnan inert in a shallow puddle of foul water
he lifts drags him toward the chains but dartagnans eyes pop open the jailer reacts with surprise and
the jailer exits from dartagnans cell closes the heavy door behind him
a closer look reveals dartagnan in the jailers soiled tunic eyes bright with adventure
he looks left and right dank corridors darkness the occasional groan
and steps lightly into the shadows
he seeks exit finds only a labyrinth
two jailers con verse step towards him
dartagnan leaps into a cell doorway allows them to pass
suddenly scabrous hands reach from inside the cell grab dartagnan by the throat
he shudders leaps free
dartagnan steps deeper in the labyrinth
frustrated no way out
just then more footsteps heading toward him
dartagnan seeks refuge watches as a cloaked figure steps into view accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers
dartagnan thinks fast
and joins them
dartagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure the ret inue
he keeps his head down glances at the corridor ahead looking for a way out
but the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway into another hall and toward a pristine wooden door
dartagnan watches as the door opens revealing
cardinal richelieu a fear some apparition in red the most powerful man in france
dartagnans jaw drops
the cloaked figure steps inside
the jailers disperse
dartagnan takes steps as if to join them
then turns back eyes the door the cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it
the cloaked figure bows to the cardinal
richelieu smiles concupiscent
rochefort stands in a corner ignored for the moment
i have an errand that requires your singular talents
the figure rises
the hood falls back
revealing the unforgettable features of milady de winter
she answers the cardinals smile with a seductive expression
i was beginning to think youd forgotten me
richelieu and milady share a look of intimacy two vipers from the same pit
dartagnan slips closer reaches for the handle finds it unlocked
he opens the door a fraction holds an ear close
richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve and hands it to milady
carry this to the duke of buckingham
impressed you did it
an alliance with buckingham
the king left me no choice
now that hes come of age the boy believes he should rule france
instead of me
rochefort knows what this portends
he steps from the corner
youre going to go through with everything
silences him with a glance yes
to milady youre to leave for calais at once
a ship called the persephone will carry you to england
it sails tuesday midnight
i want buckinghams signature next to mine before the kings birthday
consider it done
and doing so shall earn you the gratitude of
richelieus not talking about louis
hes talking about himself
dartagnan leaps back from the door as it opens head down shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they return to view
milady unrecognizable behind her cloak steps into the corridor the retinue escorts her forward
dartagnan falls into place eyes down eager for escape
just then a hand slams down upon his shoulder
dartagnan looks up into the face of captain rochefort
dartagnan lands with a thud at richelieus feet
rochefort hisses on your knees
when dartagnan fails to respond rochefort gives him a mighty kick
dartagnan scrambles into the correct posture of supplication
rochefort continues this is the boy who killed jussac
i can explain that silence
rochefort punches dartagnan in the head knocking him to the floor
the cardinal frowns
violence solves nothing
leave him to me
dartagnan reacts to the cardinals reasonable tone
rochefort makes a sullen exit
the cardinal smiles
dartagnan reacts with perceptible awe as if seeing his first movie star
he sits in a finely brocaded chair looks at the cardinal an apparition in red
the cardinal speaks his manner casual friendly
how much did you hear
busted not a word your eminence
i stepped from my cell for a breath of air and became lost in the corridors its dark as you know but then i saw a light up ahead the
light over your door i
richelieu smiles dismisses dartagnans tale with a wave of his hand
you may have many talents my young friend
but guile is not one of them
do you have a name
ive heard that name before
are you a gascon
yes your eminence
what brought you to paris
and dont say a horse
i came to join the kings musketeers
so ive heard
dartagnan i like you
i could use a capable young man like you in my guards
im honored your eminence but i dont think i would be very popular with the other men
not after today
i suppose not
your heart is set on being a musketeer
off his look when i was your age i too had dreams of joining the musketeers
surprised you your eminence
becoming a musketeer is the fantasy of every young frenchman
or should i say it was
with seeming kindness reason like the knights of the round table the musketeers have outlived their usefulness
they are a thing of the past
beat and so have your three friends
tell me where they are dartagnan and i will spare your life
richelieus seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice
dartagnan sees it now replies quietly
no longer in awe but in opposition
but i cant tell you what i do not know
in that case give my regards to the headsman
what about my trial
youve just had it
richelieu turns for the door means to dismiss him
dartagnan calls after
do you object to losing your head
i like it where it is
then tell me what i want to know and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer
beat where are the three musketeers
i dont know
and if you did
after a beat i wouldnt tell you
i admire your courage young man
you might have made a fine musketeer after all
richelieu opens the door
rochefort waits on the other side
but well never know will we
rochefort steps into the room grabs dartagnan roughly by the arm hurls him from the chair to the floor
this time richelieu does not utter protest
instead he turns to the captain commands find the three musketeers and kill them
theyll be dead by dawn
a comforting thought
good night dartagnan
morning comes quickly
with that cardinal richelieu sweeps into the dark
hold on dartagnan for a beat
a motley crowd gathers around the execution scaffold held back by men at arms
a hooded executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a priest
the priest wears a black cassock and a broad black sombrero
the executioner a large man raises his axe and touches the end of the blade cutting his finger
the executioner holds up his bloody thumb
the crowd roars approval
and turns to regard the days victim as he is rolled into view
dartagnan stands half naked his hands bound behind him in a horse drawn cart
the driver turns the cart begins a circuit of the square
the blood thirsty crowd cheers and jeers at dartagnan
but dartagnan keeps his head high
if he must die he will die with dignity
rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square
richelieu appears beside him
milady left at midnight
by private coach
a remarkable woman
the most beautiful ive ever known
and the deadliest
which would explain my attraction
peering down at the scene how is our young daredevil holding up
hes wishing hed never heard of the musketeers
down below the horse cart reaches the scaffold
a man at arms drops the tailgate dartagnan steps down
he is taken into the custody of a captain of the guards and several men at arms carrying muskets
the cardinals familiar carriage is parked a safe distance from the square
the guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities
the coachman remains seated on top braiding his whip
suddenly a gloved hand grabs the coachman yanks him from his seat
dartagnan is led by the captain of the guards up the stairs to the execution platform
the executioner and the priest wait patiently above
dartagnan sees the bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie pales
the priest mutters comfort
fear not my son
dartagnan regards the priest whose face is hidden be neath the brim of his broad black hat
he holds a large bible in his hands
for we are with you always
the priest raises his face reveals it
it is aramis
he whispers all for one and one for all
dartagnans heart soars
he turns to face the execu tioner
porthos grins beneath the hoods overhang
prepare the prisoner
porthos lays his axe aside approaches dartagnan in a threatening manner
he takes him by the scruff of the neck and forces his head upon the chopping block
the crowd goes wild
whispers into his ear dont worry boy
you wont feel a thing
the captain of the guards gives aramis a suspicious look
where is father rostand today
the good father is
all tied up
meanwhile on the perimeter of the square two figures ride on horseback they wear familiar cloaks
a closer look reveals queen anne and constance
they ride through the city towards the countryside beyond
but their progress has led them here
anne frowns at the spectacle
men call it justice
are you surprised
she replies with contempt reins her horse away from the square the crowd the executioners axe
but constance freezes in place eyes wide
as dartagnan upon the cart rolls into view
for just a moment their eyes lock
inestimable space between
constances eyes fill with tears she watches dartagnan
porthos steps back from dartagnan raises his axe
dartagnan shuts his eyes wonders mutters a silent prayer
thats when screams of panic erupt from the crowd
dartagnan raises his head to see the source of this mayhem
the cardinals crimson carriage races toward the scaffold scattering the crowd in all directions
men shout women scream all leaping to avoid the stallions sharp hooves the coachs thunderous spinning wheels
in the drivers seat clutching the reins in one hand and cracking a whip in the other
porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men at arms
aramis opens his bible pulls out a pistol and blasts the saber from the hand of the captain of the guards
a man at arms raises his musket to shoot the false priest but dartagnan leaps out of nowhere lands on him with both feet knocking the man at arms off
athos pulls up alongside the scaffold
the usual dour expression but a hint of levity gentlemen your carriage
compliments of the cardinal
dartagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold springs into the air landing on the seat beside him
aramis and porthos shed their disguises jump after light upon the carriage
the roof fabric tears they drop into the plush interior below
athos cracks the whip
and the stallions race off through the crowd towards freedom
constance watches the escape transfixed delighted
as the carriage barrels from the scaffold she thrusts a gloved fist into the air triumphant
but the cardinal looks on with horror
athos produces a dagger cuts the leather ties that bind dartagnans wrists
athos cracks the whip driving the horses onward
aramis and porthos have settled in comfortably
porthos spies a wicker hamper on the floor
well what have we here
porthos lifts the lid
inside bottles of wine champagne and a wide assortment of foods
how considerate of the cardinal to provide us with a snack
porthos extracts a bottle of wine grabs a turkey leg
aramis looks about the interior spies a small ornate box
aramis opens the box reacts
it is filled with gold coins jewelry
how is it that a man of god becomes a man of gold
looks on grins trinkets for the ladies
aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric roof hands the ornate box to dartagnan
would you be so good as to distribute these
your generosity will be greatly appreciated
open the box reacts but
to the point throw the coins boy
the people are hungry
dartagnan grabs a handful of coins and tosses them into the air
aramis smiles approval drops back to the carriage interior
pedestrians see the gold shout and leap after
their hurried steps impede the guards pro gress horses rear up soldiers tumble
but several of the guards manage to avoid the obstacle pursue the carriage with renewed determination
dartagnan hears a loud popping sound ducks
theyre firing at us
porthos sticks his head into view offers them a bubbling bottle of champagne the source of the popping sound
you know i prefer wine
dont go away
porthos ducks down returns with a new bottle
may i recommend this find cabernet
porthos hands the bottle to athos
athos hands the reins to dartagnan
dartagnan struggles with the reins tries to control the horses
and beams taking delight from every instant of adventure
athos smashes the top of the bottle drinks deeply settles back to enjoy himself
turn right at the next street
the next right
athos growls dartagnan jerks at the reins
the carriage careens around the corner tipping on two wheels
porthos looks up from his chest champagne spilled all over his tunic
and a brand new sash
to aramis thats it
next time you drive
the carriage charges up a steep hill
at the summit athos tosses aside his bottle takes the reins from dartagnan
dartagnan sighs with relief
athos yanks the brake lever brings the horses to a halt and leaps down from the drivers seat
athos pulls the passenger door open revealing porthos and aramis inside
gold coins on the carpet at their feet food and drink between them
gentlemen this is the end of the line
i hope you had a pleasant ride
to dartagnan unhitch the horses
but the guards
dartagnan points to the bottom of the hill
the mounted guards chase after begin their ascent
do as i say
dartagnan hurries to the horses
porthos and aramis climb from the cab
porthos emits a contented belch
to aramis your pistol and powder please
aramis hands athos a sack of powder and his pistol
athos tosses the sack into the carriage takes aim with the pistol and shoots it igniting the powder inside
the interior of the cardinals carriage bursts into flames
dartagnan and the three musketeers mount the cardinals white stallions race off into the distance
porthos shouts laughing
id give five years of your life just to see the cardinals face
the cardinals face is contorted in fury
he steps out of a horse cart approaches the charred remains of his be loved carriage
he stares at the smouldering ruin for a long beat
rochefort and a company of guards stand near by wait for him to speak
when he does his tone is measured and calm
one thousand pistoles on each of their heads dead or alive
the boy knows our plans
rochefort reacts with surprise
dartagnan and the three musketeers rest against tree trunks in a hidden glade polish off the last of the cardinals food and drink
their usual cynicism replaced by something approaching camaraderie
aramis smiles as dartagnan attacks a turkey wing
i havent eaten in three days
i guess with all the excitement i forgot
your trip from home has been an eventful one
he cant quite believe it three days
i heard of a dartagnan once
he was a captain in the musketeers when we were just recruits
he was my father
a good man im told
i knew there was something familiar about this boy
sadly he died when i was nine
the mention of the elder dartagnans death casts a pall
dartagnan continues tentative the memory still hurts
all my mother would tell me is that he died in the service of the king
an uncomfortable silence
it is athos who finally speaks dartagnan your father and another musketeer were ambushed and murdered outside the louvre
dartagnan pales stunned and silent
he manages a broken whisper this other musketeer is he still alive
id like to talk to him
athos shakes his head
porthos adds you already have
his name is the count de rochefort
dartagnan isnt listening
he stands suddenly turns and walks away
he doesnt want the musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes
aramis shouts after dartagnan
dartagnan stands at a flowing stream wipes the tears from his eyes
aramis appears at his side offers silent comfort a hand on dartagnans shoulder
quietly i imagined his death a hundred time
on a battlefield defending his king
fighting bravely for france
i will find the man who murdered my father and kill him where he stands
a man is better measured by his life than by his death
your father was bold and brave
but you never knew him
he lives in you
thats all the evidence aramis requires
dartagnan pauses to reflect
then wonders and your father
i was orphaned at a young age
the church took me in
you didnt have one
but i did
he was a great man a leader of the church
and his example inspired me to dedicate my life to gods service
aramis opens his cloak reveals a priestly cloth
a secret he carries near to his heart
you were a priest
i was a fool
eyes on the cool water this great man this father betrayed the church and turned his back on god
to worship power and gold
quietly it broke my heart to see it
and you became a musketeer
i joined the musketeers and a strange thing happened
i got my faith back
but who was that man
turns to face him all of france knows him
his eminence the cardinal richelieu
dartagnan nearly jumps from his boots
richelieu stands on the roof of the palais lost in thought
he looks down and sees through the smoke and mist the silent rooftops of paris pointed innumerable
richelieu turns and crosses to an elaborate pigeon coop
servants attach messages to the legs of carrier pigeons
rochefort steps into view anxious out of breath
bowing your eminence
the musketeers have been sighted riding north on the road to calais
richelieu nods he already knows
he picks up one of the pigeons strokes it gently
thanks to our winged friends every mercenary and bounty hunter in france will be waiting for them
with a smile isnt modern communication a wonderful thing
richelieu releases the bird and watches it streak sky ward flying across the sky
the three musketeers gather around dartagnan listen to his story
in mid telling i couldnt hear it clearly i was standing by the door the voices were low go on
the cardinal sent someone to england
with a secret treaty
hes made an alliance with a man named bucking
the musketeers look at each other with alarm
the duke of buckingham
nodding do you know him
he rules england the way richelieu rules france
dartagnanj a ship called the persephone waits for the cardinals agent at calais
to take him to england
figuring calais is over two hundred leagues from here
this messenger and the treaty will prove the cardinal a traitor
if we can get our hands on them
what are we waiting for lets go
athos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a single word
all turn wonder
as always the bottom line does the cardinal know you have this information
then he knows we have it too
and hell do everything in his power to stop us
but with three men trying one of us might be able to make it
dartagnan matures by leaps and bounds
athos almost smiles
fog drifts across a lonely stretch of road
suddenly pounding hoofbeats come over the scene
and galloping out of the fog come dartagnan and the three musketeers riding hell for leather
hold on this heroic tableau for a long beat
four rough looking mercenaries crouch on a low bridge spanning a shallow stream
they are armed with muskets and swords
the mercenaries wait in the darkness whisper eagerly among themselves
one of them hisses for silence all conversation ends
and the sound of hoofbeats is heard in the distance
faint but growing closer
well need their heads for identification
the mercenaries raise their muskets take aim
right on cue four horsemen come thundering out of the mist
but just before they reach the bridge the four horsemen break in half one pair rides to the left the other to the right
before the mercenaries realize whats happened the horsemen ride on either side splashing through the shallow stream
in a flash they return to the road and race away
having avoided the bridge completely
cursing the angry mercenaries whirl about fire at dartagnan and the three musketeers as they ride into the night
porthos merry laugh drifts back to mock them
an overturned wagon lies in the ditch
beer kegs litter the roadway
the wagons driver an old farmer sits on one of the kegs holding his head
dartagnan and the musketeers gallop into view rein their horses to a stop
with relief thank god for a friendly face
my horse broke loose
can you help me move these kegs out of the road
dartagnan starts to dismount
stay on your horse
he needs our help
well help him
suddenly two other men step before the wagon pointing muskets
the ragged farmer reaches inside his coat pulls out a pistol makes a smirking request
wont you step down
gentlemen i beg you
please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road
wed prefer to ride on without having to kill you
dartagnan and the farmers gape at aramis in surprise
youre threatening us
its not a threat its a fact
if you dont haul those kegs away youre dead where you stand
the farmer laughs contemptuously
he raises his pistol and aims it at porthos head
but before he can pull the trigger three explosions erupt from under the cloaks of athos porthos and aramis
when the smoke clears dartagnan is startled to see the three dead farmers sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the musketeers
mine hit the ground first
mine was taller
aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform last rites over the bodies
dartagnan still cant be lieve what just happened
he turns to porthos
porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke
theres only one rule dartagnan stay alive
thunder rumbles and rains begins to fall
a large warm tavern with a roaring fire
present are the innkeeper his wife a few benighted tra velers and three barmaids
they turn as the door flies open and the musketeers and dartagnan enter from a raging storm
they keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces
the occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with suspicion
outisde the storm blows
dartagnan closes the heavy door
fearful the innkeeper comes forward to meet the four ominous travelers
see to our horses and bring us some food
apologetic im sorry but we have little to spare
the cardinals guards were here today
they helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay
bitter in the name of god im sure
porthos is on the lookout for danger
he reaches inside his cloak for a weapon and in doing so accidentally exposes his musketeer tunic
crying out musketeers
the sound of sliding steel as athos porthos aramis and dartagnan draw their swords ready to fight
they stand back to back in a circle ready for attack
but there is no attack
quite the contrary
the people here are thrilled to see them
honored musketeers in my house
gentlemen put away your swords and come in
anyone who fights the cardinal is welcome here
the musketeers lower their swords
i think weve found a home
the musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and take off their dripping hats and capes
the pretty barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car ry it to the fire
we dont have much but what we have is yours
porthos rubs his hands together eager to indulge himself
he follows the barmaids booming in his loud friendly voice
ladies youre in for a treat tonight
allow me to introduce myself
im the musketeer they call porthos
porthos beams waiting for a big response but nothing happens
the barmaids look at each other
repeating louder porthos
still no response
aramis and dartagnan hide smiles
its hard to believe they havent heard of the great porthos
oh shut up aramis
the three barmaids perk up
with excitement aramis
did you say aramis
and with that the three barmaids desert porthos and scurry across the room to attach themselves to aramis
porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair
i dont get it
i just dont get it
porthos regales the barmaids with a tale
i said a queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark
practiced in the arts of pleasure
the barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee
but dartagnan isnt so sure
porthos with two barmaids bellows a reply
if youre going to be a proper musketeer youll have to learn the manly art of wenching
the barmaids heartily concur
dartagnan looks over porthos shoulder to the dark haired barmaid seen previ ously
porthos follows his gaze grins
ahh very good
your first subject
but youll need instruction
porthos pulls one of the barmaids to his chest brings her lips toward his
the secret to wenching is the first kiss
for in that kiss a lasting impression is made
if it is weak she will think you are weak
and if it is comical she will think you are a clown
and as a musketeer is never weak and only rarely a clown your first kiss must be all the things that you are
porthos gives the barmaid a powerful kiss
he breaks it turns to dartagnan with a grin
you may speak first if you like your name her name an endearment or two
but words are usually a waste of time
only if you dont know which words to say
all turn to regard aramis
hell play along too
porthos reacts with delight
dartagnan with interest
aramis continues words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of porthos kisses
still reeling not likely
sit beside me
aramis courtly behavior is as out of place in these en virons as it is persuasive
the barmaid slips from porthos lap sits down on the bench beside him
aramis does not touch her
he simply looks into her eyes
and begins to speak
shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summers leash hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye
of heaven shines and often is his gold complexion dimmed and every fair from fair sometimes declines by chance or natures changing course untrimmed but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou growest so long as men can
breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee
the barmaid once skeptical sits silently
her face covered with tears
aramis pauses almost embarrassed by the outcome
he turns to dartagnan cites shakespeare
the barmaid on his lap disagrees
dartagnan looks at the dark haired barmaid across the room
porthos urges him on
come on dartagnan
we havent got all night
dartagnan steps forward
the dark haired barmaid sees him coming and smiles
dartagnan stands before her hesitates not sure where to start
then remembering as best he can shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou are move lovely and more tempest er more tempered
beat ahh to hell with it dartagnan takes the barmaid into his arms delivers a powerful kiss
as previously demonstrated
porthos and aramis smile proudly
the barmaids cheer
the boys a natural
so little time so much to learn
dartagnan drains his flagon indicates athos sitting at a table by himself scowling working on his third bottle of burgundy
in all the years ive know him
i have never seen athos smile
why is he sitting by himself
athos takes his drinking seriously
hell be his usual warm charming self by morning
calls out service
my lap is cold
a barmaid scurries into view
porthos grabs her by the waist adds the barmaid to the one already sitting on his lap
the chair breaks beneath them and all three go sprawling on the floor laughing heartily
he remains lost in drink
dartagnan appears beside him
he hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude
come join us
athos pulls dartagnan down with a dark smile
he fills his flagon for him
you fight like a musketeer
lets see if you can drink like one
ill drink anything you put in front of me
famous last words
raising his flagon what shall we drink to
dartagnan notices the dark haired barmaid eyeing him across the room
the word nearly makes athos grimace
he stares at dartagnan for a long beat then beyond
as if to look into another time and place
beat would you like to hear a story dartagnan
a love story
athos voice reveals unexpected vulnerability the pain he keeps inside
dartagnan is fascinated moved
he nearly whispers yes
athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy wipes the blood red wine from his lips
i once knew a man
one of the counts of berry
my native province
when the good count was about your age he fell in love with a visitor from paris
a breathtaking girl of seventeen
she was more than beautiful dartagnan
and this man the poor idiot he married her
isnt that what people do when they fall in love
sharply be quiet and listen
beat the count took her to his castle and made her the first lady of the province
they were happy for a time as happy as a man and a woman can be
then one day while riding in the woods the girl was thrown from her horse and knocked unconscious
the count hurried to help her
her dress was torn
on her her arm the woman wore a gold band in the shape of a serpent
it was the only article of clothing she refused to remove
the counts curiosity got the best of him
he reached over and slid down the gold band
he saw something on her arm
something shed kept hidden til then
the fleur dlis
shed been branded
dartagnan reacts with shock
the counts angel turned out to be a murderess who escaped the executioners blade
she swore that she loved him
swore that she had changed
and if he would just keep her secret they would live a long life together
athos pauses imagines that life
the count and his angel
but the count was young and he was stupid
he was tormented by the ridicule of his social class
and so he rejected her
for her lies and for her past
beat and turned her over to the authorities to be executed for the crime
athos now turns his unflinching gaze on dartagnan
but you see
his heart did not agree
the count soon realized what she had meant to him
and what he had done
betrayal was far greater than her own
beat soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him
gave up his title
and was never seen again
he loved her
he killed her
it seemed like the same thing after a while
hold on athos for a long time
as he gathers up his pain and puts it back again
athos smashes open another bottle
but the story has made dartagnan quite sober and a little sick to his stomach
he refuses another drink
more for me
aramis play something with some blood in it
i feel like dancing
aramis launches into something appropriate
porthos and a barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance
porthos is damned good
his joie de vivre is infectious and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging him
every once in awhile another weapon a dagger or something drops out of porthos clothing and hits the floor with a clatter
thats when porthos dancing with abandon spins out of control trips and falls on athos table crushing it to the floor
porthos lies in the wreckage staring up
athos totally unperturbed looks down and offers him the bottle
care to dance athos
only if i can lead
porthos blinks in amazement at athos grim face then breaks out laughing
athos made a joke
the innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt and a sleepy expression
excuse me gentlemen
were we making too much noise
you told me to wake you at dawn
they turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows
sunlight is peeking in through the cracks
the sun rises casts long shadows across a sparkling dew wet field
dartagnan and the musketeers ride into frame continuing their journey to calais
dartagnan squints ahead wincing with every bump
beautiful morning eh dartagnan
dartagnan is terribly hung over from the nights carousing
he looks like he could puke at any moment
so thats exactly why porthos shouts to him and says
you know dartagnan its not a good idea to travel on an empty stomach
you really should have had a big portion of those sheeps brains
dartagnan covers his mouth
porthos laughs good naturedly
my head feels like its filled with the kings marching band
would you please stop whistling
im not whistling
well someone is
to others the barmaids kiss left him dizzy
i hear it too
it sounds like
knows immediatley a connon ball
athos is cut off by an ear piercing whistle as a cannon ball drops out of the sky and strikes the ground nearby sending up a tremendous explosion
i hate cannon balls
another ball explodes into the ground in front of them
their horses rear up in fear threatening to dump them out of their saddles
as the musketeers and dartagnan struggle to control their horses they look back and see an old castle atop a distant hill
a group of men operate two rusted cannons left over from some long forgotten war
the musketeers barely calm their horses when another ball comes screaming their way impacting a few feet away
as dirt rains upon them to dartagnan hows your head now
im beginning to wish the cardinal had chopped if off
stay with us and you just might get your wish
athos spurs his horse across the field dartagnan and the musketeers follow
but they discover crude battle ments in their path
athos changes direction sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance
he changes direction again as the horsemen charge after
they ride as fast their mounts will carry them
a cross roads up ahead
athos sizes up the situation shouts command
split in half
dartagnan rides with me
dartagnan nods thrilled to go with athos
well see you in calais
athos and dartagnan take off in one direction porthos and aramis in the other
the pursuing horsemen soon race into view break in half to give chase
a room heavy with mist and steam
behind a maze of gauze screens we discover anne reclining in a large tiled bath constance attending
constance replenishes the bath with pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron
in mid conversation as confidantes and friends but how your majesty
how can you tell if youre really in love
do you think about him all the time
considers replies yes
and when hes around do your knees feel as weak as water
and when he looks at you do you suddenly forget how to breathe
then youre in love
thrilled by the knowledge knew it all alone i am
anne turns to constance soap and water swirl about her naked body
she wonders who is he
youll never believe it
of course i will
the young man who rescued us from the bandit
the young man on the scaffold
turns back in the water peers ahead youre right
i dont believe it
a warm beat
anne and constance are friends as much as they are queen and subject
are you in love your majesty
what an impertinent question
if only her life her emotions were as simple
is a matter of state
a sad beat
constance teases do you think about him all the time
playing along as queen my mind touches on many subjects
do your knees feel as weak as water
when he looks at you do you forget how to breathe
and anne is a girl of eighteen again not queen
wistful she replies i hope he will someday
i hope i will too
hold on anne for a beat
anne steps to a dressing chamber wearing a long robe arranging her thick wet hair into braids
constance have you seen my
anne stops short
cardinal richelieu waits for her in the dressing chamber now bows assumes a supplicant air
your majesty forgive me
i need your help
and could not in good conscience wait another minute
you want my help
on what matter
remembering richelieus last encounter with louis your king
richelieu allows the jest remains silent watchful
anne resumes chooses her words with care
as your eminence has been kind enough to advise me
nods assent its the least i can do
richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure
he steps closer
i am worried about the kings
what do you mean
the huguenot rebellion occupation in the antilles and cayenne
the coming war with france
these are not the usual hobbies of youth
and now he wishes to postpone his birthday celebration
he feels it is not
it sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters
which is exactly why we must celebrate
off her look to show the world that the king of france is strong enough to face any enemy on any field
to show france
that he is king
beat he will listen to you
if you will speak
richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence seeming loyalty
anne considers replies noncommittal i will speak to him
anne senses hidden agenda intrigues below the surface
the conversations conspiratorial tone begins to disturb her
now if youll excuse me i
anne nods turns back toward the chambers
richelieu calls after
off her look please understand that i do not underestimate the value of your assistance
and that i wish for you to consider in fact to know all that you and i might accomplish
quietly as if to justify for france
richelieu steps away his red cape swirling behind him
anne feels a chill pulls her robe more tightly about her body
infantry troops drill outside the kings palace prac ticing muskets and sabers
louis watches from a balcony
richelieu appears fresh from his encounter with the queen
louis looks up greets him with displeasure
louis watches from a balcony
richelieu appears fresh from his encounter with the queen
im sorry to be late your majesty but i was wrestling with an important matter of state
richelieu never allows the mask to slip
even for an instant
louis glances at the throne room the increasing number of cardinals guards on duty
they make him feel uncomfortable
louis speaks with renewed determination
why is it i dont see any of my musketeers
they have become outlaws
they are terrorizing the countryside robbing and killing innocent people
louis cant believe it
there must be some mistake
i have reports from the local constables involved
richelieu ever prepared produces a sheaf of papers
no doubt counterfeit
but louis has no way of knowing
he takes the papers into his hands reacts with sadness
they are better off disbanded
louis turns back to the balcony the soldiers marching below
his mood glum and lonely
he sighs moves on to another matter of business
your eminence ive been hearing some very troubling rumors about you
richelieu nods not the least bit concerned
there are so many to choose from
is it the one about my alleged alliance with buckingham
lets see if i remember it correctly
while the english attack from without ill undermine the throne from within depose you and become sovereign of france myself
that rumor your majesty
richelieu smiles his face a mask of innocence
it does seem rather farfetched
if there are any doubts of my loyalty theyll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday celebration
ive been thinking about that
a birthday celebration when were on the brink of war
alert ready for this as well your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their king at a time like this
im not so eager
i have an idea
why dont you discuss the matter with your queen
louis looks up wonders
as richelieu draws him deeper into his spiders strategems
porthos and aramis ride hard look back over their shoulders
they crest the top of a bluff rein their horses to a stop
they can afford to rest for a moment
their pursuit is at least a mile behind them
my horse will not survive another league
in kind ten twenty at the most
porthos looks into the near distance manages a weary smile
heres just the thing
a nice relaxing boat ride
at the bottom of the hill a crude ferry lands at the bank of a swift choppy river
the ferry is an open flatboat a wooden platform about fifteen by twenty feet
it travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope
transport is slow the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes
as porthos and aramis arrive the flatboat is just re turning piloted by its ferryman a hunched and weather beaten gnome
four passengers wait to be carried across two gentleman cavaliers on horseback and a country woman and her child
as the flatboat enters its slip the two cavaliers urge their horses on board rudely jostling the woman and her child to the rear
the ferryman an experienced boot licker bows and scrapes to the cavaliers collects the coins they toss to his way
a privilege to carry you on my humble boat
the ferryman turns a greedy eye on the woman and child
but i only have one
couldnt my child ride free
shes so small
hand outstretched demanding two pistoles
a courtly voice intervenes
put away your money madame
you and your child will cross the river under our protection
all turn to regard aramis on horseback porthos at his side
the woman reacts with grateful surprise
the ferryman is outraged spittle flies as he curses and protests
nobody rides for free
under your protection bloody well indeed
ill teach you a thing or two about protection
apple cheeked young fools
just who do you think you are
waits for the tirade to cease simply musketeers
two two cavaliers react to the word
the ferryman does too into cringing obedient servant
well why didnt you say so
of course youll ride for free
i insist on it
this way pretty madame
my what a lovely little girl
aramis takes porthos by the shoulder and turns him so he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the hill on their horses
and with that porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom erang and brings it down on the dock rope
the rope splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock
the pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of the dock but theyre too late
porthos and aramis have gotten away
porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers
aramis ties scarves around the horses eyes to blindfold them for the crossing
then he turns around and sees what aramis is already seeing the two cavaliers watch them with keen interest
youre those musketeers everyones been looking for
popularity has its price
the first cavalier smiles produces a flask
i have some excellent brandy here
would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the cardinal
wed be happy to
porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak
if youll drink one with us to the king
but the only king we recognize
is the cardinal
there are those who would call that treason
happily no such objections have been raised
you are by your dress and by your manner members of a bone lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to his eminence the cardinal is as that of
a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before
beat piss is piss no matter what robes surround it
i was momentarily inspired
the cavaliers are not amused
the first replies in measured tones his lips white with fury
may i reply
courtly by all means
better to be a dog in the service of a great master than a beef witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature
of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it
which is to say that most muddy brained of all men
the cavaliers have already pulled out their swords
porthos and aramis now reach for their own
porthos deadpans maybe theres something about us that just pisses people off
at least id like to think so
its too bad we can only kill them once
the middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the best place for a duel
but the combatants make the most of it
slipping sliding and falling
they attack with everything theyve got
the cavaliers are excellent swordsmen
and as if that were not enough the musketeers have an additional disadvantage they must keep the woman and child clear of the flashing blades
porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a devilish grin chases him between and at one point over blindfolded horses
aramis duels with the expected artistry gradually re ducing his opponent to tatters
at one juncture the child loses her footing slides toward the low end of the flatboat the deep river beyond
aramis executes a neat sidestep stops the childs desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle with the other
he returns child to mother with a grin continues
the two cavaliers are soon vanquished groaning on the flatboat deck
porthos and aramis meet at the middle breathless
porthos complains ive been called a lot of things in my time
eyes on the opposite shore porthos
but beef witted is a little more than i can stand not to mention unfair
aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it
there waiting patiently swords and muskets already drawn
is a patrol of cardinals guards
can you swim
doesnt like the sound of this no
my horse can
aramis hurries to his horse takes off the blindfold
porthos grumbles after follows suit
they leap atop their mounts the horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the edge
you go first and ill watch your progress
then they cant help it aramis and porthos grin
life is an adventure lived to the fullest
one two three
and with that as the woman and child the ferryman look on aramis and porthos guide their horses into the raging river
the woman whispers after thank you
porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance
the cardinals guards react with anger and disbelief
a wild ride down the roaring river
porthos clinging to his horse for dear life
aramis keeping an eye on his fellow musketeer
and the deep rapids up ahead
through twists and turns walls of white water huge boulders and gyrating whirlpools
aramis and porthos finally reach a quiet pool a leafy shore beyond
they lead their horses from the water step toward dry land
and see yet another or perhaps the same patrol of cardinals guards
waiting swords drawn for their arrival
porthos looks down at his latest sash destroyed like the others
aramis draws his saber mutters
a nice relaxing boat ride
and with that aramis and porthos charge towards the guards
cool clear water
widen to reveal dartagnan and athos at a shallow pond watering their horses
the forest around them is dark and primeval
do you think weve lost them
theyll catch up eventually
to the point as always
dartagnan pauses to look at their beautiful surroundings remembers my father used to hunt in a forest like this
he promised to take me on my tenth birthday
i dont know why he picked that year
something about a boy becoming a man
id lay in bed at night and imagine it just the two of us
but he died before i could go with him
athos is unmoved or so it would seem
he replies with quiet cynicism well
you have your boyhood wish at last
the dark forest
the thrill of the hunt
the nearness of death
only dartagnan is the hunted not the hunter
id be proud to die for my king
i just wanted to save you from the life of a musketeer
you dont have to go looking for experience dartagnan
itll find you soon enough
and when it does it will mark you forever
athos rides into the forest
dartagnan hurries to follow
athos leads dartagnan through the forest
sunbeams shoot down through thick branches like golden bars
a pastoral setting almost peaceful
and then thundering hoofbeats
athos and dartagnan turn in surprise see six horsemen crashing through the glade
athos and dartagnan gallop through the dense forest
the horesmen fire pistols as they ride
a shot grazes dartagnans shoulder he staggers retains his mount
athos leads them up a hillside a series of boulders at the top
the climb is fast and treacherous gunfire all around them
athos horse is struck by a bullet stag gers forward
and collapses just as they reach the crest
dartagnan leaps off his horse takes cover with athos behind the boulders
athos takes aim fires a shot and kills one of the horsemen below
the others curse leap from their mounts seek cover
shots whiz back and forth like angry hornets
stalemate but not for long
they are badly outnumbered
the horsemen creep slowly up the hillside from tree to tree
athos turns to dartagnan as he reloads ill hold them off for as long as i can
go on without me
i cant leave you here
not like this
ride to calais and stop the cardinals agent
athos points his pistol at dartagnan
go or ill kill you myself
a few days ago dartagnan would have obeyed without question
fearful if nothing else
but not here not now
a duel then
we never finished the first
ill toss a coin
tails i stay heads you remain
athos fires off another shot
he produces a gold coin flips slams it between palm and hand
and looks between
dartagnan is to remain
athos looks up without missing a beat
athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving dartagnan a chance to see
athos reloads fires below
dartagnan recognizes the kindness he has received
that athos cannot fully express it
and that there is no use arguing with him
at least take my pistol
he gives it to athos
they clasp hands
gruff yet proud dont let us down
there are tears in dartagnans eyes
he knows athos hasnt got a chance
a choke of emotion ill never forget you
athos turns away shoots at another horseman
dartagnan runs to his mount gallops away
he rides straining to hear the sounds of gunfire
as long as the shots continue he knows athos is alive
the shots cease
dartagnan swallows his heart and rides
a lonely stretch of road illuminated by moonlight
a signpost announces calai leagues
an exhausted horse clops into view its rider half conscious in the saddle
it is dartagnan
he can barely keep his eyes open
suddenly dartagnan passes out tumbles from his saddle and lands in the middle of the road
he opens his eyes once a sky filled with stars then closes them
we hear horses and the creak of a carriage approaching
the driver brakes and the horses are brought to a halt just short of trampling dartagnan
in the darkness we can make out other shapes rugged men on horseback bodyguards to the carriages passenger
milady de winter
what is it henri
theres a body in the road milady
pistols are cocked
henris shadow falls across dartagnans body
its a young man
he appears to be injured
we hear the carriage door open
footsteps to dartagnans side
my what a handsome boy
put him inside with me
strong hands grasp dartagnan and lift him from the cold ground
out of the darkness a face appears blurry and obscured
it fills the screen slowly swimming into focus
it is milady de winter even more beautiful in closeup
familiar and no doubt deadly ivory combs gleam in her hair
she smiles warmly
did you dream
reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn
dartagnan regaining his senses finds himself propped up in a large bed
he blinks into the face of milady who sits at the edge
his eyes widen with recognition faint awe
have we met
saw you in paris
dartagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged
he looks around the large room
a fire roars in the grate
food and drink have been set upon a table
dartagnan continues still groggy uncertain where am i
this is calais
with a jolt calais
muttered to self the ship
tuesday at midnight
dartagnan leaps out of bed
then realizes he is stark naked
dartagnan gathers a bedsheet around him
frantic where are my clothes
im having them cleaned
is something wrong
what day is it
dartagnan runs to a window and throws open the shutters
beyond the harbor lights of the port of calais
its tuesday near nine
are you sure
somewhere in the night a bell tolls the hour
dartagnan relaxes slightly
milady rises from the bed
she wears a sky blue dressing gown something soft and silken beneath it
dartagnan reacts perceptibly
en joying his discomfort milady crosses the room joins him at the window
are you in a hurry
after a beat how did i
i found you in the road
like an unwanted kitten
do you have a name or shall i make one up for you
nervous my name is dartagnan
i like that
i am the countess de winter
my husbands dead
i have learned to live with death
she manages to combine sympathy seduction and just a hint of danger
all in a single reply
dartagnan hesitates he is not immune to her charms then countess im very grateful for what youve done but i cant stay here
a handsome young man with important business in the still of night
does it involve a young lady
does it require clothes
i need my clothes
they wont be ready for at least an hour
i told the innkeeper to bring them when they are dry
until then im afraid you are my prisoner
would the prisoner care for a drink
milady crosses to the table food and drink upon it
as she passes by the fire her dressing gown seems to disap pear revealing a silhouette that makes dartagnans heart stop
always innocent never coy i am
milady pours wine into glasses turns to face him
and offers a smile that dazzles and burns
then we will sit by the fire and eat and drink and you may impress perhaps even move me with the story of how you came to lie unconscious in
the middle of the night on the road to calais
soft seductively i love a good adventure
dartagnan hesitates then steps to her
a carrier pigeon flutters out of the dark sky and enters its box
the little door on the other side opens
a hand reaches in and removes the bird
richelieu unpeels the message on its leg
a room as cold as the man who owns it
behind richelieus desk there is a life sized portrait of the king
rochefort occupies a window seat cleaning dartagnans sword
he lifts it to the light and slashes the air
he stands duels with an imaginary opponent
richelieu enters with the message
dry re rocheforts fencing the wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled and always easily defeated
the pride of victory without the risk of loss
if only life were like that
richelieu sits at his desk peers at the message
he looks up pleased
milady has reached calais
i told you not to worry about the musketeers
they are dead by now
buckinghams signature will be on the treaty by morning
the kings birthday celebration
will proceed as planned
thanks to the kind intercession of queen anne
rochefort steps closer speaks quietly
and our plans
knowingly will proceed as well
richelieu pours two glasses of port offers one to rochefort
they turn raise their glasses to the kings portrait
dartagnan and milady face each other on a rug in front of the roaring fire
the plate of food between them is empty
they drink wine from goblets
dartagnan drains his cup and stares into the burning embers
milady speaks quietly with seeming compassion you are sad
i was thinking about my friends
milady knows when to speak and when to listen
she looks at dartagnan with gentle expression allows him to continue
the warm room the wine her kindness
all conspire to loosen his tongue
dartagnan speaks quietly from the heart
the three best friends a man could have
we were separated on our way to calais
im afraid ill never see them again
what brings you here
id like to tell you
but i cant
he wants to impress her
he wants her to know how brave he is
and milady is well aware of it
she looks down assumes a more vulnerable pose
men make bold plans in secret
and women wait
to mourn or to celebrate the outcome
i know from experience its a lonely vigil
after a beat all i can tell you is
im on a mission for the king
looks up laughs lightly ive heard that one before
you are a young man
and young men are given to exaggeration
however if you would like to entertain me with a story im eager to hear it
and please make it very brave filled with handsome knights and beautiful ladies
i know a dragon there is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than a woman who does not take him seriously
dartagnan acts accordingly and reveals
i came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england
alert though dartagnan doesnt see it a spy
i believe you
beat arent you afraid
musketeers are not afraid of anything
i knew it
i knew you were a musketeer the moment i saw you
with sudden concern but dartagnan if this spy was to find out you are here your life could be in grave danger
a musketeer is not afriad of danger
youre not afraid of me
her tone heralds a sudden shift
dartagnan sees the look in her eyes can almost feel her lips upon him
but he resists
there is constances memory to consider
and midnight as it approaches
youre not dangerous
then what am i
milady covers him with caresses
dartagnan resists slightly but she presses closer she will not be denied
milady leans close runs a fingertip along the line of his jaw
her dressing gown falls open at the top enough for dartagnan to see her breasts as they press against the silk beneath it
milady speaks as her finger traces
they are the same
and with that she reaches up to her hair an ivory comb
he cannot continue
constance the hour a confusion he cannot deny
im sorry dartagnan pulls back just as miladys arm arcs down toward his neck holding a long sharp stick pin almost a dagger attached to an ivory comb
dartagnan sees it in the nick of time parries with his free hand knocking the dagger to the rug
milady leaps after it hands out stretched
dartagnan follows battles for the dagger stunned with fear and surprise whatre you doing
have you lost your mind
you came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england
dartagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge
milady is the messenger he is seeking
he grabs the dagger rolls to the side
milady staggers after the shoulder of her negligee rips open
dartagnan sees the soft white flesh reacts with shock recognition she bears the brand of the fleur de lis
the infamous mark of the murderess
just as athos told it to him
not so long ago
crying out parker
the chamber door flies open
henri and parker the indo chinese bodyguard appear
parker faces dartagnan with a half smile
he holds out his hands both empty
and steps toward him
dartagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand
then unwilling to fight the man with an un fair advantage he tosses the dagger to the side steps forward to meet him
parker disposes of dartagnan with lightning speed
a series of unexpected kicks brutally efficient blows
the young man is unfamiliar with and no match for the martial arts
parker hoists dartagnan to his feet dazed
henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions
milady straightens her dressing gown adjusts her hair and commands kill him
parker holds him fast
henri steps forward
and dartagnan thinks fast
you can kill me
but a surprise waits for you in england
that even buckingham cant prevent
stops henri with a gesture what
thats one thing ill never tell you
you are young vain and foolish
but i do not know if you are clever
dartagnans expression reveals nothing
except to suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping
duly deceived though she doesnt know it milady changes her mind
well take him with us
to dartagnan with a nod at parker parker will devise ways to convince you to share your final secret with me
it is a long voyage
miladys eyes show nothing but cold cruelty
milady emerges from her room dressed for travel
she is followed by dartagnan now clothed
he is flanked by henri and parker
henri presses the blade of a knife against dartagnans side
the bodyguards are waiting outside
milady leads them down the hall
but when she reaches the landing and looks at the tavern below
she draws back with surprise
the innkeeper roused from sleep and wearing a night shirt is engaged in urgent conversation with armand de winter the son of the man milady killed in paris
the innkeeper shakes his head
armand grabs him by the collar
dartagnan sees miladys reaction surprise impatience and just a hint of fear
milady commands the back stairs
they change directions
as he is pulled away dartagnan catches a glimpse of armand de winter below
miladys coach emerges from the carriage house speeds away in the direction of the harbor
in the drivers seat henri whips the horses driving them onward
miladys seven bodyguards follow on horseback
dartagnan and parker sit across from milady
her face betrays faint doubt apprehension
emotions she is not used to feeling let alone displaying to the world around her
dartagnan sees his opening
and speaks the man at the inn
what did he want
hollow laugh justice
he is the brother of my late husband lord de winter
he blames me for de winters death
he thinks i murdered him
did you murder your husband milady
what do you think
dartagnan studies her pale beautiful face
remembers athos tale of love and loss
i think hes not the first husband you killed
off her look i once knew a man one of the counts of berry
he told me a story
of beauty and danger
he was the bravest man ive ever known
and the saddest
the truth strikes home
milady cannot conceal it
but she does not react with anger or scorn
dartagnan has reminded her of the one thing in the world that still touches her heart
dartagnan looks at her with a steady gaze
milady cannot hold it she turns to the carriage window
miladys carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to the harbor
the fog is so thick that only the masts of the schooners can be seen poking out of the gloom
their lanterns glow gloomily
the carriage comes to a stop
the lights of the harbor are muted by low hanging fog
we see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier
henri helps milady out of the carriage
miladys bodyguards dismount six of them
a motley bunch of sinister killers
they look around the pier ready for any encounter
dartagnan takes in his surroundings
there is a mel ancholy air about him
whats the matter dartagnan
still hoping for your friends to ride to the rescue
my friends are dead
if its any consolation youll soon be joining them
miladys return to form does not surprise
parker shoves dartagnan toward the fog enshrouded ship
a name can be made out on her barnacled hull
henri calls out to the ship which is little more than an outline in the fog her boarding gangplank leading to the soupy darkness of her deck
we are the countess de winters party arrived from paris
permission to come aboard
there is no reply
closely guarded by parker dartagnan strains to see
milady nods to henri
he steps up the narrow gangplank followed by milady dartagnan parker and the six bodyguards
the deck is filled with swirling fog
henri peers into the gloom as he climbs aboard followed by the others
he addresses one of the crew a tall figure standing nearby
take us to your captain
the tall figure does not reply nor does he move
henri demands what are you deaf
henri goes to shake the man
he grabs his arm and the man pitches forward falling face first on the deck
henri jumps back in alarm
milady and the others react
what is this
miladys bodyguards rush around the deck confront the other silent silhouettes
they like the tall figure
the limp bodies topple at their touch
the bodyguards shout alarm and panic dead
theyre all dead
well i certainly hope so
after all that hard work
thats when porthos and aramis come swooping down from above like avenging angels
they swing on the ends of ropes slicing through the air then dropping feet first on top of miladys bodyguards
dartagnan stands open mouthed as his three friends draw their swords
calling to him you look like youve seen a ghost
two of them
remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters
a heroic tale of love death and musketeers
suitable for the general public
porthos wades into the bodyguards at play shouting as he goes
all right then
all those who wish to die raise your hands
dont by shy theres plenty to go around
dartagnan grabs a sword from the deck turns to join the fray
and finds himself face to face with parker the indo chinese bodyguard
parker has two oriental swords spinning in his hands
one knocks dartagnans sword out of his hand
dartagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck
as parker is about to chop dartagnans head off his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword out of frame
in the mist athos is revealed
sorry im late
did i miss anything
dartagnan almost cries with happiness
he leaps to his feet and embraces athos
i thought you were dead
keep your mind on the mission dartagnan
he winks at dartagnan returns to the fray
the musketeers confront miladys evil bodyguards in the night and fog
athos with brutal perfection
porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the absurd
and aramis with familiar grace and artistry and a marked determination to disable not kill his opponents
milady views the latter with alarm
as the battle rages around her she retreats into the shadows
athos and dartagnan find themselves fighting side by side
athos observes dartagnans technique the usual frenetic windmill of feint and thrust with a frown
boy its a miracle youre still alive fighting like that
what do you mean
first always find your enemys weakness
second take advantage of it
one of the bodyguards who wears a wooden leg attacks athos
athos kicks the false leg out from under him knocks him to the deck
dartagnan repeats even as he disables his own foe
find the weakness
aramis kneels at a dying man delivers muttered last rites
a bodyguard races into view means to kill him where he kneels
aramis doesnt miss a beat he shifts rises delivers a punch and kick knocking the man off the ship to the water below
a splash is heard
and aramis resumes a priestly pose continues the litany
two sailors crew members of the persephone return to the ship after a nights drunk
they see and hear the mayhem ahead
thats our ship
the two sailors pull out daggers and bound up the gangplank
the two sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild battle
they look around for someone to assault see a large musketeer with his back turned
porthos hears them coming spins
the two sailors stop in their tracks eyes popping with horrified recognition
porthos the pirate
with a collective yah
the two sailors drop their daggers and flee into the foggy night
porthos looks about to see if anyone noticed their exit
dartagnan grins nearby
i told you i was famous
porthos the pirate
theres a difference
every musketeer is running from something or someone
dartagnan deadpans i love a good sea story
do tell me sometime
porthos reacts to dartagnans jest
but before he can reply the youth has bolted back to the fray
the battle raging aboard the persephone sabers flash athos drives several bodyguards back with his sword notices dartagnan working his way towards him
did you find the cardinals spy
did you kill him
is a woman
athos turns to dartagnan wonders
and at that moment sees a figure at the gangplank swathed in fog and diffuse light
time stops as they regard each other across the deck the battle between
milady turns and runs into the night
athos races after
with the speed and grace of a panther milady runs down the gangplank climbs into the saddle of one of her bodyguards horses and gallops off
athos appears moments later leaps into the saddle of another horse
and gives chase
milady whips her horse drives it onward
but athos overtakes leaps from his saddle takes her into his arms
they fall to the ground with a crash
milady grabs the deadly comb from her hair grips the daggers handle
athos stunned from breaking their fall rolls to his side
milady peers at his face vulnerable in the half light
and lowers the dagger
she will not kill him
milady scrambles to her feet runs toward a dark forest
but athos stands and shouts stop
milady takes a halting step then turns to face him
athos holds his musket in a steady hand
a very long beat
milady takes a step closer
finally she whispers with love with hate athos
how did you do it sabine
how did you come back from the dead
a kind gentleman took pity on me
i did not
you were too proud to listen to the truth
i learned the value of lies soon after
athos grips the pistol tighter as if to ward off the past and what it brings
give me the cardinals treaty
then i will shoot
athos cocks the trigger
milady whispers be kind
and aim for my heart
athos face is a mask of contradiction
he tries to pull the trigger but it is not in him
milady recognizes his pain with a nod
she feels it too
then briefly before she leaves him milady speaks softly
the past their love and where it led them
she turns and runs away
directly into the arms of armand de winter
he has ridden and he has followed and he has finally found her here
countess de winter
as dartagnan porthos and aramis arrive on the scene
the public room is empty save for dartagnan and the three musketeers
they gather around a table
aramis holds the treaty in his gloved hand
the mood is somber and tense
the treaty outlines richelieus plan to forge an alliance with buckingham
what about the king
he is not mentioned directly
but the agreement is contingent on a demonstration of the cardinals power
what does that mean
i dont know
athos face grows dark
he has been silent throughout
now he rises to his feet
i know someone who does
dartagnan aramis and porthos watch in grim silence as athos crosses the room to an imposing door
a fire burns in the grate
milady sits beside it in a chair staring into the glowing embers
their hot re flection dances in her pale blue eyes
there is a knock at the door
armand de winter emerges from a dark corner of the room where he has been standing guard with an impassive executioner
he crosses to the door opens it
and athos steps inside
id like a word with your prisoner
a beat he nods she dies at dawn
athos nods and steps to milady stands before her
milady stares at the fire speaks softly her eyes on the flames
quietly sardonic did you come to offer me consolation
milady turns looks up to face him
there was a time when i wouldve given my life for a kind word
i could not give it sabine
milady hears the regret in his voice holds his gaze
athos indicates armand in the corner
did you kill his brother and his father as he says
a long beat honest at the last i have become
the nightmare you once thought me to be
but not before
the memory will keep me company
athos kneels at her side near to pleading do you know the cardinals plans
will you spare my life
remembering another time another place society demands swift justice
off his look ill take the secret to my grave
youll die for your crimes
nothing can stop that
but how you leave this world is up to you
milady offers a half smile takes his hand in hers
what did the world ever do for me
hold on athos
miladys hand in his
all that he is feeling
a hundred feet below waves crash on a rocky shore
on the jagged cliff above a black mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with copper colored clouds surreal in effect
a sinister procession approaches the cliff
porthos leads milady
she wears a simple white shift her hair pulled back into a long braid
she looks years younger the girl she used to be
the executioner walks behind them
followed by armand de winter aramis dartagnan
he watches every step
the procession stops at the cliffs edge
lightning slashes the sky
the executioner ties miladys hands behind her
the executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his cloak
milady catches athos eye
he holds her gaze
he stares at milady unflinchingly as if to burn her image into his eyes so that he might keep it there until the day he dies
aramis reaches inside his cloak removes the sacred priestly cloth he carries
the executioner delivers the formal litany i forgive you for your crimes
die in peace
athos repeats whispers die in peace
aramis comes forward intones i am the resurrection and the life sayeth the lord
he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
the executioners sharp blade shines in the light of dawn
on your knees
milady kneels the executioner steps closer
the tableau silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon
the executioner brushes miladys braid from her neck exposing the soft white skin beneath
he raises the scimitar overhead and just as he is about to bring it down
a cry is heard torn from the heart no
athos grabs the executioners wrist and twists the scimitar loose
it falls to the ground
porthos leaps forward locks his great arms around athos
athos but athos breaks free
milady rises to her feet
athos rushes to her
forgive me sabine
the words he could never say finally spoken
milady locks eyes with him
athos desperate act the pure feeling it signifies has given her a kind of release
and the strength to face her fate
the cardinal intends to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration on friday
and with that milady reaches forward offers a gentle kiss
then as athos and the others look on stunned uncertain
she takes a backward step finds the cliffs edge
and steps over it
the executioner rushes to look after
the others follow
except for athos who remains rooted in place eyes on the distant horizon
a long silence
gods justice be done
dartagnan sadly lowers his head
porthos puts a consoling hand on his shoulder
aramis stands to the other side mutters amen
dartagnan porthos and aramis turn
athos has regained his former self
stoic in command
and hiding a broken heart
the kings life in danger
we have work to do
start close on the now familiar portrait of king louis xiii usually found hanging behind richelieus desk
a shot rings out and a blast tears through the painting leaving a smoking hole where the kings heart should be
reveals richelieu and rochefort as they walk across the roof to the painting appraise the damage
thie cardinal pokes a long finger into the hole
he can do it every time
rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman positioned far away on one of the roof parapets
the marksman rises from a shooters crouch bows curtly and begins to reload his musket
and he has no qualms about
he believes that man should honor no kings before god
a man of faith
turns back to the painting whatever youre paying him double it
i want the kings birthday to be a memorable event
and rehang this painting in my chamber
just as it is
hold on richelieu for a beat
framed by a sky filled with stars
his evil intent
music up and
dartagnan and the three musketeers thunder through on horseback
pedestrians scurry to get out of their way
as they ride past porthos raises a crossbow and fires it
the arrow slices through the air with a terrible hum and imbeds itself on the public wall
attached to the arrow is a piece of parchment like the one in dartagnans fathers study
it reads all for one and one for all
a captain in the cardinals guard makes a public pronouncement from horseback outside a cathedral
townspeople are gathered around
the aforenamed musketeers are declared outlaws and are sentenced to death
any person sheltering or aiding them will be hanged hoofbeats interrupt
the captain turns in irritation
and porthos and aramis ride to either side snatch the man up by the arms drag him briefly through the air and deposit him with a thud against a hitching
the captain stunned looks down at the piece of parchment now attached to his chest
all for one and one for all
as the word is passed to musketeers in homes and pastures brothels and gaming casinos
galvanizing them into action
all for one and one for all
the city as seen from the hills
a glorious sunny day
the citizens of paris move through the streets
they share a common destination the palace
a festive mood is in the air
and why not it is the kings birthday
a gathering of nobles and ladies all in full ceremonial dress
rochefort is there as well the familiar eye patch in command of the cardinals guards
a seneschal waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers
the trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal blast
louis queen anne and their retinue enter from a corridor proceed slowly across the room toward the balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside
noblemen bow and their ladies curtsy as the king and queen pass
constance dressed for the occasion looks on from the sidelines smiles
the king and queen proceed two teenagers with the world at the feet
hungry more likely
still you were right about the celebration
and when the cardinal told me how much it meant to you
i said nothing
the cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you
both pause to consider the manipulation
richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession he watches the king and queen as they walk speaks quietly to himself im not sure which is sadder
to die so young
or to die a king
richelieu turns from the procession
speaks to rochefort who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him
france will not go wanting
a new king will sit on the throne
the true king after all
he says it quiet fervor the dream at long last within reach
then as if to reassure
is everything ready
yes your eminence
are you sure
id stake my life on it your eminence
a dark beat rest assured captain
the balcony has been colorfully decorated
the crowd focuses its attention on the empty space where the king will soon appear
below the entrance to the palace is protected by a double line of the cardinals guards resplendent in their crimson tunics
it would take an army to get past them
the streets leading to the palace are clogged with people all pushing and straining to get closer
dartagnan and the three musketeers arrive on horseback are forced to dismount
they push through the crowd trying to reach the palace afraid that they will be too late
athos barks orders as they struggle forward to dartagnan look through the surrounding area
well try to reach the king
athos and the others press on
dartagnan a little disappointed to be left behind pauses checks the buildings that loom overhead
then he starts reacts with shock and surprise
the bell tower of the carmes deschaux monastery
a figure moving about dimly viewed but this much is clear
the man is not a monk
and he is carrying a musket in his hands
dartagnan turns to alert the musketeers
too late they have already vanished into the throng
dartagnan takes off running for the monastery
high above the swelling scene
the marksman assumes a crouching position raises his musket and trains it on the empty balcony where the king is soon to appear
louis and anne continue toward the balcony
richelieu trails the royal couple
he nods to rochefort in passing
they exchange significant smiles
anne spots the smirk on rocheforts face
he resumes a supplicant pose
anne glances back richelieu behind them
i do not trust him
im not sure who to trust
then we will discover the truth together
louis likes the sound of that
they step side by side toward the balcony
bell ropes hundreds of feet long dangle down the vertiginous shaft
dartagnan races up the narrow circular stairs
above him is the open trap to the bell tower
he catches a glimpse of the marksman back turned taking aim
athos porthos and aramis push their way through the crowd trying desperately to reach the palace entrance
but the throng is impenetrable
athos turns wonders
and shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the carmes deschaux looming against the sky as if to intuit the danger lurking there
louis and anne lead the procession to the doors of the balcony
the crowd roars and the trumpets blare
the king steps into the sunlight
the queen follows then richelieu
the three most important people in france stand together acknowledging the clamoring multitudes
the marksman takes careful aim
the cheering down below is like a faint whisper at this altitude
the marksman cocks the hammer of his flinklock
dartagnan hears the click of the muskets hammer and knows he must act now
he looks around and sees his chance
dartagnan leaps off the stairs and grabs a handful of rope using his weight to ring the bell overhead
the big bell makes a resounding ear splitting clang causing the marksmans shot to go wild
the shot misses the king and explodes into the wall an inch from his head
louis turns to richelieu sees anger and disappointment flash on the cardinals face
just for an instant
but it is enough
pandemonium inside and outside the palace
athos porthos and aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance draw their swords and prepare to rush the long line of guards protecting the doors
the guards cannot believe what they are seeing
three men against a hundred
the looks on guards faces begin to change subtly at first from amusement to horror
behind athos porthos and aramis something incredible happens
musketeers appear from every direction
some from the surrounding crowd
some from buildings roof tops
others appear on horseback a few disguised as monks
and all defiantly wearing their blue and gold tunics
the murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar
the corps of musketeers line up behind athos porthos and aramis
porthos and aramis exchange a smile
athos keeps his usually dour expression
but his eyes are charged with excitement
they raise their arms and face the long line of guards
a hundred sabers flash in the sunlight
save the king
the musketeers charge
it is a glorious sight
dartagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor and tackles the marksman
as the bell continues to clang they fight hand to hand
the marksman forces dartagnan toward the edge of the tower
two hundred feet to the ground below
they remain deadlocked for a beat the marksman inching dartagnan backward certain death behind him
and at the last moment dartagnan summons up the strength of three and shoves the marksman backward with a resound ing kick
the marksman stumbles falls through the open trapdoor and plunges to his death
dartagnan peers down the shaft
theres a faint crash as the marksman hits bottom
utilizing the bell ropes like a firemans pole dartagnan grabs hold and slides down into the abyss
rochefort instructs his guards to close the huge door to the great hall
the members of the kings royal court run in panicked circles convinced the palace is under seige
constance pauses amid the riot seeks the queen
but richelieu has found her first
he steps to anne assumes an air of priestly innocence
but louis steps into view puts a protecting arm around his wife speaks stern command leave us
thats when a loud boom rocks the room
the great door shudders under the impact of a terrific blow
another boom and the great hall is plunged into further chaos
the regiment of guards rush forward press their bodies against the door to secure it
boom the great door threatens to split in half
richelieu huddles with rochefort amid the rising panic
his eyes narrow to mean slits he gestures toward louis and anne across the room
a cold whisper kill him
kill her too
rochefort draws dartagnans sword from its sheath
he advances on louis and anne
louis has witnessed the latter treason confirmed
he raises his own sword prepared to protect his queen
to die for her if necessary
to anne get behind me
rochefort takes confident steps toward the king
but one last boom and the great door comes crashing down on the guards revealing a tide of musketeers on the other side
athos porthos and aramis at the lead
louis breaks into a wide grin
the musketeers wade into the guards and the great hall is transformed into a bat tlefield
rochefort turns sees athos charging at him
greetings monsieur cyclops
are we interrupting
not for long
athos and rochefort lock swords and duel
musketeers surround louis and anne to ward off attack
but the young king has no intention of being protected
he wades to the fore fights side by side with his musketeers
anne watches him with a host of emotions
louis pauses to return her gaze then returns to battle
constance dashes through the fray
she sees a guard slip behind a curtain approach the queen
she grabs a heavy goblet shouts look out
anne looks up
constance tosses the goblet to her
anne catches it neatly brings it down on the head of the hapless guard
constance smiles leaps forward
aramis cuts down a guard
as another man comes at him from behind porthos intervenes runs the man through
the two musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks and continue
athos and rochefort slash at each other
it is a mighty confrontation
but athos soon gains the upper hand
rochefort shouts to a nearby guard for help
now its two on one
athos receives a wound in the shoulder he staggers
and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor
rochefort reacts with a start he grabs the treaty stuffs it into his doublet
athos shakes off the sudden pain disposes of the guard
rochefort and athos face each other a second time
athos wounded rochefort confident he can finish the injured musketeer
but athos merely changes sword hands
their sabers clash as they draw together
rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand
but athos sees it coming and smashes rochefort across the face with his fist
rochefort goes sprawling
he loses his sword it slides across the floor until someones foot stops it
rochefort looks up
and sees dartagnan standing on the blade
this sword belongs to me
dartagnan stoops to pick up his long lost sword
he tosses his other saber to rochefort who catches it neatly
athos watches from a short distance knows this moment belongs to dartagnan
he will not intervene
but he shouts dartagnan
kill him where he stands
these are dartagnans words
a son vowing to avenge the death of his father
by all means
lets discover if you are as brave a man as your father was
and as foolish
stunned by the revelation as it unfolds what
he died for his king and for france
but most of all
he died on the end of my sword
the final curse as will you
rochefort smiles a taunt
dartagnan raises his sword whispers to heaven
this is for you father
then eyes blazing dartagnan attacks rochefort with everything hes got driving him into an adjoining chamber
a fire roars in a great stone hearth
its light pro jects giant shadows on the wall as dartagnan and rochefort duel slashing at each other
athos porthos and aramis take the fight to the cardinals guards
each with his by now familiar tradmarks
king louis fighting beside them
they battle before the blazing fire sweat covers their faces
rochefort wears a wolfish grin
but dartagnan has learned his lessons well
he attacks with gusto
rocheforts grin soon turns toward desperation
he cannot match the boys vengeful steel
so he drives a knee into dartagnans groin
dartagnan falls to the floor
rochefort means to finish him there
but dartagnan rolls away from the blade leaps back to his feet
undaunted he hurls himself at his hated opponent
rochefort sidesteps throws dartagnan against a wall
he pins him there stunning the youth
and hisses with superior disdain one things certain
youre no musketeer
but dartagnan remembers athos advice
always find your enemys weakness
he shoves a thumb into rocheforts good eye
rochefort stumbles backward
dartagnan plunges his sword into monsieur cyclopss heart
take it back
rochefort crumples to the floor dead
dartagnan looks at rocheforts blood on his sword
his fathers death finally avenged
thats when he hears the rustle of a silken robe
dartagnan pivots sees richelieu kneeling at rocheforts body
extracting the treaty from his doublet
richelieu smiles hurls the treaty into the blazing fireplace
as the flames begin to lick at the parchment paper dartagnan flies past the cardinal and dives after to retrieve it
athos porthos and aramis enter the room
dartagnan stumbles out of the fireplace covered with soot clutching the treaty
on dartagnans look of triumph
a short time later
the battle is over
the musketeers have won
on the dais louis and anne confront richelieu who is a prisoner now guarded by several musketeers
louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands
dartagnan and the three musketeers stand nearby
your majesty that document is an obvious forgery
i am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three musketeers
richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose one familiar to both king and queen
this is a complicated matter your eminence affecting both france and the crown
as all wonder if richelieu will manage to elude blame after all
but louis continues with quiet author ity just a trace of humor
as king and as a man
and so until such time as i and my advisors gestures toward anne the musketeers can determine the whole truth of the matter
i invite you to await our decision in the comfort of
musketeers close in around the cardinal
he fumes protests
you cant do this to me
im the cardinal of france
never more certain and i am its king
shouts of long live the king
long live the king
and as king
i hereby reinstate the musketeers
a tremendous cheer is heard from all
richelieu is led from the room
he pauses in front of dartagnan
congratulations monsieur dartagnan
ill be keeping an eye on you
unphased thank you your eminence
ill be watching you too
richelieu smiles his crocodile smile
followed by guards he turns and strides away hands clasped behind his back scarlet robes billowing behind him
louis turns to the musketeers
he indicates dartagnan
is this the young man who saved my life
porthos puts a hand on dartagnans shoulder
his names dartagnan sire
dartagnans heart pounds as he draws closer to king and queen
then he remembers reaches into his doublet
and turns to the queen
i have something that belongs to your majesty
dartagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road
he holds it out to her
the king wonders the queen smiles
thank you dartagnan
but the bracelet does not belong to me
off his look it belongs to her
anne indicates constance who steps forward into view
dartagnan and constance lock eyes for the third time
the thrill of recognition the promise of romance charges between
dartagnan slips the bracelet around her wrist
constance kisses him on the cheek
louis continues dartagnan i am in your debt
what can i do to repay the courage youve shown me
whatever your heart desires
dartagnan knows what he wants
but he is tongue tied unable to ask for it
athos asks for him
majesty his heart has only one desire
to become a musketeer
dartagnan looks at athos thankful for the intercession
louis answers with pleasure
then kneel dartagnan
dartagnan drops to his knees
louis lays the blade of his sword on each of his shoulders
the world is an uncertain realm filled with danger
truth despoiled by broken promises
honor undermined by the pursuit of gold
freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong
but there are those who oppose these powerful forces
those who dedicate their lives to truth honor and freedom
they are a constant reminder to all of us
that such a life is not just possible but necessary to our continued survival
as a country as a king
these men are known as the musketeers
as louis speaks dartagnan closes his eyes countless images rush through his mind
his home in gascony constance and queen anne on the country road his first encounters with athos porthos and aramis their adventures together the face of milady
its been a busy week
and join them
dartagnan stands transformed from boy to man
bells ring in the distance
constance smiles brightly tears gleam in her eyes
athos porthos and aramis surround their young friend and happily present him with the bright blue tunic of the musketeers
they slip the tunic over dartagnans head react with a cheer
dartagnan hugs each of the three
for each has given him gifts more valuable than gold
porthos aramis and last
who to the surprise of all who know him
do my eyes deceive me
i find it hard to believe myself
his lips unused as they are to such a contortion twisted and stretched
into a smile
it was spectacular
and what teeth
dartagnan basks in their company wonders aloud
i know this is a stupid question
but what exactly does a musketeer do
porthos and aramis exchange a glance
theyre not so sure themselves
helpfully suggests a third and freedom
werent you listening
the three musketeers no make that the four musketeers raise their swords and clash blades together causing them to give off sparks
all for one
and one for all
the curtain falls
