the crow salvation by chip johannessen the crow salvation by chip johannessen silence
broken by the faint clink of precision tools
accurately patiently wielded
a scalpel returned to its place in a neat array of taxidermy tools
long surgical tweezers taken
a steady hand grasps a clay bird form
then sets the second eye
a mystery man features obscured sets the tweezers aside reaches for a black lump on the table revealed to be shiny feathers as he wraps it around the form
adjusts it so the glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large crow
a taxidermy specimen
wide the man works across the room under the pooled light of a draftsmans lamp the crow on the table in front of him
his identity yet to discover
the walls like a medieval castle above a throng of protesters and gawkers
a postcard at first then signs of movement handheld placards and flickering candles telegraph an imminent execution
the group shifts amoeba like as
a large mercedes approaches slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd
inside the benz nathan randall father of the victim comforts erin randall seventeen year old sister as she looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car the
throng between the car and the prison entrance
the car stops
why are there so many
just hold on to me
through the windshield a protestors poster visible
remember the victim
with a picture of lauren randall the deceased who bears a striking resemblance to surviving sister erin
and another sign happy birthday alex
its because theyre doing this on his birthday
she takes a deep breath they get out of the car and
with the randalls as they make their way through the throng toward a special entrance marked witnesses nearly within reach when whomp
erin shields her face as a bright light comes on
over tv reporter barbara gonzalez action newsteam addressing the nathans
speaking into a mic
do you think this execution will bring you a sense of closure
nathan pushes past gonzalez taking erins hand
leave us alone
the reporter turns to the camera not missing a beat
a difficult time for everyone involved
then interesting fact
it will take about twenty one cents of electricity to execute alex corvis tonight on this his twenty first birthday
close on a birthday cake twenty one candles flickering as it makes its way past deathrow cells held waiter style on one hand by mercer a mustached prison guard
the barred door opens and the cake swoops in landing on a small table next to a chess game in progress and an untouched last meal
adjust to find
twenty one today
he looks up from the game at
peter walsh alexs pro bono attorney and only friend trying not to explode at this shit eating stunt
he didnt order that
we found the man with the scar
despite himself alex looks up
mercer gestures at
the cake in the middle of the candles an arm made of frosting with a large zigzag marking on the forearm also frosting
favoring alex looking from the cake up to mercer who nods at the candles
make a wish
intense whisper get it out of here
alex focusses on the chess board
tries to anyway
the harsh newsteam video light whumps on illuminating a wrinkled old woman
yes ive come to a lot of these over the years but this one has many unique aspects
youth of the condemned
fifty three stab wounds
kind of a record
and corvis still maintaining his innocence
oh they all say that
a nervous not to say shifty looking thomas tommy leonard thirty five year old key witness in the trial talks to gonzalez under the hot video light
i dont fault him saying i lied on the stand
facing the chair you do what you gotta do
but i saw those two fighting that night
tommy shifts uncomfortably silent as we hold a long beat
i didnt lie
a chess piece a castle shoved at camera
adjust to include alex
he breathes deliberately trying to hold it together
his hand shakes as he removes it from the piece
alex gets up crosses to a small ledge on the other side of the cell that holds a few books and pictures
a picture of lauren and alex in a grove of tall trees
a self portrait by autotimer
arms around each other
her head on his shoulder
resume alex staring at the photo taped to the wall
whats been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace
and ill be seeing her again soon
only what will i say
that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her
that hes down here laughing
well get him
someday hell surface and ill get him for both of you
ill find the guy with the scar
four uniformed cops dutton erlich larkin and toomey in the harsh news light
erlich holds a cane in one hand
larkin and toomey are twosie monkeys smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity
this mystery man with the scar
indicates forearm the zigzag whatever
erlich gives a long suffering look
like its preposterous
but hes too gentlemanly to say it
we couldnt find him
and obviously the jury didnt buy it
some people here seem to
people here are protesting the execution of a kid just turning twenty one
a kid who had a tough life
no parents no dough
always had to fight for everything
its a tragedy it really is
but i dont see a single sign telling me alex corvis is innocent
alex still gazing at the picture of lauren
at the board walsh moves a piece
i was facing the hot seat id want my attorney banging down the door of the supreme court not playing board games
but maybe thats just me
they look up as mercer appears outside the barred door to the cell starts to unlock it
it really is
other prison personnel arrive outside the cell in various uniforms a minister with clerical collar the warden two guards
walsh crosses very emotional how
gives alex a huge hug
i dont want you to watch
i dont want to give them the pleasure
the two friends exchange a long last look
as alex exits past mercer walsh sits down on the cot
hes hard to read a second until he lashes out flips
the cake against the wall where it hits slides down still semi intact as it hits the floor
dead man walking
a mini parade past the cells of the condemned
one guard flanks alex another follows
the warden and minister out in front
hands extend from the other cells as alex passes
unable to touch but he reaches for them a gesture of solidarity
mercer catches up with the group flanking alex cell side
alex drops his hand cut off even from that
the parade continues down another hallway
the chair an atavism sits alone a moment before the entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well choreographed last dance
the warden gestures and alex is escorted to his place in the chair
the guards move in death attendants now
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
the minister continues as
alex squirms despite his resolve
through an act of will calms himself
looks up at
on the wall
a last possibility of reprise
trouser legs slit
footstraps tightened around bare ankles
chest strap tightened
yanked again for good measure
its hard to breathe now with the strap tight across his chest
pieces of sponge jerry sewn onto it the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural appearance
adjust to reveal this is the electrode in the odd leather helmet tightened now on alexs head
pulls a hood over his own obscured face
moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room
concluding and i will dwell in the house of the lord
the minister shuts his bible
some weird sin
alex strapped into the chair unable to move
the guards exit jobs done
the warden nots and
as the curtains open
two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a singlewide trailer
gonzalez and other media types
every seat occupied
sweaty and surreal
all looking at him
in the death chamber the warden steps forward
alexander frederick corvis
do you have any last words
a thick silence
alex looks unprepared uneasy as he scans a sea of hostile faces settling on erin and her dad
i loved lauren
i still do
erin shakes her head disgusted
alexs pov the last seconds of his life slowing in his inner perception movement ramping down as alex scans the disbelieving faces
the observation room witness door opens
a guard in the back row deferentially offers his seat to the new arrival a man in dark clothes his face obscured by reflections in the plexiglass
as he unbuttons his shirt cuff
the warden steps to the side of the room nods to the executioner who lifts a cover off a large switch
the new arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm exposing a scar for alex the scar an odd zigzag pattern of raised welts a pattern deliberately formed of skin
the executioner throws the switch
on alex shaking violently as he fights to stay alive time extremely subjective now as he chokes out
indistinct filtered murderer
the word bubbles up as if from underwater audible only to alex
alex wrenches his head a superhuman act of will trying to id the scar man through the reflections
the helmet starts to smoke
then a burst of flame at alexs head
a botched execution made worse by alexs struggle to see to stay alive
in the observation room the observers panic horrified
only the scar man calm as he covers his arm rebuttons his shirt
face always obscured
in the death chamber alex in electro spasm smoke filling the room the warden in real time now as he runs to pull the curtain closed
it jams partway across
alex expires in the char grotesquely burned eyes open as the warden finally yanks the curtain closed
in the observation room the scar man slips out but the rest remain transfixed horrified
erin and others in tears
hold a long beat their gasps faintly audible
cruel whos to say but it sure was unusual
two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far from the in your face security of deathrow
look at this
goddamn helmet melted down
that my friend is a deterrent
they wipe past alexs charred remains visible a moment parts of the helmet fused on his face and head his body convulsed in a pugilistic attitude
the guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker one of several
mercer opens the locker door
the unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and
the body hits the open door
convulsed as it is the body wont really fit through the door
the sound of something breaking as the shove alex into the cubby hole
why do they even autopsy these guys
cause of death is pretty fucking obvious
from inside the locker
the door slams shut
close on the picture of alex and lauren
adjust to include walsh looking at it
still trying to understand
he secures it to the lid of the case already containing the neatly packed chess set
bows his head
the protestors are gone as is the newsteam but the four cops are still there larkin and toomey synchro smoking
they look up as the randalls emerge shaken from the witness entrance
favoring nathan randall he speaks softly to erin whos leaning against him
to erin ill meet you atthe car honey
she continues on and randall crosses to the cops who wait patiently to see what hell say
we all wish this had ended better
like thats all anyone could say
as he walks off the cops fall into easy chatter
cut to close
a face slides into frame in profile too tight to be recognizable
just an eye peering
eyes pov through a magnifying glass a coarse zigzag stitch shaped like the scar runs the length of the crows underbelly
the end stitch now tied with a tiny knot
tightened just so
the mystery man features obscured still grabs a bent surgical scissors snips the excess thread
smoothes black feathers into place hiding the stitching on
the crow finished
the man gets up leaves
camera pushing on the birds head as we hear a door shut still pushing on the glass eye that blinks now
inside the locker
a human eye blinks
barely visible in the darkness
alex kicks with a yell and
in the morgue
the locker door flies open and alex spills onto the floor
gropes a few seconds on hands and knees before a shadow passes over him evoking a primitive response
he cowers looks up at
a large crow flutters through the bars of a high window lands near him on the floor
it looks at him then flaps its way up to the autopsy countertop cocks its head
alex strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought him here
his pov as he slowly rises above the gurney the crow in front of a mirror over the splash sink
it flies off revealing alexs reflection
alex drops back to the floor with a scream
turns sees himself in a stainless door and smashes it with his fist
the bashed stainless door the word morgue painted on the wall behind alex brought into focus at the center of the concavity
alex thrashes trying to avoid his reflection but the dim mirrors have him surrounded
the crow flaps down crazed too as if in empathy
cawing loudly finally getting alexs attention
alex settles hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel
his body looks less misshapen now
he looks at his arms hands no longer burned
pulls himself up on the gurney again cautiously
over alex as he slowly rises above the gurney a second time looks in the mirror
his body miraculously healed covered by shredded clothing
his face obscured by the meltdown helmet
he slowly approaches the mirror on unsteady feet
to his own reflection what happened
alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first frightening flash as his fingers touch it
alexs internal pov flashback a blitz return to his own execution
the copper screen the helmet lowered into place
the faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen darkly
resume alex clutching the helmet on his head ripping it off in one painful overcranked movement and
over alex in the mirror its alex and yet not
his face marked with the crow mask jagged warpaint where the melted helmet ran down his face
an indelible reminder of the botched execution
he stares at himself for a couple of deep breaths
shatters the mirror with a martial punch
the fractured mirror alexs mask reflected in shards as his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass
his purpose unclear
the crow hops out into the hallway flies toward us lands with a caw as alex enters the hallway framed against hight walls
his tentative movements growing more assured
follow the leader
the crow flies off and alex follows to
a door marked no unauthorized entry
as they pass through
close on a monitor a schematic map of the prison
a small red light flashes
the guard keys a communications radio
weve got unauthorized movement in b five
with the legs of a guard walking quickly
his radio crackling
into radio mercer
im on it
he passes through the no unauthorized entry door into
bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory
mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway stops as
the crow hops out from a side hallway
drawing him on
into radio found our intruder
its got a beak and a death wish
mercer pulls out his nightstick loses the bird as it hops back through bars into
alex looks around his now empty cell
on the wall is a rectangle clearer than the wall around it where the photograph of alex and lauren had been before walsh removed it
alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot
alexs internal pov flash of lauren laughing as she beckons to someone alex who joins her in frame as we hear the whir of the camera auto timer
a click as the picture is taken
alex and lauren are frozen in the pose of alexs photograph
resume the picture is gone
alex perplexed stands looking at the blank spot on the wall for a moment
he turns and exits the cell
mercer is peering through the double barred gate at the end of the row as alex emerges from his former cell
still into radio get me some backup
we got one loose on the row
through the bars to alex now who the fuck are you
alex looks up sees mercer and flash
alexs internal pov a pop of mercer bringing the birthday cake
a wash of flame twenty one candles
a blip of walsh
of a white king
resume alex perplexed looking at the cake still littering the floor of his ex cell candles melted down
mercer works his way through the double barred doors onto the row
and what have you done to your face there beauty queen
the inmate occupying the cell next to alexs peers out through the bars vanishes again as mercer whops the bars once with his nightstick
its my birthday
heres a present for you
mercer swings his nightstick at alexs head
alex catches it instinctively in one hand
mercer reaches for
a red panic button hanging off his guard belt
mercer slams it
favoring alex lets go of the stick looks at his own hand surprised
mercer broadsides alexs head with the stick
alex goes down shocked not from pain from the fact that someone would attack him
wham wham wham
mercer brutalizes alex collapsed at his feet as
two guards enter the far end of the row race toward alexs cell one holding a taser
its laser sight finds alex crumpled in front of mercer
had me going there
looks like its over
the guards relax
alex suddenly looks up at mercer
zero damage from the blows
make a wish
alex wheels around as guard one squeezes the trigger
crowvision the taser darts speed toward camera
resume alex shunts himself to the side and the taser darts impale themselves in mercers thighs
he drops fibrillating
a cheer goes up from the men in their cells who become progressively rowdier as the guards bolt and alex follows strength in his stride nightstick in hand
pieces of flaming toiletpaper flung now from the cells of deathrow
at the far entrance the two guards scramble to get the door closed behind them before alex catches up
theyd make it except alex hurls
the nightstick flying end over end like a throwing knife catching the trailing guard in the back of the head dropping him in the door propping it open
alex enters the cage entrance to deathrow sharing the space with the guard still standing
pats pockets then keys
the frightened guard opens the door into the next hallway and bolts
leaving the keys
the crow hopping screaming
close on a schematic map of the prison
lit up like a christmas tree now with flashing red lights
the guard keys a communications radio
unauthorized movement in b five b six c three four five
another light goes on
theyre starting to make a line
buzzers going off now
a general alarm sounded
escape in progress
heading for the roof
the crow flaps up the stairwell
alex on its heels taking steps three at a time
at the top of the stairwell the crow waits on a landing with a door marked emergency use only
plus a dozen lines of assorted instructions
guards feet thunder below approaching
i hear the pitter patter of little feet
he opens the door
the alarm is loud
dark a moment
then a huge spotlight hits alex casting long shadows
he looks up at a guard tower the source of the light
and of a bullhorn voice
do not proceed
back slowly away from the fence
as if in defiance the crow hops toward the fence old chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of the roof
bullhorn voice continues as alex follows
alexs pov through the fence down fifty feet to the pavement
alex turns sees
a half dozen guards emerge from the stairwell to the top of the roof level weapons at alex
on the fence alex climbs quickly to the top where he grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply into this hand
he extricates himself balancing atop the fence
alexs hands the jagged bloodlines disappear miraculously heal
favoring alex as he holds up his hands to show the guards a kid like smile on his face
they respond by raising their weapons and bam bam bam
alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of gunfire that dopplers down to silence as he falls falls
at the base of the walls alex hits flushing pigeons that fill frame with manic wings
as the spotlight sweeps toward alex he rolls off over the sidewalk between two parked cars
on the rooftop mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck looking down as the spotlight finds nothing
a radio crackles
mercer keys it a beat later
physical head count shows all inmates present
mercer moves the radio away from his head
then who was the fucking houdini
at the base of the walls illuminated by spill from the spotlight alex crouches between two cars
he leans forward checking his reflection in a chrome hubcap
a huge smile spreads over his face
life or whatever this is is good
the crow flies past tall buildings downtown
the crow flies past letters p o l i c e on the side of an older building taking us to
a hand punches through a sash window right through the imbedded security wires roughly rips off the latch inside
the window opens
its alex on the fire escape checking out his arm as the alex follows the crow into the dark room packed with file cabinets and evidence bins wire lockers
and a desk strewn with police forms
plus a vertical spike with processed evidence request forms impaled on it
checking out desk police
then to crow look
i like what weve got going here
but i can think of lots better to do with it than fighting crime
know what i mean
the crow makes its way to a file cabinet the top drawer marked cl cr
alex lingers a moment at the desk eye on the spike
alex drives his hand onto the spike
looks up delighted
the crow gives alex an admonishing look
alex pulls the spike from his hand
alex opens the top drawer
hes not sure what
glibly goes through folders
nothing under crow
pulls out the first file out in a thick section marked corvis alexander f
having caught a glimpse of
in the file alexs mug shot and rap sheet
we see murder st degree penalty phase find for execution
but even this has little interest for him as the finds the words lauren randall on the page
alex rips the drawer out of the file cabinet dumps it crashing on the ground
he drops to the floor with a growing sense of dread feeling with both hands finding
a splay of phtographs encased in plastic the prosecutions background presentation on alex and lauren
the first photo shows lauren posing jauntily her arm around a snowman
she and the snowman wear matching boston red sox caps
alexs internal pov on alex anticipating
a snowball nails him square in the face
wide to reveal lauren running for cover as young alex scoops up snow for ammo
he lobs a snowball at lauren just as she slips to the ground
she doesnt get up right away
alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her
he reaches the spot to find lauren in the snow waving her arms and legs to make a snow angel
she looks up at him and beckons him to lie on top of her
what are you an angel
im your angel
resume alexs pained smile at the memory until he finds the murder weapon a rough looking hunting knife bagged and tagged as ac murder weapon
alex frantic now spreading out the file contents finding
crime scene photos in a grove of tall trees lauren randalls stabbed and mutilated body her neck slashed head lolling sideways melds with
alexs internal pov brief glimpses of lauren with alex in the grove happy like the still photo alex kept in his cell
resume alex full blown tortured now throwing things
alex smashes his own head against the metal file cabinets wounding himself on the handles droplets of blood flying now spattering the evidence on the floor
he reaches for the knife the murder weapon to end the pain and flash
alexs internal pov a tunnelvision pop of tommy leonard on the witness stand
the knife held up for him by an unseen lawyer
resume alex shakes his head no
the fury abating with a growing sense of mission
you lie you lie you lie
alex fishing through the detritus around him finding
the list a list of witnesses by category with contact numbers addresses
alexs finger finds eyewitness thomas leonard
the door to the evidence room opens
a young cop enters walks slowly past rows of file cabinets looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful alex dumped
but alex is gone
the young cop looks up as the crow departs through the window and two other cops arrive
one of them dutton
what the hell was that
then seeing mess shit
dutton walks to the mess on the floor curious
picks up a tag marked murder weapon ac staples ripped out nothing attached to it
takes in the crime scene photos of lauren
off the pix
camera drifts down through dark trees finding alex at a grave beneath a sheltering tree
i thought id be with you now
hes kneeling in front of a headstone
always with us
the crow perched nearby
camera circles alex who looks up as the headstone wipes through frame and
alexs internal pov lauren nathan a compelling sixteen year old circles making an oddly sexy version of the oooo bruce lee sound
a goof a game shes playing with alex who circles opposite
chinese pseudo dub your shaolin style is no match for my kung fu
as alex wipes by
resume camera continues to circle alex at the grave
im not dead
and im not alive
and im remembering
and it hurts
alexs internal pov more goof kung fu the circle closing
lauren laughing more searching for words
flying crane style is no match for my
drunken tiger kick
resume resolve strengthening
i cant be alive
not without you
alexs internal pov laurens starting to crack up trying to think of what comes next
is no match for
they look at each other a long moment
as they kiss
i want to be with you forever
alexs internal pov lauren in his arms as the kiss ends and she answers a question we never heard
resume over the crow
camera stops circling
alex looks up at the headstone silent tears in his eyes as
what happened to us
a single blood red tear rolls down the cheek of the angel atop the headstone
alex stops it with his finter
wider the supplicant at the grave
and the crow nearby
a girls hand clutches a heart shaped locket
tilt up its erin wearing an identical locket around her neck
school uniform pleated skirt and school books
the splish splash of the wipers the only sound until
nathan looks over
sees shes holding the locket
i want to take this to lauren
shed want it
i just cant
stay in the car
ill only take a second
i know you think shes been talking to you
its not that
now that hes gone i think its time
off her dad
the benz stops on the roadway beneath laurens grave
the door opens
erin gets out in the pouring rain pulling her jacket hood up over her head
locket in hand she runs to
laurens grave the tree a shelter from the downpour
erins approaching the headstone when alex emerges from behind the trunk
im not going to hurt you
dont come near me
he holds his hands up compliant
she doesnt bolt
but shes ultra cautious
like with a snarling dog
i was a friend of your sisters
i know her friends
that locket youre holding
you have one just like it
she lifts the locket around her neck
visible to anyone
yeah no kidding
your father gave them to both of you
and hes right over there by the way
then what did you do to your face
someone else did it
youre a friend of the guy who killed her arent you
you almost sound like him
he didnt kill her
how do you know
i know everything about your sister
ill prove it to you
loud now stay away from me
os the car door opens
then slams shut
she whips around points at
alex is gone
what were you yelling about
this guy said he was a friend of laurens
he had like paint all over his face
are you ok
whats that supposed to mean
he was right here
she shakes her head confused then looking around spots
the track from the red tear indelible even in the downpour
off erin as she touches the angels stained cheek
and her dad soggy in the rain
a street light flickers on
maybe because night has fallen or maybe its just a rainy day
thomas leonard hikes up his collar trying to stay dry as he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway
red light special
hikes her skirt even you can afford it
he shakes his head dont need that grief continues on to the next building and camera finds
alex watching holding the list
he crosses off the name for eyewitness thomas leonard
tommy clears the stairs heads for his door
unlocking the second lock he looks around alert like he heard something
then opens the door
alex waits for tommy crouched by an open window that looks out onto an alley a four story drop
sees alex then march
where the fuck did you come from
big bang primordial ooze divine hand of a benevolent creator
although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator
tommy starts toward alex who pulls the knife from the evidence room
you lied at my trial
i dont know you man
capital case nine nine dash c one one five
flashes knife exhibit a
alex pins what looks like tommys arm
its just his jacket but it immobilizes tommy
i said what i saw
two kids arguing
a guy and a girl
you said you saw me with this
i never held it until today
whats your damage man
corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker
alex heaves tommy crashing into the window smashing the glass and cheap aluminum frame
tommy hanging halfway in halfway out
four floors above the alley
alex rips tommys shirt where the knife already cut it
jacks the sleeve down
no scar there
one chance to tell the truth tommy
who is the man with the scar
he planted this in my car
theres no scar
corvis made it up
who are you
tommys wife enters from the bedroom screaming
heavy eye makeup looking like she just woke up
os a toddler cries as she throws herself on alex and they spill back inside
let him go
let him go
take the baby
get out of here now
but she doesnt leave
she pleads in wrenching sobs that seem to affect alex
the crow lands in the window
hes all i got
tommy and the baby
dont take him
the baby needs a father
her mascara runs down her cheeks a facsimile of alexs mask
they share a long look connected by pain
the crow cawing a warning hopping in the window as
your baby is crying
tommy nods at his wife who heads off to the bedroom
the crow gives alex an admonishing caw then takes flight
what did they give you
they showed me pictures what he did to her
said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head yes
repeats insistent what did they give you
twelve an hour
tommys wife returns holding a fifteen month old boy
alex unfolds the list passes it to tommy blank side up
write down their names
all of them
but tommy takes a look at the list and flips it over
the list tommy points to the police witness list
dutton erlich larkin toomey
you already got em
these cops said the needed an eyewitness or corvis would walk
alex drops his head
all clear now
he laughes gently at the sound of sirens approaching still blocks away
camera creeps toward the by now familiar mystery man bent over his work at the table across the room
a lineup of short rods
one selected with a pair of surgical forceps inserted through a hole in human flesh raising a considerable welt
as the man reaches for a cotton ball he notices an empty stand among the taxidermy specimens
marked corvus brachyrhynchos
he scans the table searching then throws up his hands shielding his face as a crow flies out of the darkness right at him
the man turns toward camera but we never see his face as the crow wheels mid air flying past him a second time
as the crow flies up and out a small window the man stands hands on the desk
slow push on the man on
a zigzag pattern of raised welts on the underside of his forearm in high relief under the draftsmans lamp
a drop of blood zigzags running downward
slow fade out
over black the crackle of a police radio
a police cruiser has stopped a late model cadillac seville on a deserted street
in the police car close
dutton philip with a picture of the same face camera finds working a bad comb over in the rearview mirror
in the seville tracy almost sixteen dressed for nightlife sees dutton primping in her rearview mirror
hes getting out now
she jostles her friend jannie passed out in the front passenger seat trying to rouse her
dutton motions and tracy buzzes down the window
lets hope not
license and registration please
tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks through her purse
not finding anything
whats with your friend there
off dutton actually she never had mai tais before
but you youve had them
tracy paws through her purse some more
if you had a license i bet id have seen it by now
how old are you
look ill tell you the truth
jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back she has a license but i mean
look at her
dutton leaves that dangling
circles around to the passenger side
whisper to jannie get up get up
dutton opens jannies door leans in slides a hand between her slightly parted legs
dutton smiles at tracy
why dont you get out
crowvision high overhead
tracy steps out of the car
dutton shuts the passenger door points
tracy moves behind the seville
resume dutton closes in
shes getting very nervous
you want me to walk a straight line
i want you
to bend over
look can i just call a cab
what did i say
tracy bends over the car trunk
dutton eases her feet apart with the tip of his boot then pulls out his nightstick uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt
as he does she stands back up shakes her head no
maybe ill ask your friend
tracys frantic about to call out as dutton moves to the passenger door opens it and
over dutton alex sits in the passenger seat now
jannie shunted inward
mimicking dutton i want you
to bend over
dutton pulls his mm baretta on alex
whered you come from
out of the car
with insolent slowness alex finishes writing
the list a red line drawn through duttons name
alex gets out of the car
dutton slams the door and janie stirs coming to
at least a bit
hands on the car
alex advances on dutton
youre dead ditch weed
duttons finger squeezes the trigger
the shot blows alex back at the seville passenger window
slumped face against the car
jannies head pops up inside the car
she screams at
jannies pov alex right in her face nice and dead
dutton lowers his gun bg
tracy in a panic
suddenly alex opens his eyes smiles
face distorted against the glass
she screams again
alex wheels around wrenches duttons wrist vise gripped
duttons gun falls to the ground
tracy rushes to the driver side
you might want to call
report an officer down
tracy screeches off leaving dutton in shock
that was a fucking hollow point
i guess its true
guns dont kill people
alex draws the knife the murder weapon from his costume
think maybe knives do
keep that thing away from me
this is not just some thing
its a c zero zero five
youre the skel broke into the evidence room
the knife moves and rip
alex yanks the sleeve off duttons uniform revealing a scarless forearm
what do you want
on the arm
of the man who planted this in alex corviss car
theres no scar you freak
the corvis kid made it up
alex glitches hearing this a second time then rams dutton into a wall with a great clatter of trash cans
alex all over him holding duttons head firmly in his two hands like he could crush it in an instant
he was innocent
you framed him
what do you think officer dutton
an eye for an eye
alexs thumbs inch toward duttons eyes grazing duttons eyelids now and a wild thing happens
alexs internal pov duttons nightstick lifts laurens skirt
then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle laurens death
and the surprise bam
of a shot fired
resume alex thrown by this
relaxes his grip on dutton
you were there
all four of you
dutton kicks him off smashes a garbage can over alexs back then pulls a small semi auto from an ankle holster
you killed her
i saw it
bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg
if she just acted like a girl nothing would have happened
then so youre right spooky
alex barely slowed by the shot advancing dutton starting to panic
alex keeps coming right up to the gun
pointed right at his face then
alex flips it around rams the gun in duttons mouth
he couldnt talk if he wanted to
im working on it
we hear the blast as we
cut to bam bam continues but these are toy guns fired in synch with pounding music
in the hands of two strippers
topless leather gs and chokers black stockings police hats on their heads law enforcement stars for earrings
the capacity crowd responds as they pout wield their weapons
at the entrance madden a straightfaced plainclothes detective more upscale than the clientele flashes a badge at a bouncer who scowls lets him pass
with madden circumnavigating the mainstage where the cop strippers are waving handcuffs now
at the edge of the room lap dancers pull one on ones for twenties
backstage madden moves past girls in various stages of undress
smoking yapping waiting to go onstage
one looks up interested but he doesnt look back exits into
an internet porn facility where live sex workers man tiny fantasy sets a dungeon a shower a desk and blackboard meant to suggest a schoolroom
crudely built but good enough for x pixel resolution
madden stops a second looking
over a monitor the dungeon set updates every six seconds the slowly changing low rez version of the action on the set a woman tied to a chair with bright
the picture refreshes and bg the woman sneaks an expertly timed sip of diet coke puts the can away before the picture updates again
a counter shows hits and climbing
madden gives a look like people are really fucked up continues past a curtain with a no admittance sign into
a back hall dark the furthest recesses of the building
madden continues cautiously toward
a door the door is cracked open
madden moving very quietly now scowling as he peers through the slight opening
three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money
guns on the tabletops in holsters out of reach
the door flies open
a moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze
raise their hands slowly turn
then lower their hands
dont do that
its erlich larkin and toomey
three cops we met at the execution
erlichs cane nearby
hows the month end
never been better
probably parked near some high school with a hardon
fuck never showed
anyone at all curious why
erlich larkin and toomey exchange a look
madden goes to one of the money counters and grabs
a stack of twenties tossed violently at the ceiling
larkin and toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like leaves picking them up
you leave the door open with two hundred strangers out there
whats it take for you guys to learn a goddamn lesson
no one saw anything mad
you know why duttons not here
the three exchange looks
one shot to the head then fifty three stab wounds with a six inch blade
any deja vu here
think corvus knife missing from the evidence room
since last night
as usual youre right on top of things
it was supposed to end when corvis died
the kid no one would miss
dont look at me asshole
hey i didnt kill anybody
i mean it
erlich and larkin settle down
crime scenes a goddamn clusterfuck
every reporter in towns trying to get a look at duttons body
i suggest we get a line on this before someone else does
whod give a shit about corvis at this point
kid didnt have a friend in the world even when he was alive
i can think of one
erlich and madden share a look
on the same wavelength
erlich picks up his weapon off the table
a large crime scene marked off by tape duttons cruiser where he left it
several other cruisers nearby lights flashing
an ambulance stretcher being unloaded now
an action newsteam the one weve seen before barbara gonzalez frontman speaking into a mic too far away for us to hear
close on a tv
gonzalez audible now
rumors multiply as officials refuse to confirm or deny reports of multiple multiple stab wounds
gonzalez continues under as
come in here
the sound of footsteps racing down the hall
what is it
the cop who found the knife in corviss car
randall riveted by the tv now
theyre moving him now body covered
it would appear that thirty seven year old phillip dutton is dead in the line of duty
on the tv the newsteam and gonzalez shoved back by cops running defense for the stretcher
gonzalez grabs for the sheet covering the body and
newscam tight on dutton as the sheet pulls down partially uncovering
duttons head comb over hanging to the side
blood dripping from crude letters carved in his bald pate the word daisy
quickly covered by a cop who yells at gonzalez
out of here
but through a digital miracle the daisy frame has been grabbed and appears as a still now behind gonzalez
resume favoring erin struck dumb by this
shocking even for these mean streets the word daisy apparently cut into his head by the perpetrator still at large
perhaps a message
gonzalez fades under as erin backs away from the tv
what is it
lauren called me that when we were little
no one knew but us
its doesnt mean anything
its not a message
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren
it still doesnt mean
he said hed prove it
off randall as he sits on the bed thoughtful
the ambulance drives off lights flashing and we boom up over the crime scene over the newsteam revealing the top of duttons cruiser marked with a bloodred crow
continuing upward finding
the crow perched high on a building
it takes flight
the crow soaring through this lousy part of town
the crow swoops in lands on the roof of a low end brick building peers down over the edge
camera drifts down the side of he building finding a light someone burning the midnight oil
finding a chess set mid game near the open window as
erlichs cane knocks a pile of papers to the floor off a desk piled high with briefs
i dont know about any knife
im trying to forget that case
well someone isnt
they killed dutton
it wasnt me
you couldnt get close to him
but im betting you know who did
whos into corvis
erlich flips through a rolodex knocks it to the floor then picks up a phone log off the desk
not a lot of calls
he tosses the phone log out the window
watching the phone log fluttering down
include alex sitting where the crow was perched wearing duttons badge on his evolving costume
alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below
youre the only one gave a flying fuck about him when he was alive
lauren randall did
bitches are crazy
richer they are crazier they get
the list the name erlich vincent crossed off now by alex
erlich limps through frame toward walsh grabs him roughly by the collar
maybe if you hadnt fried an innocent kid
who is it
how about the real killer
you think of that
erlich violently tosses walsh crashing back toward the window falling by the chess board
if youre covering for someone thats jail time
i got my eye on you
erlich exits slamming the door behind him
walsh starts to get up stops
looking at his own eye level
alexs chess board set up identically to the game in alexs cell a piece of folded paper protruding from under the board
walsh pulls it out
it says q b walsh makes the move queen to bishop five
the paper unfolded says check
walsh sets it down in the chess box next to
the picture of alex and lauren arms around each other in the woods smiling
walsh sensing something a presence
walsh moves cautiously to the curtains draws them back
he leans out the window
crowvision starting on walsh popping his head out the window two stories down including erlich as he exits the building gets in a silver porsche
picture bending wildly as the porsche takes off and the crow takes flight
a red traffic light
the porsche pulling to a stop
in the porsche erlich looks down presses a button on the stereo
elvis from his baroque period if i can dream
erlich looks up waves his arms
erlichs pov through the windshield a bum starts to clean the windshield with an oily rag leaving opaque smears on the once clean glass
a handful of gravelly mud lands on the windshield starts to get smeared around
erlich pounding the window from inside
the bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment
hard to see anything now
erlich throws up his hands in disgust reaches for the door handle just as
the driver side window shatters as something enters at high speed kicking erlich across the car
erlichs head bounces off the passenger window leaving a bloody smear
alex in the driver seat now
the germans really know how to make a car dont they
low angle on the porsche wheels spinning as it peels out
windshield washers and wipers clear away the grime alex smeared on the windshield revealing that were rocketing through a bad part of town
music continues as alex pulls the knife out of his costume with his left hand
it looks huge in the cramped sports car
re lauren knife i heard you were looking for this
youre the guy killed dutton
i want you to think of me as the guy who killed you
erlich pulls a
semi auto stashed between the two seats
points it at alex
stop the car
alex floors it and
erlich blows a hole through alexs left arm a yawning aperture through which erlich watches the passing scenery a few improbably seconds
the wound closes
knife still in alexs hand
what happened to your leg there officer
in one swift move alex impales the knife through erlichs wrist into his thigh
erlich screams tries to remove the knife but alex keeps a firm grip on the handle
lauren randall shot you trying to get free
the fifty three stab wounds she died of came from you
am i right
erlich tries to stay steely yells louder as
the corvette bumps over a sidewalk runs a red light
a police cruiser going the other way pulls a stunt u flips on its lights
in hot pursuit
bumpier now as alexs driving gets more and more erratic
in saudi arabia they cut off the hands of petty thieves
what price for a life
alex yanks the knife out and flash slices through the left arm of erlichs jacket sawing into the flesh
erlichs arm bleeding
not my arm
what you fucking want
i want lauren
i want my life back
to know why
whys anything happen
its all money man
the girl just got in the way
alex grimaces then rip he yanks the sleeves off erlichs arm
erlich looks down surprised to see his arm intact
which of you has it
alex poises the knife for another descent
its a bullshit fucking story the loser boyfriend made up
this gives alex pause
he shakes his head clearing the reality glitch looks up
in the rearview mirror cop cars lights flashing
the corvette slides around a corner screams into a final straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side of an overpass
the cops not far behind
the porsche bottoming out on a bump now ant
alexs sun visor falls partway down from the jolt
he reaches to push it back into position and notices
on the back of the visor the car registration
alex takes it out of the holder
resume alex suddenly calm
he reaches down for
the cigarette lighter pushed in
the volume on the elvis song pumped up
alex relaxes back in his seat as they scream toward the abutment
are you out of your fucking mind
were going to die
how can you die if youre already dead
i was talking about you
alex smiles as the cigarette lighter pops out
he grabs it and the glow vanishes as he closes his fist around it
erlich turns front in horror
the microsecond of terror realized as elvis climaxes the retaining wall zoomes in
the corvette hits at a million mph
crumpling disintegrating and hurling two bodies bouncing off the abutment
the cavalry cruisers and plainwraps too late
a half dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens
screeching to a halt by what used to be a silver porsche
the ruptured gas tank spurting gasoline
a cruiser screeches to a halt
both doors fly open
toomey and larkin step out
toomey on his radio as larkin looks up the embankment catches a glimpse of
alex battered but alive jerkily unclenches his fist still holding the lighter glow fading
the cigarette lighter arcs down onto the ex corvette
cops shield themselves as the crash scene explodes in a huge fireball that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close by
in the too close cop car the driver rams the car into reverse
tires squeal as the fireball hits and
the too close cruiser engine compartment ignites a second fireball racing backward into another cruiser
total chaos now
larkin focussed on alex seen vaguely through the flames
moving toward him
with larkin as he arrives at the top of the enbankment draws his weapon
alex is gone but he finds
erlichs body two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises
larkin pulls something out of erlichs shattered fist
the list dutton and erlich crossed off
larkin and toomey yet to go but the first letters of their names are all contained in a vertical oval delt circled in red
larkin as toomey joins him they give each other an oh shit look
then larkin checkes his fingertips smeared red from
the list flip side the crow cipher rendered thick in coagulating blood
illuminated by the flickering light of the fire below
a heart shaped locket swung gently back and forth then closed in erins hand as caw
erin turns sees the crow perched on the window ledge
as she moves to the open window the crow flies off
erins pov out the window the crash scene far away the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to bring the fire under control
erin looks wondering then spots something closer to hom
she moves off wiping through frame revealing
on the front lawy alex
he looks down now at the front door where
erin exits the front door and we see her framed against the huge house a rich mans castle built in the twenties of quarried stone quarter sawn oak and leaded
erin like her sister a child of privilege
she approaches alex
how did you know
i told you i knew your sister
you killed that cop dutton
and another one
took a wrong turn
alex points at the distant crash site the vague flashing lights
i know who you are
no response thats why you paint your face
im not hiding
im right here
you killed lauren
you killed her
erin shakes her head trying to absorb whats going on then rushes alex screaming beating on him fists of fury
dirty cops killed her
alex tries to handle her flailing arms but shes too manic
hes getting hit in the face the chest and its hurting
he grabs her roughly gets her to stop
ive been shot and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt
but what youre doing now does
i dont know why
my dad was right
he said youd ruin her life
listen to me
lauren found out something they didnt want her to know
he holds up a card the registration from the corvette
from the bonfire over there
look at it
why are you haunting me
because you need to understand
and you need
to be careful
he tries to give it to her one more time then flips the card through the air
she turns watching its flight all the way to the landing by the front door
your father wasnt right
she turns back and
erin walks to the door
despite herself reaches for the card on the landing
the corvette registration which we see clearly for the first time
owned by a company called delt
the address is forestview drive
erin spins around horrified holds up the registration
the address on the registration forestview matches the numbers two feet away from her the address plaque on her own house
the buzz of nervous cop walla settles out as a stocky sergeant clueless but honest raises his voice trying to command attention
we got a cop killer out there
walla responds no shit and camera booms up moving to the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms
til we get an i
treat everyone like a suspect
patrol assignments are posted by the door
no singles its the buddy system til we catch this asshole
sergeant continues under as camera finds
favoring larkin toomey and madden huddling together at the back
larkin and toomey try to contain their panic
i saw him
fucking zombie mask
you calm down
larkin takes out the list from the crash site
whose names fucking next
you didnt testify
youre not on the list
flips it over scary guy
not only survives that crash but takes time out for art
he pockets the list
then looks up as
the entire room looking back at the three renegades
the old mans requested the pleasure of your company
madden shakes his head like this is bad news rises and leaves
a secretary mans a low counter guarding a large door at the end of the huge empty hall
shes got a heavy mascara trailer park vibe looks up from her eyelash curler at the sound of approaching footsteps
her pov through the eyelash curler madden approaches
the secretary smiles hits a button under the counter
the door to the captains office swings open
glad im not you
right back at ya
she checks out madden as he moves past her then puts the eyelash curler away in a nailit containing a couple of razor sharp scalpels
no sunlight in this cavernous wood panelled office
the captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the room
i thought we had an understanding
i thought we understood that discretion is paramount
yeah we do
the captain begins and intense slow burn
erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet
ive got reporters asking me how much he made
ive got the entire force looking at this case now
i know the guy leaves a sign
madden produces the list flips it over to show the crow doodle in blood
no shit he leaves a sign
hes a goddamn picasso
the captain slaps down a crime scene photo the crow emblazoned huge on the top of duttons cruiser
what else do you know
do you know this
the captain slams a file down in front of madden who lets things cool out a moment before looking at it
reads cover tommy leonard
the eyewitness in the corvis case
some hooker phoned it in
there was a riot at his apartment yesterday
guy dressed for halloween
good for you
you do know something
they look up as the secretary enters holding the door open like its time to leave
madden starts to speak and
before it all comes tumbling down
the secretary gives madden a look as he exits then joins the captain whos standing
by an awards case holding glass bowls and trophies presented to the captain over the years for civic service
the secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he looks at his loot
youre the only one who makes it go away
as he turns toward her embrace camera adjusts to point up something we may have noticed
in the case a stuffed bird on one of the glass shelves
camera creeps toward the large stone house
a light comes on at one end of the lower floor shining through the window
erin works at her fathers desk under the light of an antique floor lamp
using a letter opener to pry open
a desk drawer full of files
she flips through finds a manila file marked delt
takes it out
erin lays the file open on the desktop
a small paper shredder under the desk
judging from the paper spaghetti in the basket underneath recently used
erin scoops up the shreds of paper
no way to reassemble this
trying to be casual what are you doing there
erins a terrible liar spooked as he approaches
i think i dropped an earring
looks like you have them both on
she jumps up as her father reaches the desk keeps her distance
he spots the empty delt folder closes it
alex corvis didnt kill lauren
youre in with them
its not what you think
you killed her
stay away from me
it wasnt supposed to happen
erin screams runs out the door with her hands over her ears
he misses a beat then runs after her
nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs car keys out of a dish by the front door
he grabs hold of her arm she struggles claws at his face to get loose
squeaks out the door onto
erin runs to the far side of the big benz parked in the driveway
tries the door
the alarm goes off
they killed her because she found out
youve got to leave it alone
across the street a porch light comes on
erin hits a button on the key ring chirp chirp
dont call me that
dont call me anything
a neighbor opens the door peers at them from across the street
i would never hurt you or lauren
i dont believe you
im never going back in that house again
he edges away from the car reluctantly
she starts to get in anger giving way to extreme sadness
crying now they killed alex for something you did daddy
you killed both of them
she gets in the car
she peels out backward down the driveway
slams the car into drive and tears off down the street
the neighbor shakes her head at nathan goes back inside
thomas leonard bounces off the wall drops to the floor
a female figure wipes through frame throws herself on larkin whos roughing up tommy
leave him alone
larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor where she crawls to the wailing baby takes him in sheltering arms
im not making this up
he had a crow with him
caw caw thats what youre telling me
he said i lied at his trial
its alex corvis
so were talking
with a pet bird
turn down that fucking baby
the babys gets quieter as the mom rocks it
get up tommy
i want to show you something
larkin helps tommy to his feet
places the list on the table
then rams tommys face down on top of it
you see that
my names next on his list
its fucking next
larkin hauls tommy back upright
so who is the guy tommy
cutting him off take your time
think before you speak
cause at this point i got to hear something besides the crap youre been spewing
toomey cycles his mm
everything dead silent
he said the whole trial was a setup
that i caused an innocent kid to die
is that true
the only question is how to end this
madden stands by a plainwrap calmly smoking
a scream above
he looks up to see crash
tommys body breaks through a window four floors up and falls with broken glass landing by madden who rubs his temple a second then calmly grinds out the butt
tommys wife horrified pleading as toomey raises his weapon
her voice stops mid sentence as bam
the baby still crying as toomey takes aim again then lowers his weapon starts to leave the room with larkin
at the door toomey turns and bam
the crying stops
a diminished field of chess pieces
adjust to include walsh scrutinizing the board
he looks out the window a second
then scans the room again
im talking to my myself here
walsh goes back to the board makes a move
check and mate
walsh looks up
then alex steps from the shadows
walsh looks at him a long moment sees through the makeup
its really you under there
the two guys look at each other a long moment cross the few steps to hug
walsh blown away
id like to say youre looking good but
walsh leans in examines duttons badge on alexs costume
two to go
wait dont tell me
the cops from my trial
they killed lauren
the whole thing was fixed
off walsh you think im crazy
that explains a lot
walsh sits down
laurens fathers involved
he bought the cops fancy cars i dont know what else
its a company called d e l t
i think lauren found out
what do they do that they had to kill her
i was hoping youd find out
i sure will
they both turn as the crow lands in the window caws
at the bird boo
the crow flies off
walsh goes to the window and looks out
whats the deal with this bird
its been hanging around
he turns toward alex whos gone
a double take as walsh gets it whips around looks out the window again
cut to far above a solitary car winding through an old growth forest its headlights stabbing the darkness
the crow soars into frame watching
a simple wooden cross illuminated by the headlights of the big benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge trees dripping with moss
in the benz erin blank as she turns off the car leaving the headlights on
with erin as she steps from the car walks toward the cross
erin looks up finds the crow fluttering in to perch high overhead
alex emerges from behind a tree near the cross
this is where it happened
right over here
yeah i know
she stays where she is
alex quiet affected by the place
erins about to lose it
are you ok
when lauren was missing the police came to our house
they said they were looking for her right
breaking down but i know now they had her and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you
is that i sent them here
i told them she came here sometimes
with her dirtball boyfriend
thats exactly what i said
shes crying softly
he draws nearer
its not your fault
losing it now its all my fault
i wish i were dead
yes i do i really do
seeming to lose patience alex lunges at her like an attack
there were four of them
hes holding his hands over her eyes transferring images that shake them both
alex erins internal pov jolting flashes
a plainwrap stops where the mercedes is now
a hand slams the car into park
four men get out seen dimly but theyre dutton erlich larkin toomey
erlich reaches back in to drag lauren out of the back seat her hands cuffed in front of her
dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick
four large men
lauren stumbles into erlich grabs and bam
he takes a shot in the leg from his own still holstered weapon
she grabbed one of their guns
got off a shot then ran ran for her life
resume present erins covering her face like trying to avoid seeing some horrible thing
i dont want to know
alex grabs erin forces her to run with him awkwardly like a three legged race
tracing the path lauren covered
them breathing down her neck
erin stumbling as alex pushes cajoles her the two of them running toward a large tree matching to
alex erins internal pov lauren stumbling her cuffed hands hindering tree limbs hitting her face
her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her heels
all the way from the road to this tree
resume present erin still trying not to see
alex forcing her
heres where it happened
i dont want to see
alex spins her up against the tree and we match to
alex erins internal pov lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter destined to lose
her movements undercranked strobed
discontinuous and jarring
she turned and faced them and went down kicking and punching and fighting them fighting death as they stabbed her and stabbed her
fifty three times
the brutal cops overwhelm lauren
she drops to the ground as
resume erin drops to the forest floor convulsed in sobs
she fought for her life because life is worth living
think about that
and then tell me how much you wish you were dead
off erin sobbing heartbroken
alexs fury waning as he looks at her wonders if he did the right thing
armed men and barbed wire
the spotlight flares and were
an odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall
mercer escorts madden the captain and the secretary who hangs on her bosses arm gawking like a tourist
why wasnt the incident reported
nothing to report
all inmates were present and accounted for
so you pretended nothing happened
hey corvis fried
i dont really see how it could be him
i wouldnt expect you to
they all enter
mercer goes to the locker where he left alex
nature takes its toll
opens locker bon appetit
the all look inside
the locker is empty
mercers the only one shocked
he noisily opens and shuts the other lockers looking for alex
you lost him
now lay off the fucking doors
mercer stops backs off gives the power trio some space
they botched the execution
could say that
it was corvis
tommy leonard was right
maybe you were a little harsh on him
they watch now as the secretary moves drawn to the mirror
shes looking at
t he fractured mirror
shards of glass selectively removed forming we see now a crow
sign of the dead come back to life
madden turns not comfortable with the concept
how about sign of a big black bird
the dead can return given sufficient motivation
and corvis has that
this guy david jenkins came back as a ghost because my uncle owed him four dollars
followed him everywhere
ruined his life
you really saying hes back from beyond
the secretary nestles into the captain who whispers in her ear
cause if youre losing your mind i got a right to know
hes looking for something
wont stop until he finds it
then sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want
with the scar
erin sits cross legged in the headlights of the benz
alex perches crow like on the hood
took everything i ever cared about
left me with nothing
so youre going to kill him
have to find him first
he closes his eyes
pained at a memory
you know what lauren and i were fighting about that night
she had a secret wouldnt tell me
all i knew she was pulling away
it made me crazy
i used to be so proud of him
my big deal daddy
and now hes just a crook
and the weird thing is
she fights back tears
i wish i could hate him but i cant
he said hed never hurt either of us and i know its true and
im going back
its what lauren would do
erin nods takes the locket off her neck
i want to forget
forget what i know
she winds up to toss the locket away and alex hops down off the hood
takes the locket
alex re locket keep it
because it connects you to lauren
and it connects you to me
he fastens the locket back around her neck
no matter what happens ill make sure everyone knows
that youre innocent
that you loved her
erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket
dumps it on the ground
finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among the containers
i dont want to be me anymore
make me like you
erins face blasted white by headlights
she closes her eyes as alex begins the first bold lines around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light she could be
lauren opens her eyes a second smiles shuts them again
alex paints erins face in the benz headlights the two of them kneeling in the forest cathedral
camera creeps backward leaving the two of them connected by ritual
and a promise to each other
a mess of documents
nathan nervously writing assembling a tell all at his desk
you know it doesnt work this way
nathan gets up
tries to subtly herd the captain off
im out of this
partnerships dont end like that
our friendship ended when lauren died
the captain circles to the desk now past nathan
do you believe in ghosts nathan
because theres a ghost threatening us
you mean alex
i mean lauren
the captain flips through some of the papers on the desk
he closes a file folder
because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident
you killed my daughter
an accident nathan
exploding now she was eighteen years old
there were four of them
they stabbed her fifty three times
wheres the fucking accident
where is it
the captain keeps a preternatural calm
i watched her grow up
just like you
i know how her mind worked
she kept snooping around because she was worried about you
what youd gotten yourself into
so stop blaming me
and blame yourself
beat quietly i do
erin knows doesnt she
this catches nathan off guard
he starts to say something
dont even bother
you never were a good liar
the captain flips through the papers on the desk again
look at this
everything we worked for
you tell me
what are we going to do
headlights approach from down the street
the big benz pulls into the empty driveway
erin alone in the car her mood tough to judge in the crow mask
erin enters steels herself
then she calls out
erin plunges her masked face into the wash basin in this white tiled bathroom
angle erin a few slo mo droplets cascade off her face into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror wipes off the mask
camera inching forward
she listens up
grabs a towel to blot the water on her face
we begin to hear with her
she tightens the sink faucets
the sound continues drip drip as she moves to
the clawfoot bathtub faucet not dripping but the sound is louder
erin grabs the shower curtain whips it back revealing
nathan randall behind the tub face a mask of gore blown off point blank by the bloody handgun on the tile next to him
the chess set
a few pieces moved off the board now
alex not looking at it
hes looking at the picture of himself and lauren taped in the lid of the chess box
its like a bowl of spaghetti
d e l t is owned by westwind builders nathan randalls company
but delt in turn owns a dozen other corporations
a big mess to wade through so i checked out tommy leonard
alex picks up the black king
leonard dutton erlich
they dont matter
i want the king
were getting there
because in his so called construction job tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called the hole
the strip joint
i believe they call it a connoisseurs club
owned by delt
alex places the picture of himself with lauren back in the box of chess pieces against the open lid
places like that theyre about unreported cash processing money from drugs prostitution
then i took a chance called asking for larkin and toomey the two other cops
whoever answered said theyre not here
meaningfully this is the front office
they look up
a shadow banging on the door
leaving bloody smears on the outside of the frosted glass
walsh opens the door and erin enters wild and blood smeared remnants of the crow mask around her eyes
they killed my dad
it all catches up with her now the flight the exhaustion
she throws herself into his arms
its ok its ok
i cant take it
i dont know
i found him lying there
alex immobilized by this
he turns to walsh
where is it
i think we should get some support
call the police
what is this
where are you going
alex waiting for an address
dont leave me
alex turns to her comforting
holds her face in his hands
it will be over soon
then watch out for each other
he heads off and we pre lap sexbomb death metal pounding
more debauched than our previous visit
darker more crowded
patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely eighteen
the room writhing
on the mainstage the cop strippers we saw before but dangerous seeming as they pantomime an interrogation a handcuffed perp manhandled between them
at the entrance alex blows past people waiting to get in creating enough disturbance that two bouncers greet him
toomey and larkin
theyre expecting me
the two bouncers give each other a look
one points to a sign on the wall you must be
i need to see some i
circus in town
the other bouncer grabs alex as he pushes past
alex heaves him into the line of waiting patrons
as they go down like dominoes
the first bouncer pulls a i dont think you want to do that
lot of innocent people here
looks around a lot of people anyway
as alex starts off
hes blown back by a shot half lost in the noisy club
no panic yet
onstage the strippers break character looking
the audience turns as
near the entrance the first bouncer goes flying above the heads of the crowd getting off a dramatic shot while airborne inducing
pandemonium patrons stampeding as bam bam
alex taking bullets the miracle lost in the chaotic exit
the bouncers out of sight underfoot
on alex visible again back on his feet
buffeted stationary as everyone flees
with the exodus still at flood stage
on walsh in motion as he puts on a jacket throws some papers into a briefcase
hes nervous ill suited for this cloak and dagger stuff chattering
well be safe in my car
nobody will recognize it
lets move yours in back no down the block
hope its nothing fancy
theres a chop shop around the corner
shes looking elsewhere at the door that has quietly opened
the captain stands there
holding a sheaf of papers in one hand
you followed me here
erin i put out a bulletin on your car because
theres bad news
and i thought you should hear it from me
she stares at him expressionless
your father got involved with some bad cops
on my force so i take responsibility
beat then he killed himself
she talks with great difficulty
how did he kill himself
with a gun
is that what you mean
how did he kill himself how do you figure he killed himself with a gun right when it wasnt anywhere near where you found him
he takes a step toward her
she pulls out the blood pistol
seems crazy enough to use it
you killed him
back the fuck off
the captain stops gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward her onto walshs desk
the papers nathan was preparing
walsh looks at them while
he left this
names addresses a note to you
these people he was involved with killed lauren
he couldnt bear it anymore
hes right its all here
show it to me
erin has one eye on the papers now recognizes her dads hand
the captain inches forward
to captain not you
to walsh show it to me
the captain steps forward right to the desk
erin backed into a corner now
its right there under that paper
grabs a note here
she holds a hand out for the note taking her eye off the situation for one second as she reads
the note a bunch of numbers added together in her fathers hand
not a suicide note
the captain grabs erins wrist and bam
a chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges
the captain throws her in a chokehold her finger still on the trigger
you were always the stupid one
she fights as the captain wraps his own hand over hers wrestles her arm toward walsh in the sights now
walsh blown backward collapsing by the chess board
trying to pull himself up
madden enters from the hall in a hurry gun drawn
you need help
he nods toward walsh who is moving barely
we dont have much time
a shot from madden drops walsh for god
as madden drags walsh toward the door the captain grabs
the picture of alex and lauren pulled off the lid of the chess box one of the pieces of tape left behind
the captain exits
music still pounds lights swirl
but the club has cleared out leaving human detritus a handful of casualties from the stampede
with alex as he steps over the two bouncers expired on the floor
a soft whimpering marks the silence
the girl cuffed onstage
alex goes up to the terrified girl
close up she looks way underage
he gathers her clothes spots a key on the floor
how old are you
she listens as he unlocks the cuffs
you have one chance to value your life
he watches as she hightails it out the front door still half naked
as she leaves
the crow appears in the doorway near the broken bodies
alex takes a deep breath as if it hurts
the crow flies on disappearing into the back rooms
alex turns follows
alex moves past the empty makeup table
a lipstick cigarette smolders in an ashtray
people left in a hurry
music loud as if inside our heads now
empty images refreshed every six seconds
number of hits static now
alex drawn now by the no admittance curtain which he approaches slowly touching it and flash
alexs internal pov lauren looking over her shoulder pulling back the no admittance curtain going where she shouldnt go
you were here
lauren makes her stealthy way into
revealed as alex slips past the curtain retracing laurens footsteps
camera follows alex creeping down the hall to
alexs internal pov lauren down the hall peering inside the partially open back room door then turning back startled toward camera as if suddenly overtaken
at the door alex turns back like lauren looks behind him
the hallway is empty
as alex gropes for a lightswitch a lighter flares
toomey and larkin lean in light up in synch
alex takes in the dark fringes dim reflections off lots of eyes
not taxidermy specimens
a dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges into alex in an angry strobing fusillade
in the silence that follows
after the fact dont move
the gang laughs
larkin makes his way to a light switch by the door
drinks are on me
larkin flips on the low watt bare bulbs hanging down past industrial pipes and conduit casting a dim light on the cinderblock space
they look up and
alex drops larkin with a shot to the forehead
he misses toomey as bullets from below explode all around him
alex scampers across framing as
the bare bulbs burst all but one plunging us back in to near darkness as alex drops to the ground near larkins fallen body
jacks up the sleeve
alex spots toomey rolls out as
three cops pump rounds into alex
alex takes the middle cop out a tooney like guy who falls onto toomey behind him
alex turns forced to defend himself as full auto fire breaks open the other flank more advancing cops
toomey crawls out from under the fallen copy then backs out the door on hands and knees while
a final explosive fusillade leaves only alex standing
as the echoes dissolve
alex alex moves to where toomey was bends down to check the body
the nameplate toomey but the pin isnt fastened properly
the badge askew
resume alex rolls the body over finds another nameplate underneath
heads off in search of
toomey is clearing the no admittance curtain when
you dripped something
toomey panics as he approaches
internet fantasy sets monitors still updating every six seconds
toomey hears alex coming slips through the dungeon
behind the shower fantasy set toomey takes refuge out of sight next to a gas hot water heater quiet as a mouse
alex tears the no admittance curtain completely off its rod arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see
the dungeon monitor toomey frozen scurrying through
gone now as the monitor updates
then alex appears following him through the set
with alex moving to the rear of the dungeon on toomeys heels
toomey hits him full force with a pipe sending alex sprawling backward collapsing the flimsy shower set
toomey swings again misses alex but connects with
the gas line to the water heater ripped out by the blow
the sound of gas loud as the line breaks
resume alex straddles toomey just as toomey manages to get his gun pointed in alexs face
hissing gas nearby
toomey cocks the gun
and its not this leak here thats the least of your worries
alex swings toomeys pipe hard at a much bigger gas line right behind the gas heater leaving it badly cracked
the hiss magnified nos
were going to play a little game called whos got the scar
what fucking scar
buzzer sound aaaank
thats not how we play the game
alex jacks toomeys sleeve down
alex pissed as toomey locks eyes with him
really seeing him now
we fried your ass
youre dead man
good thing in a situation like this
we pick up
some light filters in as a door opens to the outside
a figure enters squats among the bodies
he leans in closes larkins eyes and we see
blood on his hands
he hears alexs voice faintly then toomey cries out in pain
madden moves toward
madden creeps down the hallway to the back room
voices growing louder
there is no scar
im telling you
as madden moves toward the conversation his face registers the slightest of smiles
maddens creeping pov monitors obliquely visible as he reaches the end of the hall by the fantasy sets
the shower monitor shows alex and toomey visible through the trashed set updated every six seconds
madden sniffs gas
the hiss now audible along with alexs voice
pulls out his mm
and backs up away from the fantasy sets toward the back room
madden takes aim at
the first monitor the images is alex threatening toomey
updating now losing alex on the monitor as he steps into frame in person looks up and bam
crowvision a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and
angle ground zero as the bullet hits the monitor in a shower of sparks followed by
a roiling fireball seems to vaporize alex before flying down the hallway right at camera
madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows him into the back room with a deafening roar
windows blow out in a gas fired inferno
a body flung out the rear door
interior exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago
walls crumbled roof blown off
bright fire consumes the frame consumes the bodies of downed cops consumes every last bit of oxygen and life
distant sirens draw closer
a slow scan someones obstructed pov of hell
include alex watching from under a collapsed cinderblock wall that offers some protection from the flames if not the heat
he looks intent now spotting
the arm with the zigzag scarification sticking out of the rubble murky through the flames growing clearer as camera pushes flames licking at it
alex tries to move toward the arm
forced back by too intense flame as another beam falls the rubble shifts and
the arm with the zigzag scarification skeletal now baked down to bones
a dozen short metal rods on the ground under it
he picks a few up
the captain drawn now to
under the rubble where alex was water dripping off the concrete collecting in the place where alex hid
but hes long gone
the captain drops the rods
satisfied its over
alex staggers along in bad shape
a girl in her twenties exits a building down a flight of stairs waits at the bottom for her boyfriend whos locking the door
she sees alex gives him an empathetic look
alex walks slowly closer
alexs internal pov lauren appearing to him playing their game
but the words are wrong distorted
your witness list is no match for my kung fu
her bruce lee oooo a siren call
resume alex moving slowly forward on the street drawn toward the girl who watches with horrified fascination
im losing you
your zigzag love scar is no match for
lauren and alex drawing very close now when
a fist clocks alex in the face dropping him hard onto the pavement
did you have to do that
how about thank you
i dont bleed
better steer clear
the guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl walks her off
running into a cop at the next intersection
they point at
alex takes off ducking into an alley
camera creeps backward as he gathers his thoughts
alexs shadow visible through the frosted glass jostling the locked door
his arm punches through the glass turn the knob
alex enters arm bleeding badly
he yanks a large piece of glass from his flesh
alex registers that the rules have changed
he finds a necktie of walshs uses it to bind the wound staunch the flow
he scans the room again looking for
but everything seems ok
the chess box the picture of lauren and alex gone
just a piece of tape left sticking to the top of the open lid
over the chess board alex the missing pic lost on him drawn to the chess board where walsh collapsed
something wrong with the game
the black king off the board
on top of a stack of news clippings lying on the floor
alex picks it up leaving a ring of blood under
camera pushes on the clipping underneath the headline city leaders vow crackdown in wake of randall murder
pushing finding among the city leaders
the captains face circled in blood
camera continues to push on the grainy newsprint through it until all we see are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning
the police station in sinister crowvision as we approach swoop in and
alex walks the long approach to the captains office past the empty secretarys desk
kicking the door open crash
the captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp
looks up unconcerned as alex enters walks to the desk and slaps down the ring of blood clipping
i hate that picture
where are they
can i get you something
a glass of water
where are they
youll bleed all over my carpet
the captain rises
you know crime was actually down until you showed up or stuck
around or whatever the hell youre doing here
then what are you doing here
im looking for my friends
see i heard you were looking for some guy with a scar
hows that going
you find him
alex tenses as the captain starts toward him
you are like the guest who would not leave you know that
and judging from your condition maybe youve overstayed your welcome
thats not a criticism
just an observation
alex draws the knife from his clothes
i dont think youre going to use it
thats laurens knife
enraged alex swipes the knife
the captain grabs his arm right at the blood soaked necktie squeezes hard
alex writhes in pain
in each others faces now
you come in here al lfull of righteous indignation but what have you got to be righteous about
the knife starting to fall from alexs hand as the captain continues to clamp down on his wound
how many innocent people did you leave dead back there
you sent them
i had no choice
youre a killer thats all you are
a clown with a bird and a rising death toll
you think the world did you wrong
you did the world wrong
the captain snatches the knife rams it into alexs midriff
you and lauren had a fight
you couldnt let it go
alexs internal pov lauren in tears in alexs car
i cant say
he grabs for her
she pulls violently away
dont touch me
another stab into alex
there will be fifty three
it was one thing her dad rejected you
but when she did you lost it
i see doubt oozing out your arm
where do people go when they kill their girlfriends
flash alexs internal pov alex back at the inferno cowering from flames
resume the captain full of righteous conviction
screwed up kid stabs her fifty three times
where would he end up
the captain bent over alex stabbing him
flashes move us backward along the path weve taken so far a tour of hell on earth the blast of infernal winds and the ever present voice of the captain
take a look
strippers writhe at the hole
thats who you are
the porsche explodes
you sick fuck
look at it
alex blasts dutton
every loser name anyone ever called you was true
alex escapes the taser
are you looking
time screeching to a halt all the movement converging on a single quiet image
one weve seen before
alex in the chair
but his last words are different
i loved lauren
i never meant to hurt her
electro spasm as the switch is thrown
no scar no meltdown just violent fibrillations that moderate finally as we match to
resume the captains office the captain shaking alex holding something in front of alexs face
you see it
did you see it
alexs eyes gone dead no longer seeing
the photo lauren and alex in the woods arms around each other
familiar but on second take its like the crime scene photos
laurens neck is slashed her body riddled with stab wounds
alex has a big smile on his face his arm around her her head on his shoulder
i think you fucking saw it
the captain drops alex lifeless and bloody to the floor
only the sound of the captain panting now then
the sound of slow clapping
madden walks into the room from behind perimeter curtains
you were right
pictures worth a thousand words
madden kicks alex lightly nudging him
no life signes
the captain rips the picture in two
tosses it in the trash
just dont believe everything you see
doubt is a motherfucker
give me a hand with this sack of shit
new angle through a window darkly madden and the captain grab alex one at each end
reveal this is the secretarys pov through the window
shes bent over someones toes painting them blue
the mystery room revealed
taxidermy specimens line the wall and the table
erin stands in profile in the middle of the room strangely silent hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the ceiling
the secretary brushing polish on erins toes
but the face well makeup can work for you or against you
the secretary applies a last flourish of polish then stands kisses erin gently
then youre a good listener
the secretary moves off revealing
erins face mouth sewn shut in a rough zigzag stitch like the scar
her eyes dart as
the door opens
the captain and madden carry alex in
madden sweeps the taxidermy specimens back with his hand clearing a space for alex on the table
the crow on its corvus brachyrhynchos stand takes a small hop backward this sign of life unnoticed as
alex heaved onto the table
so was he dead
the secretary puts her ear to alexs lifeless lips
ive seen birds stuffed and mounted so lifelike youd swear you saw them breathing
this reminds him
he looks at the crow on the stand
as it should be
maybe we had a case of that here
to secretary get me my kit
you two are majorly demented
anyone ever tell you that
the secretary steps off to grab thekit leaving alexs lifeless open eyes pointing toward erin reflected in his eyeballs first before
angle erin looking up at her own hands bound above her as she eases them apart and
the heart shaped locket slips from between her palms and she closes them again in time to catch the chain the locket swinging
on the table x close
the locket reflected in alexs lifeless open eyes a second before
the secretary returns blocking the sightline
lays out the kit nasty looking tools left over from the inquisition
then unbuttons alexs tattered shirt undressing him for the procedure
stab wounds everywhere
in all the excitement i kind of lost count
then i think ill mount him with his head up his ass
a large knife the lauren murder weapon angles in at the base of alexsneck where the secretarys head was
the crow overcranked moves on the table
the trio turn toward the commotion
the locket overcranked snatched in midair by the crow from erins praying hands
dim memories from the woods
anamorphic and dark
two figures alex and erin kneeling
resume the locket released from the crows beak passing through the trios hands uncaught bouncing off alex onto the table in front of his open eyes
alex crows internal pov flash
at ground level
alex fastens the locket around her neck
the distortion lessening becoming alexs pov
it connects you to me
no matter what happens
alex painting her face
resume alex blinks
the captain reacts oh shit starts to bring the knife down a hurried strike at alexs chest
alex grabs the captains arm in his hand stopping the movement on a dime
everything you ever showed me
madden pulls a gun points it at erin
alex jumps up flying into the gun as it goes off
they tumble through the window into the captains office while
the captain cuts down the rope holding erin
on the table strewn with blades secreting one between her hands in the second before
the captain drags erin off
the secretary flails at the crow with a metal rod while
in the captains office madden has the gun on alex now
madden sweating it now continuing to shoot with no effect as
the mystery room the secretary finally connects with the crow batting it against the wall noticing this coincides with
alex goes flying against the desk winged himself
madden c onfused not understanding
its the bird
madden wheels points the gun through the busted out picture window into
the secretary dives for cover as bullets explode around her
the crow dancing sprayed with debris
floor lights sequence above the door heading for underground parking
the captain watches the lights
erin is slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite him
you brought him back
he owes you
well stick together you and i
on erin face pressed against the elevator wall intent
seen but not heard
they ought to make it a law
erin winces looks down
the blade emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it with her two bound hands
the elevator jerks to a stop
the captain grabs her off the floor and she rams the blade into his abdomen with the force of the entire body
the elevator doors open
erin pulls out the blade claws her way out the door the captain hanging on to her finally getting free as she swipes at him again drawing fresh blood
running now into
erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage cutting the cord off her hands leaving it behind as
behind her the captain unsteady on his feet a wounded animal
he pulls out a glock mm and ka chunk
erin dives between cars scrambling on hands and knees
her pov scanning a small garage with a few police cruisers by a service area and no people
a barred gate over the exit
no way out
then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches off her mouth with the knife
drops the threads on the floor and moves off
alex runs past the glass awards case takes a flying leap behind the desk seeking cover as madden empties a clip at him
the slide ratchets back
madden slams another clip in advances on alex hidden behind the shredded desk as
the secretary clears stuffed birds off the table trying to expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall
here pretty bird
she grabs it the crow flapping desperately as
in the captains office madden creeps up on the desk peers over it
out of nowhere
alex rushes madden bulldozing him across the room with a pained cry of brute force toward
the awards case crash
glass shatters as alex hurls madden who swivels around in time to get off a last shot bam
that collapses alex to the floor
in the mystery room the crow squeezes out of the secretarys grasp leaving her holding a couple feathers
at the awards case alex hauls himself off the floor as the crow joins him
maddens head has taken its place among glass bowls and trophies half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests on
down the shelf from the stuffed bird
alex rushes through the blown out window into
seeing for the first time that erin is gone the rope hanging from the ceiling finding
sitting on the floor painting her own toenails blue leaning up against the wall
whered they go
alex eases the secretary to her feet with a hand around her neck her back to the wall
she looks up smiling at
walsh right arm missing hangs high overhead from some kind of hook
his arm has been crudely removed
underneath him on the table a box of surgical stainless steel rods sits by a pool of blood
alex yells reeling as
the door flies open
a half dozen cops in all targeting alex as
the secretary plunges the lauren knife in alexs back
he spins violently throwing her hard against the wall
reveal shes impaled on antelope antlers hanging off the wall
her head drops looking down as a stream of blood flows down her legs drips off her toes
dying words my nails
bam bam bam
the new arrivals open fire
alex reaches over his shoulder yanks out the knife with an odd slurping sound as
the sound of gunfire filters down from above as the captain hunts his hidden prey
he stops studies
erins pov low angle looking under a car the captains feet joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she left on the ground
reproving herself as she turns toward camera
she looks back under the car but
the captains feet have moved off
she listens hears nothing
new angle erin takes refuge in the service area crouching behind stacks of tires
knife at the ready
the captains footsteps audible
her obstructed pov between stacks of tires the captain glock at ready passes by moving out of sight
erin listening neurons firing
cranes her neck to see
wider the captain appears behind erin over the stacks of tires
shes oblivious then
erin wheels slashes across his wrist
the glock falls erin grabs it levels it at the captain
her finger tense on the trigger
re gun i know you too well
you wont do it
you dont know me at all
she pulls the trigger simultaneously wrenching the gun aiming just enough off that
the captain yells in pain rushes his hand to his ear a bloody mess
he starts advancing again toward her and erin pulls
the trigger again again again
no click no blast
resume the captain takes the gun from her
shows her the clip hes carrying in his hand
slams it into the gun
one in the chamber
thats all you get
erin screams as he drags her off now and
the crow flies up toward the small entry window
alex follows bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself up toward the windowledge
the sound of a car in a hurry audible as alex hauls himself out the small window
runs to the edge spotting
far below a dark sedan leaving in a rush wrapping around the corner of the police station now
the captain nervous at the wheel
he looks over his shoulder
erins in the back seat cuffed to the door handle
the sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the carnage
crossing himself holy mother of god
the devil himself
he looks up where alex vanished
starts to climb
alex dashes over the articulated roof trying to keep in sight
his moving pov partially obstructed of the sedan below
speeding around another corner now
alex alters course to cut the sedan off jumping up onto a parapet where he totters over the vertical face as the sedan turning onto the street below
the sergeant and crew emerge on the roof
acquire target alex corvis
with alex as he takes a flying dive off the building intercepting
the dark sedan careening up the street leaving the city
the captain nearly jumps out of his skin barely keeping control
what the fuck
erin perks up in the back seat
as the speeding car passes under a streetlight we see a human figure standing on top of it legs spread arms upstretched
the figure alex strikes downward right through the glass moonroof
in the sedan the captain horrified as alexs hand yanks his own right off the wheel and up through the moonroof
on the roof of the sedan alex kneels now holding the captains arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing
the zigzag pattern the mortified flesh held in alexs hand like the trophy it is
alexs voice appears
the jolt eight amps at two to three thousand volts
it lasts a few seconds
the current surges and is turned off
find alexs face in the darkness
moving as he performs some unseen task
they wait for the body to cool then check to see if the heart is still beating
find erin in the darkness listening to alexs voice
she touches her mouth little drops of dried blood where the wounds are already healing
if it is
ba boom ba boom
another jolt is applied
slow fade in as our eyes adjust to the dim light
experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register
they agree electrocution does not hurt could not hurt
but it does
were in the death chamber
the only light a few panel indicators and spill from the door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside
alex looks at the phone on the wall
i dont expect a call from the governor
any last words
captain my captain
reveal the captain in the chair
a private execution
erin slumped along a side wall
a long beat of silence
was that it
im not dying for your goddamn illusions
you got that
you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you
she was already bored why do you think she was looking around
youre nothing corvis
less than nothing
a figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch
the captains voice rising as he senses time running out
you cant do this to me you little fucks
ill come back just like you a big fucking shit spewing bird and three guesses what little bitch im taking out first
the switch thrown
pan up off the switch to
you are so dead
she glances at the captain fibrillating in the chair starts to move off
then stops near alex looking with him at
their pov the zigzag scar fibrillating as we push into seething detail
writhing bodies human suffering a hellish miasma that draws us in until we turn our heads away released
alex and erin exit the visitors entrance met by the crow and the first rays of morning light
he puts his arm around her and she places her hand over his
you want to get some breakfast
then what i mean is
i dont know how this works but
he stops face to face now
in the woods you said you had nothing
but you wouldnt and i wouldnt if theres some way you dont have to go
at least not right away
ill always be with you
for a split second shes
she kisses him
as the break off its
erin again she hangs on a long moment before letting go
then she spots something
on the ground a sign carried by one of the protestors
remember the victim
with a picture of lauren
someone has written a bold s after it
remember the victims
erin picks up the sign
look at this
she turns to alex
but hes gone
she tries to keep it together as
camera booms up leaving her alone outside the prison walls with her memories and her conscience and her hopes which is alot
as a dustdevil whips up in the parking lot she drops the sign and starts to cry
in that moment when alex went
wherever he went
when he made that choice i knew i was making a choice too
to be alive
in the world
and it made me cry
camera finds walsh laid out on the table now missing arm mercifully away from us
the crow alights nearby something in its beak
maybe the world is a bad place but the captain gone has to be some improvement
and that hope that tomorrow will be better is enough to keep me going
the crow flaps off revealing the white king laid by walshs head
camera keeps moving finding
the crow on the stand marked corvis brachyrhynchos stuffed and mute
its eyes blink a last time then are motionless
a not too loopy feminine hand writing the words we are hearing
when i think of lauren fighting and dying it tears me apart but it also reassures me
that lauren and alex were meant for each other
erin is writing the journal but shes a radically transformed wild child
a shock of vividly colored dreadlocks some of the holes that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs
that theyre together now
united by love
that theyve given also to me
shes leaning up against a new headstone
alex corvis always with us
i love alex
as my sister always hoped i would
and i love lauren
and i know because of this that love does not die
thinking of them
hoping that sometimes theyre thinking of me
erin stops writing closes the journal stands
she takes the locket off her neck drapes it over alexs headstone like the one already over laurens
she stares at the two a moment then puts her index finger to her lips transfers kisses to the two stones
