written by michael france an unparalleled set of sheer mountains part of the colorado rockies
the peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out of the valley wind whipped snow mists over the mountains like a low fog
the tranquility is broken as a helicopter blasts into view fighting the wind as it heads for the center of it all
our credits fly us past and through this magnificent range
there are sky piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow high pinnacle and others that are steel straight up approaches to large plateaus
one of the mountains has a crystal lake on top with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the middle of a mountain wall
nearby an abandoned cable ladder is bolted into the same wall leading to the top
we can see a man sitting in its doorway looking out the glasses scan systematically slowly to us it looks like nothing more than a field of gray and white
the helicopter now circles this tallest mountain the tower separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by a chasm of two hundred feet that drops feet below
spotter frank newell s scans the mountain wall
maggie deighan s expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm winds
both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as members of the rocky mountain park rescue team
wait a minute theres hal
beat and his date
thats part of the smaller peak
hal tucker s and his date susan collins s are decked out in climbing gear
hals aplomb suggests hes a veteran climber susans worried look shows she isnt
hal and susan huddle together both cold but okay
hal has a makeshift splint wrapped around his lower leg and a slow burning flare in one hand
frank lowers his glasses maggie struggles with the wind
how do they look
hal now aware of the copter looks towards it smiling and starts jerking off the flare
hes signalling okay
the pov dips down theres somebody climbing below in an orange rescue jacket
right where hes supposed to be
this is gabe walker s
in spite of the cold and the snow hes fearlessly swiftly scaling the tower without safety lines as if hes done it a hundred times
thats because he has done it a hundred times
this is what gabe lives for
gabe almost there finds a fingertip width handhold at arms length grabbing it he pulls himself up on the ledge with a move thats just a little tougher than chinning
yourself on a doorjamb
winded gabe slumps down next to the couple and tries to light a cigarette
the lighter only sparks
excuse me i know youre my salvation and all do you think you could rescue us before your smoke break
hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one bogart style one handed with a thumbnail cupping a hand to shield it against the wind
gabe bends down for it a familiar routine
we know in a glance theyve been friends for years
maybe you could tell me why i am rescuing you
basically ive fallen down and i cant get up
into radio rescue one have located helpless climber please prepare idiot line for transport over the helicopter dips down towards the ledge no way can it land there
frank lowers a rescue wire to who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it the wire is just out of reach
hal grabs the radio
rescue one please remind me to tell you about the time i hauled your hero here down mt
huntington on my back over through radio hal if i hear that story one more time im making you limp down the entire three thousand feet over gabe finally grabs
the line secures it to a heavy piton and hammers it into the wall
to susan this guy showing you a good time
swings over across to the facing mountain maggie lands the copter in spite of the winds on a small plateau
frank gets out to secure the wire theres now a lifeline spanning the chasm
gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock he extinguishes his cigarette in the snow and naturally pockets the butt
hal propped up against the wall expertly rigs a seat harness around his legs susan helps him get part of it around his splint and gabe clips it to the
now remember keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times laughing fuck you with that hal pulls himself hand over hand across the sloping line hal makes
a point of looking down is vertigo defined
thirty five hundred feet straight down
you could stack the world trade center towers on top of each other and theyd still be shorter than this mountain is high
however lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face in mock horror he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet of the line where frank
catches him and pulls him out
hal gets out of the harness checks every stitch of it signals thumbs up and sends it back
gabe retrieves the harness on a small attachment line and gives susan a reassuring smile but shes still sensibly very scared
gabe recovers the harness rigs susan into it and meticulously re checks it
sees shes afraid did he tell you about the time he almost made it up everest
he said you gave him a bad oxygen mask well if hes bored you with that bullshit then this has to be the best part of a bad date
susan nervously laughs
scared but tough okay gabe starts to push her out on the line but she grabs his arm in a panic
i cant susan starts to tilt her head down gabe gently takes hold of her chin turning her view up to face him
yes you can
reassuring you can do it
dont look down
the whole way across dont look down
look at me
just keep looking at me and youll be okay
susan looks at gabe trying to be confident nods
beat i have always depended on the kindness of rangers
gabe grins and gently pushes her out
susan tentatively pulls herself across then develops a rhythm building speed inching away in the harness looking more confident now signalling ok youre doing fine thirty feet out going fine
holding the strap under susans left leg breaks the harness completely unravels all at once its strands shoot through the clips what was a seat has become a trap door in half a second as the harness shoots out from under her susan falls but grabs the harness strand is helpless and can only watch as too scared to breathe dangles on the remaining strand of what used to be the harness she sways from the wind and the jerk of her own weight her grip loosens that is supporting all of susans weight is being seriously tested a single knot in the harness has caught there but it clearly wont last long moves back from the ledge
loud in control hold on
im coming out to get you
gabe gently pulls himself up on the line crosses his ankles on it and clips himself on with a three foot safety line
gabe starts smoothly quickly pulling himself out but is in trouble the bobbing of the line from gabes weight and the winds are making her lose her grip even more
urgently pulls himself along the line faster trying not to shake the line
as he gets closer and closer to a terrified susan his eyes lock on hers keep looking at me
hold on gabe is only ten feet away from who stares at gabe petrified this focus is helping but her strength is just about gone the knot has worked itself
halfway through it doesnt make any difference how tight she holds on to the harness the harness itself is letting go who knows it and pulls himself the rest of the way a little faster almost bridging the gap staring desperately at gabe holding on thats keeping susan alive surrenders the knot it passes through and falls deliberately lets go of the main line and launches himself at susan miss gabes three foot safety line pulls taut testing the limits of the line above as it yanks him back is just out of reach her hand is still stretched out her eyes still locked on who can only look down swaying helplessly on the wire as susans scream starts frank and maggie look down in horror but neither look as anguished as hal falling falling falling looking very small against the vast mountain range from this height takes the longest nineteen seconds you can imagine twists from his safety line spinning helplessly he wants to but cant shut his eyes susan is gone
her scream cut short echoes the safety harness spirals down after her like a carefree bird as the plane dips to land gabe can see a bird circling far below
over the same mountainous terrain
sweating panting awake
it hasnt been that long since the accident a year to be exact but he looks older
he looks as if hes watched susan collins drop at least one hundred times
gabe reels himself in as a stewardess hands him a glass of water
gabe does afraid of flying
gabe shakes his head
gabe with no luggage is at the small airports only car rental counter doing the paperwork for a rental agent
any size any color any model
how long will you be needing it
flat just under six hours
you arent wasting any time are you
gabe turns and looks at who is standing off to the side
i knew youd be coming by
gabes happy to see her but at the same time he isnt
she looks too good and she brings up quite a mixed bag of memories
maggie carves on a smile
if youre in that much of a hurry why dont you ride with me
maggie pilots the copter heading out toward the mountain range
gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside
both grope for a way to start the conversation
this is new
its a thermal scope picks up body heat of lost hikers gabe flicks it on looks at the total absence of heat as they fly over the snow
still find the dead ones the old fashioned way i guess
so much for small talk
gabe is clearly uneasy watching these mountains go by
maggie breaks an awkward silence you could have said goodbye
shakes head if i did id have to listen to you tell me one more time that it wasnt my fault
angry today especially today you get to hear it again
the harness clip broke
cold stress one in a million equipment failure
you and hal could have checked it from then till now and it still would have happened
beat you did everything right if i did everything right susan collins would still be alive
whizzes on to the ranger station a small building by an old country road
not much activity outside of some rookie climbers working out on a climbing practice wall
maggie starts to land the copter and as she does do you really believe all that
that it wasnt our fault
maggie slows the rotor her eyes on the controls
gabes eyes are locked on her
turns to gabe yes
yes i do
but she answered a half beat too slow
the helicopter touches ground
im not sure what i wish more maggie
that you meant what you said just now or that it were really true then
hal wearing sheriffs garb storms towards maggies side of the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies
maggie where the hell have you been
ive got two climbers out gabe gets out of the copter and hal sees him for the first time
unlike the last time we saw them neither man is glad to see the other
hal turns on maggie
brett and evan are up there again to jump off the spur
their wives called twice
i want you in the air and i want them found before the storm system moves in
maggie hesitates now
maggie takes off as gabe and hal step away from the copter
gabe eyes hals uniform and almost not quite but almost laughs
youre in charge of rescue now
there was a vacancy
maybe you heard about it
the last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town
well youre a better man than i am hal
nothing rattles you
the rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this faceoff
gabe and hal are one crack away from beating hell out of each other
frank heads over to defuse the confrontation
steering gabe away gabe
long time son why dont you come meet some of the new guys good idea
beat why dont you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death rig a woman properly
that tears it hal rushes gabe and they pummel each other until frank and the others pull them apart panting and bleeding
hal throws off the men holding him back but instead of going at gabe again hal throws gabe a set of car keys
take the bronco to where youre going
ive already been
then go back to wherever it is you like to hide
and stay there
hal heads back into the office gabe heads for the bronco
the southwest regional center for printing and distributing currency
hundreds of troops stand guard over the impressive u
is at work the roar of its parts is deafening as it stamps out a plate design on huge sheets of paper we move in on which is moved by
mechanical arm to a slicer that razors the bills apart its moving too fast for us to see the denomination the cut bills are separated by that fire the bills down to a mechanical counter that serializes counts bands and stacks them faster than any human could a hand reaches to pick up a band are something a banker could work a lifetime without seeing but are real nonetheless bills banded here in hundreds
the band is put back in the growing stack by mid thirties a tough imposing treasury agent he regards the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold
travers is flanked by a trio of equally tough treasury agents he turns to flunky davis s
its clear whos in charge of protecting the money here and whos in charge of counting it
tell wright the san francisco shipment is ready
phone already out right away mr
as davis dials we move to of walter wright s comptroller of currency his demeanor suggests hes in control and used to keeping it that way
into phone good good
ill be right down
as wright gets up from his desk though we hear in the outer office you cant go in there watch me
kurt matheson s bursts into the office trailed by wrights flustered secretary
flashes badge matheson
we need to talk
has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases ten thousand bills
travers shuts the cases in turn and locks each with an electronic key card triggering a flashing red light on the locks as he does
a uniformed pilot shows up behind travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three other agents
well be fueled and ready in ten minutes mr
an order be ready in five
go ahead and take ten
well need the time
travers looks up at matheson who has just arrived with wright
travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his authority
flashes badge matheson
looking down at it your parents must be proud
to wright what the fuck is this about
small problem with the shipment travers
to matheson tell him what you just told me
matheson draws out a file and hands it to travers
we got word that somebodys been observing your currency shipments this load the s over the last three deliveries
laughs there isnt a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe
beat this is the most protected shipment weve got and the most useless for a thief
those bills arent in circulation
you think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass
who the fuck would try
matheson hands travers a folder
this guy might
we look over travers shoulder at the photos which are all blurry all blown up from different surveillance pictures and all of them show eric qualen
who is he
patient his names eric qualen
one of the east german spies who got shut out by the reunification
the cia issued an inter agency warning about him right after the wall came down
hes got nowhere to go and nothing to lose
hes also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these and hes probably desperate enough to try for them
fifty million bucks buys a lot of sanctuary
could you get to the part where im supposed to care
shows him more photos we had two agents monitoring him
these two gleason and quinones
their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment
turning away thanks for the tip
but ive got work to do
stopping him did i say last report
i think i did
i mean last fucking report
these guys have vanished
you have my sympathy but exasperated theres a reason we do things this way all right
armored cars can be hijacked
trains can be derailed
but nobody can get to us in flight
the only time this is on the ground is at the mint or on the presidio runway in san francisco
either way someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards
matheson still isnt convinced
if youre worried about an inside job forget it
i checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago
and these three are my best against
even if one of them did go skydiving they wouldnt get far
each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles
travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman out of his jacket pocket
the small screen shows three red blips at rest matching the three currency cases
facing down matheson i havent lost a bill in eight years
and im not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily
an easy smile who said anything about stopping the shipment
beat ive been tracking qualen for almost a year
if he pulls something i want to be in on the party
travers angry turns to wright
wright clearly doesnt like this either but is resigned to it
this is cleared from the top travers
matheson will accompany you on the flight to san francisco
beat show him every professional courtesy
travers turns back to a smiling matheson looking like hed rather kill him instead as we is being buffeted by storm winds and a light snow maggie struggles hard with
the controls but visibility is near zero
maggie keys the radio
rescue one to base over
rescue one have you sighted them
over negative hal storms already moving in i cant see them and winds are too strong to stay up here over rescue one abort
theyll be all right
brett and evan are dumb enough not to log in but theyre smart enough to have storm gear
head back to base
not unkindly maybe you can catch gabe before he leaves
i dont think hes planning a long visit hal
back to business rescue one heading back to base over and out
banks a to fly back we can see over the horizon that the storm is moving in fast
we can hear maggies helicopter flying off overhead camped inside the cave are brett and evan both s both shivering amid their gear backpacks cooking stuff and parachutes
these are colorado rock jocks thrillseekers wholl try anything if the odds are strong enough theyll die in the process
freezing way to check the weather brett
shivering yet macho hey
if it were easy it wouldnt be worth d doing
the dc cruises over increasingly mountainous remote terrain
who looks tense we move around the cabin and find two more relaxed treasury agents are dozing on the opposite side of the plane their arms chained to the currency
matheson is edgy
another agent offers some condescending reassurance
just enjoy the view huh
matheson says nothing relax
i mean what could happen in the air
matheson turns back to his window and looks down is covered with snow the jets shadow moves sleekly and plainly over it
but after a moment we see another jets shadow on the ground coming up fast
reacts this and shifts his look upward to is flying a parallel course to the treasury jet and is just one hundred yards away
close enough to see eric qualens face in one of the windows
matheson stands travers has noticed the plane by now too and gets out of his seat as the other agents react
to other agents stay put
dont panic goddammit
travers moves into where the pilot seems nervous but oddly not frightened
hes coming in too slow
cool no were going too fast and were too high up
push flaps forward twenty degrees and drop to five thousand feet
matheson is out of his seat pistol drawn
seems a little puny under the circumstances
to agent you got any rifles
forward compartment left side matheson rushes through a curtain to the area between the cabin and the cockpit and pulls open a closet door
to his horror he finds inside not rifles but who well recognize as the missing fbi agents from the photos matheson showed travers
backs up in horror and he sees travers calmly coming out of the cockpit
rattled matheson pulls his gun on travers
travers looks dumbfounded then angry
what the hell are you doing checked the plane from top to bottom huh
you fucker clicks hammer back put your hands behind your head
travers puts his hands out and walks forward slowly backing matheson into the cabin
not in surrender but as if hes calming a nutcase
the other agents see this and dont know which way to jump
calm down give the gun to me to other agents theres a couple of dead bodies in the front compartment theyre fbi agents hes losing it they now think matheson
is crazy too he looks nuts the other agents move behind him
matheson gets even more frantic and point his gun at them
dont you see what hes doing
hes hijacking the fucking shipment
back to travers dont make me shoot you
the other two agents get behind matheson and rapidly disarm him
travers pulls out his gun with a slow leisurely move
dont make me laugh
travers fires his gun three times one for each agents chest the agents are cut down realizing too late whats happened
a fourth shot knocks matheson over a seat as if hed been kicked
travers puts his gun away and puts on a radio headset as he goes to a window
to mouthpiece move into position
maneuvers over the dc and holds steady above it
the stone reads susan collins
its surrounded by wreaths one of which has an old snapshot of her attached to it
mementos sent on the first anniversary of her death
brushes some of the falling snow away from the marker
he lays down his flowers and pauses for a moment then gets into the bronco and drives away
gabe looks out the window at the countryside he used to belong in
hes wondering if he still does
qualens jet is now flying parallel to and slightly above the treasury jet
the door in qualens jet is open and we get our first good look at qualen who is also wearing a headset radio and is wired to a safety line
in the jet
hes lowering a thick steel cable down to the treasury jet
qualen is as deadly as advertised mph winds are tearing at him through the open door but he is unfazed and unfrightened
is also wired to a safety line by his own jets open door
into radio more more keep it coming qualens jet lowers the cable into the treasury jet it looks like an air force midair refuelling difficult and dangerous
after about thirty feet of line is lowered takes it in and clips it to a ring at the top of the jets doorway
into radio locked on
move into lateral position
the pilot kristel is a woman
her skill like her hard beauty can be measured in a glance shes a lot calmer than her counterpart in the treasury plane
moving into lateral position
qualens jet lowers itself banking to the side the treasury jet raises itself
both are now flying side by side with the cable serving as a thirty foot bridge
travers unclipped from his safety line cautiously goes to the cockpit
the pilot nervous struggles with the controls
were right on the edge of the storm lets move it
travers pulls the two dead fbi agents out of the compartment one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot one in a suit like travers
this isnt going to work wright will suspect something
hell sift though a plane that went down in a storm gestures to bodies find enough pulverized bone for six men heroically killed in the line of duty finds three
suitcases and just enough of the right kind of ash
travers opens one of the cases which is identical to the others except that its full of one dollar bills
hes thought of everything
we get twenty one gun funerals and they write off fifty million
its perfect as long as you hold the plane steady so concentrate
travers moves back into the cabin
we can now see four other passengers
all are fit and armed heldon and ryan are seated while kynette and delmer ready to help with the transfer are on the opposite side of the door from a
very impatient qualen
into radio travers hurry it up
travers now in a harness like the one seen earlier uncuffs the money cases from the agents
into radio on my way
travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch over and led starts counting down from even in the last minute the storms gotten worse the plane is
flying right into the blackest center of it
the pilot looks more panicked than ever
that charge is going to blow both engines the planell go down like a rock so clip yourself on to the end of the cable with the money as soon
as i get over
an afterthought and make sure you bring the right cases
travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the cable between the planes
into the headset dip the plane
im coming over
qualens jet dips down so theres a sharp incline travers starts the slide down zipping in seconds across into where hes pulled in and unclipped by qualen
shouting over the wind why didnt you send the money over
shouting too somehow i didnt think youd have waited for me if id sent it first
qualen smiles in reply
maybe he wouldnt
the pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin
counts down the pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach them to the cable but as he steps past the bodies of mathesons eyes open hes not
the pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable and is about to put his harness on but behind him matheson shakily crawls to his feet draws
his gun and shoots the pilot in the back twice
drops out of the plane flailing if hes screaming we cant hear it over the howling of the storm qualen and travers are watching the whole plan unravel shouting to
cockpit get underneath the jet
the cases will slide over
qualens jet sharply dips down and the cases start to slide over but at the same time matheson groggy holds onto the doorway and fires a full clip from his
automatic at qualens jet and counts down and are destroyed as the charge detonates as promised the treasury jet is now plummetting as if it had no wings at all levelling the angle between the planes the cases dangle precariously on the wire shouting lower
get underneath it
matheson struggles to the cockpit and gets behind the controls as if thats going to do any good qualens jet is deliberately racing the disabled treasury jet down but its
hopeless theres no way to get underneath the falling jet long enough for the cases to slide over
isnt quite panicked
its dragging us down
disconnect the cable
heldon and ryan try to do just that but the cable is taut theres no way to loosen the clip on the door dive down faster at an ever steeper
angle over the edge of the colorado mountain range the clip on the door finally breaks the treasury jet drops as qualens jet trailing the cable and the money sharply shoots upward makes a one point landing nose first into the wilderness cartwheeling into a fireball
the sound of the explosion muffled in the wind far off but audible drives hal outside hes alert but cant see anything in the murk of the storm levels off
the plane but its still in trouble struggle to reel in the cable because the money cases are still barely holding on the cuffs caught on the broken clip at the end arent even bothering with the electric winch theyre dragging it in hand over hand but the cases torn by the wind work their way loose one at a time and drop one two three into the snowy mountains below
heldon and ryan clamp the door shut as qualen angrily attacks travers tries to bring the plane up but cant the fuel guage needle is dropping fast is pouring out
fuel through a dozen bullet holes one of two engines sputters to a stop
the plane is now just skirting the mountain tops and is still being battered by storm winds kristel aims it for what looks like the flattest longest mountain top kynette
and ryan grab qualen and travers to separate them all strap in because is going down it just tops the edge of a precipice and hits the ground level the problem is the ground itself isnt level it tilts down towards another edge five hundred yards distant if the plane keeps skidding itll go over the edge sleds down at an angle skipping over rocks through trees tearing off a wing kristel rides the stick only out of habit nothing she does is going to matter now the men are jolted around windows implode as kynette tries to protect a bag of what is obviously explosives rips downhill through a wooded area like a runaway train the second wing is sheared off by trees is coming up fast but wrenches to a sudden halt the fuselage intact
or whats left of it has stopped several feet short of the edge we can see why the steel cable trailing from the cargo door has lashed itself around a
half dozen trees acting as a tripwire to stop the plane
all are dazed but outside of superficial cuts unhurt
kristel moves out of the cockpit looking around
so much for phase one
to travers now what
she speaks for all of them especially a still seething qualen
travers pulls out the tracer monitor for the cases
the tracer screen shows three distinct blips the tracers have survived the fall
now we call the police
hal agitated paces in the main office frank unconcerned puts a coat hanger and some aluminum foil on a little tv to drag in the fading signal of a broncos
look i know theres a storm but that wasnt thunder
unconcerned hal when youve been in this line as long as i have the stations scanner radio barks to life
panicky mayday mayday downed dc mayday hal runs to the radio and keys the mike
rocky mountain rescue come in mayday kristel is on the radio as travers and qualen hang back
kristels voice is panicked but she cant suppress a grin
downed charter flight alpha charlie niner keys mike to garble transmission dead seven seriously wounded acknowledge acknowledged mayday
whats your position
panicked dont know position unknown landed on top of some mountain only visual bearing is a facing cylinder type formation over got to be comb bluff
keys mike acknowledged mayday
winds are too strong for us to get a copter up there can you and your passengers make it through the storm
over negative cockpit is on fire fuselage broken into three sep garble ed in shock
need medical supplies including insulin repeat insulin as soon as po dead silence
the transmission cuts off mayday come in mayday kristel hangs up the radio and smiles travers and qualen standing behind her
qualen lightly applauds
the insulin was a nice touch
the bronco wends through a winding country road coming finally to a cabin settled in a clearing
pulls into the driveway and puts the bronco in park
he doesnt cut the engine because hes not sure whether hes going in or not
finally he cuts the ignition
a knock on the door brings no response no one inside
gabe opens the unlocked door and steps inside
gabe takes a look around the living room
his face tells us without a doubt this used to be his home
gabe moves inside pausing at a mantle
two framed photos gabe and maggie sleeping together in a hammock bolted to a sheer wall over a foot drop
gabe hal and maggie all younger all sporting drunken grins in a mountain cave
gabe smiles for the first time today at this memory a banging at the back of the cabin shakes him out of it
has come open and swings in the wind
gabe steps outside and pulls it shut
gabe looks down and sees tracks that lead to a small but sturdy shed a few yards away
gabe heads over to it
not a storage shed at all its a small workspace that offers solid protection from the elements is well lit and whistle clean
maggie in front of a table pulls a cover off
inside is a bald eagle
one of maybe left in the country
its uneven feathering and small gawky size tells us it isnt nearly full grown
a bandage on its side tells us its been injured
maggies smile tells us its healing
hey there the door to the shed opens gabe steps in and shuts the door behind him
maggie looks surprised to see him
gabe just looks awkward
beat could you introduce us
gabe walker this is a
not the tag what do you call him
i call her lucky
bends down eyes wound poachers
maggie nods bastards
they got the mother and left this one behind
too small to make a decent trophy i guess
about four months right
maggie nods christ it must have been just about his i mean her first flight time to change the dressing
maggie pulls on a pair of pair of cowhide gloves
you cant do that alone ive had to learn
she trust me maggie reaches into the cage but the eagle starts thrashing
im making her nervous beat you hold her ill do the dressing
gabe finds another pair of gloves sterile cotton pads and alcohol in a drawer maggie reaches in and grabs the eagles beak and talons quickly but gently and takes it
out of the cage holding it firm
this is clearly something theyve done many times before
they move together tight gabe and maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage the eagle
its getting warmer in here
gabe reaches down and yanks off the patch
the eagle thrashes as gabe cleans the wound
got some fight in her thats good
beat what happened to dave
flew off never calls never writes gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch and sticks it on the eagles side
maggie puts the eagle back in the cage and closes the top door
gabe and maggie dont move any further apart as they pull their gloves off
gabe tentatively reaches for maggies face but she pushes him hand away
im glad to see you gabe
but i kind of wish you hadnt come
i was almost used to you being gone
beat quiet why are you here
pauses i thought i came back to see if id learned to live with it
well big surprise
coming back just tore me open all over again like it all happened yesterday instead of a year ago
including the way i feel about you
beat i didnt realize it till i saw you at the airport
but i came back for you maggie
does that mean youre going to stay
beat i want you come with me
start over somewhere else
incredulous you come back after being gone a year and you expect me to beat you dont live here any more gabe
your choice remember
but this is my home
im not leaving
you can stay with me or you can go alone
its still your choice
now theres an easy call
standing in the sheds doorway is hal
furious gabe heads out after hal
what the hell do you want
beat i need your help
a planes gone down on comb bluff
this storm would blow a copter all over the place but we can climb up to it
beat talk to somebody whos still on the payroll
youve got a half dozen new guys who couldnt climb that wall now if there were stairs cut into it
but youve soloed it
during the summer
on a bet
this is a little more important than a bet
just a few injured people with no first aid or shelter camping in a zero degree blizzard
theyll be ice sculptures by tomorrow morning
shakes his head maybe you missed the headlines but i dont do rescues any more
theyre bad for my conscience
beat fuck this one up on your own
gabe walks past hal
furious hal spins gabe around
play it again gabe about how we killed her
i was there too remember
hot not like i was pal her fingers brushed mine on the way down right back and i was the one who had to deal with her family when you
fucking tore out of town
takes a breath we lost her
whatever anybody says about cold stress and the clip you and i have to live with that
but right now there are some more people who need our help and they shouldnt die too just because youve got a problem keeping the past in the past
gabe knows hes right
but hes hesitant
i dont want the responsibility
walk away and you are responsible
i cant do this alone
gabe slows but doesnt stop you know what else gabe
you can go anywhere you want but if you dont do this now youre going to be stuck on that goddamn ledge for the rest of your life
sees maggie in the doorway
shes heard every word
gabe turns to hal hesitates and nods
relative to the other mountains comb bluff is smaller about feet high
but thats like saying the empire state building is smaller than the sears tower
its still a long way up if youre climbing the stairs
with full packs of mountaineering gear on
theyve got to climb up this beast
gabe now back in his orange sheriffs jacket scrambles with hal up the base of the mountain the last few yards before it turns into a sloping wall
gabe takes a bolt gun which fires rope fastened bolts into rock and hangs it from a strap on his chest
indicating gun that things dead weight
completely useless for an ice climb
gabe readies a coil of rope and starts up the wall
not a challenge ill lead
i left a few bolts last time i climbed this i think i can find some of them
hal starts up after gabe easily keeping pace with him
save the rope for when it gets tough
beat realizing that bet was for you to free climb the wall
further up tell you what hal if were still alive tomorrow morning ill give you the twenty bucks back okay
two orange specks move their way up the mountain its definitely going to be a long trip
are now visibly two thirds of the way up
is not only higher its a lot tougher to climb
instead of being angular the wall is now completely vertical and coated with ice
rough irregular ice ledges are all gabe and hal can grip its a matter of grabbing what you can for a handhold and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons
on their boots into the ice for footholds
gabe leads planting pitons into the ice threading the rope through them as he goes
three steel pins between gabe and hal
their only safety net
gabe trailing rope behind him goes up a difficult slab of ice and climbs under a ledge where he anchors the rope in the ice with another piton
shouting down anchored
is beside and slightly below gabe at the other end of the fifty foot rope
hal cautiously pulls himself along the line to the first piton as is standard for a climb he pulls out the piton then moves on to the second but up
above ice building in a small crevase builds and cracks the adjoining rock several ten pound boulders fall causing a chain reaction that bounces down the wall hugs the ice wall making himself as flat as possible shouting down rockslide
flattens too as rocks bounce past the second anchoring piton loosens as it is struck by a falling rock hal nervously eyes the last piton between him and gabe also
has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops at half mast no way are these going to hold in the unreliable ice tries to stay flat but one boulder painfully clips him on the shoulder knocking him from his perch hal falls in falling hals weight on the rope yanks out the nearest anchor piton hal tumbles in space keeping pace with the boulders as whos seen everything we have quickly reaches to the piton hes just anchored and removes the carabiner clip the rope draws taut yanking out the last piton between he and gabe nothing but a few yards of slack rope now has the bolt gun out
he rapidly hooks the ropes carabiner clip to the chambered bolt and fires it at a solid rock ledge above him imbeds solidly in the rock lashes the rope to
his shoulder bracing for the coming impact by lodging his feet in the ice the line pulls taut leaving hal suspended the wind knocked out of him from the impact is almost dragged down by the jolt he painfully takes most of the impact in his shoulders the shock forces his feet through an ice ledge but the rope bolted to the rock above has held
shaken voice gone anchored shouts this time anchored
now somewhat recovered steadies himself
breathless too youre sure this time hal climbs up the rope finally reaching another ledge slightly below gabes
hal leans against the wall gasping as gabe clips the gun to his pack
looking up at gun dont say it wheezing too its kind of hard to resist its not dead its not dead weight you weight i am
hal and gabe start howling that hysterical giddy laugh that only comes from just missing a violent end
hal and gabes friendship is starting to resurface their laughter is nearly louder than the wind as we from the top of the bluff someone is looking down through binoculars
gabe and hals orange jackets are plainly visible a few hundred yards below
lowers the binoculars and keys an ear button on the headset radio hes wearing sending a beep
travers is wearing another headset the others are just resting in the seats into mouthpiece have they arrived
two beeps in response good
return to the plane and cover your tracks
to others get ready
hal and gabe are tired but get a second wind from the excitement of being almost on top
gabe stops breathless for a second then goes on
hal lags a little behind
come on the hard parts over
gabe heads up and over and helps hal up
from here the rest of the range looms large
even in the continuing snowstorm its a spectacular sight but gabe and hal dont pause to enjoy it
this isnt a trip for sport
hal looks off into the trees and sees the torn tree stumps from the plane crash
grim thats it
hal and gabe run into the wooded area and follow the wreckage felled trees a smashed wing and reach which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice
i thought the fuselage was broken
that looks pretty cozy
puzzled too the pilot was hysterical
somethings wrong here does this look like a prank to you
come on hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in gabe wary takes a look around the plane
its comparatively dark in here hal starts in shining a light the beam finds slumped down on the cabin floor a blanket wrapped around him hes shaking and is generally
giving a good impression of a shock victim
hal rushes to him
relax were here to help weak travers whispers as hal gives him some water
dont try to talk travers wont quit hal leans down to hear
hoarse whisper where
what are you a gun barrel moves into view as it presses against hals neck
heldon and ryan are right behind him
travers instantly drops his act
you said we
where are the rest
notes footprints in the snow fresh ones and kneels down to look at the cable wrapped around the tree
no ordinary accident
but before he can think about this he gets an earful of gun barrel from qualen who is behind him
qualen hustles gabe inside the plane his hands are on his head and his pack has been removed
qualen throws the pack to ryan and delmer who rifle through it removing anything that could be a weapon they quickly confiscate gabes bolt gun and ice axe
whats for dinner
kynette tosses packet ugh
dried beef slices with barbeque sauce
tosses it back try and make this edible
travis looks at hals park ranger badge
to gabe wheres yours
he doesnt have one
just a wallet
qualen tosses it to travers who glances through it
notes photo of maggie very attractive
let me tell you whats on for today
wed like you to help settle a wager
you see we lost some luggage travers motions to ryan and qualen who shove gabe and hal forward in the cabin
travers takes out the tracer monitor
showing them the blips see these
now ive bet the gentlemen behind you that you know enough about this mountain range to lead us to each of these quickly and that youd be happy to do
they bet me you couldnt and wouldnt
guns are clicked now tell me who wins
gabe and hal eye each other no choice
now lets get this expedition started
hal and gabe lead the expedition down a steep but passable descent leading to that links comb bluff with the next mountain
travers stops gabe and pulls out the monitor
connect the dots
gabe pauses as he holds the monitor up against the mountainscape
the first blip is up a thousand feet its a wall and obviously not something for a novice
gabe pauses a little too long qualen nudges him with his gun
gabe hands the monitor back to travers
gabe with hal right behind leads them up the wall its not a straight climb but theres a series of zig zagging natural ledges that cut up the wall
wide enough even for an amateur
the others follow gabe and hals example
have led the gang further up the wall using pitons and carabiner clips to create a guide rope
its still just a matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges
hal and gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge
as gabe hammers in a new piton he turns to hal
sotto we dont have to do this
we know these mountains they dont
if we can get ahead can you climb faster than they can shoot
weve got to try something
think well get a finders fee after they get all their luggage
all the bullets we can eat
thats not what really worries me
theres something else to worry about
once theyve got what theyre after theyre gonna need a copter to get out of here
gabe nods grimly and keeps moving up
the rest keep pace
the climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on the wall the ledge is now two feet wide
travers takes out the tracer monitor the monitor shows that the first case is just above them
beat its up there
juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position
as the rest of the wall above is completely sheer its obvious that the case if it is above has landed on top of a ledge
but this isnt easily accessible we move down from the overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds to get up there and those are slick with
ice and snow
worse the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve making climbing almost impossible
travers holds his gun on gabe and motions up fetch
ill need the ice axe
laughs youve got to be kidding
how about some tape
travers nods kynette pulls a roll of tape out of gabes confiscated pack and throws it to him
travers hesitates but nods kynette throws him the iron spikes
gabe fastens them to his boots
gabe looks up this is going to be tough even for him
in spite of the cold he takes off his gloves thats how small these holds are and he meticulously tapes up his hands and his fingers
moves up the wall with some ease at first there are hand sized handholds and decent footholds but twenty feet up theres nothing
to keep going gabe has to painfully wedge his fingers into small cracks essentially supporting his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment
we can see from the angle that gabe is at least feet from solid ground
we can see from his face that hes trying not to think about it
watch gabes slow progress
i dont trust him
indicating wall where could he go
id rather he didnt show us
beat we dont need two guides
shrugs you win
kill him when he gets down
make that if he comes down
gabe is now in one of the worst positions possible for a free climb
he is moving up the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging upside down knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support
its excruciating both in terms of muscular effort and the abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock again and again
gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides the other up hammering it into a crack wedge with ice some of the ice chips whistle past and down finally
gabe gropes one hand over the edge and pulls himself onto exhausted gabe pulls himself prone across the top
something hard is underneath him gabe recovers and brushes the snow off the money case thats underneath
its battered from the fall but is still barely holding together
gabe manages to force open the trashed locks he looks inside the case and fingers a band of s
they can see gabe has made it but they cant see him or the case
impatient shouting lower it down now
has no intention of doing this he snaps the case shut and looks over at a ledge that moves off from it and at the ice and snow above
try to look up and locate gabe
until shouting down ive got a better idea
why dont you come up and get it
with the case gabe moves back against the wall on a ledge that skirts off the overhand from travers and qualens point of view
gabe can hardly be seen since the mountain bulges out as it goes up
gabes got a slight edge of cover
shouts to heldon get him
heldon runs along the lower ledge firing up at who has to flatten against the upper ledge bullets howl past at twenty per second sparking against the lip of the
rock its cover but not much looks up worried piled by the ton from the storm lie further above the ice holding it back already already weakened by the sun is being chiselled away by bullets grabs hal and puts the gun to his head
shouting bring the money down or we kill your friend
travers pushes the barrel away from hal shaking his head
frowning and he knows it
gabe moves across his thing ledge as heldon runs across his gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall because his ledge is getting smaller smiles
seeing gabes cover is gone heldons ledge is getting wider so its easier for him to fire up
heldon moves out to the edge theres now nothing between heldon and gabe heldon takes dead aim looks up sweating it come on above finally give way dropping an avalanche
on who drops the case and hugs the wall only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up on the mountain top tons of ice and snow sweep down the mountainside it shatters the case against the wall as it easily swipes a screaming heldon off the ledge are safe at their vantage but stunned at the sight of heldons machine fun fires uselessly as hes swallowed in an explosion of white as well as a flurry of green as the bills scatter amid the snow then quiet
the avalanche ends as abruptly as it started
the rumble dies down to complete silence
apoplectic stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow settling far below
he takes his gun furious and fires at where gabe was hugging the wall its now blanketed with snow
travers fires an entire clip at where gabe used to be
the snow falls away revealing nothing but stark rock
gabe has been swept away
reacts and attacks travers
you son of a bitch travers turns and pins hal against the wall with the gun ready to kill him too
but hes stopped by qualen
we need him to get the rest of the money
he isnt backing down if he dies we lose everything travers furious takes the gun out of hals face
to hal get us out of here
hal stares at travers with absolute fury but he leads the gang back along the ledge in retreat
powdery snow is settling from the avalanche
from a cave in the rocks brett and evan crawl out a little timidly
what the hell evan takes a pair of overpriced binoculars and looks up the figures are small but its clear that one is pointing a gun at an orange jacketed
lowers the binoculars
brett youre not going to believe this but a couple of guys are holding a gun on hal and forcing him up the bluff i believe it
evan turns to who has found both heldons broken body and his gun half buried in snow
evan walks over amazed
what the fuck is going on here
brett picks up the gun this is more an adventure than he ever dreamed of
lets catch up and find out
brett and evan grab their packs and hurry onto a trail as we return to where gabe was
nothing is stirring
until theres some movement ten feet from where gabe was hugging the wall
its a crevice in the mountain about two feet wide a climber would call this a chimney and its packed with ice and snow
its also packed with his hand gropes out and with some difficulty he digs himself out gasping and coughing
gabe coated with snow leans against the wall and rests
maggie is on the phone pacing as frank is slumped in front of the radio scanner
suddenly the radio comes to life
come in rescue unit over maggie bolts over to the radio before frank can react
keying mike rescue unit whats going on hall
over travers has his gun pressed to hals temple
no tricks no procedural codes no personal messages just tell them everythings under control and youre taking care of the wounded
keys it weve reached the wreckage top of comb bluff six injured but theyre responding to treatment
everything a ok
everything isnt okay hal im coming up after you over negative maggie
winds are too high and the passengers injuries are all superficial
were going to ride out the storm here over travers yanks away the radio
have her come up
forget it downdrafts would wipe her all over the peaks travers starts to argue not that i expect you to give a shit but its our only copter
youll be stuck
travers relents and hands the radio back
i can handle the winds breaking in forget about it maggie thats an order acknowledge maggie looks out the window
the stations windspeed gauge is flying around so fast it looks like it might take off
let me talk to gabe over hesitates you cant
hes taking care of passengers
just like i should be
over and out
maggie leans back in the chair looks out at the storm and tries not to worry
she fails miserably
snatching radio away good
you might live longer than your friend
now takes out monitor what
hal takes the monitor the next blip is above almost straight up
hal motions to the wooded area ahead
the next ones on top of the peak
thisll be long but easy more like a hike than a climb
suspicious it looks like a winding route
theres a more direct route
the east face
but its the wall on the other side and its smooth as glass
maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather
only a psycho would try it in a snowstorm
travers digests this and motions hal to move on as we is torn in pain
in spite of the cold and wind hes drenched in sweat half exertion half fear
we pull back to take in envision a wall
a really big wall
a really really big wall
a wall thats as wide as it is high five thousand feet by five thousand feet narrowing to a domed peak at the summit
now picture the same wall checkered with ice
if this were horizontal you or i couldnt walk on it without falling
now picture the same wall with an orange dot two thirds of the way up it
the orange dot is and he barely has the strength to hold on much less go up
gabe holds himself steady with one hand gets a foothold and swings another hand up to slam it against the wall
hes improvised gear hes tied a crampon to one hand
but its as awkward as it sounds
gabe moves up only a foot or so then pulls out the crampon reaches up and slams it into the wall starting the painful process over again
wrights pacing around trying to figure out what in his office he should break first
davis shows up at the door
furious okay i know its not in san francisco
i know its not here
i know its not in any fucking airport from here to montana
where its not we got that covered
now do you have any ideas on where it is
walking to a map theres no radio contact sir
were not receiving the tracer signal from the cockpits flight recorder
radar lost it after it went low here
he points to a huge part of colorado
hundreds of square miles
we have to assume it went down in the storm
shakes head that storm hasnt quit yet
weather service says weve got it until tomorrow morning at least
even if we could get a plane up now itd be impossible to see anything on the ground
and wright slumps into a chair
the roads are shut down right
most of this area doesnt even have roads
rubs his eyes keep two copters on full standby
and let me know the second that storm starts to wind down
is clearly exhausted and freezing his lips are blue his eyebrows encrusted with snow
wind still threatens to knock him off the wall but he forces himself on
teeth chattering a steambath
spikes himself up a steambath and a bottle of whiskey
new foothold a steambath with a bottle of glenlivet
and a fire
new handhold a steambath with a bottle of glenlivet and a steak
new foothold a steak soaked with glenlivet cooking over a steambath on fire
gabe finally reaches the top of the wall where it meets an enormous overhang of ice
is right underneath where the ice flows over the wall
gabe takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice overhead with more force than usual
this one is going to have to hold
gabe steels himself for a tough move with one hand gripping that crampon he swings out away from the wall
only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand are keeping gabe from falling
gabe needs the second crampon to make the move up but thats not going to be easy to get
its attached to his boot
as gabe clings to the upper crampon his body swaying he reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon
the ground is one slip and five thousand feet away
gabe fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons but both his fingers and the buckles are frozen stiff shows real solid terror for the first time gabe gets the
first buckle off then the second
the crampon is off his boot
still swinging from one hand takes the now freed crampon and slams it into the ice
it doesnt hold but the force of gabes swing pushing him away has loosened the other crampon
gabe only gets one more shot at this he swings the free crampon up with all his might it catches in the same split second as the other dislodges
but the hard part is over with the two crayons gabe quickly manages to climb up over the lip of this is a field of ice sloping up to the
gabe pulls himself a few feet away from the edge and puts the crampons back on his feet where they belong
its now pretty simple for gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to which is a rocky wooded area
gabe seems to have a second wind now he runs to the other side of the summit
the other side is obviously the route hal and the others will be taking beneath the summit is a winding well beaten path
gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby commemorating the douglas expedition
is just a small point of interest shed for hardy tourists who have hiked up this far there is a corny photo stand where you stick your head through a
hole so your face is put on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain
gabe rushes past this to a glass display case on the wall
has black and white photos of a square jawed s climber with his expedition more important is whats beneath it
douglas original climbing equipment a coil of rope some pitons a hat a cloth backpack small binoculars other odds and ends
gabe prepares to smash the glass and hesitates
sighing sorry gordon i promise ill have it back tomorrow
gabe smashes the glass as we move to hal is leading qualen travers and the others upward this is a comparatively easy route but still tiring
the sun goes down beyond a facing taller mountain
ryan is huffing and puffing the altitude and exertion are getting to him
hal allows himself a smile at his discomfort
come on tourists take this trail
qualen pokes hal with the gun he moves on ahead
its getting dark rapidly gabe has scaled a rock formation so he has a view of the rest of the summit gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit
looks pretty ordinary to us but something must have caught gabes eye because he swings back to look at one tree
with broken branches on top
climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree
this expedition reaches the top hal is in the lead with qualen just inches behind
qualen shoves hal forward
is this it
this is it
get out of the way
travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip
frantically rushes around looking for the case he spots a crater of snow rushes to it and starts digging
even below the snow the tracers blinking red light is glowing and visible
gabe laughs as he digs it out
has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor which shows the case is nearby
smiling this way
qualen shines a light all of them push their way through the trees
is excited now he cant even wait for qualens flashlight he intuitively races through the trees dividing his attention between his surroundings and which shows hes practically on top of
the case finally shoves his way through some small pines he can see the blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches
calling behind its over here
travers shoves his way through the branches and heads for the light but somethings wrong qualen comes up behind travers and shines the light on cute if hastily constructed stands
with a five pebble smile as well as douglas cap in a clearing
the still blinking still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman
the case is leaned up against it
travers runs over to the case furious and opens it
its empty except for a single bill
travers picks it up scrawled on the margin is lets trade
incredulous hes still alive
furious hes still alive
to qualen and the others he cant be far away spread out
qualen kynette delmer and krystel fan out into the woods each with a flashlight and a fun
ryan however straps on nightfinder goggles and runs out without a flashlight
to hal brandishing gun put your hands on your head
watches the chaos with a grin from a slightly elevated vantage point he can see the flashlight beams all headed in the wrong direction
but he doesnt see with these goggles light is amplified a thousandfold this isnt one of those infra red thermo blob jobs it looks more like day for night photography
even starlight is enough for ryan to run easily through the thick woods and hes going in the right direction
begins climbing down to level ground so he can circle closer to where travers is holding hal before he can get far looks up and can clearly see gabe climbing
down the small rock twenty yards distant smiles looking macabre under the goggles and opens fire is startled as the bullets impact inches over his head he jumps the last ten feet to the ground and is running even as he hits the ground more bullets hit where gabe was a split second ago chases gabe easily maneuvering through the trees runs too trying to dodge ryans continuing fusillades gabe knows this territory but to him its still pitch dark he stumbles and rams against trees keeps coming up behind closing the hap gabes bright form just ahead comes out of the trees and finds he is on another part of the summit
all thats beneath him is a sudden sloping plunge down a field of ice
no escape route here anything that goes down this slide is going all the way to the ground far below
is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets he dives to the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder the sole source of cover
kristel qualen and kynette having heard the gunshots are now rushing to gabes position almost casually emerges from the woods
he can see there is nowhere for gabe to have gone except behind the boulder
he walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world
fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the douglas exhibit an ancient flare that looks like a can of sterno
gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it it resists and looks like a dud but finally it catches and as it ignites gabe heaves it over the
boulder at ryan arcs over the boulder to fully ignite turning everything into a blinding agonizing flash of white screams putting one hand over the goggles trying to rip them off bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him instantly aware of what gabes doing blindly shoots fanning out in a semi circle as he gets the goggles off just runs straight ahead to ryan getting to him before the machine gun field of fire can intersect his path gabe tackles ryan as he manages to get the goggles off both men fall to the ground and the machine gun clatters away landing on the edge of the ice just out of reach ryan now recovered from the blinding flash pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at gabe gabe rolls away in time and gets to the machine gun grabbing it but ryan dives for gabe slamming into him the force of it knocks the machine gun loose it skips down the ice slope but the momentum of ryans hit also carries both gabe and ryan over the edge onto gabe and ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding down ryan face first on his stomach gabe head first and on his back both are in immediate agony because its covered with razor sharp irregular ridges both large and small that slice through clothing and shred skin as they pick up speed the edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred yards away ryan flails and screams as the ice gashes him from underneath gabe however manages to flip over and to the side he lunges on top of ryan and rides him down like a bobsled is coming up too fast tries to maintain his perch on ryan who is screaming and not yet used to the idea of being a human sled he isnt remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride gabe frantically reaches behind to ryans wrist to get the ice axe trailing from a wrist strap but ryans arm is thrashing away threatening to toss off the axe qualen kristel and kynette arrive at the lip and look down incredulous gabe and ryan accelerating have almost reached the edge finally grabs the ice axe pulling it off ryans wrist just as they reach the precipice edge gabe loops the axe to his wrist and swings toward the ice with everything hes got the axes scythe like blade catches on the ice right at the lip of the precipice gabe is wrenched to a painful halt suspended over the drop as whats left of ryan still screaming shoots over the edge gabe unhooks the axe and gets another handhold
gabe uses the axe to climb further down the ice to some rock finding easier hand holds he quickly disappears into the darkness
look down ryans death scream is still echoing
qualen is furious gabe has escaped with the second case
to kynette follow him
kynette shines his flashlight below illuminating the long frozen streak of blood on the ice
gestures with light after you
the expedition has holed up here for the night travers and qualen look upset
things arent going as well as theyd hoped
kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending machine thats obviously empty
kynette saws at some camp food with a distinctive knife the handle is a set of brass knuckles
delmer guards hal who is bound and seated by the souvenir photo stand
well look at the bright side
beat at least youve only got to make the split five ways now
gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out from the wall obviously familiar territory for him
the ledge leads to a small enclosed cave
gabe takes out his penlight and shines it but the light looks dim
batteries are low
gabe pockets it flicks his lighter and goes in in the flickering light we can see that no one has been in here for a while snow dust rocks but
we should also recognize this from the photo seen earlier as gabe maggie and hals hangout
smiles with the memories then his face brightens with one memory in particular
gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and opens a rock lid to a hiding place
please still be there oh please gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half full pint of jack daniels
the first thing to go right all day
gabe uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot
peace at last
gabe smiles and leans against the wall closing his eyes but hes startled instantly by a screech gabes eyes shoot open an aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor
gabe grabs a rock and clobbers the rat off screen ending the screeches with one blow
gabes face first registers disgust then an idea
then real disgust
sighing gabe pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade
gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass properly skinned and butchered off his knife blade
we can see from flickering shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave we pull back to see which is built out of small bundles of bills
its safe to say that something like is going up in smoke and the fires dying down
gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on the flame
gabe cools the knife in some snow saws off a rat leg and chews unhappily
mouth full mmm
just like chicken
gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of jack daniel
its going to have to last him
he has an entire rat to get through
the first rays of the sun start to poke through the mountains
its stopped snowing the storm seems to be letting up
very quiet in here
frank is snoring slumped over the radio
maggie is wide awake and obviously hasnt slept her attention is fixed out the window
the gauge is still flying around but clearly shows that the winds are slowing
wright is coiled at his desk tense
ten empty styrofoam coffee cups and dark rings under wrights eyes make clear he hasnt slept
wrights assistant bursts in
weve got a fix on the plane sir were getting a reading on the flight recorder tracer any visual
any radio contact
not yet heading to the door get the copters ready
we take off in three minutes
the winds are still too strong sorry to hear it
were still going
the plane might be intact
wright drags the protesting davis out the door
sir shut up
that fifty million isnt coming out of my pension
travers qualen and the rest of the expedition head out of the shack a little groggy
odds are no one got much sleep
travers shoves hal toward a sketchy you are here map of the mountain range and hands him the tracer monitor
still interested in staying alive
hal matches the monitor to the map the blip is higher up
pointing to map its up here
somewhere on the tower
theres a way to cross over to the top in about half a day
travers shoves hal forward the others follow
from about fifty yards off someone watches hal lead the gang away from the shack
theyre heading toward the opposite edge
an easy way down
are crouched in the woods
brett gun in hand has no idea how far out of his league he is
evan looks like hes having second thoughts but he cant hack down now
ill cut around this side and wind up in front
you come up behind them quietly
and weve got em
brett theyve got five guns and you can collect them all after i get the drop on em
lets get moving
brett automatic held high circles off through the woods
evan reluctantly lopes off toward his assignment
gabe pulls his jacket on reversed with the grey lining out so the orange wont make him so easy to spot and starts out towards the facing tower his route
clearly is going to be along the rock wall
its relatively sheer but there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy
races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with hal whos guiding the hang
brett circles around ahead of them waiting
before he can jump out hiding ahead in the trees and rocks
makes eye contact with brett realizes what hes doing and shakes his head as violently as he dares no dont gives hal a confident wink in response then pounces in
front of the gang gun held high
end of the line
travers delmer kristel and kynette are startled but dont immediately comply
this throws brett off his stride
nervous now you heard me
drop the guns
travers smiles and steps closer to brett
the others walk up in front of hal
travers actually laughs
end of the line
beat youve got style
so im going to give you a three count to figure out how to turn the safety off
brett doesnt even look down he responds by firing a short burst over travers head
ive got one of these at home
now drop em
all drop their guns brett unfortunately realizes at the same time we do hey wheres the other guy shouting brett behind you
too late brett can only twist around half way before easily mows down brett with his machine gun riddling him with at least thirty rounds at close range
brett falls dead into the snow
qualen walks up to bretts corpse blood steaming in the reddening snow and kicks it over
gabe reacting to the sound of the machine gun fire climbs up but theres nothing he can do and the others pick up their guns
turning to face hal time to travers sees that hal is gone hes escaped in the confusion
runs like his ass is on fire and practically collides with evan who is more panicked than ever
what are we going to do you came up here to jump the spur pulls evans chute out of his pack thisd be a great time to do it
panicked but quick listen they dont know youre up here ill draw their fire youve got to make the jump and get help
i dont i uh exasperated grabs chute unless you want to do it the other way around
evan snatches the parachute and runs off
hal wasting no time runs in the opposite direction deliberately making as much noise as he can slapping branches stomping on rocks
runs into the woods qualen and kristel hearing hals noisy retreat run after him
but travers stops for a second he has spotted in the snow not unlike a neon arrow
runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the gap between him and who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time its not
evan closes one of the three buckles but bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him in the meantime get behind hal in a clearing kristel fires
over his head
hal caught again freezes in his tracks
is still up and running he dodges travers fire weaving through trees getting the second buckle closed he sees the edge just ahead and puts on an extra burst of
speed does likewise still firing his clip runs out but this only buys evan an extra few seconds is a rock formation that just out like a diving board evan runs like hell to the edge of it is right behind him and has slapped a fresh clip in place but before he can shoot dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle is directly below a few hundred feet looking up he thinks evan has made it but throws himself down aims quickly but carefully and fires twenty rounds towards evans falling figure evan laughs he hasnt been hit come on wait till youre out of range dont pull it yet several seconds pass evan is now several hundred feet down and apparently out of firing range stops firing but doesnt seem unhappy at all
laughs more and pulls the d ring the parachute billows open inflating which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack as quickly as it inflates it deflates through
dozens of holes whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy collapses
exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the chutes guide lines but the more he does this the faster the chute caves in he screams as the chute
finally gives way and plummets right past who is powerless to do anything but watch falls the long full five thousand feet desperately uselessly pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until hes tangled in it like a shroud turns away he cant watch evan hit bottom he grimaces and looks up with absolute hate at who doesnt see gabe hes laughing at evans desperation which ends as his death scream is cut off
hal is led over to the spur with the other gang members behind him
hal looks as angry as gabe
was that walker
no such luck
to hal smiling cheer up
everyone should die in a spot this beautiful
who has heard this and is shaking with fury
quietly dont worry
on top hal reluctantly leads the gang away below we can see gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges
winds or not maggie is untying the helicopters rotor from the bolts on the helipad
frank who has obviously just awakened rushes out of the station
maggie what are you doing im going to go nuts if i sit here one more hour
still a little breezy out mag maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor
over engines whine you coming
frank hesitates but climbs in the other side
the helicopter lifts off and heads toward the mountain range
the next obstacle hal is leading the gang through is a buttress a large stark boulder formation that lays between the mountain theyve just come from and the nearest mountain
to it the tower
this is lower down from the summit its solid and treeless
hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they climb in single file up to the top
terrain is flat enough that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours
hal leads the gang forward and keeps casting anxious glances back at them
and beyond them
travers notices this
forget about it
hes smart but hes not invisible
hal looks back
travers is right
theres absolutely no way gabe can come up behind them without being seen
where the bluff meets a tree lined plain
gabe in hiding watches hal and the others go up
no he cant follow them up the bluffs side without being seen
but gabe moves closer to the bluffs base gabe shoves through some trees to the beginning of a crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff
pulls out his ancient binoculars and scans the crack
starting with an outside view we can see that the crevice runs all the way up and through the bluff but its a zig zag not a straight line
picture a mine shaft designed by a madman
the crack moves upward then erratically to the side then straight up again
the width of the crack is uneven ranging from six inches to six feet
and thats just how it looks on the outside
theres no telling what the interior is like
gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack
its hard to see much its very very dark
but it looks as if the crack goes all the way through the bluff as well as all the way up it
on this route gabe can tunnel through the mountain instead of going up the side
puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack starting the long process of going up and through the mountain formation
a frenzy of activity as several dozen treasury agents sift through the snow for the wreckage of the ct some taking photos some taking videotapes some putting the pieces into
bags for analysis
many small bags
the treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash and its subsequent explosion there are few pieces here that arent charred and fewer still that are any larger than
a paperback book
unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering up the plane to a harried crash specialist from the faa ross stuart s who is organizing the debris
what can you confirm
well sir it crashed
that i can confirm
condescending weve been here just about one hour
these events take months to analyze
so if youll excuse me he walks away but wright pissed spins him around
no i dont think i will
the reason the faa pays you is to exercise your vast amazing knowledge of these events
so i expect you to come up with some stunning insights something a slow witted fuck like me hasnt already observed
gesturing to wreckage one it didnt blow up in mid air because the debris isnt widely dispersed
but was there a bomb on board that could have disabled it
pointing back two there wasnt an attempted landing
otherwise thered be debris to the east of the wreckage where the plane was coming from
did it come straight down
thats got me scratching my head too
gesturing back to wreckage and three the flight recorders tracer led us here in the first place
so where is the goddamn thing
that ones got me all aflush with curiosity
a little cowed youll be the first to know
oh i believe you
wright storms off as agents delicately handle debris
from this point you can see everything else in the mountain range
the only thing left thats taller is the tower a hundred yards away
between the two mountains lies a drop of a mere four thousand feet
hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge
travers approaches him furious
i thought you said there was an easy way across
you might not like it much
hal points a steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that bridges the two mountains
the same wire we saw at the beginning left behind from susan collins botched rescue
of course well have to do it hand over hand
seems i forgot my harness
hal is surprised to see kynette pull a harness out of his pack the one travers used earlier
disappointed hal leads the downward climb looking several hundred yards to running up and through the bluff coming out on this side
registers a thought will he
gabe is sweating straining in the dark climbing up thisd be a good spot to pull back and take in the view except theres nowhere to pull back to
theres about two inches of clearance between gabes chest and the rock and about the same between his back and the rock
to the right there is no light
to the left theres no light
even above there is no light because the crack isnt straight nature isnt that obliging it zig zags up
gabe is well within the mountain rock
nothing could be closer to being buried alive gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up he takes out his penlight and turns it on even this
dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the wall surrounding him up and down left and right is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that hes made a big mistake
i didnt need to see that
i really didnt
gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark
maggie and frank are flying low and fast over treetops and snow both are intently staring down is nothing but empty wilderness
but a buzzer goes off turn their attention to the helicopters heat scope which shows something alive beneath them
got em theyre under the trees maggie smiles and slows the copter over a clearing touches down
maggie is out of it before the rotor has stopped turning running into the trees
maggie runs into the trees headlong into that are preying on a body
a pair of legs are gruesomely sticking out from the feast
one wolf turns to snarl at maggie but frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster
frank aims high and fires twice to scare the pack the wolves run off
maggie goes to the body frank holds her back but she goes ahead anyway worried it might be gabe as she examines the body its evan
she stands looks up parachute failed
not unkindly damn fool
why would anybody try that in the middle of a storm
why would anybody try at all
sighs get the bag
gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now
he pulls himself up with his hands then braces his body with his back and pulls himself up again hes not looking up because he cant see anything yet anyway
naturally this leads to a head and rock collision
gabes head crashes against a new part of the crack as the passage thins out
he gropes up
the passage is narrowing to the point that he cant get through it
shouldve taken that left turn at albequerque
gabe backs down and starts to slide across the side
with his back wedged against the rear wall he uses his feet to push against the forward wall
zero visibility gabe cant see what hes shoving toward
there has never been light of any kind in here
blindly pushes to the side rattled by the difficulty of doing this in the dark
its just like any other side move you cant see where the fuck youre going thats all gabe stops and fishes out his penlight
turning it on its clear those batteries havent gotten any more potent in the last few hours
gabe shines it to the side
is fading fast
a matchs last gasp is brighter
exasperated puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on
garbled much better
gabe inches on to the side
looks up to see if the crack has gotten wider
gabe mumbles something phonetically near motherfucker around the flashlight aiming it up no opening larger than a mail slot still cursing still looking up still moving to the side he
gets the opening he wants but not where he wants it the crack suddenly drastically widens as he moves to the side since hes been bracing his back against the wall gabe falls out of control twisting around face down gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack
its now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself falls out of gabes mouth and tumbles down ping ponging from one side of the crack to the other as
it tumbles a long long way down even after the light is gone we can still hear the penlights receding clattering against the walls is now literally in a jam
there are no handholds no ledges and the walls are slick
all he can do is remain braced against the cracks walls until his already sore arms and legs give out
frank is now flying the helicopter a body bag is stashed in the back and maggie is in the passenger seat
motioning down bring it down here
maggie just do it frank
the copter touches down frank doesnt turn it off
maggie jumps out with a walkie talkie
frank makes another try
maggie this is dumb no it isnt
im going to find brett i dont want to have to talk to his widow too
fly evans body back to base ill call you when ive found brett
maggie runs off into the snow as frank lifts off
maggie moves quickly through the snow and it isnt long before she spots multiple tracks in the snow they lead toward and up the buttress
now shes really confused
but with nothing left to do she starts climbing up the side
as weve caught hal in mid crossing hes looking from whence he came the opposite side of the buttress where travers has a gun trained on him unhappily hangs high
above the ground from the harness kindly provided by travers kristel is waiting also with a gun trained on him
hal arrives and disengages the harness is pulled back
kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to qualen whos standing next to travers
motioning up im going back
look this part is nothing believe me walker should be coming up by now
kynette automatic strapped to his chest rushes back to the buttress summit
gabe is just as we left him
face down arms and legs pressing against the five foot gap of the tunnel walls
carefully gabe takes one hand off the wall gets out his lighter with the other and ignites it for a look just as the crack has widened below him its
wider above him
more important it slants at an easy enough angle to allow him to walk up
if only he can get up there
snaps the lighter shut pockets it and readies himself
gabe steadily walks up the vertical passage by bracing himself with one leg and one arm then moving the other leg and arm up
gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge where the crack snakes into a sideways passage
but there are no handholds that will allow gabe to get a grip and simply swing over and climb up
winded so much for the easy part
gabe takes a deep breath readies himself and shoves himself away from the wall with his arms pushes himself into a squat against the opposite wall hanging for a second
with no support at all and he springs from that all into gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts backsliding into the drop but he digs in with his boots and his hands
safe at last
gabe carefully stands in a crouch and starts heading up
kynette moves to the edge lies flat and looks down maggie is climbing up but shes still some way down and the hood of her parka has been pulled over
all kynette can see is what shes wearing an orange parka
smiles and hits his headset radio
hes on the way up
i could hear that jacket before i could see it
over radio then get the money kill him and get back here
into radio ill wait till he comes to me
kynette flattens out to wait maggie is coming up fast
gabe moves up through the diagonal section the crack is starting to go directly upward
gabe looks up its coated with snow but not too much gabe can faintly make out light shining through up there
knows the top is twenty feet away
gabe starts up the easy segment his back braced against one wall
is staring down intently at the climber below is now almost to the top sweating with exertion she throws her hood back
keys his headset radio again
into radio bulletin
the climber isnt walker its a woman
gabe wedged near the top of the crack is ready to dig through the snow but he hears the sound muffled and distant of kynette talking
gabe strains to hear a bad time to come up
maggie tired gets near the top and collapses resting for a moment her arms on the edge maggie looks up and is very surprised to see kynette standing over her
smiling his gun aimed down at her
rotten weather for a climb huh
aims barrel i have two questions id like to trouble you with
maggie stares up frozen whatever she was expecting it wasnt this
this first ones easy
do you know a man named gabe walker
breathless scared where is he
you dont know either
i am sorry
that was question number two
lowers barrel thanks for your time
as kynette tightens his finger around the trigger appears he completes his run toward kynettes back and kicks him over the edge goes flying over maggie his shots going wild
but he catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe halt after skidding down ten feet yanks maggie to her feet and onto the top
maggie gets a good look at gabe his clothes are slashed hes covered with cuts and coated with slime and dirt from the crack
he looks like hes just spent a week in hell
gabe doesnt react to her reaction he just grabs her hand and runs
chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge he fires and automatic burst at gabe and maggie
come on where
gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack caving it in gabe falls two feet into gabe has grabbed and is hanging from a rope anchored to
a piton on the edge of the rock
hes also glowering up at maggie a little impatiently
gabe rappels down the rope into the darkness
hesitates shes still getting used to the idea of being shot at woozy but recovered has climbed up he runs toward the opening firing his gun drops into the relative
safety of the crack and rappels downward
maggie reaches ropes end thirty feet down as the vertical passage again becomes diagonal
gabe is there waiting
reaches the edge of the crack and fires down into it bullets are ricocheting all over gabe throws himself over maggie to shield her
cant see what hes shooting at so he mercifully stops
seeing the rope he bends down to climb after them gabe reaches up and tugs gently on the rope twice which is tied in a standard climbers slipknot and comes
undone with a final tug the rope freed of the piton falls down but kynette firmly grabs hold of the end feels the rope go taut he yanks the rope down hard gets more pull than he counted on and takes a head first fall into the crack disappearing with a scream qualen has just arrived in time to see this looks over as kynette bounces past him a few feet away the rope goes slack in his hand as kynette falls below
in frustration fires a burst straight down into the crack gabe and maggie move laterally through the crack now about thirty feet from where they started so ricochets are a
serious but decreasing problem
the crack narrows from five to three feet
gabe edges maggie down into it and along a ledge moving to the side
off maggies look i like the outside of the mountain better too but gabe and maggie move along the ledge is still at the edge of the crack stymied
hes definitely not climbing down after them he pulls back from the edge
find a comparative point of comfort a toe sized ledge
maggie is moving ahead of gabe
we cant i need to stop
exhausted gabe braces himself against the wall
looks at maggie im glad to see you but christ i wish you hadnt come
qualen whizzes across the wire on the harness easily making it to where hal travers and kristel are waiting
dont tell me disengaging hes still alive
travers takes a couple of heavy swings at the connecting bolt with hals axe
qualen grabs his arm before he can take a third swing and looks at his watch
for another two minutes
gabe catches his breath
all this is taking its toll on him
it hurts just looking at you
still panting try it from this side
do you still have your radio
its not going to work in here
lets give it a try
she hands it to him im in bad need of a ride
keys it come in rescue unit hal is leading the expedition upward along a ledge the radio in travers pack comes to life
over radio come in rescue one travers stares daggers at qualen
qualen looks to his watch
the radio is reading gabe loud if not clear the interference of solid rock is garbling it
but we can see out the window that frank is now between radios carefully hauling evans body from the helicopter to the station on a collapsible gurney
no one else is in the station
over radio broken up come in frank gabe exasperated stops for a moment
is there anybody else on the radio
maggie shakes her head no
i take a year off and the department goes to hell
keys it come in rescue unit we can see there are three holes punched in the snow along the cracks top recognizably the part of the crack gabe and maggie
dove into but perched on the edge is a block of plastic explosive the detonator led races down has been punched in the snow at the center point of the crevices top another bomb has been planted there at the opposite end of the crevice has a third timer tied to a third pack of plastics qualen is staring at his watch but pointing the others toward the buttress
via radio come in frank over try to get thirty million in entertainment out of this because he is definitely in for thirty million worth of pain
gabes radio calls continue as qualen extends his arm towards the buttress and starts a silent hand countdown stage manager style five four three the led runs down is shattered
by a huge blast as the first bomb detonates the walls are pulverized near the top and cave in raining rocks further down towards who are hit by a blast of air booming down through the confined space gabe drops the radio maggie slips but gabe grabs her both slide down the crack out of control until it narrows to a three foot width and they stop gabe shoves maggie against the wall and tries to protect her with his body as the rocks start to rain down hal lunges at qualen but is held back by travers
you sick fuck dont worry
they may still be alive
that was the small one
frank stops wheeling the gurney and looks up at the far off blast and the smoke amazed
jesus thats some flare
rocks tumble down it filling it in and sealing it off is braced over maggie protecting her from the first round of falling rocks but rolling thunder in the crack
announces that more is coming gabe looks up as the noise gets closer the rockslide arrives the crack is filled in seconds with rocks and dirt packing it in gabe tries to hold on but is shoved down by the falling rocks maggie however is buried in the crack as it fills is knocked down to a point where the crack narrows he stops himself by jamming his body against the sides
suddenly its quiet
a little dirt whistles through but thats all
the cave in has stopped as its filled in the crack above
and maggie is in the middle of it
gabe unsheaths his ice axe and starts hacking up to get at maggie
dirt and rocks fall in his face as he digs another led is counting down from gabe frantically hacks at the ceiling of dirt rock and soil tumble down but
no sign of maggie
gabe uncovers one of maggies feet
is it too late
gabe digs up around her maggie realizes gabe is there she starts kicking
finally maggie tumbles out of the cave in gasping and coughing but alive
gabe catches her and brushes the dirt off her face
are you all right
terrified coughing why are they doing this
frank having lain evans body to rest runs back to the helicopter starts it up and takes off
gabe is leading maggie horizontally through the crack fast and furious looks up we might be able to get up that way theres an opening no there could be another
bomb up there even if there isnt we could get another cave in
the only sure way out is through the side
treasury agents sift debris as davis runs up to stuart
ive got something here
lets have it
theres an unconfirmed report of a distress call made from a plane that crashed
thats really really interesting but gestures around kind of old news dont you think
this call was supposedly made from a plane that crash landed
after it landed
waves it off sounds like they got it wrong
next time you interrupt my work make sure its something i can use
gabe and maggie cautiously move along a single ledge finally some light can be seen thirty feet ahead as they round a corner
smiling come on were almost out
the crack narrows and gabe straddles it putting his feet on the opposite edge to walk faster
but before he can go on grabs one of gabes ankles from below and yanks him down gabe tumbles painfully braking himself in front of bruised and bloody who has
survived the earlier fall and made his way out
his look is not a forgiving one
kynette smashes gabes face with a devastating brass knuckled punch falls back desperately grabbing at the walls to stop himself from going all the way down as he weakly tries
to get up calmly opens his knife and re laces his fingers into its brass knuckle handle
the gang and hal watch the mountain top with very different expectations and hopes their vantage point keeps them from seeing where the crack actually comes out
looks to hal you might say a few words for your friends this is the one that will bury them
ready to blow can only look down helplessly at fighting gabe is on his feet but kynette slashing at him with his knife is forcing gabe to back up the
crack is getting wider and finding footholds while crab walking backwards in the dark isnt east
gabes in a rotten fighting position as he has to spread his feet out wider as he backs up hes always lower than kynette
gabe throws a punch at kynettes stomach but theres no power to it
kynette hits gabe with a brutal knuckle duster punch gabe flies back several feet somehow managing to straddle the crack walls which are now four feet apart
kynette moves in for the kill
the led counts down but doesnt detonate
a green light starts flashing but the bomb hasnt gone off
kynette moves in over gabe and swings down with the knife but gabe grabs his knife hand and adding his own force to the swing imbeds the knife to the
hilt in the rock wall trapping kynettes hand in the brass knuckle handle
gabe stabilizes himself on kynettes trapped arm and gets a little payback three solid roundhouse punches to kynettes face he then climbs up his pinned opponent stepping up on kynettes
stuck hand as if it were a piton
qualens smirk is wiped off his face
the bomb didnt work
im not sure i set the timer qualen gestures helplessly putting the radio in hals reach
hal takes advantage of this throws off travers and grabs the radio
keying radio gabe its a dud but the second hal transmits detonates over the central part of the crevice and as promised its even bigger than the first the bomb
instantly blasts tons of rock down the crevice the rumble of the approaching rockslide is unmistakable gabe shoves maggie forward move
maggie doesnt have to be told twice she and gabe move out the narrowed crack quickly but under the circumstances this running looks damn slow struggles with the stuck knife
as the cave in knocks him off the wall and buries him instantly cover the last ten feet shoved forward by an airburst from the giant explosion they make it to the cracks edge at last but on the gabe and maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer wall the airburst has turned the crack into a wind tunnel its as if the mountain were trying to blow them out
hal shocked stares at the enormity of the explosion
qualen looks serenely satisfied
when i was seventeen i was a sentry on the east berlin boundary
there was a problem then too many defectors were managing to sneak through the wilderness to the west
a man would take them through every night of every week a man like your friend
beat he had quite a sense of humor
every time he got someone through hed radio us at midnight to let us know how many
eight more have been freed tonight
no one could find the route
it made me look bad
beat i looked day and night and finally i found it
i didnt tell me superiors
i put a charge there with a timer to trigger a radio receiver on the detonator
our friend made his radio report and i heard him say seven before the explosion
beat they pulled eight bodies out of the tunnel and i was promoted to intelligence the next day
hal stunned looks at the radio realizing qualen tricked him into detonating the bomb
travers grinning takes the radio from hal and pats him on the back
we couldnt have killed him without you
the force of the airburst as brief as it is strong is over
dust slowly swirls out gabe and maggie raise their heads
gabe looks back the crack is now sealed off
gabe takes a piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to maggie along with the rope
knock this in the side
make it firm
maggie does as gabe takes the binoculars out and climbs out on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall
gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall
its blurry gabe focuses the binoculars on the third bomb visible on the mountains edge
the led counts down but its partly obscured
all gabe can see is the seconds not the minutes that remain bad news
theres another bomb up there
weve got to move quick
gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below
until gabe swings the binoculars back
theres a lip ninety feet below leading into the wall
theres a cave down there
puts away the binoculars and swings back to maggie she lets the length of rope drop
its thirty feet long
not even almost long enough to get to the shelter
gabe leans against the crack wall drained
frank is in the air heading back out toward the range frantically working the radio
maggie come in maggie this is rescue one franks call is heard on the radio
travers takes it and takes charge
theres our ride out of here
everyone out of sight except you kristel
hands her radio make the distress call
youre so good at it
all scramble up towards the clearing
we can see what gabe couldnt the timer has about two minutes left gabe looks completely defeated
cant go up
cant go back in
cant go down
frantic what are we going to do
im sorry maggie
im sorry you got into this
gabe and maggie fuse together in a tight embrace a final embrace
but gabe opens his eyes as the rope still in maggies hand brushes his cheek
the end is frayed
gabes eyes light up
gabe breaks off the embrace and snatches the rope from her he pulls at the end and furiously starts unravelling it
what are you doing
davis has just filled in wright on the unconfirmed distress call
wright looks furious
he didnt think a distress call from a crashed plane was important
davis nods get me a fucking radio
flying over the mountains
frank is practically there heading toward the buttress and the facing tower
over radio come in maggie over over radio weak alpha charlie niner please help frank recognizes the pilots voice from the distress call
over radio i copy charlie niner whats your position over an aerial flare fires up leaving a clear marker
over radio sit tight charlie niner im right on top of you
gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber its three different segments wound together
the helicopter flies overhead and past
shouting waving frank
forget about it
he cant hear you
hands maggie some rope tie these together
realizing are you out of your mind this is rope from the gordon exhibit
the way guys climbed then theyd tie on three at a time this ropell take around nine hundred pounds
gabe this rope is sixty years old misses the point yeah they made it pretty good then
each of these strands ought to hold about pounds before snapping
gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton maggie works on the third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of what she and gabe weigh together
dazed ought to
beat will it hold
gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop
ninety feet of what looks like twine
depends on how big a breakfast you had
you want to go first
maggies stunned but theres no choice
she starts the rappel down and gabe is close behind
is ready to blow to make this even trickier they have to swing over to the side about fifteen feet to get to the cave meaning they have to move
down in pendulum type swings that put even more pressure on which looks sorely tested at one knot its coming undone they swing down lower twenty feet to the cave four thousand to the ground they reach the end of the rope six feet above the cave and fifteen feet away laterally
shouting swing towards it and drop
maggie nods they start the swing over as they get over the caves lip snaps fall landing roughly on the caves narrow lip gabe starts to slip over but maggie
pulls him back as the bomb detonates and starts raining debris an instant massive rockslide dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past exhausted they collapse on the cave floor
frank obviously is surprised by the nearby explosion
what the fuck but he sees kristel in a clearing
face down in the snow
first things first
frank lands near her and rushes over to her
frank turns her over and breaks a capsule under her nose
she wakes up with a start and looks terrified
what who are dont worry
im here to help
recovered glad to hear it
kristel sees the snap is off franks holster she grabs it spins it around and pulls the trigger
frank grabs her wrist with a move faster than youd expect from him and he yanks the pistol back
first chambers empty aims gun the rest arent
forgive me but things have been a little strange this morning
nearby the helicopter radio crackles to life
frank backs toward the helicopter keeping the gun trained on kristel
but frank only gets to the helicopter door before comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into frank
frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he can even get a shot off
travers runs over to delmer and shoves the barrel up
explaining youll damage the helicopter
as if to punctuate this frank and the now ruined pilot side door fall to the ground
the radio continues to squawk as travers grabs franks discarded gun
to kristel answer that
kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio
over radio calling rocky mountain rescue come in rocky mountain rescue over keying radio rocky mountain rescue one over wright davis and an irritated stuart huddle over a radio
this is ross stuart federal aviation administration please identify over by now the others have come out of hiding and up to the helicopter
kristel grabs some papers from a plastic packet on the helicopter seat and keys the mike
this is margaret deighan rocky mountain rescue
over we have an unconfirmed report of an air crash in your area and a distress call on this frequency can you confirm over keying mike copy faa
distress call came at approximately eleven hundred hours yesterday
i investigated the call turned out to be a false alarm
stuart gestures with exasperated triumph
please repeat rocky mountain rescue distress call was a false alarm
over over radio repeat distress call was a definite false alarm weve had several here
somebodys sick idea of a joke
do you require further assistance over not from you
thanks rocky mountain rescue over and out stuart shuts off the radio with finality
i dont want to say i told you so
but i did
can i go back to work now
kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket
i almost believed you myself
travers smiles and turns looking at trembling with fury and grief bent over franks body as the last trace of vapor his breath trails from his lips
hal gently closes the eyes of his friend
quiet goodbye frank
travers moves up behind hal and kicks him
time for number three
unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere
low fuck off
travers kicks him in the face knocking him into the snow
i think ill wait here
you just murdered three of my friends
sooner or later whoevers chasing you is going to show up and return the favor and id love to watch
travers puts his gun at hals forehead and shrugs
you see we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government one of whose members i know has zero imagination and i can tell you the
cavalry just isnt going to make it by this week
beat no youre taking us where we want to go
because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch
you want to kill me more than anything even more than you want to keep on breathing and with a little more time you pray youll get that chance
tightens trigger am i right
hals answer is a stony loathing stare
he gets up
but we can see hal has palmed something from franks body
dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening but the worst is over
gabe rolls maggie over carefully
are you okay
my ears are ringing but im all right
gabe whats going on
shows money in his pack this
that plane crash its a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks but dumb enough to drop it all over the range
theyve got hal as a bird dog and right now theyre heading for the rest of it
its close to the lake hals probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it
stiffly gets up i can get there first all i have to do is make it along the north wall to the bitker ladder all
jesus gabe what do you expect to do then
aching something subtle
gabe lurches towards the cave opening looking more like quasimodo than a champion climber
maggie stops him
im going with you
youre climbing back down try to get to the station or find some help
im just as good a climber as you are and right now im definitely in better shape
hard and youre definitely not going maggie stares gabe down
guess who won all the arguments when they were together
gabes face is a portrait of familiar exasperation
come on as they move out of the cave together gabe favors one foot
but the second you slow me down im leaving slips on sore leg maggie catches him im leaving you behind
helping gabe out anything you say gabe
if you have a good imagination this corner of charcoal looks like it could have been one of the currency cases
are standing over some of the wreckage
one of the suits bags and tags the briefcase
weve tested the ash inside its the right paper
what about the men
its hard to tell
but forensics says yes
all of them were in the plane
sags with the news everythings accounted for then time to head back and start making excuses
beat fifty million bucks up in smoke and i just dont give a shit
its one more run of the press
but we lost five good men and they arent so easily replaced
beat especially a guy like travers
dedicated agent travers leans in reasonable comfort against the helicopter and keys his headset mike
how far along are you
over radio not as far as wed be with the helicopter
qualen kristel and delmer follow hals lead down the side its not too steep a grade but its solid rock and its covered with ice and fresh snow all have
to brace themselves with their hands to keep from slipping down
over radio we have less than half a tank of fuel eric if we burn it up treasure hunting well never get off this rock
now how far away are you
keys radio it looks like two miles but qualens foot slides out from under him he catches himself
itll take some time
over radio time we have walkers dead wrights an idiot
and our guide keys radio what about him
over radio as soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity kill him
keys radio agreed
can only hear qualens end of the conversation but his face shows he can guess what theyre talking about
gabes rattled too but for a brand new reason we pull back to see gabe at where the wire that wire links the buttress with the facing tower
whipping in the wind it looks risky but thats not the problem
gabe stares at the other edge for a moment
remembering susans death
gabe shakes out of it when gabe
beat ill go first
shakes his head if i dont go first i might not go at all
gabe hooks his ankles over the wire and starts dragging himself hand over hand across the abyss no safety line this time
as his weight pulls the line taut the wind rocks him back and forth
gabe steadily drags himself out fatigue stops gabe in the middle a half mile up strung between two gigantic mountains he looks as insignificant and alone as a man possibly
can be panting with exertion frozen he can barely hold his grip and has an elbow crooked around the wire for support
gabes eyes are shut he looks near collapse gabe is falling from the wire in slow motion trailing susan she spirals out of reach as his line snaps him back
grip unconsciously relaxes but his eyes jolt open and he clamps both hands shut on the wire
gabe drawing on some inner fury drags himself with long sharp yanks tensely watches gabes crossing is about ten feet away from the end looks a lot further away than
that pulls faster and reaches the other side
gabe maintains his hand grip and swings his feet onto the ledge leaning back against the wall to catch his breath
winded shouting across think you can beat my time
smiles this is more like the gabe she remembers
she gets on the wire and starts across in a fast easy rhythm
watches her grinning
admiration for maggie is washing away bad memories of susan
to himself shit she is in better shape
maggie pulls across fearlessly but on gabes side of the wire is giving where travers had hacked at it just a millimeter but its pulling loose doesnt notice and shouts
across at maggie now half way
enjoying it now quit sandbagging it i havent got all day is coming looser maggies quicker crossing is thrashing the wire and straining the bolts weakened anchoring who is now
twenty feet away fifteen ten five pops out of the wall as if it were shot which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm maggie stunned and without options lets go two feet short of the ledge drops low just as maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out towards hers in one lightning fast motion catch maintains his grip on maggies hand but her weight nearly pulls him off the ledge maggie drags him down the window goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledges bottom but their grip holds
all of this in a split second
maggie hangs from gabes arm locked in terror but skill wins out over fear
she finds a handhold with her free arm and climbs up to the ledge with gabes help
maggie collapses into gabes arms and they fall back against the wall but gabes the one whos really holding on tight
that tears it
gasping youre not coming any further
just as breathless gabe youre going to get yourself killed breath almost back maybe
but im not getting you killed
she starts a reply look maggie
i dont know whatll happen when i catch up with hal but ive got to know one thing for sure that youre making it off this mountain
gabes eyes are pleading
but gives in
gabe lightly kisses maggie he doesnt want to turn this into a farewell kiss afraid that thats really what it might be
they stand and separate
gabe moves away
get on the trail and stay out of sight
beat ill see you on the ground
maggie wonders if she will as gabe vanishes around a corner
as the zipper is pulled down before we can see anything we mercifully reverse pov to near a helicopter look down with disgust
davis turns away
i give up
what was it
a search pilot zips the bag back up
id says this used to be your pilot
beat and we found him seven miles east of the wreck
davis and wright look at each other drawing the same conclusion
beat the plane was hijacked
son of a bitch oh give me a break
your pilot lost it when the flight started going south and he bailed excuse me but theres no parachute there
check it yourself
before this can go on a forensics agent runs up to stuart carrying a recorder
sir we found the flight recorder it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater
it was demolished but we salvaged the recording grabbing it away ive heard a thousand of these wright whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the
lords prayer and wind up screaming oh shit at ground zero stuart clicks the recorder on with a flourish but his smug look melts as the voice of fbi agent matheson explains shouting rushed the moneys been stolen travers and the pilot were in on it the pilots dead but travers took the cash and made a mid air transfer to a jet flown by qualen controls wont respond screaming shiiiiii matheson is cut off by the sound of impact which is followed by silence
wright gently turns the recorder off
guess were both right stuart
thanks for your expertise
turns to pilot well
jerking a thumb back youll be waiting till groundhogs day for him to pull his head out of his ass lets get it in the air
wright davis and the pilot scramble into a helicopter stuart pauses but goes after them
thats a little narrower than your coffee table
its got irregular breaks causing it to go up or down several feet and gabe is jogging it leaping across the ledges gaps leaning toward the wall and away from
the four thousand foot drop
gabes gotten his second wind he keeps jumping from ledge to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity and with renewed purpose
gabe makes the last jump to a section of ledge near the bottom of which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable bolted into the rock running two
hundred feet to the top something left behind by a past expedition now a tourists toy
and the bottom rung is three feet above gabes outstretched arms
hasnt gotten any lower in the last year
coiling for jump bitker you cheap bastard
would another four feet have killed you
gabe leaps up grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile of air and he shoots up the ladder as we pull back a closer look at terrain seen
earlier fifty yards away from the ladder a waterfall is spewing out of the wall giving the appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak
as we track gabe up the ladder we can see where the waters coming from a whirling lake on top of the mountain
its constant motion keeps it from totally freezing but the lake is still coated with a veneer of ice moving in thick chunks through circular currents on the surface
are negotiating the grade which is slippery thanks to the fresh thick snow we can see from their relative position to the lake that gabe has a lead on them
a very slight one
pulls himself over and starts running as he does he uproots a big x park service sign commemorating the bitker climb and takes it with him moving ahead into a
where gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope
gabe heads down towards some rocks and spots the third case which took a tough landing on one rock its shattered into halves and the bands of s are scattered
around in the snow
gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the cash soaked by the snow theyve frozen into ice bricks
as gabe stuffs them into his pack hes startled by something coming over the rock gabe whirls around to face thats landed in the snow and looks a lot more
frightened than gabe was
gabe leans back relieved
are closer now but as they move down hal freezes in place as he sees the bitker sign some distance ahead
the sign is out of place
a signal from gabe he is alive
qualen and the others check the monitor
hal takes the opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly subtly wedge something into a crack behind his back is what hal lifted off franks body a
speed load cylinder from a revolver with six fresh bullets in it
checks the monitor the relative position shows theyre almost there
but qualens grin is wiped away as he looks down at the tracer blip is moving fast away from their position
face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage
all eyes are on the monitor hal at the rock formation has one hand behind his back
shakes a box of matches from his sleeve he slides a single wooden match halfway out of the pack and ignites it with his thumbnail moves away from the rock
to draw their attention from what hes been doing oh no you didnt lose another one did you
delmer clicks off his safety and aims at hal qualen runs into the woods guided by the monitor kristel follows
delmer backs hal up at gunpoint
hal deliberately moves in a semi circle putting delmers back to the rocks
what about him
over his shoulder kill him
delmer grins as he aims at hal
tell me where would you like the first half dozen shots to go
has burned more than halfway down to the rest of the box which is behind the speed load cylinder hands up as long as youre taking requests how about the
base of your spine
delmer smiles and starts to squeeze the trigger hal tenses up its now or never burns down to the box igniting all the matches as there is the sudden sound
of six distinct consecutive gunshots behind him the fires blasted the powder in all the bullets
delmer startled spins around and fires up fires down fires across by the time he realizes no ones there and he turns back around to find hal is gone vanished
into the woods
through the woods up a slope around a tree down another slope his eyes fixed on the screen and the blip thats zig zagging just ahead of him
tagging headset radio travers
get down here
is trying to repair the helicopter door when the call comes
have you found the money
travers furious flings the door aside jumps into the copter and starts the rotor
is running alone following the monitor lead until he sees a band of s in the snow
sure hes on the right track qualen picks it up and picks up his pace too
but we can see that behind him and higher up who is on a rise behind a rock watches qualens futile pursuit from a distance amused
amused until you would have lived longer if you werent such a smartass
gabe spins his head around and his temple smacks into kristels gun barrel
you telegraphed this kind of stunt with that joke snowman
too bad for you were not all gullible
kristel starts to squeeze the trigger
good thing for qualen you are
pauses wary what do you mean
when he comes back hes going to shoot you and the other guy grab the money and take off with travers
squeezing trigger again no sale
say night night talking fast he already blew up one of your pals in that crevice
and ive been in that copter
it goes a hell of a lot farther with two people than with four
beat am i wrong
give him a buzz
kristel eases back with the gun
youve got my attention
youve also got all the money
and i can show you how to get off the mountain with it
tears into a clearing trying to put some distance between him and delmer as soon as hes out in the open though thunders over hal travers fires down at hal
through the doorless pilots side
bullets kick up tufts of snow at hals heels as he runs down into a steep sloping wooded area
the tree cover is too thick for travers to take good aim
looks like temporary refuge but travers finds a new use for the search copters heat scope using the blip that betrays hals body heat as a guide travers can still
fire down through the trees at whos still running down the grade he hasnt been hit yet but theres an awful lot of bad luck in the air banks the helicopter around and up for another pass
is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip which is turning back around and heading towards him
qualen aims his gun and waits but at the top of the hill that spooked gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious sniff
it has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency band
furious qualen fires at the rabbit it safely speeds away as qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns around
on the heat scope
the blip that represents hal vanishes
delmer who has caught up is at the edge of the tree lined area he looks up at travers
keying headset radio hes hiding twenty yards in be careful
replies beeping twice on the headsets ear button as he moves downhill into the woods closely following hals tracks they lead up to the replanted bitker sign
just big enough to hide behind
delmer smiles and advances toward the sign and looks behind it
nothing but a mound of snow
delmer looks again to the tracks which lead toward also big enough to conceal hal
delmer moves toward it as the mound of snow shifts as hal climbs out silently shaking off the cover the snow hid him not only from delmer but from the
heat scope as well hovers overhead watching delmers blip on the heat scope but hals blip returns rushing ahead keying headset radio hes right behind you
whirls around at the warning his gun blazing but hal is too fast he swings the sign like a club knocking delmers gun away into the snow
before hal can swing again delmer brutally punches hal in the face stunned hal drops the sign travers cant do anything now but watch the heat scope as if it
were a video game now its just one big blip thrash around in the snow pummelling each other hals getting the worst of it as delmer manages to get on top of him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face
ready to end it delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his front pack strap but he has trouble unfastening it
hal rallies with a solid punch to delmers face
hal gets delmer off of him and follows with two more
delmer is knocked away landing on the sign board but clear from hal another chance to get the bolt gun off hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its
post before delmer can move off the signs board hals running forward
shoving the sign ahead of him with delmer on top hal lets go and the sign with delmer sleds downhill on the hard packed snow can now see one blip
moving quickly away from the other into radio somethings moving fast down the hill is it tucker
has found delmers fallen headset radio and put it on
over radio answer me
is it tucker
hal smiles and beeps twice affirmative
happy at last travers takes off after the blip flying down the incline and staying just above the trees strafing an intense fusillade at whos screaming as a storm of
bullets rip through him and the sign and the surrounding snow keeping pace with his downhill slide fires until his clip is empty he heads for the end of the tree line as his target comes out skidding to a stop in the snow
travers gleefully moves lower down for a closer look but is shocked to see delmers highly perforated body rolls off the sign as it finally skids to a dead halt
who is apoplectic hes just shot one of his own men
over radio thanks loads
beat i couldnt have killed him without you
travers looks down at the heat scope blank
is hiding his body heat under a rock formation
stymied travers furiously banks it away from the wooded area and circles around the mountains other side
gabe hands on his head moves down a slope near a mountain edge ahead of kristel whos aiming her gun at his back
how much further
stops its right over there
gabe nods ahead indicating what looks like a that is partially obscured by snow about twenty feet distant across a snowy plateau
its a storage locker for the rangers
everything you need to get off the mountain is in there skiis food ill show you gabe shows a sudden burst of enthusiasm and starts quickly moving ahead again kristel
suspiciously notices this dont move
kristel gets ahead of gabe and walks backward keeping her gun trained on him as she crunches through the snow
skiis food and maybe guns too right
moves backward keep walking
not too close
wed make better time walking straight ahead
qualens not going to be hopping down the bunny trail too much longer
walking backward right
so id better have one less problem when he arrives
knowing this means him dont fuck up
you still need me to show you a route off the mountain
youve worn that one out walker snaps back bolt ill find my own way down
kristel solidly plants her feet firmly to shoot gabe but her feet sink through the crystallized snow cover kristel completely disappears down through the snow as it collapses under her
shes pulling the trigger and shots go wild as she sinks and sinks whos had to drop flat on his stomach to avoid the same fate as he scrambles back to solid land kristels shots arc up through the snow toward him and the snow crumbles around him but he bellies ahead as kristels gunshots slow and finally stop the very last of them loosening the snow around that was obscured by snow was a tall three sided park service sign shouting warning snowdrift do not cross in eight different languages
the rest of the snow falls away from it revealing a cautionary but cheesy illustration a stick figure fatally sinking into the snow
bellies ahead flat on his stomach testing the snow with the ice axes staff only when he hits something solid with it does he get back up to his feet
but the sound of ice crusted snow crunching above gabe alerts him that has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him qualens gun blazes down is on
the run but its that lead footed slow motion stuff that only happens in nightmares with every step a foot breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of snow gabe stays just ahead of the barrage making it into which is very temporary refuge qualen will be down in seconds
gabe looks down the slope
running is impractical
so he sits down
arrives where gabe was and looks down the slope is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position using his back and his shoes as gliders the ice axe as
alpinists call this a sitting glissade
colorado climbers call it butt skiing
some psychos do this for fun
is anything but fun gabe cant control his speed or direction well at all gabe barely manages to steer in and out of trees and boulders in his path starts
running down the slope he doesnt have speed but he does have the machine gun he fires short bursts at who tries to steer away from the line of fire gabe is hit in the shoulder he slides out of control and rolls down to the slopes bottom
gabe painfully lifts himself up and moves through the woods coming out of the trees to the bridge that spans it is ahead of gabe but there is nothing around
but flat terrain
its a beautiful sight but no good for hiding
and qualen is right behind him
rushes down to delmers body in the snow he finds the discarded machine gun and holds it up but stray bullets from travers fusillade have made it inoperable
hal tosses it aside and checks delmers bloody pockets for more weapons
just a couple of machine gun clips and the bolt gun
is wending her way down a hiking trail on the opposite side of the mountain
in plain view is circling the mountain he spots maggie from on high and moves down after her
hears the helicopter and turns around she has no way of knowing it isnt frank so she takes off her jacket and waves it as a signal frank
the helicopter moves down until maggie can see is at the controls
starts running but its useless
nowhere to hide
travers hovers over her firing ahead of her firing behind her not to kill just to make a point
hes in charge
maggie finally stops travers lands the copter and opens the passenger door keeping his gun trained on her
i know someone whod like to see you again before he dies
moves down to the slopes edge noting with pleasure the blood in the snow
gabe is wounded and hes left a trail as a bonus
qualen moves out lakeside nothing visible but the thick flat ice chunks circling in the currents
but gabes footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge
qualen starts to run across the bridge but stares down the blood and slush from gabes boots end halfway across
smiles and shakes his head
gabe is hiding underneath the bridge in the three foot deep network of steel supports
qualen slows his pace staring down through the thin but visible cracks between the planks
grimacing shivering ashen from his wound and exertion lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge
youve come a long way to die
enjoying himself slams a fresh clip into his machine gun
if you were smart youd have left your friend behind
i would have
theres no shame in staying alive
qualen stops staring down
through the gaps gabes parka is visible
right where the blood trail ends
aims down but youre not smart
and now youre going to die from an overdose of heroism
qualen blazes the gun into the planks is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being shredded by the
fusillade without the parka gabe is freezing and too many bullets are coming too close for comfort as they ricochet on the bridges supports stops firing and kicks away the planks which are a tangle of toothpicks at this point qualen bends down and sees theres nothing in the parka except for gabes back
qualens face registers anger and surprise as gabe appears at the edge of the hole before qualen can react gabe swings up with his ice axe hooking it around the
shoulder strap of qualens machine gun gabe yanks down and qualen falls head first with gabe qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a leg on one of the steel supports but both fall landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath the bridge gabe pulls himself through the girders to qualen and punches him with his good arm but qualen is unfazed neither are in good position its like a fistfight on a jungle gym qualen steadies himself to savagely punch gabe in his shoulder wound gabe yells in pain and tries to block the next one but qualen punches him again and gabe lets go of the support falling on the way down gabe grabs qualens leg with his good hand too low to grab the bridge gabe dangles just over the water raising his legs above it as qualen tries to kick him off gabe holds onto qualens leg and swings on it like a pendulum gabe twists the leg qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go both fall they land hard not in the water but on a raft sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the current
their weight teeter totters the ice as they get up theyre in danger not just from each other but from where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling
vortex that drains into the waterfall qualen and gabe circle each other like cautious boxers as the ice itself swirls in the current if either makes the wrong move theyll both go over
gabe swings at qualen but qualen throws a leg under gabe and stiff arms him down gabe hits the ice hard his chest hanging over the side qualen moves in
to shove him off but their combined weight on the same side of the ice starts to tip it over gabe viciously kicks qualen back gashing his face with his boots crampon as qualen grabs the ice rafts opposite side levelling it
wiping the gash stalemate isnt it
winded not any more
gabe still prone reaches out the chunk of ice with qualens machine gun is floating by
gabe snatches up the gun and pulls the trigger
nothing but an empty click
far more intimidating when its loaded
the chunk of ice with gabes ice axe floats by gabe gabe grabs for it but misses as the ice raft spins around qualen manages to snatch it up qualen
scythes it down at gabe slamming the blade into the ice as gabe rolls away is nearing the center of the whirlpool the current is faster and stronger here if it doesnt swallow the ice raft it will definitely upend it stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance qualen swings out at gabe with the axe
gabe ducks and tries to go low to hit qualen with the gun but qualen swings the axe down again whizzing right past gabe as it sinks into a crack
spiderwebs through the ice around the blade quickly reacts jumping onto another bed sized chunk of ice floating by landing on his stomach and braking himself by digging his crampons in just as realizing what deep shit hes in looks for another chunk of ice to make the same move to sees one just out of reach
qualen pulls the ice axe out of the rafts center to drag the other chunk closer in as he does the entire raft disintegrates under him qualen plunges into the
water and tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left but now at the center of the whirlpool qualen is drawn into the vortex struggles to his feet and looks down wincing qualens inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as he shoots down to the bottom of the lake and beyond qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the lakes tunnel drain blasts out full force hurling a still thrashing qualen a half a mile to the ground below
has no time to celebrate the chunk of ice hes on leaves him moments from the same fate
one more time around and its down the drain
gabe takes a deep breath
he leaps from one chunk of ice to the other running the way you would across stones in a stream zig zagging to catch the ones big enough to support
him only his crampons keep him from sliding off only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the ice chunks which shoots away from him in his wake lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge
no choice gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge supports his hand catches but its slippery and hes weakened gabe slides off but reaches
down and grabs him pulls gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge
gabes surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as hals
eyeing gabes ruined shirt nice outfit
hands him his parka i know you never liked the orange but didnt care for the smokey the bear hats either
thats why i quit
pulls on parka you all right
i feel better than you look
i can live with that
gabe looks down at the parka its completely full of bullet holes
hardly seems worth zipping huh
serious now frank
hal sobers shakes his head no
a cloud passes over gabes face
its not over gabe
travers took the helicopter
maggies hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopters roof
travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter
into radio qualen kristel come in gabe hears hals borrowed headset radio crackling he holds his hand out to hal
dons it keys it they cant talk right now travers
kristels busy making snow angels and im not sure but i think qualen is still falling
radio silence any messages
a moments silence then over radio gabe
keying it maggie yanks the radio off maggie and puts it back on into radio you wanted to make a trade earlier walker still interested
pause ive got the money
fly to the lake
and if you touch her travers cuts off the radio smiles and banks the helicopter down around the mountain wall
i have no fucking idea
holds qualens gun empty
smiling not for long
hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo clips he took from delmer gabe tries to force it into the guns stock but its the wrong
sagging against rail why cant anything be easy
thunders around the mountain wall getting closer have crossed the bridge near the mountain edge gabe now wearing his pack again nods over to the wooded area
stay over there look let me what throw snowballs at him
just whatever happens get maggie out of here
relenting count on it
beat and gabe
thanks for tagging along
smiles thanks for asking
i forgot how much i enjoyed rescue work
gabe limps toward the mountains edge as hal runs into the woods
blasts along the wall towards the lake the waterfall and the ladder are just ahead
the copter radio crackles from radio come in rocky mountain rescue urgent come in travers recognizes the voice frowning he snaps off the radio and banks the helicopter up over
the top tops the precipice revealing gabe standing on the end of a narrow spur it just out from the edge like a diving board
gabe has his pack on one arm the money is visible
gabe levels qualens emptied gun on travers and the copter this bluff is all he has left
over radio remember that bet you made
about whether i could find the money for you or not
holds pack over drop you won
travers helplessly flies in low tight circles over gabe and the spur if he shoots gabe the money falls too travers presses his gun at maggie
into radio ill kill her over radio you do and the spring thaws going to be worth thirty million bucks
pause no rush
im sure youve got lots of time
into radio all right
drop the gun first
into radio when shes safe on the ground
travers has no choice but to give in he gives maggie the handcuff key and she frees herself as he flies away from the spur touching the copter down on
the mountain top
to maggie get out
maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at gabe
she doesnt run
maggie runs for the trees
when gabe is sure shes safe he throws the gun away but keeps the pack suspended over the edge
into radio now come and get it
my arms getting tired
travers flies the copter up and over until he and it are five feet away from gabes position on the spur
gabe is buffeted by the copters wind but stands firm
travers levels his gun at gabe through the open passenger door as gabe heaves the pack in
travers doesnt even look down he just stares at gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot
shouting dont you want to count it
puzzled travers takes his gun hand and rips open the s are there but theyve been shredded by qualens earlier blast of gunfire
few if any of the bills are passable
stares down incredulous as he does rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt gun from his waist travers looks up and raises his gun at gabe
but gabe fires first the bolt imbeds itself high in travers chest
gasping travers drops his gun it falls over the pack and out the open door travers clutches at his chest dont spend it all in one place you son of
travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the helicopter it spins around and gabe has to instantly flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him
gabe looks down as quickly begins to spiral down in wide aimless circles travers has clearly lost control stares down coldly waiting for the crash but wont give up sweating bleeding he sits forward and grabs the stick seizing control of the helicopter again stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and up with clear purpose eyes widening with realization
gabe gets up from the spur and starts running back towards the woods several hundred yards from safety before he can get very far tops the precipice edge and sweeping
low over the snow it gets between gabe and the trees cutting him off watch powerless hes going to run gabe down ashen hyperventilating hes running on pure adrenalin and fury as he drives the stick forward is stiff legging it toward the edge of the mountain but hes too banged up to run fast through the thick snow with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes as he throws himself flat into the snow the front of the skid misses gabe by inches as it blasts over him moves out over the precipice edge travers banks it wide to circle back around for another run gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it into one of the ammo clips maggie stays back as he runs for all hes worth out into the clearing has circled back around stopping at a hover far back in the clearing travers intends to not just run gabe over but to run him off the edge as well lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge knows he has gabe nailed he shoves the stick forward flies forward skids just inches over the snow runs out to where travers is heading he lights the cloth in the ammo clip as flies past hal hurls the clip with its cloth fuse burning down into the doorless side of the copter the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit travers sees it and looks down but sputters out nothing but glowing embers in the cloth smiles nothing to worry about he speeds ahead as they slice through the top of the snow towards as he runs toward the mountains edge its just a couple of feet ahead but the copter is a couple of feet behind as the copter overtakes gabe dipping even lower into the snow he dives off the edge gabe is at the ladder he falls the first twenty feet of the long drop then grabs a rung on the cable ladder very painfully stopping his fall but in the same split second skid meant to impale gabe catches the top two rungs of the cable ladder caught in the rungs of the cable ladder the helicopter keeps flying out over the abyss but as it pulls the cable ladder it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place rung by rung still going full tilt the copter strains against the ladder thirty feet of it tethers the copter to the wall and gabe is dangling from the center of it
has one arm hooked around a rung hanging on for his life as the copter thrashes the ladder up and down travers is disoriented by the jolt and tries to
maintain control he doesnt see that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited it burns down to the clip and fifty rounds explode like a string of firecrackers travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne lead
shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes dead the rotor blades slow gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor if
it were possible for him to grip the ladder tighter hed do it now as the rotor whops to a dead halt the copter arcs down and slams against the mountain wall the skids are still caught in the ladder and it holds is shaken off by the massive impact he falls landing on the helicopter half in and half out of the cockpit
as gabe scrambles for a solid hold travers who has been shaken to the opposite side of the copter reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he took
from frank he aims at gabe one of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts slips now hanging from just a single rung and the impact of the slip makes travers drop the gun it falls out the open passenger door
travers scrambles up through the cabin to go after gabe who is trying to get off the helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the whole thing
goes down gabe jumps for the wall as travers scrambles behind him and as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two grabs hold of the ladder as plummets down but as it starts its fall leaps from the falling copter and grabs gabes leg gabe struggles to support both of them but travers weakened from his wound loses his grip on gabes leg he stares up in terror at gabe as he clutches gabes snow slick boot cheer up
its a beautiful spot to die
travers slides off and away travers screaming as he free falls trailing behind the helicopter we follow the entire four thousand foot drop until the helicopter explodes when it hits
the ground far below and the fireball engulfs travers just before he impacts into the explosion
looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion
but the whopping of another helicopter makes him look up has shown up a little too late to be of any help
wright davis and stuart look at the billowing flames of the wreck even from here the burning money is visible drifting up in the smoke
wright turns to stuart
im no expert but what do you make of that event
is drained from somewhere he finds the strength to lift his head up the section of ladder above him of course is gone he has to cover the fifty feet
of wall above him by free climbing
there are holds that look easy enough for him but leans back gripping the ladder too tired to move
just the thought of one more climb drains him
mumbling forget it
no fucking way
im staying right here
ive spent the night on walls before some of the best nights of my life have been spent lashed to walls before gabe can take this any farther a loop
tied to the end of a rope falls to a stop next to him
gabe looks up has thrown the line down
maggie is by his side
remember keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote even this action aches
too tired to shout fuck you hal and maggie draw gabe up gabe pulls some of his weight by using hand and foot holds but when he reaches hal and
maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul gabe onto the top
gabe unties himself and collapses into maggies lap
winded coiling the rope jesus christ you think you could have put a little less effort into that climb
i mean what have you done for me lately
hal ends his harrangue and looks over gabe has apparently revived because he and maggie are locked in the kiss of their lives
hal stands and smiles he walks toward the treasury agents who are scrambling out of the helicopter
hal starts an explanation thats going to take a long long time as break off their kiss
does this mean youre staying
