a small planet glows in the light of its sun
suddenly we hear a loud rumble and see a thick electronic mist behind the planet
then the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction
almost like somebody or something is eating it
strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic
it looks like pompeii must have looked as vesuvius erupted
the creature is kranix
we will meet him later on in a very different context but for now he is running from the ever growing mist that threatens to engulf him
as kranix runs another creature arblus calls to him
transform and flee kranix
you must warn all you meet of the horror of unicron
suddenly the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid
the mist threatens to engulf him too
he transforms into a small rocket ship and
he takes off
as we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious unicron
the planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out
the energy cloud surrounds it and
and when the smoke clears we get our first look at unicron
it is horrifying
a massive metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity
pan forward to show that this hideous planet is on a direct collision course with
there are two mechanistic moons orbiting the huge planet cybertron
but we are most concerned with a small greenish metal one
it is the year
the treacherous decepticons have conquered the autobots home planet of cybertron
but from secret staging grounds on two of cybertrons moons the valiant autobots prepare to retake their homeland
at first we see nothing unusual or suspicious
then pulling closer we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage netting and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons
this is the autobot staging ground for an assault on cybertron
dolly through the complex until we arrive at a command center where several autobots peer into monitors running constant surveillance on cybertron
he peers into a monitor
as he speaks we see the monitor pan to an area where a huge decepticon symbol is emblazoned on cybertron
every time i look into this thing my circuits sizzle
im tired of this waiting game prime
when are we gonna start bustin deceptichops
he stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion plans for cybertron
we still dont have enough energon cubes to power a full scale assault ironhide
then let me make another run to autobot city on earth
ill bring you back more cubes than youll know what to do with
he solemnly hands down an order alright ready the shuttle for launch
he raises a fist in a warwhoop
looking into monitor your days are numbered now decepticreeps
ironhide transforms and races toward a mountain which stands about a half mile from the secret autobot facility
jazz report security status
no sign of decepticons in this sector prime
what about moon base
jazz to moon base
pan up and through the sky to this is the second moon
it is much closer to cybertron than the first one
this is where bumblebee and spike are stationed
jazz to moon base
they stand together a communication console
spike is now years old
bumblebee looks as he has always looked save for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail i heart cybertron
i club decepticons
bumblebee and spike here
were about to send up the bird
any decepticon shenanigans in your sector
all clear jazz
pause hey ironhide tell my son daniel i miss him and tell him ill be coming home as soon as weve kicked megatrons tail across the galaxy
ironhide and prowl sit at the controls running a series of pre launch tests
will do spike
standing at the command center watching commence countdown cliffjumper
suddenly smoke starts pouring out of the mountain
then the mountain which must be made of paper mache or something blows away revealing the shuttle
suddenly the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of fire
as it takes off we realize this isnt any dinky shuttle but a massive ship capable of carrying all the energon needed to fight a war and an army to
the screen is bathed in smoke and fire which slowly clears
as he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance
now all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck
we see a bank of computers
suddenly a small tape deck pops open
a cassette pops out and transforms into
laserbeak who flies away unseen
the shuttle hurtles though a massive asteroid field
slow down ironhide
we want to get to autobot city in one piece
ironhide is at the controls
if i can dodge dececpticon rays i can sure as shootin dodge a couple of asteroids
suddenly there is a terrible bang
on the side of the ship and the two autobots are thrown from their seats
you were saying
that wasnt an asteroid
there is a blast of light and they turn to see
the most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a gaping hole in the side of the ship
then when the light clears a panel of the ship falls in and we see in all his glory
then he transforms to gun mode spins into starscreams arms and starscream fires
is cut in half by megatrons blast
as scavenger melts him down
eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for
an army of other decepticons including laserbeak who enter firing
while firing back are fused together
then blasted apart and fall in smoking glowing fragments
as they enter the now empty ship a number of decepticons flood past them taking positions and searching for other living autobots
this was almost too easy starscream
much easier oh mighty megatron than attacking the real threat the autobots moon base
youre an idiot starscream
were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base they could build another one
but when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy autobot city the autobots will be vanquished forever
fat chance megatron
ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto megatron who flings him against the wall
such heroic nonsense
a childs hands hold a scanner device which tracks a traveling blip across a star map towards a pulsing dot which represents the earth
the shuttle just zipped past checkpoint zeta
daniel a classic twelve year old american boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over sized boy scout compass
widen shot to show he is at an old fashioned fishin hole on earth surrounded by weeping willows assorted trees and shrubs and that his fishing pole is stuck in
the dirt the line floating lazily out on the water
lets watch ironhide land it hot rod
as daniel runs to small skateboard like device hits a button and watches it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it like a surfer up a steep grassy hillside we
change angle to feature
an adolescent autobot
he is in robot mode sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers looking bored with it all
talk about dull
then he tosses the rod into the water
calling excitedly hurry or well miss it
lopes up hill after daniel
if youre gonna ride dan o
ride in style
hot rod catches up with daniel scoops him off his hoverboard transforms to automotive mode and rides over crest of hill with daniel in the front seat
follow hot rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter of autobot city which becomes visible the instant hot rod clears the rim of a hill
as they travel we should also be getting a sense of what autobot city is all about
design note autobot city looks like a federal energy project gone mad
here the autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy
the mountain is covered with solar panels windmills spin in the valley oil derricks pump and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts
near all of these various things are energon compressors which turn the raw energy into energon cubes
in the background of these scenes we should see various panel truck type autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon convert to humanoid mode load up
their vans then convert to auto mode again and drive the energon into autobot city
in short it should be clear that the purpose of autobot city is to harvest energy
all the while hot rod and daniel are riding recklessly out from the autobot city and up into neighboring hills for an overview of the which resides within the bowl
created by the city structure and natural surroundings
let me out
why settle for a peek when you can see everything from lookout mountain
but were not supposed to go beyond city limits
kup a grizzled old soldier of an autobot is directing the positioning of a large metal road barricade
hot rod barrels through a sign which reads stop this area off limits almost knocking kup over in dust and wind disgustedly watches hot rod drive up the mountain
to sound like swearing cam bustin turbo revvin young punk
hot rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside and transforms back to humanoid mode
daniel rushes to a set of public viewing binoculars and peers into them
this is it
now take a squint through those babies
hot rod look
theres a hole in the shuttle
the hole megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship
hot rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out of his eyes
hot rods vision now infinitely better than human vision spots something truly disturbing starscream and several constructicons inside the ship
drawing his gun he starts firing on the shuttle
this is for ironhide
as sos this
rays streak through the hole searing
he ducks away from the door
standing behind a pair of decepticons who pilot the shuttle he turns to see
firing out of the hole
you imbecile our cover is blown
it was your stupid strategy
kup and the autobot construction crew watch hot rod shooting at the shuttle
whats that darn fool doing
hound looks up and points
suddenly it cracks open and decepticons shoot out of the wreckage like toys from a pinata
in mid air shouting to forces attack
he looks down and fires hot rod pulls daniel back as megatrons blast shears off the viewing platform which crumbles and falls down the steep mountain
putting daniel under one arm he pivots and kicks up at
hook and scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid mode
causing them both to crash against the mountainside which starts a
landslide which hot rod rides down the slope pursued by
whoooooooaaah blitzwing flies down in jet mode transforms to robot mode looks up at the slide riding hot rod and daniel transforms to tank mode and takes aim
amused come on down autobrat
as hot rod tumbles he covers daniel with his arms and tries unsuccessfully to slow his fall
about to fire when
kups arm descends into shot spinning blitzwings turret around
blitzwings blast scorches
who is flying nearby
transforms to robot mode and turns as
kup comes flying feet first into blitzwing knocking him off the mountain ledge
follow kup as he lands in front of hot rod who is just coming to a stop at the bottom with daniel
not bad for an old timer
gruffly old timer
thats something youll never be if you dont get back to the city
you know what we used to do with cocky insubordinate upstarts
interrupting save it
transforming into jet mode fires on them with laser bursts which
chew up the ground beside them
with daniel race toward autobot city transforming into vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them
megatron insecticons constructicons and other decepticon forces attack the city from the sky and ground
transforms to humanoid and runs toward
three new autobots arcee a lovely female autobot of about hot rods age springer a very muscular and bantering indiana jones type autobot and ultra magnus the large and soldierly
a cursory evaluation of decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficit
in other words perceptor
translating were outnumbered
he turns and fires from his hip
zooms in to strafe as
explodes on his wing tip
as decepticon bombs and laser fire pour in on the city
springer arcee transform autobot city
transforms and hovers in robot mode firing all around them as they
dive for the switch and pull it down
theres no escape
just then the floor of the courtyard starts transforming the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam trapping starscreams foot
as they make it through an archway which transforms into a steel shield as they run through he struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still transforming
in the nick of time he shoots a shoe horn like projection from his wrist and pulls his boot free then
the clam shape retracts completely and more armored shielding slides into place to cover where the courtyard was
he winces in mid air and flies away as the city continues to transform to a fortress below
the towers and buildings of the city picot and retract
withdrawing like periscopes turning and vanishing into steel shield coverings
as he flies over scene blasting this way and that shouting breach their defenses
who are trailing megatron attack the fast closing city trying to gnaw and devour their way through the ports and bridges leading inside
chewing on jamb of doorway near bridge delicious eh shrapnel
chewing on draw bridge to city a little heavy on the electrons
as kup and hot rod are racing down mountain toward the transforming citys drawbridge
the insecticons are in our way
theyre our way in
hot rod speeds up passes kup and
rides up and over kickbacks back using it like a stunt drivers ramp to
hurtle across the open space between kickback and the doorway into the city
as shrapnel looks up and reacts
kup hurtles up and over kickbacks back just as kickback is starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the bridge in the first place
kup goes sailing ot over open space between kickbacks back and the doorway into the city clobbering shrapnel who is in the way and landing on the city doorstep driving
transforms shutting down with metal shields with a clank sound as kickback and shrapnel both leap at is to
bite kup and hot rod and instead break their teeth on steel door falling face down with a grunt as last bits of city
as kup and hot rod roll in and transform where ultra magnus is waiting for them with perceptor
other autobots are moving into battle stations in the b
and alarms sound
daniel looks on in awe
sternly you can explain your security violation later hot rod
now man your battle station
i dont have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone
tugs him along roughly he said later
kup moves off with hot rod and daniel
the crows nest has windows all around and blasters seat rotates so he can watch action and broadcast battle reports like a top deejay
perceptor climbs up ladder into crows nest from lower level
as blaster speaks we see decepticons firing at the windows of the crows nest but the bursts explode harmlessly against the glass lookout and shout
explosions rock the crows nest
blaster swivels around and tilts to see
chewing on armor plating at the lower edge of the fortified transformed city
activates turret type laser cannon gonna lay some slugs on those overweight bugs
fires laser cannon
laser blast cooks out and we follow it off screen to
as a laser blast hurls bombshell up and out of sight and causes shrapnel and kickback to get sucked into the vacuum
perceptor joins him
joyful at his direct hit im talkin hits here autobuddies
hits with a capital aitch like in hard heavy and
sees perceptor hey perceptor whats shakin other than this fortress
blasts of enemy fire continue to rock the crows nest as perceptor answers blaster ultra magnus sends orders to contact optimus prime for reinforcements
cover your receptors perceptor
blaster transforms to ghetto blaster mode and broadcasts visible waves
rise and expand into space optimus prime
do you read me
the decepticons are blitzing autobot city
were really takin a pounding
dont know how much longer we can hold out
he is firing at armored door trying to melt through when he reacts to sound of blasters broadcast for help stops and looks up at crows nest
jam that transmission
soundwave moves forward and starts heaving cassettes upwards toward blasters crows nest position
as they transform and attack the crows nest
as he starts pile driver motion on crows nest windows first we crack the shell
then we crack the nuts inside
as blaster and perceptor see rumble and others and react
blaster stops broadcasting
we got cassette critters knockin on the window
as he cracks through glass and he and others swarm in and attack perceptor who tries to beat them away run blaster
two can play
as he spews out cassettes which transform into cubbie a lion stripes a tiger stinger a scorpion and bolts a small tough robot
as cubbie takes him down by the foot turning him over and over as he snaps at ratbat who screams and darts trying to escape as we move to as
bolts swats frenzy into stinger who jabs stinger into frenzy making him yowl and run
as they fight decepticons
you think you got through to prime
lets hope so
cause if i didnt were gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens
the city shows gaps dents smoking holes and decepticons continue to pump fire into it and get back sporadic return fire from inside as
megatron moves into shot and fills constructicons merge for the kill
where springer and arcee clear the twisted remains of autobot defenders away from a catapult like torpedo launcher
we see the mountain where the decepticons are getting ready for the final charge
megatrons making his big push and we cant even push
struggling to turn catapult around to re aim it back
arcee starts to push beside him
moves slowly as we change angle and kup hot rod and daniel keep at it springer lad
helps at hand
to hot rod together now
hot rod joins the others in pushing the huge catapult into firing position
also leans against it his small legs churning
starts moving easily now
pushing on the busted catapult
pushing manages to speak to hot rod
she likes him but doesnt want to go too far i was afraid youd be trapped outside the city walls
likes her too but tries to be cool and collected hey i wasnt worried for a micro second arcee
enjoying letting him have it then you probably didnt understand the situation
before hot rod can react kup steps back from repositioned catapult that did it
daniel at launcher port opening in pillbox through which the catapult will fire
kup hot rod
he points as they start linking themselves together into enormous devastator
as he rises up and starts firing hammering tearing away at metal shields which create armored walls of the transformed city
as they line up behind devastator firing into the city ready to follow devastator inside when he has torn the roof off
as springer loads torpedoes onto catapult like sling i got better things to do today than die
he fires catapult as it hurls flaming torpedo bombs one after the other out the launch port and we follow them to megatron and other decepticons waiting for devastator to
open the way as a succession of torpedo bombs explode knocking them aside some of the torpedo bombs strike
and explode harmlessly as devastator continues to grunt and tear off armored layers of the city
he grabs hot rod and kup and starts to crush them
as optimus primes space shuttle hurtles in
me grimlock love challenge
transform into humanoid mode and with grimlock at the front
fly out of the shuttle in wedge formation blasting in unison
in as they transform again and in dino mode swoop over to devastator
roars towards the dinobots
shakes the earth
buckling city walls menacing the autobots inside
hot rod and kup are released during the struggle
as they try to destroy devastator
their strength is more than matched and soon they are overwhelmed by him
prime stands outside the dented shuttle with sunstreaker and hound
as he talks he shoots at a swarm of decepticons who battle their way towards him
megatron must be stopped
the decepticon leader stands a hundred yards away vanishing and reappearing with the shifting waves of generic decepticons that charge back and forth
no matter the cost
optimus prime leader and hero of the autobots charges into certain doom
as he battles his way through the decepticons we hear an inspiring anthem of courage strength and triumph like eye of the tiger
this theme will reprise during the film when the autobots are battling at impossible odds
he charges headlong into the decepticon forces which separate him from megatron
decepticons fire on him but he takes the shots and
spinning and whirling like the sundance kid he takes a lot out
then decepticons attempt to block his charge and prime
like a powerback transforms to truck mode and barrels into them sending decepticons flying around like shards of glass hit by a
finally he is engulfed by an incoming swarm and it looks like his attack is foiled
as he commands his troops
their defenses are broken
let the slaughter begin
then he turns and sees
smashing through a wall of lesser decepticons
one shall stand one shall fall
his eyes blazing with hatred
why throw away your life so recklessly
dirge takes a sneaky leap at him
optimus stiffarms him with a shuddering clank
then turns him upside down with one hand and
drives him headfirst into the rocky ground letting him crumple and fall
thats a question you should ask yourself
hurls himself at optimus prime
both tumble into the walls of the city
denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to short circuit surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling electrical energy
ultra magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying several autobots
he and the others transform into robot mode and fire lasers at the decepticons
fighting their way to the battle of the titans
weve got to save prime
thats his fight lad
megatron attempts to kick prime in the throat
prime catches his foot twists it
and hurls megatron backwards into a metal pile
grabs a jagged spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at the steel spear pierces his side and sticks in him as
he charges megatron
dodging shots from megatrons gun to
deliver a huge uppercut which
lifts megatron into the air so high that
his head butts sharply against overhanging concrete balcony mashing him down
lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger from his boot turning and slashing at
as he comes for him tearing
a gash across primes midsection which spews smoke and sparks and
dropping prime to one knee
gloating farewell prime
as megatron hurls the laser dagger as we change angle to as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger on it tossing it aside as he
lunges at who claws his fingers and digs them into primes eyes ill rip out your optics
optimus grabs megatrons clawed hand in one of his hands twists it in see sawing test of strength which
optimus wins in a judo toss which sends megatron skidding face first through steel rubble in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city
he dispatches a decepticon and turns to prime
thats showing him optimus
knocks two decepticons on their tails and turns
finish him off prime
do it now
as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him no more optimus prime
grant me mercy i beg of you
as optimus prime warily moves out to look down at the cowering megatron keeping him in his gun sights
you who are without mercy now plead for it
i thought you were made of sterner stuff megatron
as he sees megatron go for the gun and leaps out to grapple with him out of the way hot rod
as hot rod grabs for the blaster megatron quickly gets hot rod in a headlock and using hot rod as a shield gets the gun and
his midsection now glowing and smoking a huge hole where the blaster has struck
firing blaster again and again fall
megatron tosses hot rod aside like a rag doll and stands above the dying prime
i would have waited an eternity for this
on your knees
as he gathers his remaining strength and smashes megatron with both fists clasped together
gasping painfully never
he bashes in megatrons torso casing fracturing the sides which split spilling wires fuses lights circuitry
prime falls to his knees tries to rise collapses to his side and falls slowly back
hot rod runs over to him
starscream and other decepticons stand over the smoking body
sarcastic filled with false sympathy how do you feel mighty megatron
he kicks megatron weakly clutching at starscreams hand gasping enshrine me
drops megatrons hand coldly calls to other decepticons take this scrap to cybertron
astrotrain transform and get us out of here
as he moves onto scene in humanoid mode showing battle burns and scars
then he converts to train mode and rolls through a crowd of generic decepticons crushing many under his wheels as he makes his way towards starscream
ramjet thrust dirge the constructicons soundwave and his cassettes et
run towards astrotrain
they fight for a moment then they notice their attackers are beating feet
the decepticons are retreating
prime did it
he turned the tide
he shoots o
who fight each other for a place on the shuttle
dragging megatron by one leg callously disregarding the way megatrons head and upper body bump and get knocked from dragging
fire after them closing ranks on the shuttle and pouring shots into the melee
decepticons make way for starscream as he tosses the nearly lifeless megatron into the shuttle and gets in
then standing at the door he kicks other decepticons away
astrotrain take off
the shuttle takes off leaving a number of generic decepticons behind who immediately raise their hands upon realizing that they are surrounded by autobots
as he lies on an improvised bier like platform a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and plasma bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound
emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker
is bent over prime in microscope mode examining him
he then transforms and straightens up his voice strained and cracking with emotion
i fear the wounds are
he cant finish what hes going to say and other autobots as they react
using remaining strength to makes himself heard autobots
do not grieve
soon i shall be one with the matrix
a flash of hope prime
looks off at prime his head is turned so all assembled can see
his eyes flicker weakly his voice rumbles with overtone of vast weariness and resignation reaches up with right hand with great effort ultra magnus
it is to you old friend i shall pass the matrix as it was passed to me
as he steps forward unwillingly mixed grief and surprise on his face prime im just a soldier
im not worthy
gasping nor was i but one day an autobot shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of the matrix to light our darkest hour
optimus prime is tilted into half sitting position by other autobots manipulating the platform as ultra magnus grasps his hand with great emotion voice failing pressing on with it until
until all are one
continue the struggle
sags gasps hanging on transfer the matrix of leadership
a distraught ultra magnus nods reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at optimus primes chest
then pressing a button on primes chest a small secret doorway opens and we see something extremely bright glowing in there
ultra magnus nearly blinded by the intense light reaches in and lifts out and holds it for a moment in his hand
the bright light which emanates from the perfect crystal seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot
then slowly ultra magnus moves it into his own chest closes the door and the light is gone save for a momentary and extremely powerful glow from his eyes
they are all full of great sorrow
all of his lights go out including his eyes
rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with electricity
dissolve inside unicron to reveal scenes of primes death and the passing of the matrix to ultra magnus playing on various monitors
some of the scenes are in slow motion others are sped up
the effect should be eerie
as it whizzes through the solar system
jettison some weight or ill never make it to cybertron
the ship is packed with living dead and wounded decepticons
starscream addresses them like an athenian orator
fellow decepticons astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden
in that case i say its survival of the fittest
so i hear a second on that
the ayes have it
a robotic hand flips a switch and chaos ensues
strong decepticons start heave hoing the weaker ones out into space
starscream picks him up and holds him up by the door
sarcastic oh how it grieves me to do this
wait i still function
starscream kicks him out
he shakes his fist
the last of the weak decepticons is tossed and the others dust off their hands
well as megatron has how shall we say departed
i nominate myself as the new leader
the constructicons form devastator the most powerful robot
we should rule
who are you calling inferior
nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you
the five cassettes buzzsaw frenzy rumble ravage and laserbeak pop from his chest transform and prepare to attack
hey nobody calls soundwave uncrazmatic
lets kick tailgate
try to form devastator but
quake the ship so hard with their pile driver arms that with the help of laserbeak buzzsaw and ravage they keep knocking the constructicons off
over the battle
i am a triple changer
i am worth any two of you
i should run things
death comes to anyone who crosses me
he attacks blitzwing
he is flying a very wobbly course past pluto
stop squabbling or were gonna crash
megatron and the other dented dinged and dead decepticon bodies float through space
we follow the wailing megatron and the others down to
littering the otherwise beautiful technological expanse
looking around who said that
i am unicron
i have summoned you here for a purpose
nobody summons megatron
then it pleases me to be the first
state your business
bring me the autobot matrix
it is the one thing the only thing that can stand in my way
you have nothing to fear
i have already crushed optimus prime with my bare hands
the point is he is dead
and the matrix died with him
it has been passed to their new leader
get it for me
why should i
whats in it for me
your bargaining posture is highly dubious but very well i will provide you with a new body and new troops to command
you belong to me now
i belong to nobody
perhaps i misjudged you
proceed on your way to oblivion
the mist appears and starts to dissolve megatron
pleading no no
i accept your terms
x ray images wiring circuitry etc
flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form changing from dented megatron to a huge new creation galvatron
ends in a blinding flash and galvatron who still resembles megatron laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches
his voice is deeper different from megatrons long live galvatron
and these shall be your minions
their bodies are turned from battered decepticons to
scourge sweep character is bearded fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been created he roars and stretches and an array of similar creatures smaller and all
wearing dark and matching uniforms are instantly created from others behind him scourge the tracker
and his huntsmen
cyclonus is created and then his armada of similar but smaller and similarly colored and clad creatures are formed
cyclonus the warrior
and his armada
he roars with a mad power rush gets into cyclonus who will be his personal ship and leading the armada takes off for the distant stars
loudly proclaiming over the scene bring me the autobot matrix
during unicrons command we change angle to show as galvatron and his newly created force fly up and away with great speed
i will rip open autobot after autobot until it is yours unicron
this is the closest thing the decepticons have to a throne room
it is a massive circular room with tombs of old leaders and a raised area where starscream stands
the decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his shoulders and thrust and ramjet at his side weapons held high but ready for action should anybody question starscreams rule
in front of him stands astrotrain holding a huge metallic crown over his head
in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure
preening get on with the ceremony
dirge and others react to eerie sounds and look up and off
starscream looks where others are looking and reacts
as they descend in hall of heroes and galvatron moves out to confront starscream who disrupts my coronation
this is bad comedy
megatron is that you
heres a clue
as galvatron transforms into cannon firing a huge burst on starscream as blast hits him
for a moment he retains his shape then piece by piece he falls apart
only a pair of boots remain on the floor
he transforms back to robot mode and confronts other decepticons boastfully
will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes
pan for their reactions as they ponder for a brief beat and then exchange looks they look at each other what did he say his name was
bit by bit we see new sections of the planet being generated
then the sinister mist we saw at the beginning of the film starts pouring out
hes about to do the big munch on
standing outside the netted complex looking off at
a strange loud hum fills the air and the ground heaves and shakes beneath their feet whered that come from
im more worried about where its going
on communicator device talk to me earth
we got a situation out here
autobot city is almost rebuilt and we see kup and hot rod working with other autobots to move large panels into position
in the background two huge space shuttles are almost completed and ultra magnus is directing the work
during this establishing series of shots we hear jazzs roger me
springer and arcee fit a hull section in place with daniel motioning to them directing the action
he reacts to muffled transmission from jazz
im pickin up a faint signal
blaster transforms to blaster mode and jazzs voice is broadcast loud and clear causing springer arcee and daniel to react this is jazz
i gi normous weird lookin planet just showed up in the suburbs of cybertron
and its attack
static obscures the message jazz
is covered by unicrons energy field and slowly seems to dissolve
a great maw works more intensely crushing bits of the planet
as quakes tremors and cyclonic winds toss and tear at all structures on the moon and the energy field closes in on jazz and cliffjumper who using handholds every step
of the way et into as unicron looms larger larger the energy field seems to dissolve the landscape
if we can
they get in and start retro blasters the flame of blasters whirling in wild winds as moon is engulfed
sounds of torrential winds quakes etc as moon is quickly becoming unicrons lunch
as it blasts off and away from unicron with an explosion
for a moment it looks like they are going to get clean away but
suddenly it is pulled deep into unicron
as moon shatters like a hollow egg and is sucked completely into unicrons maw which closes around it with a snap
no more winds
no more movement
how dare unicron
defiant cybertron and all its moons are mine
his body starts to twist making him writhe in pain powerless to resist but remember we belong to him
gasping for breath writhing nods i
will obey unicron
decepticons to earth
the torture stops and galvatron clutches his throat and tries to regain his composure as we
he has a portable communication device
spike and bumble can be seen on it
springer kup the dinobots blurr and hot rod look on amid general gathering of autobots
arcee holds daniel up on her shoulder so he can see
blaster is in b
its like a terrible nightmare ultra magnus
this thing this juggernaut just ripped the first moon to shreds
and its heading this way
well try n slow it down
but youd better get here fast because
suddenly static obscures the transmission
autobots prepare to board the shuttles
this new menace is more dangerous than all the decepticons put together
somehow we must destroy it before it devours cybertron
but what about my dad
hes on the moon between that monster and cybertron
daniel ill do everything i can for spike
and what are we going to do when we get there
if that thing crunches moons itll make short work of us
maybe the matrix can stop it
what do you know about it lad
its just a feeling
hot rod looks up and sees something
decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the autobots
to the shuttles
galvatron is in the lead
there is no escape
i galvatron will crush you just as the magnificent megatron crushed prime
and youll die trying just like megatron
ultra magnus fires laser and hits galvatron
you want me to gut ultra magnus for you
there are plenty of autobots for you
ultra magnus is mine
decepticons dive on fleeing autobots
as daniel looks up and arcee moves over to him protectively
hot rod looks at arcee in the same way she is looking at daniel
stay close to me daniel
to arcee and you better stay close to me
arcee pulls hot rod toward her before he gets hit by laser
no youd better stay close to me
blurr is trying to get grimlock into shuttle with the rest of the dinobots as decepticon fire comes in all around
grimlock is like a spooked horse refusing to be shut in the barn
pleading with him shoving him talking very very rapidly nice dino good dino sweet dino
wont you step into the nice spaceship for blurr
please pretty please
sticking head out past struggling blurr me grimlock not nice dino
me bash brains
he gives fire breathing blast at jets as they go by strafing the as grimlocks blast sets them all on fire and they spin into one another as we change
angle to as kup hot rod and arcee move into scene kup hot rod
get the dinobots out of here
as they run into dinobot shuttle retracting their entry ramp in
as he transforms to humanoid mode and shouts orders firing at blurr who blurrs past and then at arcee who also ships by no survivors
as hot rod squeezes past sludge swoop and slag to join kup who is already at control deck where grimlock sticks his head down to look out the window
kup shoves him aside
this reminds me of the battle on alpha when the petro rabbits were
annoyed grimlock get your noodle out of my face
starts throwing switches me grimlock love kups war stories
youre living one now
to hot rod engage the boosters for cybertrons sake
hot rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of switches all of which glow and pulse with the action
as decepticon fireball comes up and splatters against window sending tongues of fire running across the glass behind hot rods head you got em
grimlock still trying to stick his face in the control panel as kup works furiously and more decepticon fire hits the ship to kup tell grimlock about petro rabbits again
muttering using joystick ill give you petro rabbits
the shuttle lurches and shakes it takes off amidst a hail of decepticon fire
as they bank down toward rising shuttle far below
jets streak down toward upward rising shuttle as we springer springs onto scene with daniel ultra magnus and perceptor are guarding the entry ramp firing at decepticons
to daniel looks like were shipmates squirt
but if you get space sick youre gonna walk home
blurr blurs up ramp
arcee reaches the ramp as the shuttle takes off horizontally
as he reaches down for arcee
still going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the ground
just as the wind and gravity are about to knock her off she jumps up and
springer grabs her hand and pulls her in narrowly avoiding a barrage daniel is watching terrified
that was close
concussion of decepticon hit rocks the shuttle believe it or not this is the fun part
ultra magnus is at control deck with perceptor as they taxi for launch and we see oncoming decepticon jets firing at them no time to preheat
can this ship take it
with an accelerated ignition procedure the ceramic housings might create a magnetic flux
entering shot reaches in and pushes joystick forward he says go for it
powerful rockets ignite and the shuttle shakes with the sound
the shuttles rockets surge melting the pursuing sweeps as the shuttle hits the sky and soars upwards
cyclonus jets fire on it as we change angle on ultra magnus shuttle it roars up behind cyclonus jets and overtakes and smashes through them scattering them as it pulls
up alongside the dinobot shuttle grimlock is peering out of the side ports
gives the thumbs up gesture
including ultra magnus shuttle through side port as springer gives thumbs up signal in return and daniel waves as he turns and reacts looking straight up and ahead it ought
to be smooth sailin from here on in
astrotrain starts diving into upcoming shuttles blasting as kup struggles to hold controls his shuttle also rocking from direct hits using intercom ultra magnus
shuttle rocks with direct hits as ultra magnus struggles with controls remember what we did off beta four
i remember it well
they fire o
with incredible precision the rays strike the asteroid splitting it in two parts
it shoots through space and strikes another asteroid which breaks into several pieces many of them angling back towards
which swerve to avoid them as
hits another moon or asteroid or general rock in space doing the same thing
widen shot to show that the pieces are shooting around like pool balls after an incredibly violent break
zinging into each other
narrowly missing galvatrons ship
filling space with incredible amounts of dust lava from inside the moons multi colored gasses explosions and generally making a mess of space
note think of this scene as the asteroids video game
as all of this is going on they jam into hyperspace
corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy leaving only blurred images of themselves as
emerges from the chaos
the explosions jammed my sensors
pause i have lost track of the autobots
they did the same thing to me off beta four
possible song optimistic adventure with the suggestion that all dreams might not happen
as both shuttles soar majestically through the vast depth of infinite space
congratulations autobots weve lost em at least for a while
so rest up
well refuel on the junk planet and work out our battle plan there
kup sits spinning yarns leaning back in chair as grimlock sludge slag and swoop lie lounge sit with chin on hands all listening like little kids to a bedtime story
in rapt attention yep i remember the dust was so thick off beta had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors
impatiently me grimlock know all about wipers
want to hear good part of story
beating wings rapidly excitedly good part kup
tell swoop good part
excitedly beating tail on unh unh unh
floor good part
the dust was really thick and then this gigantic ick yak
he is practicing sparring with a spinning auto combatant a very high tech quintain with many arms legs and weapons that test the users skills and reflexes
hot rod wears sparring gauntlet and holds a small laser dagger and special shield
as he lowers shield and reacts to dinobot reactions to kups story
dont you think we have better things to do now than tell stories kup
like maybe figure out how were gonna stay alive
as he is speaking auto combatant sees its opening and gives hot rod a swift kick in the rear sending him flying o
then hammers its fists on top of his head
continuing time out for cybertrons sake
as it sticks out a metal tongue and gives him a loud as hot rod rises and draws his fist back to clobber the auto combatant
mechanically quickly time out time out time out
suddenly the shuttle rocks from impact and sparks and flames shoot out of large hole in wall kup
raise your force fields at once
theyre armed with
as he presses firing button
particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out
it zooms towards a whopper of a planet surrounded by several small moons
we will later learn that this planet is quintesson but for now its mysterious
the moleculon missiles streak after it like sidewinders
kup and hot rod pilot the thing for all its worth
theyre closing on us
yep like the shrikebats of dromedon
yeah howd you beat them
im trying to remember
there were an awful lot of casualties that day
the missiles streak toward them
oh yeah we inversed polarities
thatll tear the ship apart
you got a better idea
with that the ship seems to stop on a dime in mid air
the missiles zoom past it
hot rod watches wide eyed as kup watches ahead warily hands on the controls
okay so you were right
dont run your programs until theyre debugged
suddenly the moleculon missiles reverse course and start coming back
theyre coming back
lets just hope weve screwed up their trajectories
the missiles sidewind towards them then their paths cross and everything flashes white
kup and hot rod look forward their eyes blinking as if strained
yep i thought wed had it that time for sure
it sits next to a gigantic alien made moon
suddenly a hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster claw shoots out at it
he sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen
the claw snaps on the front of the ship smashing the window and
crushing the area between hot rod and kup
as it explodes flinging the autobots inside down toward the quintessons planet
as they man control panel in cockpit
in the background blurr and arcee work to patch other holes in hull and daniel helps them
perceptor slowly plots coordinates on light up table oblivious to shakes and rockings of their ship
kup and hot rod just bought it
i cant deal with that now
face it magnus the decepticons re gonna dog us until they see us dead
ultra magnus nods solemnly cryptic then thats exactly what theyre gonna see
as he works controls which eject more moleculon missiles
electrical outline envelopes it and there is a
blinding flash after which
remnants of the hull and superstructure explode toward camera and past camera accompanied by explosive sound and then silence
where the shuttle had been there is now
just loose asteroids and clouds of space dust the autobots have been terminated
and soon we shall say the same of that infernal unicron
suddenly galvatrons body begins to twist and he writhes in pain
take me to unicron
as it veers off and away from the space cloud followed by cyclonus armada
hold for a beat and then close in on the dust cloud as
part of ultra magnus shuttle flies into the clear
arcee perceptor springer blurr are crowded together in cramped remnant of cockpit as daniel and ultra magnus sit at the control deck
did we have to detonate three quarters of the ship
seeing how they would have detonated four quarters i think it was a good choice
sharply all holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold perceptor
can you still locate the junk planet
gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities however
looks at ultra magnus holds his head in his hands as springer grimaces realizes hes overdoing it again clears his throat ahem
yes i think i can
which we see as dim shadow on the edge of space a small falling object appears high above quintesson and hurtles down down over and over until it is in
view and we see it is
still cartwheeling down toward the planet below trying to change the angle of his fall he plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues to fall past shiny rock pinnacles
of unusual construction as we
as hot rod falls into the sea we cut to the silvery energy sea hot rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with
a metallic reef bounces manages to right himself shaking his head as he regains equilibrium and
then he transforms into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding off as he calls through intercom
bubbling filtered voice kup
we follow him through undersea world as he rounds a corner of the reef wall and reacts the robotoid squid is tearing kup to pieces and tossing the pieces across
the ocean floor with its silvery metal tentacles kup
he transforms and blasts
angrily streaks toward hot rod
fires at the squid but not stopping him
hot rods shot plinks off a couple of tentacles but the squid keeps coming
wraps his tentacles around hot rod and starts crushing
hot rod looks like hes about to be crushed but he
its hideous optical sensor
releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and x shapes and retreats
dont worry im not coming after you
lowers his head and blows blast of air through head piece
the air blast clears the water revealing kups head and torso half buried in the sand as hot rod kneels kup
as he turns head around to look up at hot rod and spits out a mouthful of sand bubbling as he speaks fix me
hot rod rapidly kup stands impatiently while hot rod reassembles them
what do you think
kup feels his elbow joint twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd creaky way as he is trying himself out
a beat then grimaces theres a piece missing
sifts through pile of scrap metal parts lying at kups feet see this wasnt yours
its some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher
and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel
moving up and back bending arms and hands creaking well i still think im short a part
sees hot rod hang his head but all things considered you did an amazing job lad
rotates arm rapidly yeah you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator
now lets find the dinos and get off this twisted planet
as he transforms its evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing in vehicular
mode of all the circuit glitched diode blowin dim wittery
i told you a part was missin
we watch hot rod and kup move off into the distance as we kup and hot rod walk along a swampy marshy area
suddenly there are several loud gurgles and we can see the shapes of something terrible emerging through the muck
hot rod spins to fire but kup bats down his arm
eight sharkticons in humanoid mode surrounding them
the sharkticons are smaller than the autobots but they look ugly and vicious
dont act hostile
ill use the universal greeting
ill have them eating out of my hand
or our faces
kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon
then he addresses them
bah weep graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
mocking mimicking bah weep graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
the sharkticons look interested
see the universal greeting works every time
pause now without making any sudden moves give them an energon goody
kup reaches into his belt presses a button and pulls out an energon cube
hot rod somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came
they hold out the cubes and two of the sharkticons take the energon cubes like dogs getting a treat
then the other six show up looking for cubes
this is getting expensive
dont worry theyll reciprocate
they each hand out three energon goodies to the remaining six sharkticons
the sharkticons eat them happily
then they back off eyeing the two autobots with menace
i thought they were supposed to reciprocate
not sure of himself customs vary from place to place
suddenly the sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them
the two robots taken by surprise fall backwards
pan from the fallen robots to an area behind a tree
for just a moment we see a small yellow autobot in robot mode
there then as quickly as we realize what it is it transforms into automode and vanishes in a flash
it was wheelie
sharkticons march kup and hot rod into a holding pen within a walled compound
as we follow them into pen we pull back and pan to establish that entry procession is being watched by
slender spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five sided heads each side bearing a different mechanistic face with a different expression on each smiling angry grimacing suspicious and the fifth
face is not yet to be seen
as hot rod and kup are led to certain death in the quintesson dungeons harsh dissonant metallic and terrifying music plays underscoring the brutal evil they face reminds me of
the niter slave mines on golgonath seven
every place reminds you of some place else
you should learn to appreciate it
a lot of good its done us so far
as hot rod looks around and reacts sharply as we feature the leader quintesson who is taller and wears a different color robe from others
he is watching arrival of kup and hot rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace
as sharkticons shove and prod them jolting them into the holding pen and locking the gate
then they install i cant transform
theyre restraining bolts lad
looking around we got to get a new travel agent
what is this place
as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh basso voice
it is granix
we saw him in the first scene escaping from his planet when unicron ate it
note the script says g ranix here
not my mistake
the world of the savage sharkticons and their cruel masters the quintessons
they hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of unicron and put them on trial
but what if theyre innocent
guilty or innocent the sentence is always the same death
a planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path
so thats the monsters name
i wonder if theres any connection between it and galvatron
suddenly a quintesson guard roars in
all turn and look off reacting as two guards thunder in grab granix and pull him back out of the door
note another instance of the spelling of granix as he points at kup and hot rod soon you too shall receive your sentence
kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board over a watery or oily pit teeming with sharkticons
jury have you reached a verdict
we have your honor
to jury of quintessons guilty
spare me this mockery of justice
i repeat guilty
jurys faces rotate to fifth expression a deaths head on granix note yet another final reference to kranix as granix suddenly the robot is dumped into a pit of teeming
sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy
in moments he is no more
he watches grimly through the bars
not the end id wish for lad
as ultra magnus shuttle is buffeted by winds and storms as it enters the atmosphere of junkion
as it shakes and rattles violently where are we springer
the place where everything ends up after you throw it out
as he holds up hands and crosses fingers
tenses and crouches protectively around arcee and daniel as we see mountains of junk whizz past the window
brace for impact
it plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk narrowly avoiding crashing but frequently hitting junk pinnacles or sides of junk walls and causing avalanches of junk
by the time the ship lands it is nearly indistinguishable from the junk
everyone is in a jumbled tangle ultra magnus beneath blurr perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway arcee crouched over daniel and springer with half his body
sticking through the hull pulling himself free of hull wall remind me to give the auto pilot a raise
daniel creeps out from under arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders wow
that was bettern the roller coaster at future world
working scanner computer device thoughtfully the composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non ferrous articulations
baffled hows that
opening hull door with a he says the planets made of junk
as they look out on landscape of living junk yep this dump is a dump
as he straps on tool belt we might be able to salvage this thing
checks laser drill turns it on off ultra magnus starts for door followed by blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and perceptor who rolls up shuttle plans
as daniel moves out to join them
can i help too
its rough out there kid
stay inside and play with crayons or something
as she steps forward with a smile a strange grid like suit in her hand i think daniel can make himself useful with
it used to be spikes
holds grid like metal frame suit wow
dads exo suit
he told me about it but i never saw it
here try it on
she starts helping him into the exo suit
as he gets inside the suit which fits over his body like a grid work metal cage
daniel clips cage of exo suit shut and stands up inside the gridwork which makes him taller and broader
he moves awkwardly barely able to advance a step just think about what you want to do before you do it
brows knitted thinking
dont fight it dan o
he suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards then sideways then forward then he starts dancing rapidly then bounces off walls
spinning upside down then flips over several times and lands in a splatter legs spread arms this way and that amused startled and unhurt
continuing its kind of tricky
he suddenly flips around twice in mid air then regains his feet and leans way over against arcee for support
she laughs and pats his shoulder for the first time out you were great
as he sends down ramp and motions to the others curtly show times over
weve got work to do
he starts out as springer arcee daniel et
come down the ramp and look around at the lush vegetation of growing junk clumps all around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of weathered junk
whistles this must be the junk capital of the universe
as they start digging for parts to repair the ship sinister junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them
their leader wreck gar speaks to his fellow junkions
in guttural rusty metallic rumble stop thief
no welcome wagon hello stranger
that good coffee flavor yeah or your money back
wreck gar shows large junk gun with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like barrel
operators are standing by
they laugh in guttural clanking sounds and look out at springer and the others who keep working as we at first we see only the face of a sinister quintesson
gatekeeper backed up by heavily armed sharkticons
greetings noble strangers
they stand at the gate looking more like kids showing up at your door wondering if you can come out and play than like serious robots on a serious mission
yes me grimlock noble
me grimlock search for friends
the quintesson showing his friendly face smiles
and who might they be
hot rod and kup
feigning recognition oh yes
a young one and an old one
you know friends
where are they
they went down that path
he points to
it probably isnt lined with primroses but it should be
grimlock you good friend to grimlock
i reward you sometime
with that the four dinobots head towards the primrose path
his head rotates and he smiles a sinister evil smile
galvatron stands upon the demonic planet in an extremely contorted position
why do you torture me
we have no idea where this godly voice is coming from but this place sure is spooky
you have failed
ultra magnus is dead
then where is the matrix
destroyed with him
the matrix can not be destroyed
pause and ultra magnus lives on the planet of junk
cut him open
and bring the matrix to me
they step along the primrose path not noticing as sinister things start to happen all around them
this thing looks like a metal version of a venus fly trap and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up
swoop walks past it in humanoid mode
it misses him by an inch
me grimlock positive hot rod and kup close
get thump thump thump
taps his head hard suddenly a section of stones drop away in front of slag revealing a spiked pit
me slag say you are full of beryllium balony
he is just about to fall in when
grimlock in dino mode slaps him with his tail knocking him away an instant before he steps into the hole
me grimlock say you full of cesium salami
slag gets up
he is about to pounce on slag when a massive tree which is actually more like a sword suddenly is spring and arcs toward him
the machete like blade strikes the ground between grimlock and slag narrowly missing them
he turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground
me grimlock think trees here are cheap model
like your head
laughs at own joke grimlock jumps on slag and wrestles him to the ground
suddenly a squeaky oddly childish voice speaks from o
furious who say that
wheelie is the wolf boy of quintesson an autobot whos been evading the sharkticons since his parents ship crashed killing everybody else in his party
he wears a necklace of sharkticon teeth packs a three bladed laser knife and a special sling which hurls fire stones
he fears nothing especially the dinobots and he cockily struts into the clear
walks right up sludges tail onto sludges back and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto
slags head where he stands eye to eye with grimlock friends find
many face lie
eyes blaze furious me grimlock fool
smiling breezily picture you got
now fool you not
he laughs in a wild metallic cackle grimlock raises a claw to swipe wheelie off slags head me grimlock no like you
as he scowls and quickly loads firestone in sling and slings it onto grimlocks nose where it explodes making grimlock yowl and pull back feeling his reddened nose and speaking
through his nose angrily continuing doooooooow
why boy hit by dose
folds arms across his chest wheelie say find friends today
nods defiantly grimlock and slag react as we kup and hot rod stand on the platform over the sharkticon pit
they are bound by restraining bolts
before we deliver your verdict would you like to beg for your lives
kup turns to hot rod
remember when you put me together today
sarcastic sure thats all i got to think about
i know what part you forgot
silence or ill hold you in contempt of this court
i have nothing but contempt for this court
suddenly their heads swivel around to deaths heads
the platform drops away and they tumble
suddenly kup in double jointed fashion slips out of the restraining bolt
that doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket
watch this lad
without it im double jointed as houdini
then he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off hot rods bolt
wish youd figured that out a little sooner
better late than never
in full humanoid mode they land their weapons drawn
kup and hot rod fire driving some sharkticons back
theyve got more sharkticons than we have photon charges
kup transforms to auto mode
lets hold a demolition derby
then he roars into a bunch of them slamming a massive stack into the wall
he transforms too and does the same thing
as fast as the autobots can run the miserable things over new swarms of them come out
they clear out a circle in the center of the pit and transform to humanoid mode
didnt even bend a fender
yeah but look
there are a lot more of those cam dinging grill crackin things
is a wave of larger more powerful sharkticons
we cant hold out forever but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill
they charge kup and hot rod kup and hot rod fire into them destroying several but are
the sharkticons crawl all over them munching on their metal
they fly down and land on the pile transforming into dinobot mode
sludge in brontosaurus mode swats several around with his tail while stomping them with his feet
lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller sharkticon the sharkticon bares his teeth realizes that hes a second stringer and scampers away
me grimlock want to munch metal
slag barrels into sharkticons making a quick shishkebob out of them while
swoop picks two up with his claws flies in the air and drops them on other sharkticons
suddenly back off and begin transforming bowing to the dinobots
kup and hot rod dig themselves out of a pile of sharkticon parts
i never thought id be so happy to see those big bozos
he turns to hot rod
me grimlock no bozo
they look down their angry faces showing
he points to the quintessons
me grimlock say execute them
for a brief instant dont seem to know what to do
then they charge the quintessons
the quintessons start to flee but its clear that the sharkticons who climb over the stacked bodies of other sharkticons are going to catch them
i think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly
but what about our problems
we need a ship
wheelie you get a ship if i get a trip
he turns to the little feral robot
who are you
the dinobot lifts up wheelie
him wheelie him friend
hot rod hell be mine too if he can find a quintesson ship
he points into the distance
is the strangest looking corkscrew ship weve every seen sticking out of the ground
thats a ship
pan across an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the terrible roar we have come to associate with unicron
if this doesnt do it nothing will
he sets a timer to seconds
now with a new bumpersticker which is a unicron with a red circle and slash through it looks very fidgety
lets get out of here
they run over to a small space ship as
the timer counts down
now for the first time we see what is really going on
unicron looms behind it about to do the big munch
they roar away
his mist surrounds the planet
they stop their ship in space
five four three two one
an incredible display of fireworks goes off seemingly blowing unicron to smithereens
they slap palms
then they look up horrified
it isnt even dented
lets get out of here
the great maw opens and we hear a grand cosmic roar
suddenly the smoke and space junk from the explosion are sucked into his mouth
they try to fly away
were being sucked into it
despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power they are still sucked into
whose great mouth shuts when hes got the human and the autobot
as arcee and springer work on the ship while perceptor watches
be sure the fittings are securely welded
as he uses flame jets from finger tips to weld joints where new canopy is fitted very fast as usual absolutely positively definitely
as he helps blurr install a junk part
this exo suit is fantastic
to blurr want me to do that
well why not
give it a try but think it through first
daniel knits his brow extends finger of exo glove which is part of exo suit
as hand quivers and his finger shoots out a tiny flame which sputters sparks and then goes out like a wet match
practice practice practice
wreck gar starts to motion them to the attack and the junkions ready their weapons
forward avanti apfel and like go for gusto
stops as ominous roar comes from overhead and he looks up hang on this be industrial strength we watch
as he too hears and then looks up and sees the decepticon force decepticons
to springer weve got to draw them off and then double back to the ship
with galvatron piloting races up and launches a particularly nasty looking missile which streaks into shot and
turns it into junk
springer fires up at incoming jets calling to the others cancel that last order
as arcee transforms and moves off in one direction
daniel looks at blurr who is starting to transform
what do i do
you can do
transformation complete he blurs off and in v
blurr goes off outblurring past hail of laser fire from ramjet scorching by overhead as he reacts looks around thinks brows knitting looking off reacting transform
coming at him from one side shrapnel coming from the other side as he starts reaching for daniel human germ
as his exo suit suddenly transforms into auto mode and takes off and drives through
scavenger and shrapnel knocking them over
flies up to a ridge in advance of his forces motioning to them to split off and follow
they dash through the maze like walls of junk pursued by sweeps who strike them from above
he lets out a rayblast
hitting perceptor and spinning him around
until he stumbles to the ground
perceptor lies on the ground stunned
ultra magnus stops next to him
suddenly shots tear into the junk all around them as
roars towards them
he suddenly transforms to cannon mode and fires
blowing the sweep to protons
he transforms to humanoid mode
it appears that my lacerations were primarily superficial
then move it
he takes off
stays behind taking a few shots at
which streak over in deadly formations
he stands and shoots
ultra magnus turns to see
several yards down the junk lined corridor
your estimated survival time is seconds
he shoots at the junk walls
then use that time to escape
the matrix was designed for an emergency like this
ill try to unleash its power
but what if it doesnt work
until all are one
ultra magnus ray hits the walls and they tumble down separating him from the other autobots
his back to a wall of fallen junk he pulls out the matrix
galvatron pops out of cyclonus and both transform to land in front of ultra magnus
struggling to open the leadership matrix
he puts his hand inside of it and gets a powerful shock
he pulls his hand out quickly
he still struggles
baffled prime you said the matrix would light our darkest hour
four sweeps fly toward camera in formation
galvatron pops out a communication device from his helmet
sweeps quarter him
four rope like rays shoot out of them and
wrap around his arms and legs
his arms and legs caught by the four ropes he knows hes just about had it
he struggles for one last moment then
pulling their rays taut the sweeps fly in four separate directions effectively drawing and quartering the autobot leader
as all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered in the distance he screams in horror
it tumbles from ultra magnus hands to
he holds the autobot matrix
unicron my master with this i shall make you my slave
galvatron gets into cyclonus and flies off as he moves out and looks down at ultra magnus remains tearful ultra magnus
as they move up beside daniel
without the matrix there is no hope
no hope at all
as they are moving in battle array towards the shuttle
junkions are an interesting species
they ride themselves
that is the junkions ride transforms of themselves so that if their vehicle breaks down the driver will become the vehicle and the vehicle will transform to become the driver
they are gibbering singing almost a wild kind of junk rock war cry song which like their language is constructed of bits and pieces of the museum junk of our
culture a humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense
slice em dice em
and thats all folks or your money back
as he roars into the lead and shows his teeth dont look behind door number two monty
its time to play end of the line my valentine
geroni roni doo ron ron i mo
he charges as they react
springer leads the way and blurr arcee daniel and perceptor follow and we move to a road warrior style chase as springer and arcee ride on either side of daniel
and perceptor with blurr bringing up the rear zig zagging back and forth to keep the junkions from getting at daniel
roars alongside springer on his motorcycle and throws out laser barbed grappling hook trying to hook springer
springer ducks first pass of hook
as he hurls grappling hook again as he catches hook by the chain and yanks goes flying off his motorcycle
he transforms into a motorcycle as the motorcycle transforms into a rider and hops on the new motorcycle and then
turns around to come back
he looks over astonished
its not hard to knock em down
its getting them to stay down thats the trick
as she fires at a junkion who is trying to swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle
the junkion looks down at his missing arm digs around in the junk for a minute comes up with another and then transforms to a motorcycle
as junkion rides over to her starts belting her with junk sword theyre indestructible
as he skids stopping his exo suit as he reacts to whats ahead theyre everywhere
as junkions arise out of every junk pile in sight and gibbering singing their junk rock battle song start moving in as he stops and arcee daniel perceptor and blurr
stop around him
they close ranks and look out at the junkions grimly perhaps theyre not as vicious as they look
as he gnashes his teeth and grins and then blinks his eyes which roll to show eyes like ping pong balls
wreck gar makes blipping noises as he does this reacting to wreck gars noises and eyeball display to perceptor positive thinking gets on my nerves
suddenly all react to sound and wind of passing space cruiser their p
v hot rod kup and dinobots in cruiser as it shoots past and banks coming back for a closer look it cant be
as he looks up at passing cruiser and waves and kup and the dinobots
i wouldnt count on that
indicating junkions as junkions newly risen from junk look up and point at cruiser and make hostile signs toward it shaking weapons etc
hot rod and kup look down on the army of junkions below surrounding their friends as they swoop by not since the crocodillos of strontero have i seen such a
as he sticks his face up next to hot rod
wheelie riding on grimlocks head slips down to stand on console next to hot rod maybe they make me king too
dont hold your breath your majesty
as he watches cruiser descend and start gliding in for a landing steady as she goes mob
snoopy visitors get mud in the eye bye and bye and film at five
gives thumbs up sign rides everything must go by midnight
with a singing roar of musical tribal excitement the junkions sweep springer and our friends along with them following course of landing cruiser to cruiser sets down and junkions line
up with weapons aimed at rampway as they watch door
as hot rod steps out with big smile and hand full of energon sticks followed by a very wary kup and the dinobots with wheelie riding sludges neck
as they react to hot rods smile wreck gar trying to mimic that smile to his followers who laugh as he steps up beside kup and gently pushes kups rifle
aside aside to kup still holding smile guns arent exactly friendly
through his teeth to hot rod neither are they in case you havent noticed
sotto what was the universal greeting again
growls and slips a snipper blow torch cutting tool out of a holster and starts toward hot rod with it big smile bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
they look at one another blink then beam with smiles bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
nodding smiling bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
presses energon sticks forward as hot rod says this
wreck gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his head and
all the junkions smile and cheer and start chanting the universal greeting phrase laughing clapping their hands and dancing around taking arcees hand and
taking springer and perceptor and daniel out into center of a square dance type gathering moving back and forth with them dancing happily singing the universal greeting in a melodic
rhythmic way bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
hugs hot rod and perceptor who winces and tries to enjoy it and then hugs daniel wheelie arcee laughing and dancing as singing goes
as he reacts to wreck gar kissing his leg yuck
me grimlock not a kisser
me grimlock a king
claps his hands and gleefully makes noises as he hops about dancing with junkions until we cut to as he stands on top of platform and rings junk bells and
sirens getting silence and smiling as he waves hands all around have a nice day and please close cover before striking friends
amigos buddies and side kicks breep drit aw rootie
so say the junkions
holds hands over his head he looks at them strangely
where did you learn to talk like that
he reaches into his body and about where a heart or some other organ would be he pulls out a watchman
on it is a crazy eddy type commercial
we talk t
you talk some t
looks around nervously
i talk some tv
and now hot rod for the news
dont touch that dial
void where prohibited
junkions cheer wildly while the dinobots react with uncertainty as he points off and shouts happily
by george kimosabes your smashed up blotto friend soon like brand new with ninety day warranty all iciban parts and labor is
the junkions move ultra magnus mangled body through an amazing assembly line quickly piecing together his body parts using junk when they cant find a part
then they lube him dust him spray him and polish him
then wreck gar hits a switch and ultra magnus eye lights go on
cock a doodle do
as he steps away from junkion line of reconstruction and into group consisting of hot rod kup and springer
ad lib jubilation ultra magnus
youre all alive
all turn to ultra magnus
and with it all hope
inspired the matrix will not fail us
didnt you hear ultra magnus
we dont have it anymore
then weve got to trust in ourselves and no matter what they odds destroy unicron
his eyes light up
kill the grand poobah
flush cosmic troubles down the drain
almost chanting destroy unicron
kill the grand poobah
flush cosmic troubles down the drain
the quintesson ship in the background
listen i dont want to rain on anybodys parade but how are we going to move the army to unicron
we dont have enough room on that ship
no fuss no muss
to others hurry hurry
sale must end
rush right on down to bridge and test drive latest with no obligation
suddenly several junkions scramble to concealed doorways in the junk
you have ships here
new improved junkion planet is sleek sexy import with turbo handling
whats he talking about
suddenly boosters fire from the back side of the junk and somewhere under all of the junk we realize is a real space ship
maybe the junk is the space ship
it takes off bits and pieces of junk flying off as it moves
this is what i call traveling in style
as galvatron stands on the surface of unicron holding the matrix
listen to me or suffer the consequences
arent we getting pompous
i now possess that which you most fear
unicron laughs and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet knocking galvatron to his knees
you will do my bidding or
unicron roars with laughter
taste my wrath
he leans down and starts trying to open the matrix
in the background we see cybertron getting closer
galvatron struggles with the matrix but gets a big shock
you underestimate me galvatron
he desperately struggles to open the matrix
the planet suddenly starts shaking
galvatron is bathed in a reddish light and looks up in horror
a hideous transformation is beginning
the surface of the planet in front of galvatron opens up and we see that the hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head
galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible head before him
for a time i considered sparing your measly little planet but now you shall witness its dismemberment
suddenly the ground he stands on drops away and he falls through space
landing on a protruding plate which sticks out of unicrons chest
he looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him
the massive planet transforms arms and legs fold out of the enormous body hands unfold from the arms jets from its back propel it towards
cybertron which now looks lonely and vulnerable in space
he stands on a ledge on unicron and desperately tries to open the matrix but no cigar
unicron enters shot and grasps at cybertron with a hideous claw
shockwave talks into a communications device as alarms sound and troopers run everywhere
were under attack
scramble then his voice is cut off as
unicrons hand reaches towards the window squeezes and the walls crash in
unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as
streak out of cybertron and begin firing on the enormous planet
here we see the true scale of unicron
the fighters are the size of bees as they attack
he looks down on the swarm of fighters and
breathes fire down on them
the fighters pop and burn like popcorn in a blowtorch
in moments they disappear like sparks from a fire
decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as
unicrons huge hand reaches down
scraping buildings and
tearing out gun emplacements
as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the rockets laser blasts etc
are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as unicron opens his mouth and swallows the fire barrage galvatron stop feeding him you fools
as yet more decepticon fighters rip out of the planet it looks like unicron is going to have a field day tearing it apart
the massive junkion ship and the corkscrew cruiser piloted by hot rod and kup race through the dark void
i dont believe it
hot rod kup springer arcee and daniel as they also look through canopy astonished wow
unicron destroying cybertron doesnt it remind you of something kup
as they move closer still
kup is glassy eyed
entranced nope never seen anything like it
i knew there had to be a first time
using intercom battle stations
as hatches open and the dinobots start flying out
hot rod shoves joystick forward and cruiser drives toward unicron whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass canopy as it pulls up beside hot rods
cruiser so they are both in a line
the dinobots behind both ships
all diving toward unicrons nose as wreck gar also has joystick shoved down and watches unicrons face loom closer closer closer as unicron smiles and cups both hands together preparing
to catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach galvatron the matrix hanging around his neck
transforms to cannon and fires up at
a bright panel on unicrons chest
he hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out causing the gigantic robot to flicker momentarily
the monster lets out a roar
then reaches down picks up galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin
he drops into the deep pit of unicrons mouth narrowly avoiding both a torrent of fire and his sharp crushing teeth
as they junkion cruiser comes close unicron lets out a burst of fire
flames lick the ship but when the fire subsides nothing has happened
patented enamel resists fire rain and corrosion
five year warranty satisfaction guaranteed
or your money back
the ship fires back dumping rays into
unicrons face but not really doing any damage
unicron grabs the junkion cruiser with both of its hands and
tears it in half
unshakable unbreakable unbeatable
and for a limited time we include
as ultra magnus perceptor and the others watch in amazement
free bonus surprise
free bonus surprise
screwing things together
and kicking control panels to make them work
both halves of the junkion ship act as independent space ships
most unscientific but
as the quintesson ship shoots toward unicrons face
is suddenly struck by a ray from unicrons eye and half of it is knocked off
lights go off and the autobots are thrown around like toys
they are heading right to unicrons eye
unicron swipes at the cruiser but misses
the cruiser crashes right through unicrons eye like a corkscrew
the cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through several electrical membranes that are in fact unicrons brain
as the ship tumbles through it dumps off the various autobots like rubbish and disintegrates
he tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit which we can assume is a robotic sinus or something kup springer daniel and arcee are scattered about the
floor in the giant flickering chamber
wheres hot rod
sees something in the distance
i dont know but i hope they didnt get him
are dozens of hovering robots that look like floating bear traps snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the autobots
they run into a long cave like chamber which looks like the central nervous system or something
hot rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of miscellaneous junk
he slowly gets up and looks around the chamber
pan as hot rod looks over various different bits of junk until he sees the glowing shape of the autobot matrix apparently suspended in mid air
the autobot matrix
then suddenly two red burning eyes light up above the matrix and we see the hideous form of galvatron
it will do you no good autobot
it cannot be opened
he stands up and walks towards galvatron
not by a decepticon
hot rod steps towards galvatron
it is strange that we should find ourselves as allies
suddenly his body is violently twisted and his arms are almost broken off
destroy him or feel yourself torn from limb to limb
of course my master
galvatron takes a shot at hot rod
hot rod dives away as electricity seems to flash everywhere
he peers into the gloom
hot rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk
puny autobot you lack even primes courage
there is no response
unicron now stands atop cybertron fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees
rays streak from his one good eye
his hands smash fighters
fire shoots from his mouth
now reaching unicrons butt start kicking
me grimlock kick butt
suddenly he looks down sending down a searing blast of fire
they transform to robot mode and fly away
me grimlock need new strategy
kup arcee springer and daniel dash down the corridor
suddenly daniels foot is caught in a maze of wiring
not noticing they keep running
he tries to pull his foot out
then he looks up
the robotic antibodies are drawing very close to him
he looks o
towards the others
they turn around and see daniel about to be munched by the antibodies
they dash down the corridor firing on
their shots hit some knocking them to scrap but there are so many of them that they cant hold back the tide as it
daniel unscathed by the things which hover over his head munching their way towards the autobots gets his foot free
they dont even see me
it looks like custers last stand as they are surrounded by the vicious antibodies
they must not programmed to catch flesh creatures
us on the other hand
try to find help
misses the antibodies but strikes a large tube
when it is hit it pours a torrent of liquid which
goes over the swarm of antibodies but hits daniel
carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid
he shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo
daniel rips through what seem to be endless caves on the torrent of liquid until he is dumped down a high waterfall into
a glowing lake
he stays under for a moment and then bobs up to see
this is the central processing area for unicrons food and energy
a long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear bubbling vat where it is separated into raw material and energy
the energy which comes out in raw form goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes while the solid material is separated into its component metals and plastics
formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion
watches this with awe until he sees
several decepticon troopers hanging from cables like shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat and in moments converted to nothing
then cliffjumper and jazz roll out of the line
he dashes to the shores of the glowing lake
and then spike comes rolling down followed by bumblebee
they look down but cant move because they are held by massive pincers
shut off the control daniel
daniel looks around
then he sees
which controls the whole thing
he runs up a catwalk towards it
he reaches the flickering panel
what do i do
it doesnt have any buttons or anything
he looks down
shoot it son
but i dont have a gun
use your exo suit
he looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can
then a spark comes out
it grows longer
spike and the autobots are about to go in
starts frying the command console
it keeps moving
then cliffjumper is dropped in
he looks back and to his horror sees jazz bumblebee and his father about to be dropped in
he keeps firing
the panel starts exploding
i cant stop it
jazz drops in then bumblebee then spike
turns around and sees this
there is no answer
play the moment
it is empty
the autobots and spike sit at the bottom smoking but alright
you did it
galvatron the matrix at his neck stalks around the room
looking everywhere for hot rod
come out autobot
we all must die sometime
suddenly shockingly hot rod jumps out of the floor and grabs galvatron sinking his fist into the decepticons face
galvatron jumps at hot rod
hot rod transforms to a car and races away
he transforms to cannon mode and fires
hot rod transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his legs
then he fires back at galvatron
hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and angering him
raises his gun then lowers it
no i will crush you with bare hands
hot rod transforms back to car and tries to race away
galvatron jumps after him and catches him
hot rod nearly pinned by galvatron transforms to humanoid mode
galvatron wrestles him to his back
the adolescent robot tries to fight back but the other is stronger
galvatron puts his hands around hot rods neck and starts squeezing
we hear the crunching of metal
first prime then ultra magnus and now you
it is a pity autobots die so easily or i might have a sense of satisfaction now
hot rod desperately gasps and pulls at galvatrons hands
unicron shoots down more decepticons with his remaining eye while he crushes the junkion ship
the walls crush in
the junkions and the autobots are being smashed together
ashes to ashes
junk to junk
galvatron still strangles hot rod
on hot rod his hands nearly dead spring to life for a moment and grasp the matrix which hangs from galvatrons chest
suddenly it lights up
a miraculous transformation takes place
hot rod begins to grow at an alarming rate
age shows on his face
he is stronger and wiser
arise rodimus prime
he fires at hot rod as
hot rod gets up
the shot doesnt even dent him
this is the end of the road galvatron
with that he picks up the decepticon and throws him through
hot rod bathed in the glow of the matrix
sticks his hand in the way we saw galvatron and ultra magnus try earlier
there is no shock
then like pulling the pin on a hand grenade he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb
the matrix rips through unicrons body blowing up wires causing floods and generally causing havoc
unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the junkion ship sending it hurtling
it tumbles through space
suddenly he starts tearing into his body
unicron writhes in space tearing himself apart ripping off a leg and sending out sparks like a roman candle
they are overrun by the antibodies
one takes a whopper bite out of springers chest
im almost out of energy
suddenly he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above then another explodes then another
suddenly every antibody in the wall begins exploding and through the carnage we see bumblebee spike daniel cliffjumper and jazz
the last of the antibodies is blown away and kup arcee and springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies
thats what i call the nick of time
suddenly an entire wall vanishes as unicrons hand tears at things
lets burn rubber
the humans jump in
they race up the tunnel one step ahead of unicrons hand which shoots after them pulling apart what we know must be pieces of his brain
then they reach what seems like a dead end
in fact it is the back side of unicrons good eye
the hand comes in after them
an unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the autobots
when it gets there we realize that it is rodimus prime
i knew you had potential lad
autobots transform and roll out
rodimus prime transforms into truck mode as the other autobots also transform
daniel and spike jump into him
then in a continuous line he shoots off the other autobots racing behind him
rodimus prime shoots out the second eye
followed by the others
an arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the autobot essence spreads throughout the body blowing circuits
suddenly unicron lets out a loud agonized roar
sparks seem to shoot out of every part of his body
then he spins in space like some kind of a fireworks display shooting off sparks
we get the big visual explosion
unicrons head orbits cybertron
pan to cybertron where and push in on rodimus prime arcee kup springer ultra magnus wreck gar daniel perceptor blaster and spike watch construction being done on cybertron below
let this mark the end of the cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness
until all are one
