in close f
the back part of a sign
to most of america in the age of innocence had arrived and the stories of the indian wars and the gold
rush and the great gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front porch remiraiscences
but on both sides of the io grande men still lived as thia had in the s and s unchanged
men in a changing land
they wear the khaki uniforms of the united states cnvaljry
the horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation
wearing lieutenants bars rides slightly ahead of the others
he rides stiffly always slightly in pain
pike is a not unhandsome leather faced man in his early forties
a thoughtful self educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing except the
changes in himself and those around him
make no mistake pike bishop is not a hero his values are not ours he is a gunfighter a criminal a bank
robber a killer of men
his sympathies are not for fences for trolleys
and telegraphs or better schools
he lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others moments of regret t hey are short
he is not a good man according to the righteous
to them he is totally bad and he wouldnt have it any other way
next to him dutch engstrom wears the uniform of a sergeant
dutch is bigaz good natured with a fast gun hand strong loyalty and like pike a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations
he can sing
has more than his share of charm but believes in nothing except two men and pike is one
behind them ride two brothers lyle and tector gorch dressed as corporals
lyle and tector are big tough hot tempered and sudden
they work together eat together and
sometimes sleep together with the same whore
brutal vicious in a fight illiterate
they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it they never let go
they are without loyalty or honor to anyone except each other and that is limited
a fifth man wears the single stripe of a pfc
angel is a good looking bilingual mexican boy in his middle s who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under diaz that he rebelled but his rebellion
was not with villa or obregon his was a one man revolution against them all
he believes in his family his village and the inherent dignity of
man some men at least
he is faster than his companions with a gun and a better shot but he cant
laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride mexican pride a pride that can kill him but if it does
he will have no regrets
reaching the sign the men stop
speaking they begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order
and underneath someone has printed wi lco me to san rafael pike and dutch stare for a moment at the sign slightly bemused
make you feel welcome
whats it say
baiting him it invites us to stay with the community and grow
it is here perhaps with time and small miracle that you could be taught to read
tector looks at angel for a long moment then turns to pike
i never enlisted to serve with no smart mouthed kid
nor i with dogs
grinning at pike itd like to transfer to another unit there seems to be dissension in the ranks
t teotor and angel itll transfer both of you just one more word
they look at him silently
he means it
finally tike spurs his horse and the group stats for town camera panning
on ai m boxcars into a side street
with weekend visitors
women and children are
milling about shopping and idly trading gossip
has the look of turn of the century americana along with its
the group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed
riding downethe street they pass a large tent in front of which is a banner announcing a w
meeting which according to the sounds of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum is presently going on inside
do not drink wine or strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee least ye die
it shall be a statute forever
wine when it
is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder
that is in the good book
but here in this town it is five cents a glass
five cents a glass does anyone think that that is really the price of a drink
the price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast
i hereby solemnly procaise god helping me to abstain from all di stilled fer mented and malt ligi rs including wine beer and cider and to employ all proper means
to discourage the ilse of and
traffic in the same
phil and burt at the hitching rail on one side of the street
turn and keep pace with the group on horseback
at ti end of the street they dismount across from the yellow and brown railroad administration building
as they swing out of the saddle the other soldiers join them
pike and his companions remove empty saddle bags from their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds thesquare
some passersby look curiously
after a moment a little fall in and follow me
with the exception of tector phil and abe shuffle into a ragged column of twos
pike moves down the file looks around
real quiet sir
pike looks at the horses then at it reads pecos and south texas r
for a minute and behind him the men surreptitious ly touch their holstered forty five automatics
pike leaves the boardwalk crossing toward
the railroad office
tector and phil stay with the horses
removing his hat beg pardon maam
as she stops let
dutch picks up the package pike offers the lady his arm
she hesitates accepts
pike and dutch followed by the others lead her across the street
the crowd below their rifles at their sides behind them
on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls and the remains of at least three meals
it is hot
they have been there a long time and they are tired
hardcases frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in the street below
hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily
he turns edges forward then nudges deke thornton sitting next to him his back against the wall thornton is a hard bodied quiet spoken man with a lined face and
the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change the personal integrity by which he has lived is still
the soldiers sit up take a look
thornton straightens turns slowly looks stiffens a little
after a long moment hes there
the bounty hunters react and prepare to fire
over this shot is the sound of pike calling to thornton from the past
pike reaches the door and without pausing murmurs goodbye to the lady and enters followed by the others on the roof harrigan whirls on his men as they begin aim
aing ready to fire
hold your fire we wait till they come out catch them in the act
to thornton then
you kill him or go back to yuma thornton turns toward him his
face white remembering a thornton wrists lashed to the bars of the cells window is being whipped by a guard
b thornton on the rock pile is making little ones of big ones
standing by the horses
i can nail himl he said wait
what if they go
its covered you two bit rednecked peckerwood
the men settle slightly
thornton remains tense then turns as
thats all we needed what you meant to do does not interest me what you did then seeing pies and the others waiting he steps to the ody window smiling
with the thought that their visit means
military business for the railroad
changes as the men draw their guns and pike steps towards him
reaching for air what is it
what do you want
lyle and the
other men swiftly move behind the counter
pike ignores the paymaster and turns to crazy lee stringfellow
a young compulsive killer with just enough sense to
pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were printed on the heel the instructions are to pour tip
if they move kill them
grins happily and squats on the floor his gauge pump shotgun angled up at hatchet faced harridan in her fifties i iho enters the office carrying
wrapped package and is instantly shoved into
a corner with the other prisoners
on the street the w
bass drum booms closer as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square
people and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band
and group of believers following the
in a formation that is almost as rigid as
their song and their faces
the parade moves toward the saloon
they should have been told told what
sus t how
long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut
before thornton can answer t
shifts to change position and his hand
touches the tin roof causing him to
yelp with pain
the others snap a look in his
direction then freeze as vector on the boardwalk
sees nothing leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers
after a moment he smiles a little beating time
as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddys shoulders
from the parade grows louder
he looks out behind hi
pike and the others are loading sacks of silver into their saddle bags
they are almost ready to
the paymaster his assistants and the customer their hands still up watch c
trash filthy trash
hush now people marching and singing coming down the street going to pass near the horses
well well just join in
angel turning away hesitates looking up through the window rifles one no three
maybe more on the roof
waiting for us son of a bitch he turns and crosses quickly to the back door
pike opens it a little looks ou
hats they are surrounded
in the office dutch joins pike at the door and looks out then curses softly
how in hell could they have known we were coming
how in hell do i know
where do we go
out front thats where the horses are
he shuts the door crosses toward the paymaster
we go ing
out back mr
no son we got company there too as the boy looks at him besides when i travel i like my feet to dangle
indicating the prisoners i kill em now
after a moment no
you just hold them here and wait as long as you can after the shooting starts
hold am till hell freezes over or you say different
pike pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him hesitates
then continues to
the door grabs the handle looks back again
singing to himself happy as a clam
dutch angel and the others look at pike
they are ready
pike jerks open the door
kicks the terrified paymaster out into the street
midst of the band
screaming as the gunfire cuts him down
the marchers are frozen for a brief instant then scatter in terror as the roof
rtjnning to their horses
through the screaming terrified marchers
into the office
the sound of the band is drowned out by gunfire and screams
frowns a little
they was playing gather at the river
you know that one
as they quickly nod assent then sing it z and they do all of them their voices rising
with fervor and c
joins them marching up and down
waving the shotgun in time to the music
cover some collide with the bandits
some hit by the cross fire fall wounded in the dusty road
to the street
angel and lyle both firing rapidly almost simultaneously kill
man and then another
two others are wounded by the bandits fire
bandits mount their plunging horses
thornton tenses recognizing pike
he hesitates then lifts his gun to fire
hesitates recognizes deke then snaps off a shot which misses thornton and kills shep a bounty hunter firing beside him
thornton fires and
is hit and falls into the street
the wild bunch swing onto their horses and wheel them around i but two are hit burt is barely able to control his hors theother abe dies with his animal
pike mounts and gallops headlong into the frantic crowd some
of his men
following others splitting off in different directions
two lie dead in the street
stops looks out a the window laughs with delight at the excitement turns
he lifts his shotgun yells for them to halt
in the street frank wounded earlier falls froi hi s horse dumping his laden saddle bags
foot hangs in the stirrup and his horse drags him after the others
the horse is shot and goes down frank struggles to his feet is out down as then spurs through the crowd past frank and into the tent
horse man and tent go down in a cloud of dust and canvas
then the horse
dutch still in the saddle rises breaks clear and races away
a woman blind with terror spins to the ground as she runs into pike i s horse as it slides to a halt as pike a turns to help dutch
a terrified child stands and holds its ears screaming as the horses thunder past
on the roof a the bounty hunters continue firi ng ignoring harrigan and thornton
as they try to stop them kicknr g t b ir rifles aside dragging them
away from the wall but the
r fight them off and
the cloud of dust that covers the shambles of the ambush and ride for the edge of town
on another street a citizen aims a pistol and fires
the shot hits
i burts horse causing the animal to careen wildly
it crashes through the railing and falls throwing burt through the glass window of a store
the birdshot catches buck in the face
he screams and reels in the saddle
gorch kills the boy with one shot
and rides on
buck hangs desperately onto the horn as his horse follows the others
on the roof tho rnton and harrigan finally force the bounty hunters to cease firing after the wild bunch
pulls up his horse and wheels around to see if they are being followed kicking loose a ladys shawl tangled in his stirrup
nobody is following not yet
pike spurs his horse and rides away the others following
the six bandits remaining are pike dutch the gorch brothers angel and buck now blinded
the carnage left by the gtjnfi it women and children are sobbing hysterically while townspeople move among the dead and dying ineptly trying to help
thornton looks at the shambles then turns away sickened and slowly follows as the bounty hunters scramble down from the roof
around the office humming softly
dead bandits followed by harrigan
thornton moves slowly behind them cursing
softly as he
watches the men rush to bodies like a
puck of wild
dogs in a gut wagon they smell
blood and have forgotten the leash
coffer and the southerner
nash are stripping the pockets of one body while arguing over whose shot killed the man
harrigan runs toward them
well just dig it out and see
if it aint my
s pointing to the paymaster you stupid damn fools
how could you shoot this employee and let the others get away
i didnt shoot that old
my first shot killed this man
overlapping crossing to another body hes lying
him and them others was shootin that old employee full of holes while i was droppin this bandit and them others too i mustve killed all three of em sir
interrupting him as t
and the others protest harrigan
he shot the old an maybe we all did
crossing to him but by god the next time you plan your massacre a little more carefully or ill begin it with you
youll begin a trip back to yuma prison if you dont learn to keep your mouth shut l why in hell didnt you kill pike when you had the chance
but thornton doesnt answer he turns listening to shall we gather at the river where bright angels rise and fall shall we gather at the river when the works all
done next fall
by simpkins the town marshal and trombonist in the w
band fray his deputy and the bounty hunters
sprawled bodies of the assistants and margaret are near the back door
turns as the men burst in c
shall we gather at the river tho
rnton fires and c
staggers falls to one knee
the shotgun dragging on the floor his face mirroring shock and surprise
well howd you like to kiss my sisters black cats ass
slumps goes down on the other knee
more bounty hunters burst into the room
and everybody dives for cover and opens fire riddling him with bullets
but he takes the marshal the deputy and one bounty hunter with him before he is cut to pieces
harrigan and thornton looking down at the shambles in the room turn as and irate townspeople
benson a beefy redneck rancher curses bitterly as he crosses to harrigan
were holding you your whole damned rail road responsible for this carnage mr
o almost screaming innocent people are dead
women mangled dying because you used our town as a battlefield youre going to pay sir your railroad is going to pay for our blood blowing up without the railroad
this place would still be a lousy little pueblo so dont make any threats to me topping him you cant ambush innocent people
on our street
we were preventing a robbery and
attempt ing to capture a band of outlaws
you lured that gang in here
the rail roadts been blabbing about a big silver payload for weeks we represent the law
more irate citizens burst into the office
thornton moves through them out the door
in the street he stops looking at the dead and dying if it takes vigilantes if it takes federal troops ill stop you and your hired killers
assure you that there wont be any more trouble
my men will follow cutting him off your men enter this town again and they will be shot on sight thornton ignores them slowly rolling a cigarette looking after pike
harrigan exits crosses to thornton
you out of jail to get that bunch and you failed you gave the ordersl if you want the job done right you keep the hell out of it next
time you and the rest of your railroad trash ill do it but my way
makes you think therell be a next time for you
what makes you think youre not going back behind bars for twenty more years
thorntons face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners
because im all youve got then softly because i know him
turning away bitterly because you know ill get him ill kill him rather than go back
he s made a fool of me he never will again
then turning to thornton you know why youre here before thornton can not because youre good because i want him dead at your hands the hands of his old friend
his partner after a moment it get him you have my word
they are weary but determined
buck last in line covered with blood is swaying in the saddle
although severely wounded he still clutches the bags of silver
reaching the bottom of the arroyo the men spur their horses across the d r y stream bed and up the steep bank on
t he other side
up in single file
angel second to last reaches the top turns as bottom still clutching the saddle bags
angel pulls up and calls to pike
buck on his hands and knees moans with pain as he attempts to crawl up the slope
pike rides down to him
swings off eis horse and stands looking down
the blind man hearing him gropes in his direction
buck lurches forward grabbing at pike who steps back pike crosses to his horse and painfully climbs into the saddle
dying almost incoherent with pain i kin still ride
i cant see but i kin ride
then no i cant
then yelling finish it mr
buck on his knees a is caught square by the
sho t and hurled over backwards
he slides several feet over the smooth round pebbles of the wash then is still
pike turns his horse and spurs it
up the slope
the men watch silently as pike rides up
they dont move all looking down at buck
long moment trying to cover the loss you boys want to move on or stay here and give him a decent burial
the sentimentalist well
he was a good man hes dead
and hes got a lot of good men
back there to keep him company
too damn many
to say a
few kind words for all the departed then perhaps a hymn or two would be in order followed by a church supper with a choir
riding away crazy bastards both of you l tector follows his brother cursing
pike and dutch look at each other silently try to grin finally make it then follow
the bunch is attentive but now certain that they are not being closely followed they can relax a little
pike and dutch are side by side
ten years ago it was some shaky drunk with a tin badge that hid in the g n mill till you cleared town with your grab
now theyre c waitin
for you with old friends
pulling back to join them old friends
i thought he was your partner
he was but he got old and tired and when that happens things change
he changed you didnt
the following scenes will be superimposed over and
the suite consists of three adjoining rooms and is very plush indeed two very beautiful young women in revealing night dress are hindering more than helping a somewhat loaded pike
bishop as he attempts to get into his clothes
the ladies are giggling
and there is a great deal of grab ass between the three
b thornton fully dressed and looking very sharp in his big city clothes enters from one of
the adjoining rooms
elizabeth a tall lovely near naked
dark haired girl follows him and takes his arm possessively
for a moment both watch c pikes girlseffectively stop his half hearted attempts and begin disrobing him
come on pardner lets get out of here
grinning at him you
sound like youre all caught up caught up enough to know weve overstayed our welcomes suddenly angry what in hell is the matter with you
stay please weve got money
to spend and not a worry in the worlds theyre not going to look for us in their own backyard how can you be
so damned sure
he shakes off the girl crosses to a sideboard pours a drink
thats my business being sure
there is a knock at the door and
elizabeth throws the bolt
relax just a little champagne i ordered
door and gunfire fills the room as high on the shoulder
is knocked sprawling
the deputy moves into the room followed by three other men and fires at pike but misses as
f pike slips past the screaming women into an adjoining room
the other men pursue
ike as the deputy bends down and snaps thorntons wrists together with handcuffs
the sound of gunfire is heard from the street outside then two of the men re enter the room
the deputy looks up
the man shakes his head
g thornton his face twisted with pain and bitterness makes no attempt ato struggle as he
is pulled to his feet and moved out the door
they are silent riding even lyle is embarrassed by this betrayal
hes had five years on the r ck pile dutch and twenty more to u go that
can hurt a man
after a moment say ive heard its like the
old times in argentina
utch cassidy down
there making a killing
but itll be over there too pretty soon
those pining companies will bring down a bunch of hardcases and butchtll get his
every one of us is worth a year of drinking and whoring to any fool that can read a wanted poster and carry a gun
deke thornton isnt just
any fool that can carry a gun and read a wanted poster
fo but he takes a dim view of more years in the carcel we can hope he aint on
our tail but dont bet on it
tector and i have been stealing since the big depression and we aint never been caught
this thornton dont bother us nohe
i dont really give a damn about deke thornton
i just know that id surely like to aet the hell off
thornton looks at him white with anger then
c ntrols it he is trapped
finally he nods and moves away then stops and turns back his anger almost beyond any control
tell me mr
how does it feel
as harrigan looks at him getting paid for it
stepping closer getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the laws arms around you
how does it feel to be so damned right
after a moment coldly good mr
it feels good
you dirty son of a bitch
grinning at him you have days to get him or days to yuma
youre my judas goat mr
motioning to the bunkhouse use them lead them get pike then kill them off
when you come back i want all of them head down over a saddle
pointing to the bunkhouse all of them a head down over a saddle
as thornton starts to speak days
heturns and walks away whistling
the wild bunch pulls up at the railroad which marks the border and look out into mexico
whats so lindoa about it
the interior of the room is tawdry disorderly and smells bad
the bare walls are decorated with pin ups from the police gazette
the men sit attentively on the bunks
harrigan is marking beside their names in a large ledger book
after making a notation he looks up
the hard money value of the men killed less my commi
sson amounts to
one hundred and fifty dollars
the men mumble and shift
harrigan holds up four wanted posters
the bounty hunters move closer for a better look
lyle and tector gorch
are worth a total of four thousand five hundred dollars and you let them all ride outs after a moment any oneof these pelts would not only clear you with
but would mean a bundle of cash to raise hell with
harrigan stands crosses to the door
bout a little liquor money for tonight mr
there wont be any tonight you move after them in ten minutes turning back get them get pike and youtre rich
but if one of you quits on me ill pay a thousand dollar bonus to the man who kills him
the men silently begin to pack their belongings
harrigan motions to thornton then exits
harrigan and thornton walk away from the bunkhouse into the deserted railroad yard
why should i let you go with them
wevebeen over that before mr
you could just ride off even join him again youd like that wouldnt you
what i like and what i
need are two different things
listen i dont want to go back to prison mr
not ever but it
has to be my way
i need good men you saw what happened today
youll use what you have
and youll see it doesnt happen again or ill see you dead or rotting for the rest of you try your life behind bars to run ill be after you
and so will
i gave you my word
well see what its worth five minutes
just more of texas as far as im concerned
you have no eyes
and he rises ahead with pike anddutch across the tracks into mexico
his gloved hand then looks up at the eight bounty hunters who are sitting on their horses watching him
ly v all rightt
how many of you killed this one
i knowed i wounded three but i wasnt sure about as the others yell in jabali
jabali an aging navaho indian trots up to
this pelt should clear you up take him back to town
and tell harrigan to get me a list of every army garrison and payroll schedule on the border
others crossing to his horse we got another half hour of light and they might be just up ahead counting their money
a young boy takes their horses while an old
man and his wounded son the father of the boy watch
behind them an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas into shape
two small children watch big eyed
the men are quiet with fatigue as they dismount and tie
j their horses
freddy sykes a skinny old man in tattered range clothes crosses to pike as he unloads his saddle bags
them others aint comin
after a moment none of em
pike takes the bags out of the corral to the fire that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho watches as the others do the same
joining him again worried but i got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said they wont need them we will
sykes thinks this over finally nods
a little and turns away
lyle and his brother and dutch stand in a half
circle around the poncho
angel the last drops his saddle bag then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest
for a long moment the men look down
a t the pile of saddle bags
about the sharing up
the sharing ups going to be the some as always
whining pointing to tector and i don
t like the idea of him getting the same as us
hes just starting out and this is our stake for new territory
pike looks at him silently
he has heard this kind of argument many times in the past and it is obvious he is sick to death of it
lyle finally looks awa at his brother and i figure a share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much
ll pike takes a knife out of his belt opens a saddle bag
takes out a sack of silver kneels to slit the bag open
you hear me pike
i said it aint fair
flips the knife into the ground faces the brothers
if you two boys dont like equal shares why in hell dont you just take it all
they look at him silently
dutch drifts away a little to tie side of pike
asykes moves out of the background a buffalo gun now dangling from one arm
the brothers tense
angel laughs softly
almost a whisper well
why dont you answer me you dapnned yellow
the brothers fide et
look at each other
pike you know
his voice a whip i dont know a damned thing except i either lead this bunch or i end it right now no sir we divide just as you say
pike looks at them a moment then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag and turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread out poncho
watching as the group is silent in disbelef staring at the pile of worthless steel
hykes eases up takes a cautious look
rings steel rings
more washers pour out
under his breath son of a bitch
lyles boot flashes into the pile
the washers fly in all directions
lyle whirls on pike
we shot our way out of that town for a dollars worth of steel holes
he kicks into the pile and scatters washers across the clearing
they set it up
who the hell is they
laughing cackling they
by they are just plain and fancy they
dancing around them his high laughter splitting the night caught you didnt they
tied a tin can to your tail didnt they
lead you in and waltzed you out oh my what a bunch big tough ones standing around with a handful of holes a thumb up your ass and a big
grin to pass the time of day with
tectorswings at him but the old man ducks then falls and rollsaway still laughing
tector startsto follow pike stepsbetween them
railroad men pinkertons bounty deke thornton
in disbelief deke thornton
he was with
as pike doesnt answer how come you didnt know
all turn as the sound of laughter comes from behind
to tector hey gringo you take my share
before he can draw angels
expression turns serious and a gun is suddenly in his hand covering the big outlaw
angel smiles again
then pleads mockingly
dont kill me gringo
take my share of the silver but dont kill me please
tector tenses almost snarling with rage
k for it i tector looking at angels gun half turns to pike
continuing softly go on fall apart
lyle and tector hesitate their hands on their guns dutch moves back into the shadows of the firelight his rifle drifting across tector
angel smiles and slowly replaces his gun
lets walk soft boys
tector looks at pike dutch angel t
hen slaps his gun into his holster and moves away but his hand is never far from the weapon
into his coat lifts out a bottle
sits by the fire and handsit to dutch
dutch sits by sykes takes a drink offers the bottle to tector tector hesitates then hunkers down and drinks
slowly the others
as the bottle moves around whats our next move
agua verde is the closest three days maybe then we sell the extra stock get some griib and the news and drift back to the border maybe a payroll maybe
abank maybe that damned railroad that railroad sire bsi hell aint getting ny easier
a and we aint getting any younger
for a moment it looks like hell get a smart answer in return then lyle drinks and lifts the bottle to angel who
drinks and passes it to sykes
we got to start thinking beyond our guns theft days are closin fast
without malice all your fancy planning and talk damn near got us shot to pieces for
some lousy bags of washers
now this was goin
to be our last job before we head south
we spent all our time and money getting ready for this
you spent your time and money running whores in hondo while i spent my stake setting it up
lyle calmly picks up a washer flips
it to or at pike who catches it looks at it through it drinks tosses it back on the pile
looks like id have been better off running whores than making plans stealing horses and buying uniforms
the men are silent for a long moment
then they break into soft laughter which builds slowly
after a moment he
he was making plans while me and tector was he breaks up and cant continue
his laughter growing while you was getting your bell rope pulled by standing almost choking by two mind you two hondo whores while pikes dreaming of washers youre matching two
of them in tandem and the wild bunch falls apart in laughter even pike is caught but as he laughs he knows that they are together again
how close you figure we are
not close enough
theyre across the border by now
deke you rode with
pike what kind of a man are we up against
after a long moment softly the best
thornton cont td hes never got caught
after a moment and he wont be if you boys dont learn your trade
how was it then mm as thornton looks at him you know in the old days
i only come out here last spring
after a long moment you can saddle up or shut up take your choice after a long moment what will he do
thats what i have to figure
maybe theyll split up
no not that
theyll try again
how do you know
but thornton doesnt answer
pike and dutch are side by side in their blankets listening to angel play the guitar
for several moments they are
silent then didnt you run some kind of mine in sonora
yeah i helped run a little copper nothing for us there except day wages if it was running now which it aint
pike finds it
impossible to get comfortable
groaning and wincing with pain he shifts on the bedroll
why in the hell did you ever quit it
why in hell are you still goin
t know any better maybe dont want any better then after a moment hell i wouldnt know what to do with better if it poked me
in the eye with a sharp stick
laughing softly you never gave it a chance pike
i threw away more chances in one year that you will see in your whole
ife but that dont mean you have
to be a damn fool like me
dutch sits up rolls and lights a cigarette
you got a halfway hard mouth partner
what in hell do you want me to say
just dont give me no lectures
they are silent finally this was going to be my last too
im not getting around any better like the red haired lady said to the
white haired judge i only got so many miles left in my backside your honor and i aim to keep it moving while im still young enough to feel
what its there for
s dutch laughs softly id like to make a good score
then back off
back off to what
as pike doesnt answer any real ideas for a next one
pike closes his eyes and leans back
got men spread over the whole border
everyone of those garrisons is going to be
that kind of information is kind of
rough to come by
sitting up well i dont figure its going to be easy but it can be done
theyll be waiting for us
i wouldn t have it any other way
most of the bounty hunters are asleep onlythornton and cof fer are awake
thornton sits up
begins to roll a cigarette
if hes in old mex do we follow him
hell be back
harrigan said something about thirty days
after a moment thats what he said you must have hurt that railroad pretty bad they spent a lot of time and money getting that ambush set up for us
smiling at the memory well i caught up to them two or three times there was a man named harrigan he had a certain way of doing things so i
made him change his ways when you do that to a narrow man he cant live with it from then on hes got to change you break you just to prove hes
right there s a hell of a lot of people dutch that just cant stand to be wrong
pride i guess i guess but they cant ever forget it that pride that being wrong or learn by it
after a long moment and you and me did we learn being wrong today
well i surely hope to god we did
sykes crosses to pike gives him a cup of coffee moves away whered you find him
cont softly that toothless old wreck was a real gun about twenty years back used to run with thornton and me killed his share and more around langery ambushed stages
all along that old board highway
he had those swede immigrants so scared theyqd starve rather than go to town and by beans for their kids and there wasnt a sheriff in
the territory to take issue he laughs drinks the coffee and gags
and he aint changed only now he does his killing with a coffee cup
dutch laughs and then both lean back listeningas
angel wrapped in his serape leaning against the wall plays the great ranchero songs of old mexico
and tector are also awake and listening
softly pike i wouldn
t have it no other way aither
thetop of a high dune
they are tired and dirty
near the edge they dismount to lead their horses to the bottom
the sand is loose and the footing extremely difficult as they start down in single file sykes is last he leads his own horse a pack animal and three of
suddenly sykes slips and loses his footing
he falls pulling the five horses down with him
unable to control his slide he collides with tector who is next in line
tectors fall starts a p fain reaction in which all the men slide to the bottom of ttle hill
picking up speed they tumble to the bottom and land in a giant cloud of
is a profusion of coughing and swearing as the men and animals struggle to their feet
curses at sykes
then picks up a
stone and throws it at
the old man who is hit and falls backward
leave him alone
hats goin to get pis killed get rid of him
his anger growing we don
t get rid of nobody we stick together just like it used to be when you side aman you stay with him shaking him if you cant do that youre
worse than some animal youre finished were finished all of us
tector looks at him silently
pike turns to mount the horse
placing his foot in the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on
the leather breaks and
he falls under the animal
landing on his back he lets out a loud shriek
the other nen look down at him as teem mount
dutch ready to mount his horse hesitates but doesnt move to help
pike struggles to his feet
none of them move forward to help him and he doesnt expect them to
he is visibly miserable as he recovers the reins of his animal and tears off the
lyle and tector grin a little
sykes turns away
pears brother pike needs help brother lyle
riding with brother pike and old man sykes makes a man wonder if it aint time to pick up his chips and find another game
suddenly yelling at pike how in hell are you going to side any body if you cant get on a horse
pike looks at them then steps onto the makeshift stirrup and mounts concealing his pain taking a few seconds to gather up the reins and position himself
in the b
dutch swings onto his horse
were about two hours from the santa caterinas
he turns and rides toward the mountains the men following
that was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys bout stickin to gether
as pike doesnt
that gorch was near killin me or me him damned old fool like mes not worth
we started together well end it together
by god thats the way i see it thats the way its always been with me
sorry bout deke never figured him that way then as pike doesnt answer back in
rafael my boy how d
they ride for a while in silence as pike
thinks this over finally
your boy c
clarence lee my daughters boy not too bright but a good boy he handle higself all right
i told him you do just what mister bishop says did he conduct hisself well
after a long moment he did fine why didnt you tell me he was your grandson
well you had enough on your mind he had to pull his weight just like the rest of us just wanted to know he didnt let you down run
when things got hot after a moment no he did fine
thorn ton and the bounty hitters follow the wild bunchs trail
they are hot and tired and with the exception of thornton
coffer pulls up calls to thornton that culvert good place for them to make an ambush
go on ride up and find out
coffer hesitates his ayes wide with fear
thornton draws his gun pulls back the hammer
go onl coffer rides forward
to the others next time i want advice from any of you scum ill ask for it until then keep
your mouths shut and do what y ou re to ld turning back calling all clear into the shade the others follow suit
from here on its mexico mr thornton
do we follow
whats the closest town of any size agua verde maybe two or three days
then pointing in the apposite direction juarez five six days hard riding whats in agua verde
mexicans what else
then quickly as thornton turns on him headquarters for huerta regulars
fighting obregon led by an old time bandit named mapache
thornton thinks about this then mounts and rides back in the direction they have come from
dont we follow
no we wait
how long a mr
twenty eight days
destroyed hacienda san carlos a day the bandits are riding undera broad sky across through a destroyed pueblo filled with silent ghostlike people four or five crying children vultures and
four men hanging from a tree
in the distance is a high range of mountains
angel spurs his horse and rides up beside pike
to pike were not going to find much down here
that damned huerta s scraped it clean
in spanish may he die the death of a thousand traitors
then my village is up there
in those mountains
i wish to visit my f amily
i can do it and meet you in agua verde a day of ter you get there
going this way you will
have to turn east when you get south of the range
i know the way to cross the mountains
if you know a shorter way
angel looks away and is silent for several seconds
ashamed of having us meet your people
they don t know about zny life when i am out of the village
pike and dutch both laugh softly then pike pulls up at a
watering trough and dismounts as his horse begins to drink
far as ifm concerned you can go dismounting joining far as im concerned he goes he dontt come back
that sounds right to me
looks like im outvoted
whatfs the problem
wants to visit his folks alone thinks were a little rank for his people
as tector drinks beside his horse i think he can go straight to hell
probably wants to get a bunch of his people and waylay us
and take what
tector thinks this over doesnt answer
to angel how do you want it
after a long moment i invite you to my village my home
then looking at tector and lyle any violence any disrespect and i will
tector and lyle look at him without expression for a moment then
you got a sister
i would be proud to
make her acquaint ance and
that of your mama too
trying not to laugh and your grandmaw too sonny
angel looks at them then mounts rides toward the mountains thornton and his bounty hunters are riding back past the place where buck died
the men are sullen
some almost openly defiant
we go back with our tail between our legs harrigan will have our hides
theyll be coming back and well be waiting for them
we was supposed to go after them thornton reins up looks at coffer who looks quickly away
you have something to say
coffer instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head
then after a moment they say freddy sykes is with them you rode with the old man didnt you mr
thornton you and pike and the old man
but thornton rides on and doesnt answer
tector and lyle are seated on the ground trying to duplicate the intricacies oa a very complicated cats cradle demon strated to them by rocio the lovely bright eyed year
old sister of angel
both men are drinking tequilla but both are sober entranced and completely dominated by the girl
all three straighten as carmen angels mother calls from a nearby fire where she is preparing food with her mother
miha trigame auga
por los frijolesl the girl jumps to her feet hands both men a bucket or olla and leads
them down the bank to the river
the natural beauty of this location should contrast with other landscapes in the picture
this village and its inhabitants represent a complete and green contrast to the arid world of the wild bunch
few feet away
angel watches dully
his eyes mirroring his agony
pike laughs softly watching
hard to believe
not so hard we all dream of being a child again even the worst of us perhaps the worst most of all
looking at him you know us then i know myself only where i have been what i have done
like to ride with us old man
and for a moment the old mans eyes flash as he watches dutch and threevillagers shoeing a very small very mean l
all four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling
i am too old
almost cursing indicating too old even to ride beside this ancient gringo
hell you aint so old partner
and the soldier
who shot my father what was his name
they were many who shot your father resisted like a man and died like a man names in this matter have no importance
to pike proudly i killed one as pike looks at him i lie i ran joe by god i like you
i like a man who tells the truth
and the leader how was he called
after a moment mapache
troops they don
protect you they were federal troops commissioned by the traitor huerta seven of the village were killed
our horses and cattle and corn stolen all in the name of huerta the killer of our president francisco i
madero in mexico senor these are the years of sadness
after a long moment and teresa
they took her
no she went with them because she wished to
she became the woman of mapache and others she went with them laughing drunk with wine and love
angel knowing its true turns and moves away
pike looks after him
pike who drinks
to him she was a goddess
to be wor shipped from afar with music and flowers a deity to be followed and adored at a dis nee but mapache knew she was a mango ripe and
so angel lives with a dream while mapache eats the mango just so you have been there with the dream
many times and with the mango too
you just bet he has joe
i never could carry a candle to you old timer
to pike and
which do you prefer the dream or the taste
i dream when i sleep and eat when im hungry
laughing with sykes just so a the both of you and map ache and i
angel some distance away watches evening come upon the quiet village and watches tector and lyle moving from the pond carrying water now surrounded by a dozen laughing children
dutch and the three old men trying to pound a horseshoe an the mule
his mother and grandmother and other village women now basting a kid cooking over the coals and pike
sykes and his grandfather laughing in the ramada
angel turns away his eyes suddenly blind with tears
then turns and crosses to his grandfather
where is mapache
thornton leads the bounty hunters along the rails toward the bunkhouse
they have been riding a long time
the men are tired and bitter
suddenly coffer draws his gun and points it at thorntons back
for a moment it
looks as if he will shoot then thornton pulls up sharply
and kicks his
horse to one side as stands waiting
coffers gun has disappeared
ride ahead all of you
and they do riding toward harrigan as we
most of the village is gathered around three or four fires eating the young goat meat
drinking tequilla and mescal watching
tector and lyle dance a mexican virginia reel as sykes blows accompaniment with harmonica along with two of the local guitar players
and linda jump up and
dance with the gorch brothers learning the steps from the willing if surprisingly bashful teachers
young girl seated between him and dutch
the fire raises his voice and repeats the question
you must tell me
where map ache
laughing softly to himself finally turns his smile fading
why do you wish to know for your father or the whore
pike looks up as angel fights within himself to find an answer it doesnt make any difference kid our business is in agua verde for a moment angel looks like
he will explode then he lifts a bottle of tequi
lla in salute to pike
as you say jefe to agua verde and our business
pike and the other it n are watering their horses under the shade of several large trees in the main plaza of agua verde
the town itself is dull and sun colored like
the surrounding country
its most remarkable features are a great deal of soldiers exiting and entering a cantina like building and a small aging ornate church
sykes purchases a taco from a small boy and gums at it while the contents run into his beard
pike lifts a stirrup from his saddle on the hitching rail and examines the repair then puts it on his horse
and lyle squat in the shade working at making a cats cradle
angel is talking quietly to three mexican peons some distance away
the building and joins pike
all soldiers not a bounty hunter in sight
have a drink then try and sell the horses
s going to buy looks to me like
this place has been picked clean
joining pike hes been here the horses put their ears back and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene
the men snap their heads
around and look at street towards the plaza
inside is the almost ghostlike appearance of a or touring car
four mounted men are riding on each side and a host of small
children are running screaming behind it
the mounted guards
take up positions around the vehicle
the group shows deference to a large man wearing generals braid
next to him is his second in command zamorra
the third man dressed in white linen is mohr a german military advisor
with him is ernst his aide
pike and the others watch with interest as the men enter a cantina like building
then without a word they cross the
street drawn to the vehicle
angel is tense knowing that his man has arrived
i seen one just like this in waco
run on steam
freddy sykes edges up close to pike
he is anxious to make a
statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car
i heard about one they got up north that
kin fly pike nods sagely
ctor gorch on the other side of the car hears the remark
that was a balloon you damned old fool
the old mans right
they got t em now with motors and wings cover miles in less than an hour
goin to use them in the war they say
as t ector looks at him astonished this could cover
miles in an hour cording to the road of course
that could run a horse right into the ground
not that easy these automobiles cant stand
any rough ground or hot sun like a horse theyre for show mostly
tector touches a fender and one of the guards spurs toward him cursing in spanish
tector backs off
hands in the air
i was just going to touch th
e damn thing not marry it
un gigante de miquina ha de tenor una fuerza tremenda
a giant of a machine what force it must have la fuerza
the force of horses
y el dueno un general por lo menos
and the owner a general at least
mis que un general un hombre hecho para reinar todo mexico si dios quiere
more than a general a man to
rule all of mexico if god wills
youre here with us pardner any business you got with the general comes after we finish ours and that is selling horses
after a moment shrugging as you wish
he turns away pike grabs him jerks him back you make
one move to trouble and ill kill you understand we stick together
before angel can answer angel who does this thing belong to
with due respect es el carrazo oficial de
su excelencia el generalisimo mapache
dutch turns smiling and tells the others
the official carrazo of the pache generalisimo
lets get some beer and talk to the general about his automobile and our extra horses
nice and easy
the men turn and follow him into the cantina
hacienda filled with mexicans wearing the uniforms of huerta s counter revolutionary army and their ladies a small mariachi band wanders among the
songs of the era
in certain areas horses are stabled
a blacksmith shop is working guns are being repaired knives and bayonets sharpened
and food is being cooked for the troops by their women
are very evident
mapache and his group are seated at a table which is in a covered area raised above the others
it is obvious from
his position and respect accorded him that he is the local boss of the area
the german officer mohr and ernst are sitting on one side of him
lieutenant zamorra is seated on the other side
herrera is close by
pike and the others move towards a corner of the cantina eyeing the mexicans with the kind of caution that men who are vastly outnumbered generally show
they sit quietly at a table ignoring the suspicious looks of the soldiers
at mapaches long table the general and the germans watch them with pointed interest
mohr nudges mapache and asks who they are
mapache shr ugs he doesnt know emma a pretty waitress crosses to pikes table to take their order
six cervesas como
angel remains silent looking at the general
the girl leaves to get the order
the men at the table look around the cantina
at a nearby table a group of men are throwing dice and laughing loudly
the mariachis are gather ing around mapache
lyle shifts in his chair to look at them
mapache is laughing and drinking
leans close to zamorra and speaks in spanish
do you know these americans
the german settles back in his
begins placing a cigarette in a holder
in the cantina
the other men tired from the trail only half listen to them as the girl serves beer
probably talking about us behind our backs
dutch turns to pike who is quaffing a large beer
im down to about twenty in silver
the g neralisimo has cleaned this part a of the country
he ought to have it to spare
generalisimo hell hes just a damn bandit grabbing all he can for himself
like some others i could mention
no sir we dont
hang nobody or torture them i hope the people here kick him and the rest of the scum like him right into their graves
mapache his eyes burning with hatred
we will if it takes a thousand years then suddenly he reacts to the sound of a girls voice off scene
gustar el alenman angel
spins around in his chair watching as two pretty mexican girls teresa and rasa laughing and giggling pass the table
teresa he reaches out and grabs the better looking of the two by the arm
you know them cuties
teresa recognizes him then pulls away llamo los otros
no vete ahorita vengo pike and dutch tense as angel stands and jerks her toward him let her go
angel looks at the girl furious and hurt
djaste el pueblo si deje el pinche pueblo
y ahora vivo con el generalisimo she jerks away from angel and starts toward the other table
watches her go
in the b
the group of mariachis playing loudly have moved around mapaches table
no one there seems
to have seen the action
take it easy
he places a hand on angels shoulder
to angel que pasa his sweetheart still
watching teresa she was my woman and she left the village
and begins kissing his ear
sure aint your woman no more
just look at her licking that big devils ear
angel watches his rage growing then stands pike goes for him
but too late
in a split second he draws and fires
and hurls her to the floor
the others at the table duck for cover their guns coming out
into the side of his head dropping him onto the floor knock ing him out
the others stand hands an theirguns
mapache and theothers slowly rise look at angel now realizing who shot the girl
mapache starts towards them
he pushes over chairs and shoves people aside as he approaches the group
zamorra the germans and other members of his retinue are close on his heels
up to thetable and quickly scans the group
angel gets to his knees mapache kicks him in the
head and when angel
falls back stamps him several times with his boot steps away
one of mapaches men starts to bash angels head with a rifle butt
mapache stops the man with a gesture
then turns to the others
qua basura es este
why did he try to kill his excellency
he didnt he was
after the girl
mapache is having difficulty understanding
he looks at zamorra with a puzzled expression
era su novia the mexicans immediately respond to dutchs explanation
amorra and mapache smile
he went a little crazy when he saw her with you
his ego is pleased with the idea that
he had taken someones woman
he turns and explains grandly in spanish to the rest of
mato su vieja porque salio con el mapache the soldiers in the cantina laugh and ad lib their response
and dutch try to smile as do the gorch brothers and sykes
mohr ignores them looking with interest at the u
army pistols that the men are wearing
to pike are you men in agua verde for business
thought we might sell a few horses
you must have been associated with the american army is that riot so
tector and lyle snicker slightly at the remark
mapache and zamorra turn listening carefully to the conversation
the cantina is silent
no were not associated with anyone
was curious because of
the equipment which you are carrying
as they look at him that pistol is restricted for useby army personnel
it cant be purchased or even owned
is that so
youre surprised at my interest
then as pike doesnt answer weapons are a specialty of mine
mohr bows his head slightly and clicks his heels barely audib y i am commander frederick mohr of the imperial german
for the last six months i have been in mexico helping fight against the revolutionaries
angel on the floor is conscious but uimoving
listening to what is being said
several of mapaches men stand around him
unfortunately your government has chosen to aid the rabble in their so called struggle for liberty
never heard of any american troops fighting down here
they are aiding in diplomatic channels
it would be very useful to us if we knew of americans who did not share their governments naive sentiments
we have vez yfew sentiments in common with our government
xn spanish generalisimo i think we should ask these gentlemen to have a drink with us
and pike understanding
that much spanish smiles as we
trumpet as he looks at the body of teresa being dragged out
rosaare still very much in evidence
at mapaches table pike dutch lyle tector and sykes are all seated at the raised table on the dais
mapache seated at one end is tired and looks half asleep
in the b
angel can be seen still on the floor
a couple of guards are sitting near him
are spread out on the table
emma and rosa crying softly watch as the dead body of the girl
is dragged through a door at one end of the room
zamorra is seated
next to the german listening intently of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is the easiest to hit but ive got to figure where we can get out with
he points to a place on the map looks at dutch who shrug doubtfully to zrmorre why do you want us to hit a train thats so close to the
the general could take an army up there and get it
president huerta is anxious to better relations with the u
not destroy them
arms shipments are generally
kept secret how did you find out about this one
mapache has a superb intelligence force
indicating mohr organized under the supervision of my superior officer
drinking laughing gentlemen
we are quite well organized and well able to pay in gold
asa they react if you are not able to do the work we will find someone else as the others react i we can do it but were going to
need special equipment
our accountant will arrange everything
smiling at mapache soon you will be the best armed general in mexico
mapache raises his glass in a toast a la conquistat
pike nudges lyle who raises his glass the other men follow suit
mohr smiles and elegantly raises a drink
prosit a i pike and dutch
drink put down their glasses
with your permission
i need a bath
with my permission you all need a bath
i dont need no bath
tector and me needsome of them senoritas
to zamorra how bout that boy can you fix us up
zamorra yells to juan
jose an aide standing nearby
traeles unas viejas
gentlemen you will excuse me im sure
dutch follows pike to angel where they lift him off the floor
we better get him cleaned up
mapache crosses quickly to them drawing his gun
por favor general but i need him
i give you someone much better
i choose my own
zamorra joins mapache looks at pike whose hand is close to his
gun turns to the general
mi jefe deje que se lo lleven
mapache replaces his gun
it is not important to me take him
looks away as and lucha
and react with delight
here come our sweeties
laughing softly more than enough to go around
as one girl sits on his lap and then some
he turns and beckons to pike and dutch who with sykes are carrying angel out of the saloon but they ignore him
munition schedules and naps
the other bounty hunters are scattered around the car grumbling about the inaction
and you want to gamble everything this one shipment will be attacked
if theyre in agua verde thats what theyll go for
why not juarez
because we would have heard
then patiently if they are in agua verde they will have seen mapache
who in the hell is mapache
a killer for huerta who calls himself a
with enough guns he can become a power in northern mexico my guess is pike will try and get them f or a him
the train will be guarded by regular troops
green recruits and not
worth a damn
ill need twenty trained men not recruits or this gutter trash you
ve given me
youll get the job done with what you have thatp our bargain
then looking at the twenty four days
genter of an adobe steam hut
the structure is about twenty five feet in diameter with a small
open oven in the center surrounded by a great deal of rocks
light comes in through a tiny hole in the center of the ceiling which also allows smoke to escape
pike angel and dutch are sitting on a bench against one wall
angel has been cleaned up but looks beaten
sykes is in one corner thoroughly enjoying himself
the men are all nude and stark white against the mud
color of the walls
as the woman exits dutch stands and empties a bucket of water over himself and the others
they all gasp with relief
all have towels around their waists and none are completely sober
pikes leg is heavily scarred and he is in pain
he stands and drinks gets closer to the fire massaging his leg
i dont see how you stand it some day im going to build me one of these and live in it
then to angel i dont know why i a didn t just let him kill you
im not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again
i didnt see no tears runnin down your face when you rode in from san rafael
they were not my people nor yours i care about my people my villag
angel gets up off the bench and dumps a bucket of water on his head
pike looks at
both drink from a bottle
listen bog you ride the trail with us your village dont count if it does you jest dont go along
then i dont go along
pike and dutch look at angel through the steam
one load of guns isnt going to stop him from raiding villages
you ought to be thinking about all that money youll have
take them a large bag of gold when its over
a small bag
move them a thousand miles away and buy them a ranch
two three ranches
one a very small ranch
theyll never leave
you see its their land and no one will ever drive them away
sblemnl ill drink to that sentiment and to
love singing softly but when all is said and done i
drink to gold
it is long and narrow and shadowy and lyle tector and their two ladies are exploring it very carefully and with great dignity candles in hand
the dons of spain built this some three hundred years ago he belches then looks about in awe at the huge casks
itm all for them dons
tector suddenly swings a mattox on to a six foot cask which rests on top of two others of equal height it bounces out of his hand
he draws his gun and fires as does lyle
liquid gushes down
a lyle steps under it lifts his face drinks then drags his lady beside him
as the torrent pours over them removing his have a dollop honey theres enough here for both of us
she does tasting the good wine laughing
both are ready to write angel off
and forget about the problem
would you give someone a gun to kill your mother or your father or your brother
dutch looks at pike
pike thinks it over
another pull on the bottle
son twenty thousand cuts a lot of
no you gringos are no different
i have seen how lyle takes care of his brother
he takes the bottle drinks then throws it on the rocks
my people dont have guns so mapache takes the food out of their mouths and clothes off their backs
with guns my village could fight if i could take guns to my people i would go with you but not just for gold the men are momentarily silent
angel lifts a bucket of water spills part of it on his head passes it to sykes who drinks a little of the water spits it out puts the bucket
down pours two bottles of tequilla into it drinks
again smiles passes it to angel who drinks and passes it on
wed need is for el mapache to find out we armed some village
let him find out
bishop as p i ke looks a t him you know as well as i there aint no way of collecting from mapache cept off a lot of dead bodies
mostly ours the way he thinks
pike considers this looks at the old man finally nods
i would take guns
if mapache found out you would say i stole them how many cases of rifles did zamorra say were in that shipment
give him one
after a long moment you can have one case and one case of ammo youll give up your share of the gold
hell have to show up with us
when we deliver
they all turn as tector and
lyle and their ladies enter somewhat wet and stained with wine
awkwardly i d like
you to meet my fiancee
tears in his eyes they just got engaged
for a moment the group is frozen looking at the
bride to be her bridesmaid and the best man
then all stand
together and bow
pleasure ma ain
tanto gusto senorita
mucho gusto senorita
softly to himself
son of a bitch
trot them on in boys i m hell on packin mules but im a delight with a pretty girl
tector and lyle and their girls look at him as both pike and dutch nearly fall off the bench laughing too hard to drink their health as we with barrels
driven by sykes
the others are riding
the walls of the arroyo tower above the men
pike is tense in the saddle as the pain in
his leg becomes almost
you never told me how you got all tore up like that
pike reflects for a moment
his face is almost white
then he reaches in his saddle bag and pulls out a bottle
he drinks passes the bottle to dutch
i met a woman i wanted to marry
pike grins a little at what now seems an absurd thought
kitchen v night of groceries and too much to drink
c aurora stands waiting for him
she is very beautiful and very angry
buenas no the s mi amor
aurora swings and catches him full handed across the face the groceries scatter on the floor pike bounces off the wall
looks at her tries to grin
your husband due back
no never you are late two days late
pike is startled by this starts to protest realizes it is true tries to make apologies
aurora turns and stalks off
d pike is shoving pots and pans around attemptingto cook dinner while aurora sits watching stony faced until he turns away then she can hardly keep from giggling
you need help
he picks up a pan with a hot handle drops it spilling hot stew or soup on his foot hops around cursing looking at the shambles on the stove and
on the floor
dd aurora stands looking at him with love then smiling softly crosses to the side board and pours him a drink
he takes it suddenly both are laughing
suddenly pike embraces her and pulls her to the bed
they begin to make love then the door smashes oun and luke a skinny bad mouthed texan steps into the room a double barreled shot gun in his hands ready
aurora screams and throws herself in front of pike
luke fires the charge killing her as pike dives out of bed jumping for his gun on a nearby table
luke fires again the blast catching pike across the thigh and knee
pike goes down
luke crosses to the bed and sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the floor
she had a husband and i should have had enough sense to kill him
he wasnt around and i got careless
one night he
walked in on us got her with the first shot
he caught me here with the second then the damndd coward turned and ran
you didnt catch up with him
not yet but there hasnt been
a day or an hour that i havent thought about getting him he didnt want that woman he just
wanted to kill somebody well he killed her not me and ill see him dead for it
then yelling back move along freddy weve got a long way to go he turns back to dutch takes the bottle
drinks deeply and puts it away
this is the last go round this time we do it right
a train chugs across the flat stretch of desert
the small steam
locomotive pushes a flatbed and pulls a succession of three cars
another flat a passenger and a cattle
the train moves toward the only object in sight the flat car wearily checking the track for obstructions
on the second flat car two more armed guards sit on crates of weapons and
arnmunition gazing at the passing scenery
are sprawled across the seats near their beefy first sergeant frank mc hale who is snoring loudly
the soldiers horses are roach maned and unsaddled
i at one end of the car the railroad livestock man is asleep on a pile of straw an empty jug at his side
the animals of the bounty hunters are standing saddled with the cinches loosened
the train slows and a few of the soldiers
lift their heads and look out the windows
seeing nothing but the vast empty plain they quickly resume their slumber
the bounty hunters tense
thornton stands looks out
a rickety water tower and tiny maintenance shack no horses wagons nothing
thornton turns back to his seat
fireman climbs out of the cab and onto the tender
he reaches up and grabs the lanyard and lowers the spout
a sawed off shotgun held by angel
the fireman gasps and takes a step back
angel slides off the spout and onto the tender
he covers the fireman and the two man crew
the crew urns and angel smiles aiid puts his
f nger to his l ps then gestures
the firemanand the crew begin to take on grater
pike dutch and lyle step out from behind the maintenance shack and climb swiftly onto the tender
pike slips toward the engine compartment
dutch turns towards the guards on the flatcar behind the engine
lyle scrambles around the engine to handle the two men on the
flat car in front
he whistles an
d they look up
while he covers them angel climbs down from the tender onto the flat car over the crates toward the coupling joining the flat to the passenger car
on the front flat car the two guards turn freeze as lyle moves around
front of the engine and whistles
his shotgun covering
in the cab pike is standing with his hand on the throttle looking up at dutch
at the coupling angel grabs
the pin and starts to pull on it
in the cab pike
wa tc hesi dutch who waves his hand motion ing
pike to ease the train back
pikes hand moves on the throttle
thornton frowns as the car moves slightly
he stands and walks toward the front of the car
through the window on the
door he sees thornton ducks back and starts to draw his
pauses and turns back into the car
silently he gestures to the bounty hunters
the soldiers in the back of the car continue to sleep as thornton and his men move past them toward the horse car
reaching the sergeant still snqring loudly thornton hesi tates then decides against it and enters the horse car
the engine and
tender and flat car pull slowly away from the passenger and cattle car
a man jumping a horse out of the cattle car
it is one of the bounty hunters
another horse quickly follows
dutch turns and yells
theyre coming gorch on front of the
locomotive whirls around and looks back for an instant as dutch yells
the two guards jump for their weapons
lyle turns back watches them then kills both as they pick up their rifles
tender and the flat car turning in the air catching the tender with his hands and his feet precariously balanced on the coupling
back of the tender
his feet are bracing him on the bounc ing coupling
he is inches above the rail
and grab their guns
dutch lets go and hanging on with one hand manages to get his gun out of the holster
he fires blindly over the edge in tae
and angel whirl at the sound of the shot
pike instantly kicks the engineer and fireman out of the cab then turns toaclimb onto the tender
ahead of him yo v pike hesitates then turns back to the throttle
dutch ducks as shots from the guard splinter wood nearh s face
he is barely able to hang on
is slipping down closer to the rails
hurriedly they enter the cattle car
they remove their horses some trying to resaddle in the car
dutch pulls the trigger and his
the other guard panics and scrambles back over the crates
a second shot catches him in the small of the back hurling him over the edge of the car
angel rushes forward and bracing himself on a stanchion grabs dutch by the jacket and pulls him aboard
the recruits are scrambling around outsi de
some are climbing in through the open door
inside the horses can be heard kicking and neighing
corporal get those men out of that car
get the animals then looking off corporal ride back to the telegraph at todos malos and tell tam that pinkerton gang has robbed the train and we are in pursuit
as the corporal mounts and rides off the sergeant
contin ns to watch thornton leading his men is about a mile and a half behi c
crosses it and suddenly the wheels lock
with a shower of sparks it slides to a stop beside a large wagon on the riverside of the crossing
the bandits scramble off the train and begin loading cases of guns onto the waiting wagon
sykes and tector gorch assist them
the wagon is directly beside the car and the unload ing is very rapid
the cloud of dust of the approaching bounty hunters
he yells down to the men get the guns off and get on out of here he turns and scrambles down inside the cab
outside the men quickly finish loading and the wagon pulls up alongside the cab
not yet i want to return e
ayanks the throttle into reverse and jumps off the locomotive onto the wagon
in the b
the train picks up speed heading back towards the scene of the robbery
in perfect order dutch and angel begin attaching the ropes to the tongue of the wagon as sykes unhitches
li with angel leading the
horses are pulled into the river
large barrels on the side of the wagon serve as floatation gear
the current catches it and begins to swing it on the rope downstream and across the river
the bounty hunters are rapidly closing the gap
in the distance
they can see the bandits now in mid stream outside the cattle car recruits are lined up saddling their horses
sergeant theyre coming back
realizing what is get those horses away from the car
running to the car get them out of there which
is now bucking the saddle hanging under its belly
the other rears as the sergeant yells again
the engines coming
and it is at about forty miles an hour
the sergeant turns and runs
the car by the impact
pike ropes onto the wagon from the front and pulls with his horse
syses is in the drivers seat and dutch is next to him lying prone
on the wagon returning the fire of the bounty hunters
lyle and tector on horseback spur
to the wagon
get on those rear
the gorch brothers scramble down into knee deep water and begin to push
a man staggers out from half cover and drops to his knees dutch fires again and another man drops
the bounty hunters back up
and hunt better cover
puffs on the cigar watching thornton
heave against the wagon slowly moving
it up onto the bank
then a seeing thornton starting across the bridge pike raises his
rifle but the range is far and the wagon has begun to move
thornton forces his terrified animal across the tottering structure then whirls as a bullet whines past his head
the shot has come from behind
above and through the trees he can see the cavalry dismounting and continuing to fire
the bounty hunters whirl around and return the fire
its the army you idiots but his words are drowned out in a volley of firing
some of the soldiers start for the bridge
three or four of the bounty hunters quickly mount and spur on to the bridge after thornton
thornton forces his animal forward stops recognizing pike at the wagon
pike looks at him a moment then yells at his men and pulls the wagon up out of the mud and labor s up the slope angel watches the fuse
burning under the bridge toward the far banks where the bounty hunters are beginning to fall back to the water thornton followed by three other bounty hunters rides forward
angel lights the remaining two fuses mounts and spurs after pike and the wagon
some of the bounty hunters push their horses down the slope ta ward the water away from the soldiers who led by mchale are closely flanking them
the firing is general now
the wagon goes up the rim of a gully then down the other side and out of sight
in the cover of the gully dutch and the gorch brothers mount up and follow sykes up the gully
pike turns his horse spurs back the way he came
at the top pulls
up as angel joins
both turn watch
as five sticks of dynamite go off in the shallow water on the far side of the river among the bounty hunters
horses go down men
are thrown into the river
it is a sham bles
a few bounty hunters struggle dawnstream thornton two thirds across the bridge pulls up looks back as do the three bounty hunters behind him then at the distant figures of
pike and angel
pike lifts his hat i a mocking salute
bridge explodes blowing thorntonand the three bounty hunters into the river finally both turn and ride after the wagon followed by scat tered ineffective shots of the soldiers from following
halt dammit that is mexico and
we cant go there not yet
grouped on the mexican side of the river still wet and dazed from the river
a huge mesquite wood fire is burning in the centre of came and several men have placed boots and articles of clothing around it
three horses unsaddled are tied to a picket line in the b

lyle hands a bottle of whiskey to tector and nudges his horse forward
as he swings off it is obviaeas that he is a little drunk and you better dry out we got no cause to celebrate

he crosses slowly to his horse his weariness showing puts his foot in the stirrup hesitates
pike steps up into the saddle the pain twisting his face
for a long moment no one moves then lyle fulls
a bottle out of his
jumper hands it to pike
pike drinks hands itto sykes who drunks hands it to angel who drinks
hands it with a touch of a smile to tector who hesitates then half grins himself drinks and hands it to lyle
lyle looks at the bottle upends it over his mouth a few drops spill out into his mouth looks at the bottle in disbelief tosses it gently aside
to pike simply itll be a cold day in hell fore i do that again
and suddenly they are all laughing
and they do still chuckling as we
a telegraphoperator snaps awake as a message comes over the wire
as the machine clicks he diligently writes the mes sage
when he is finished he hands it to juan a small
who is dressed in a poorly fitting uniform
porel generalisimo andale
the boy runs out of the building and into the street
many uniformed soldiers are deployed around the train while they load horses into old boxcars also loading are
civilians who are
part of mapaches encampment most climbon top
of the box cars where they set up housekeeping
building f ires cooking food ignoring the sporadic rifle
fire that is beginning to grow in volume as thirty or forty big hatted revolutionaries probe for the weakness of mapaches position at the railroad station
note mapaches soldiers show signs of having recently suf fered a beating and it
is obvious that they are retreating
end of the train where mapachestands looking over the nearby hills with field glasses
beside him are his lieutenants
one mayor perez the two germans and ten or twelve soldiers
one soldier is hit and falls dying
mi general tenemos que irnos
mapache ignores them
juan arushingtoward mapache almost falls as herrera jerks him to a halt
telegrama de san antonio para su exaelencia el general
a telegram from san antonio for his excellency the general
reaching for the yo to llevo a juan pulls it away
understanding his wish to deliver it personally steps aside
juan runs to mapache skids to a halt and salutes
telegrama de san antonio
the general returns the salute solemnly and opens the paper reads it
los gringos se robaron el tren to his companion was sagt er
mapache is obviously pleased
he looks up at the germans
the gringos take the guns
sie haben die geware gestclen
gut patting mapache on the shoulder sehr gut
indicating the approaching villistas it is important this news be kept from villa until the guns are in our hands
beginning to panic as the firing grows we must go shouting towards the mountain in the next time i will
destroy you turning to herrera in spanish send men immediately to meet the guns on the road to agua verde take possession and return here
and if the gringos object
in english my general if they are success ful in this venture possibly they can be useful in others mapache thinks this over turns to herrera
nearby another man is hit and falls
in spanish bring them back with you over come their objections reason with them convince them of our good intentions
herrera in spanish and if they still object
in spanish kill them
herrera salutes and leaves
mapache gestures and the others
quickly jump aboard the train
mapache is the last looking back at the hills with hatred as the villistas charge and we
dutch is lying prone behind some rocks trying a paper cone over the front of a pair of u
pike stands beside him with the cone adjusted he rolls over and looks out across the valley plain broken with arroyos
still heading east
are they bluffing
or did they really miss it
id say they missed it
dutch and pike snake back from the lip of the rocky hill that dominates the area
the wagon is below them hidden in a gully
the other men are lounging underneath it
pieces of brush are tied behind the rear wheels of the wagon to brush away the trail
pike and dutch stand and move back toward the wagon
only five left didnt figure them to come down after us
how much can we be worth
a lot depends on how hungry they are
you stay up there and look for bighats
im going to start
rigging the fireworks
dutch turns crawls back and lifts the glassese pikewalk down near the wagon and
is sleeping his boot
need some help
angel quickly gets to his feet and follows pike
to the wagon
pike reaches into a box near the seat and removes a piece of fuse
get that case of explosives near the back
angel climbs on the wagon
lyle hearing him
crawls out from underneath
his brother also awakens and starts moving around
over his eyes looks up but doesnt move
whatta you want with the dynamite
as they look at i figure the general will plan to collect without payment then kill us if we have
the only reason he might change his mind is if something could happen to these guns
angel hands pike a case of explosives
now im goin to make it real easy for something to happen
l pike sets the box on the ground and pries open the lid
he begins setting the sticks on the ground next to the box
angel gets down and pike hands
him a coil
of baling wire
wrap these in pairs and put a fuse cap between them
angel takes the first two and starts to work on them
lyle watches for a moment then nudges his brother and climbs on the wagon and begins looking over the
one is much bigger than the others and of a different shape
angel and pike arm the dynamite sticks in the shade of the wagon
men from my village will meet us tomorrow
pike looks up angered
you told them about our trail
dont need to tell them
they know where we are
angel puts the charge down and looks off at the horizon
this country has many people but they have learned to live without being seen
aftera moment anyplace where a farmer has a field or a man has sheep in the moun a tains
or a boy watches a herd of goats
there is a noise off screen and they both look up tector and lyle using the heavy bladed bowie knives have pried open the strange shaped box
lyle his eyes bright reaches in
pike take a look you know how to work one of these things
pike stands then grins a little and crosses to the wagon
whatever i dont know im going to learn
the bounty hunters now in an area of badlands have stopped on a small rise and are looking out over miles of the same type of country
i dont know how we lost em except maybe in that big valley where the ground was
there wasnt but one way they could have taken a wagon out of there this here is it
t take it out
we aint gonna make it too much further without something to eat
we didnt lose them i could point to them now
as they whirl looking around sit still dammitl as they quiet you think pike and old sykes havent been watching us you think if we hadnt
turned off they wouldnt just have sat back and let us walk into it six of them hid and all the
and ammunition they need you think i wasnt sweating blood they wouldnt try and hide their trail
they look at him silently almost frightened by his vehemeno e they know what this is all about and
do i have nothin but you damned egg sucking chicken stealing gutter rats with less than rounds of ammunition be tween you listen mr
thornton i dont have to take any talk like that
i dont neither youll take it
you dont even have enough sense to keep your damned boots on
then quietly were after men and i wish to god i was with them
after a moment you make any more mistakes and im going to ride off and let you die
they are silent looking at the ground after a moment thornton turns his horse and rides off slowly
showing the wagon moving into a deep arroyo
pike is now driving
sykes is at the reins of the wagon pike beside him
the horses are at a walk
angel dutchare mounted
the goruh brothers are lying on top of the wagon one on each side of a bulky tarp covered object
looking off hold up
some distance away
seeing the wagon they pull up
pike slides into the front seat next to
without a word
sykes lights his cheroot and pike
reaches behind him and takes the end of a fuse
angel and dutch let their rifles drift over
they dont belong to villa
steps forward and waves his hand
note he speaks english but
badly very badly ho
we are friends

a the mexican turns to his companions for a short discourse
then he turns and
rides toward the men on the wagon
we are friends

pike dutch and the others watch silently as he rides up to the wagon
herrera stops and removes his hat smiles looks at
the heavily loaded wagon
que bueno what bravery you

angel laughs spits herrera
looks at him for a moment smiles shrugs turns to pike
i am to escort you to the general
nobody answers and none of the guns pointed at him are lowered he seems undisturbed
tell me what is you wish
to dutch tell him to come closer
i hear i am coming my friend
herrera still grinning broadly edges his horse closer to the wagon
pike holds the burning end of the cheroot about an inch from the fuse
herrera sees the fuse and quickly follows it back to the wagon with
the whole wagon is rigged to blow dynamite and fuse all over it
you see this
the end of the fuse with the dead ash on his cigar
itts a very fast fus
any trouble and no guns for the general
herrera is solemn as he ponders for a moment then begins to smile
very smarts thats very smart for you damn gringos
so nobody can rob the guns
nunca nadiel after a moment dont you think you should tell your soldiers
the mexican makes a face as if he doesnt understand
i am not afraid they are not afraid you blow up the wagon you die or we kill you pretty soon but we are amigos now show
him tector and lyle jerk the tarp off

lyle arms it
looks at the gun and his eyes widen

waits an agua verde
to meet with you go on back and tell the general that one of us will
be there tomorrow for the trade
any trouble no gunsb herrera takes one last look at the guns
then he wheels his horse and
to the others as they begin to relax
this isnat over yeti herrera rides his horse to the bend in
the river then reaching his men areins his horse up and turns him around
he whistles loudly and calls out muchachos
fifty soldiers from hidden positions on top of both sides of the arroyo ride out and look down
moment laughing all the soldiers whirl and ride away
pike and the men breathe a sighof relief as
to angel and dutch ride ahead a hundred yards and check the washes
to tector you and i will cover the flanks to lyle keep on the gun watch the rim
as pike steps off the give sue that cigar
as pike does anything moves i blow her sky high

thornton is looking down the arroyo with binoculars while coffer covers the glasses with his hat
movin fast looks like they bluffed off about federal es then sliding back why due east
as coffer shrugs well lets go find out
trying to conceal his hate beggin your pardon mr
thornton but our stock needs water and grain and
so do we
after a moment i dont give a damn about you but i
do about the stock
he turns and slides down
coffer and t
look at each
other then follow
suddenly to an owl
he rises and crosses to pike who is sitting near a tree with a rifle across his lap
there is rjo fire but enough
moonlight to see
my people are here for the guns
pike looks at him then looks around the camp
angel smiles then turns and calls softly
quien hablas por mi pueblo
distinctly indian voices answer from the surrounding tangled undergrowth
si angeleit o
soy ignacio a ya estamos
pike and the others move into cover their guns coming out
lyle in the wagon traverses the machine gun
to the others they have come for the guns
we havent heard from tectnr
a a pike from the shadows
call em in
the men look around
it is still silent
then suddenly a peasants dressed in white is standing near the thicket
lyle and sykes turn
another is standing behind them
then bound betwee them
as they enter the clearing they politely remove their hats
soon there are five two of them are leading a small donkey
angel crosses to them as they group in the center of the clearing
all carry machetes
his gun out still hidden in the shadows cut him loose angel speaks led by ignacio they quickly free tector and hand him his weapons with murmured apologies
tector looks at them whistles softly
never saw anything like it never heard iem never saw em
to pike they apologize and ask you to forgive them for their lack of trust but only by caution do they remain alive
hell i forgive them
i just want to join em
pike joins dutch and they watch quietly
they have mis trusted people for so long themselve g they can understand mistrust in others
freddy sykes laughs s
angel and the indians cross to the wagone climbing on the wagon lievasauna caja de rifles
take a case of rifles
crossing to him dont break that fuse
angel lifts a crate
pike looks at ignacio waiting to take the crate the mans machete glints in the moonlight
they part of your village
they are part of the village but not from it they are puro indio and these mountains belong to them
how long have they been around
how long have they been following us
angel eases the rifle crate down two peons take it
he turns to ignacio
cuanto tiempo nos sigas
the indian begins a big explanation in a dialect only angel understands
desde ante ayer cuando salli eron de la llanura grande
grupo de gringos
ellos se fueron a uno ranchito
pike looks at angel
with us since we left the big plain
he says those others went to a little
joining them ever see anyone that could sneak around like these s angel uncovers a case of munitions and hands it down they fought paches for a thousand years thats
a sure way to
if they ever get armed and led this whole countryll go up in smoke
that it will son that it will
the indians rope the two cases on the burro
they work smoothly each man knowing his job
climbs down off the wagon murmurs a farewell to ignacio and the others and they disappear into the shadows
into the air and explodes
a burst of laughter follows
mapache and his men are playing with fireworks while they wait for the guns
one of them waves aloft a shotgun and tells mapache that it belonged to the man
mapache com pletely absorbed in lighting a roman candle answers without turning
matalo l pues l
then kill him
down on the ground and shoot him
as he dies mapache lights the roman candle and shoots it into the air then at tha soldiers who run for cover the general sees pike and crosses to him
immediately laugh ing with pleasure
mohr and the other
germans run to join him as does zamorra and herrera
you bring the guns l s houting to his men ya estan los gringos y las armas l the gringos are here with the guns i then noticing the wagon
is nowhere in sight to zamorra

zamorra looks up at pike

zamorra turns and yells to herrera

herrera brings a small wooden strong box
kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold and hands them to zamorra
zamorra hands them to pike
miles up the arroyo
three cases of rifles one of ammunition are in the brush behind it
to herrera trae las armas herrera runs for his horse
i understand you have a machinegun our contract was cases of rifles and of ammunition for not a machine gun
then as maps the frowns it is our gift to the general
zamorra translates this for mapache who beams at pike
with genuine pleasure
meaning it you fight con mapache h g macho dinero muchachas bonitas la vida dulcet the general wishes you to join him
and become rich he respects you
turning to go ill think it over
wait por favor
in case he cant find them
to pike in to zamorra i trust him
zamorra shrugs pike grins then turns and rides out
show tector gorch leaning on the wagon grinning
they are in
a small shallow depression between two hills
high enough to provide a vantage point of the village and the surrounding area hidden enough by brush and broken country to provide maximum cover
sykes seated near the rock picks glass shards from his clothes turns to tector
after a moment pike must have found you
under a rock somewheres
you going to whip me
nope but you better hope i dont get riled enough to start
ggin you when this is over

to meet pike as he rides in

hows the generalis imo
like he thinks its christmas
mapache waits as two men bring him the machine gun the weapon cradled between them
zamorra awkwardly feeding a belt into the breech
finally gets it ready to fire
the two germans are watching with amusement and disdain
in the b
g f lyle and te
riding out the gate
it must be mounted on the tripod
mapache ignores them
grabbing the butt of the gun
er ist dock verrukt
the gun suddenly
comes alive and the two men holding it are bounced around the area by the wild
the gun swings wildly mapache hanging on his finger locked down
on the trigger
and other bystanders dive for cover as bullets clatter through the area
finally the two soldiers unable
to support it let it drop to the ground
now like a rivet gun driving bullets into the earth dutch and angel enter the courtyard
mapache zamorra and herrera watching the germans mount the
gun on the tripod turn then herrera crosses to his horse and mounts waiting
we brought the last of it
zamorra hands two bags of coin to dutch who opens theca locks its gold
at the head of the
arroyo in the wagon
zamorra speaks to herrera who rides off with ten or twelve soldiers
turning to go you can keep the wagon well take the horses
a group of soldiers are beginning to slowly close the massive iron gates
how many cases did you take from the train
we lost two on the trail
laughing points at angel in spanish he stole them
he stole them for his people
the mother of his girl told us
i lost the girl so now she gives me an angel
the heavy wrought iron doors begin to swing shut
no lo matez b
lo quiero vivo into the wrought iron gate
a group of soldiers pick him up and drag him back
dutch sits on his horse unmoving apparently unconcerned as angel is brought before mapache
yo los robe mientras dormian
to dutch ee took two cases when you were asleep
mapache laughs highly pleased at the idea of a mexican robbing the americans
to angel in spanish next time be more careful who you shoot the mother of your sweetheart became angry when you killed her daughter
so she betrayed you que fam ilia eh
interrupting him im wasting time here
turning to him
hes a thief you take care of him
gesturing at the gold dame lo
l we delivered

dutch thinks about this very
briefly then tosses him a bag
un vieje bien
he turns and rides off angel watching him
they got angel
some people would betray their mothers for two dollars and one drink
unhitch and bring the horses leave the wagono we got to get him out
sykes cant answer and dutch rides off
ulars as dutch better than a mile away disappears in the distance
the others are
mounted at the bottom of a small ravine below him
turning to them dutch engstrom
going from the village
dead or alive
bet they sold the guns
coming out one at a time
i then crossing to his horse well get down at the bottom of the wash and see if we can thin the odds a little
he mounts and they ride off
on a ridge above camp using binoculars they look across the badlands below and at the town far in the distance
well he had guts were just lucky he didnt talk
yeah he played his string out right to the end
he loved that girl
her own mama turning him in just like judas pike looks at him a long moment then turns away
sykes says we got to go after him
how in hell

they got guns and men
besides chances are hes dead by now
no way at all
trots up the dim trail
toward the hideout
thornton and his hunters three
m o watch from the cover of brush covered ridge some distance away then bare foot in a small clump of cholla he
jumps at the fiery pain and nearly falls and for an instant of the rifle and he catches the reflection in his eye
then he has spurred his horse into the brush at the side of the trail
thornton curses and runs to his horse as the bandits open fire
pinpoints of light appear in the rocks above him
after a moment the noise of firingareaches them
dutch takes the glasses watching
thornton and the others spur after sykes firing
then sykes is hit and falls forward over the horses withers
the bounty hunters thunder after sykes
i got him i got him
thornton is silent his face bitter
pike grabs the glasses
watches the bounty hunters ride after sykes
thornton they got sykes
hes hit bad
then turning away daum deka thornton to hell

gave his word
turning on him almost yelling gave his word to a railroad

pike turns and
looks over the camp
make a run for the border

care of those boys

the others look at him silently
finally we take our gold
we take one sack to pay our way

they think this over then nod
the bounty hunters crash through the brush into a small clearing then split up looking for tracks
the country around them is a maze of rocks and thick mesquite and chaparral
sykes horse blood running
down its flanks is standing in the clearing grazing
he cant be far
lots of blood over here then it stops and no tracks
we find him
ten dollars says hes dead by now
itll take us a day to find him if he is if he isnt hes holding a gun on us right now

softly bitterly jess you come back tomorrow and watch the buzzards
theyll show you where he is you might even get a pair of
jess thinks this over and grins then the smile fades
but what if he aint dead
he turns his horse and rides away
the others following sykes hidden in the rocks and brush above them aslowly lowers his rifle and sags back
his leg is dark with dried blood and hes weak
around the wound is a crude bandage made from his shirt with a tourniquet twisted tightly above it
after a moment there is a noise and he looks away at against the rays of the late afternoon sun a machete dangling from his hand
pike and the others now mounted look over the camp
didnt bury it i wouldnt know where to look
they ride off
fora longmoment the clearing is quiet then
enero a young mexican boy steps out of the brush
mapaches soldiers are having a victory celebration in tha courtyard of the hacienda
a fire is burning and pigs and goats are
mapache zamorra and the germans are sitting at the table
two soldiers lead angel who has been badly beaten down into the courtyard
his hands are tied and he is stumbling with fatigue
they tie a long rope from his neck to
the pack saddle of a donkey
the soldiers calls
yaalisto mi general
gets up from the table and crosses to the area where
zamorra and the germans join him
second soldier steps to the animal and leads it at a run around the
courtyard angel dragging behind it
mapache and theothers watch without expression
a pike and dutch and the gorch brothers dismount and enter
they move into the courtyard and stop watching the animal dragging angel around
and animal stop exhausted in a t i g
corner of the yard and the soldiers return to their party atmosphere
angel lies unmoving
i hate to see an animal treated like that
no more than
i do maybe we could buy him
they are silent for a long moment
finally just thinking about him is asking for trouble
we could use another gun
mapache zamorra and the german advisors now grouped around the fire see the men
los bandidos gringos
come here pike and the others push through the large group of festive mexicans towards the table
as they walk toward mapache angel is dragged past them by two soldiers and dropped in front of the general
you come for your friend
pike and the others stop
a few feet away
i want to buy him back
dutch and the others look at him surprised i pay you his share of the gold
we kept his share of the gold
quiere comprar el traidor este listen boys
he wants to buy this traitor the soldiers respond with laughter
he dont look
wotth too much
levantasel two men jerk angel to his feet
he is groggy and unre sponsive
maybe he wont live too long
ill give half my share to get him back
no i dont
i dont sell that one
mapache turns away and mumbles something to zamorra
youve had your fun with him
off el g neralisimo is happy with victory
zamorra grabs a bottle of tequilla ofd the table and tosses it to pike
go and drink
there are women in
but dont be foolish
and change his mood
pike holds the bottle and looks at the table seething with anger
suddenly he calms
want to go hunting general
mapache looks at him confused
pointing five government men out there policio they want the guns back
mapache turns to zamorra who translates
to herrera happily in spanish five gringos want to take our guns maten los
he turns barks orders to his men then mounts and rides out followed by twenty soldiers
zamorra gestures and juan jose crosses
pike looks at angel for a moment then turns away
the group moves through the celebration out the main gate and into the village beyond
his glasses as his men search the area behind and
dont look like nobody was ever
here pointing at horse tracks well they was
then they look up as
army patrol coming this way
instantly the men mount and ride out
pike is sprawled over a native hammock drunk
he lifts a bottle of mescale and takes a drink
on the floor of the hut a sad but not unattractive woman is sitting looking at a handful of silver in her hand
in one corner a baby whines as the flies bother it
through an open door leading to another room
the drunken voices of the gorch brothers can be heard as they bargain with delores a very reluctant prostitute
you said dos for two
your dos and oneto grow on cause y ou did real well honey
doce es mas que dos dace para cada uno
suddenly swings out of the hammock and steps into the ad joining room
lyle gorch looks up at him blearily from a hammock
tector is on the floor embracing the disheveled woman
pike watches them weaving a little lets get angel
for his gun and stands as if he has just been given an important order by a commanding offi cer
lyle rises more slowly begins to check the
loads in his pistols
pike turns and moves through
tector and lyle follow
behind them the
woaian begins her complaints again
sitting with abottle back against the wall listening
to the plaintive sound of a distant guitar
looks up as they come out
they cross to their horses their drunkenness lessening with every step
pike and dutch pull rifles
or shotguns from their saddle scab bards as do
then they move up the village street
strong around them that as they pass through the celebrating soldiers the song and the laughter begin to die
mapache the germans zamorra herrera and six or seven of their officers and a handful of women are seated at a long center table
food and liquor bottles are spilled every where the mariachi band plays for a chita a scared not unattractive girl who is trying to please the general by dancing on
at other tables are more officers and perhaps thirty or so enlisted men
the machine gun mounted on its tripod is in a far corner
angel lies on the floor nearly unconscious almost unrecog nizable from
the beating he has taken
mapache watches the dancer then angrily kicks her off the table
she falls heavily to the floor then mapache seeing pike and the others enter throudh the large arches and s
half angry hey bandidos
what you want
hey this pointing to herrera dog lost those gringos you wanted but
we kill em tomorrow naw
you go on and get out of here we want angel mapache stares at them without answering
you are very stupid
and lifts him to his feet
half dragging him he steps in front of the americans
around him many of the soldiers are rising
pike watches unmoving as mapache props up angel from behind grins at them
you want him
he takes a knife and cuts the rope binding
angel barely able to stand reacts with disbelief
pike and djtch watch without a movement without a sound
tector and lyle ignore mapache their eyes drifting over the mexicans who are slowly edging forward some beginning to grin
zamorra still seated at the table pours himself a drink the clink of the glass against the bottle loud in the silence
beside him the
germans rise slowly
mapache still holding angel from behind leans over his shoulder and whispers in his ear vete angelito
angel stands fast then curiously he takes a step forward
angels face begins to brighten with hope and he takes another step
then mapache grabs him
by the hair and his other hand flashes across the boys throat as he shoves angel into the americans the blood splattering them from his severed throat
as pike steps back to avoid angels falling body he draws his forty five automatic and fires twice into mapache
the bullets double him and hurl him into
as he dutch
fires into the top of his
head then the room explodes with gunfire
zamorra and two of the others scramble for cover while drawing
mohr runs for the machine gun
ri fle fire erupts from the courtyard as the soldiers rush forward and die as one of dutchs grenades explodes amongst them
pike firing with amazing rapidity empties his shoves it in his belt cocks the lever on the rifle moving slowly but steadily into the shadowed corners of the room kill
ing men firing being shot at and hit in return
dutch emptying his
throwing another grenade is hit draws his
continues firing moving with pike covering his back
the soldies hunt cover and die more pour in from the courtyard and die caught in the cross fire
tector and lyle yelling with the lust of battle charge toward the table emptying their guns
reaches the machine gun begins firing
kills a number of soldiers as it gets away from him
pike kills him with his last two rifle shots and the german dies with his finger locked
on the trigger
the gun swings cutting a swath of death across the room killing s
ix soldiers wzunding dutch
pike throws the rifle
as he slips a
now clip in the
whirls as zamorra puts three rounds into dutch
pike kills zamorra and herrera then a soldier has driven a bayonet through his gut and into the wall
mexicans continue firing at the americans from all sides and the gorch brothers badly wounded
but still on their feet still are blasting away at them from the middle of the room then tector laughing picks up
the screaming terrified chita and rushes the crowd using the woman for a shield
she tosses her head and dies as bullets slam into her soft body then he is
hit again and goes down on one knee
a soldier unseen by
tector steps into a doorway
he aims at tector with a revolver and fires into him from several feet away
the bullets tear into tector and he drops the woman and dances out into the room
as he is hit
from all sides he whirls around seeing th
the man in the doorway he fires his last shot into the mans body
the man plunges forward screaming
tector stands up straight as bullets pour into him
finally he crumples fast and falls lyle
hit several times screaming with rage standing over tector is wild eyed firing madly into the crowd
a bullet splashes into his cheek and he runs
the nearest of his attackers firing scattering them killing most tector rises clicks his empty pistol at
a soldier rushes him from behind with a machete and the cross fire of his own men kills him as he swings the weapon into tectorps back
tector falls to the floor
writhing in pain cursing pulling down a soldier strangling him as he dies lyle staggers bullets pumping into him then falls dead before he hits the ground
the soldiers continue to fire into
his body dutch lifts a soldier and tosses him against the wall then falls as bullets cut into him
he rolls then
crawls under the tables dragging the useless lower halfof his body
al thotgh in pain he is grinning strangely
he removes a car bine from a dead soldier and
props himself on a bench
taking careful aim he fires and a soldier drops screaming
methodically he aims and fires again and again and again a man dying each time he pulls the trigger
pike watches as he tenses finally jerks the bayonet out of his body runs firing at five of the soldiers
who are rushing the room kills two
reaches the machine gun pulls mohr away from the gun jerks back the bolt
and staggers as a soldier empties his pistol into him from behind pike him self turns and dies dutch swings the rifle firing crippling the soldier then another soldier his
uniform stained with blood draws his knife and hardly able to move falls on dutch the weight of the
fall burying the weapon deep into dutchs back
crumpled together both
men die for a few seconds there is still sporadic gunfire as the re maining soldiers fire into the bodies of the wild bunch
then it stops
wounded man suddenly screams in agony and writhes on the floor and dies
another pistol in hand rises staggers to the gateway teeters for a moment then falls firing blindly into the
somewhere outside the wall a cur yelps and runs away into the night a the bounty hunters led by thornton ride through
it appears deserted in the courtyard a small group of women wrapped in
black robosas are burning candles and moving
among the dead bodies
that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the yard
it is a scene of carnage blood now black in
the sun a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures
there is no sign of soldiers anywhere
a few of the bodies have been dragged into the courtyard
most including pike dutch and the others including mapache lie where they fell
and dismount their horses snorting nervously at the smell of blood and the stench of death
at the end of the courtyard where five corpses are heaped in a small di a lone vulture stands
patiently near them
as the bounty hunters approach and the
bird labors reluctantly into flight the men dismount
thornton looking in through the broken wall turns away
coffer and t
enter whistle softly
one hell of a time proving that

thornton walks slowly among the bodies

they laugh and go to work
thornton comes through the gate ties his horse sits down his back against the wall
except for a dog and two
silent women the village appears deserted

coffer shrugs and drinking out ofa half full tequi
lla bottle rides off followed by the others who ignore thornton as completely as he does them dissolve toi thornton hasnt moved
then from the
distance come three slow paced rifle shots thornton sits up waits then there is a fourth thornton settles back
the sun has passed the mountains and as the light goes a cold wind kicks dust across the empty street of the village
thornton stands looking off at ignacio
and a handful of angells compadres sit watching him
they are leading the bounty hunters horses the sacks of gold are tied to sykes saddle
