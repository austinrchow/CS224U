de souza story by william wisher walon green march in the third millennium the world
vicious events both natural and man made
chaos and injustice
all were in upheaval
humanity itself turned as violent as the planet
civilization threatened to collapse
a solution was found
the crumbling teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police creating a powerful and efficient hybrid
trained equally in jurisprudence and combat these new guardians x of society could dispense both justice and punishment
they were x police jury and executioner all in one
thru omitted thru it looks like the beginning of time
or its end
nothing grows here
this is the cursed earth
with a whirr a shuttle appears in the sky
we pan it to a giant city wall
a lock like gate chugs open
the shuttle enters
as the massive craft settles it is sprayed down by hi powered jets
brown dirt drips away to show eroding metal and the logo the shuttles air lock port whooses open
a line of drably x dressed men and women exit carrying their few possessions
x judge dredd rev
one by one the parolees return to society
we follow the last herman ferguson fergie
genius a genius without common sense street smarts or muscle tone
so his career as a master criminal has gone absolutely nowhere
six month sentence aspen prison served
welcome back citizen
your living assignment is block y heavenly haven red quad
watch it or x your ass will be back in aspen
x fergie hurries through the gate
we follow him as he stops in his tracks
hes looking at giant towers reach miles into the sky
elevated skyways are filled with traffic
flying barges and shuttles service the highest levels
dominating all is a building shaped like an eagle the hall of justice
almost lost and forgotten among x the towering buildings is a relic from our time the statue of x liberty
title supered x fergie takes another look at the gleaming city and then his x papers
x heavenly haven
and it is nice a perfect utopian future of happy families strolling through a green urban park
and we realize that the scene is a video poster on a bleak and rubble filled empty lot
z taped v
oming soon the heavenly haven pocket park
bringing fresh air and recreation to your lives
another design for better living from the mega city council
coming soon the heavenly haven pocket park
bringing fresh air
surrounding the lot on all four sides are giant tenements
weary hungry and dirty residents rezzies scurry by on x errands both lldegaannot
a municipal vehicle pulls up
a bored city tech gets out goes to the video poster standee and turns it off in mid ilspe
the sudden silence attracts some attention
the tech drops in a new video cart which begins to play as he drives away
rezzies gather around to watch the new video
showing a monolithic building on the empty lot
coming soon the heavenly haven law enforcement barracks bringing surveillance and security to your lives
another design for better x living from the mega city council
li reverse angle as this sinks in on the tenement residents
they stole our park
gets tossed into the video screen
as it sparks the residents swarm knocking it over then the chain link fence around the lot starts to shake heave and collapse widen from a sign on the door
this level condemned
nonetheless a group of squatters s living here
several giggle ingesting some future narcotic through tubes they stuff in their noses
suddenly shouts and breaking glass rouse them from their stupor
zed the meanest looking squatter goes to the window curious
the rezzies are going mental
lets give em a hand
as the others start to take out weapons we x
ru omitted thru fergies jammed in with other lower economic passengers
he sees a terrace pool where a number of girls are frolicking
he waves at the girls speaks to the shuttle driver
right down there
i think thats heavenly haven
nc such luck
the craft banks
as descends the structures it passes grow progressively de
filth and grime cover everything
the shuttle lands z
e street with a whoosh
x he sets out the shuttle lifts off
fergie looks signs
still better than prison
suddenly gunfire erupts all around him
he looks ir se er
al windows his p
as more and more frustrated residents open fire at anything and everything
fergie runs into the building
people run in panic as bullets shatter windows
a battered robot food cart cruises the hallway oblivious to the people darting around it
delicious and healthful ration packs piping hot and ready to eat
fergie darts around the robot sees a small maintenance hatch in the wall and jumps inside
his long howl tells us he didnt x expect the long fall that results
a resident breaks for cover tries to run across thestreet
bhudda bhudda bhudda
hes cut down midway
have spread out and are firing from the windows of several ac joining rooms
did you see that
what a fucking shot
what a fucking shot
reggie h fives him
then an overhead thud makes them look up a the heating vent
zed reaches up yanks off the grate fergie tumbles into the room
zed puts one foot on him points his gun right between his eyes
what do we have here
you a judge little man
the others laugh at the concept
me a judge no no i live here i mean im gonna live x here if if i live if youre a rezzie then why are you hiding
this is a block war man
they grab him playing roughly with him
you gonna stand up for your block aint ya
look im out on parole if i get into any trouble my ass is right back in aspen click
zeds gun is in his face
fergie cont d quickly cheerleading lets go haven lets go haven haven all the way banana clips are shoved into his hands along with boxes of artridaes
bullets rip through the windows here
fergie ducks er fied
drops the bullets
a street level night close on two figures wearinc armored uniforms riding armored motorcycles called lawmasters
both riders wear helmets that conceal most of their aces
but we can see that the leader is a woman
her badge reads hershey
suddenly bullets ping around her
several ricochet off the arm ored bike
as bullets seek them out both riders dive off their bikes and roll into combat positions behind a low wall
hersheys partner brisco is young and eager
just like an academy simulation right down to the crossfire
ill lead off you follow
yanking him back this isnt a sim rookie
stand down and wait for back up
into helmet mike in position outside heavenly haven
pinned down by fire from upper floors
a figure close to camera straddles an even bigger lawmaster cycle that makes a harley look like a mo ped
the riders gloved hand activates the lawmasters city map
fire is coming from level y repeat y
request back up nearest judge
the map beeps shows a route
the hand moves to the throttle
da rs away from the camera burning rubber
hershey and brisco are pinned down under a barrage of fire
smoke fills the street the sounds of automatic weapons fire exploding glass and screams fill the air
hershey tries to ae a shot off a bullet cracks her face plate whips around a corner dodges a burned out vehicle
the mighty bike vaults the barricades and lands
a molotov cocktail sails in front of it explodes
the riderdoes a wheelie
the bike parts the flames like a curtain smashes down right in the middle of all the chaos
the rider gets off
huddle behind their bikes at the perimeter
they react to a figure emerging from the smoke
thats our back up
hes a sitting duck out there
youd think he wants them to see him
hershey smiles ruefully
if thats who i think it is
steps out of the flames
six feet of armored justice he was raised in a state orphanage that taught him duty and honor
now he serves that state as judge
is badge fills the frame dredd
tw st stares down scared
thats judge dredd
we gotta surrender while we can he starts to raise his gun over his head
zed smacks him in the yaw with his own weapon
you chickenshit bowab
hes gonna surrender to us
and then well blow his brains out
come and get us dredd
zed fires out the window
reggie happily joins then the others
finally twist shrugs fires too
a terrified fergie hands him a clip
the stream of gunfire chews up the pavement at dredds feet
you crazy futz
strides calmly over to them
hes firing a laze pumper from six hundred feet
he couldnt hit me if i painted a bulls eye on my ass
well keep it simple
brisco eager to prove himself steps in front of dredd at the heavenly block entrance
dredd pushes brisco behind hershey
turns toward heavenly as re draws his massive lawgiver handgun
dredd speaks into the ny computer in the breech as he aims at the door
the round knocks the steel door off its hinges
dredd r zxs z aside and the judges enter
feraie terrified passes loaded ammo clips to his friends
the whirr of a motor outside the hallway attracts his attention
delicious and healthful ration packs piping hot and ready to eat
looks at his crazed friends and then backs up to the robot
dredd hershey and brisco stride forward
sound of gunfire tells them they are close to their target
i think theyre there dredd shakes his head
the squatters here are so busy firing their own guns out the window they dont see the circle of bullet holes that carve an oper
ng above their heads
with a crash the section of ceiling falls in dredd rides it down firing
his shots catch most of the shooters by surprise
the few survivors throw down their weapons
this room is pacified
mcves carefully through the smoke
behind him hershey and ump down to the floor check the bodies
hershey cuffs se s alive
dreoc avcids the door moves along the wall
suddenly brisco darts forward
this ones mine
dredd moves to stop him but hes too far away
brisco kicks the door open hes face to face with reggie zed and twist
this room is under budda budda budda
brisco is blown backwards off his feet
sees brisco dead in the doorway
hershey whirls kicks down one of the wounded who tries to escape in the confusion
wheres the little ammo dude
as they all look for fergie the wall next to the door explodes open
dredd enters through it
youre all under arrest
will you surrender or would you like your trials now
ne look at him for a moment then blast away
for cover fires back but one guy has a weapon as big as a
a nsaw and its decimating dredds hiding place
x i seep and led change on the weapon
dredd fires x t h s enemy the bullet goes through his weapon kills him
x dredd turns sees reggie and another squatter charging at him from both sides
two bullets come out at once each taking x out a man
but reggae s body rolls into dre d knocking him off his feet
hes lost his lawgiver
he reaches out for it and gets kicked in the head
camera adjusts to show twist sudd enly courageous with dredd on the floor
and he snatches it up and aims at dredds head
dont touch it
theyre booby trapped
a high pitched beep is the only warning before the handgun explodes knocking zed off his feet
zed starts to get up sees twists arm on his body
screaming flings it aside and jumps up right into dredds kick
mega city municipal code
willful destruction of property
thats two years
he hits zed in the face
zed rocks but stays up
he fries tc grab a nearby weapon but dredd kicks it away
illegal possession of assault weapons
zed blocks dredds next blow pulls him into a brutal embrace slams dredd against the walf
dredd breaks free
slams zed once twice
zed flies back against the wall
assault on a judge with deadly intent
tough scornful dont tell me
camera reveals that zed another weapon hidden behind his back
now he goes for it
we werent expecting zeds move
while we were blinking he kicked a fallen weapon up from the floor and caught no
he fires at the same moment as zed
zeds shot hits dredds armor pings off
dredds shot hits zeds heart
court is adjourned
o er judges and paramedics have arrived
the judges process arres ees and the paramedics see to the wounded
ersneva rooks on beside dredd as briscos body is zipped into a cac an away
i was supposed to watch out for him
he made the mistake
dredd cocks his head listening
somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something
the food robot is coming down the corridor skittering around bodies and debris
its actions are less smooth than before and its voice seems off too
ummm umm yumm
healthful and nutritious food rations ready to eat
dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd
she watches puzzled as he steps in the automatons path takes an assault rifle from another judge and aims it
you have ten seconds to surrender
dredd its just a servo droid aside to hershey the guide wire in the floor isnt working
to the robot five
ah just put your credit in your selection and credit in the slot and and shit
the robot stops
the jumble of food in back spills out and fergie uncoils from the cramped interior still holding the scark r
a wires he was using to manipulate the machine
mega city municipal code
willful sabotage of a public servo droid
thats six months citizen
he grabs fergie pushes him against the wall
taking it lets see your unicard
come on give me a break judge uh
by now dredd has run his scanner over fergies chip and fergies dossier is zipping by
forget six months youve hacked into city droids computers
reading interested cash machines robot taxis
and you havent even been out of jail for twenty four hours
hes habitual hershey
automatic x five year sentence
but i i had no choice judge he sees dredds impassive face turns to hersheys more sympathetic one
they were killing each other up there i had to get out
i only hacked the droid to save my life
it was the only way
not at all
you could have climbed out a window worked your way down
or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable
it woulda been suicide
but it would have been legal
i sentence you to five years in
take him away
s protesting fergie is hauled away
hershey looks at dredd
he might have been telling the truth
havent you ever heard of extenuating circumstances
and cowardice isnt one of them
she looks at dredd disappointingly and we x the gleaming civil and legal heart of mega city shaped like x the symbol of the judge system itself an eagle
x my fellow judges have we forgotten x the lessons of history
x the camera discovers the mega city council of judges in mid x session chief just ice fargo sits at an elevated position x a a great black tab le
other judges sit on either side of him
x arcng them are judge mcgruder a woman in her s open minded x b with an ironill w judge esposito s thoughtful x accommodatin g judg e yamamoto s
short tempered yet fair x and judge griffin with a mind and body as honed as men half x s agehis cl ean f eatures can hide much
but now they hide x ng his pass i on and sincerity make his words ring
x griffin contd x a r epublic is a body politic that x i s susceptible to many ills
from x eni nuto anarchy
and the block x wa r to d ay was a definite warning x s i gn of x asser bi a reacts as rowdily as the british parliament
x of your misguided policies as x urban administrator
x hold on judge mcgruder lets not blame the messenger
judge griffin griffin has been trying to get us to swallow his crime package x for two years now and i still have uproar
we sense that the room is evenly divided
a gavel bangs for order with a crack like thunder
everyone quiets as quickly as schoolchildren
favoring fargo c order order
as presiding justice i only vote to break a tie
but i wish to address the question of judge griffins crime package
is there any objection
this entire body owes its very existence to you chief justice
looking around x i can t imagine anyone having an objection
camera sweeps towards fargo passing over the map of north x america etched on t h e great dais
only a few lights stand out x on all the conti nent mega city one mega city two texas city x and the aspen penal c olony
all the rest is labeled the cursed x fargo stands eyes blazing with intelligence and intensity
x we sense t h at we are observing a lion in winter
and the lion can still roar
this body is not the first assembly to think that more laws and fewer choices will bring peace and order
x that delusion has been tried and failed before
if the citizens of mega city are demanding more control of their lives thats not a threat its a signal
a signal to open the windows of our society and let it breathe a look to griffin not to bolt the door and throw away the key
my fellow judges i was x barely in my teens when i put on this badge
when the time comes for me to take it off
let me do it
knowing that it stood for freedom
and not for repression
he sits down
clearly he has changed the mood of the room
once again chief justice you have served as a moral compass for all of us
withdraw my proposal
dredd is watching a monitor
vardis hammond grey haired commanding is standing in front of heavenly haven block while workers put things back in order
hammond on monitor fifty three people hospitalized
five of them
four of them allegedly x killed by a gang of squatters
who were themselves killed in x summary executions by judge dredd
x camera widens as the council chamber doors open
the judges come out
griffin comes over watches with dredd
dredd stiffens at the approach of his superior
griffin silently indicates for him to stand at ease
some people say that to be a judge on these mean streets is bound to x have a certain dehumanizing effect x and that we should sympathize with x the
but the mega x city council apparently doesnt
x to them dehumanization isnt just x a buzz word x its a byword
and ill show just how terrifyingly far x theyve taken that thought
x tomorrow night
x turning to griffin a rookie judge died there too
i guess he wasnt worth mentioning
no that might confuse the viewers
we cant be victims dredd
were the villains
dont they understand we need law and order
safe streets can
di i dd things will get better sir
i pray youre right dredd
ch as griffin leaves dredd turns
as he passes the council x amber fargo beckons to him
startled dredd joins him
x chief justice
four summary executions dredd
x were they necessary
they were unavoidable sir
out x there
thats the reality
x e make our own reality dredd
x maybe it s time for a new one
x although i doubt judge griffin would x recognize a new reality if he x arrested it himself
with all due respect sir how can you say that when you spend most of your time d edd breaks off hes said too much
but fargo wont let him she hook
most of my time where
at the academy
dont you mean at the academy wiping cadets asses
that is what they say in the squad room isnt it
doesnt matter what they say sir
chief justice of mega city
if rt werent for you and the others like you we wouldnt have our justice system
there isnt a judge in mega city who doesnt want to follow in your footsteps
im glad you feel that way dredd
because starting tomorrow youre going to spend one day a week at the academy
dredd takes this in his stride
id be honored
unarmed combat or marksmanship
exiting with a grin ethics
and as dredd reacts we an ominous mountain fortress
guard towers on every corner
wind rattles the concertina wire on the walls
if the cursed earth is hell this is hells prison
stark spare on creature comforts
warden judge miller paces
time to time he looks at a small package on his desk
sma sealed box with a thumbcode lock
looks at it frustrated
finally makes his decision
he picks it up leaves the room
miller and two guards stride through the old part of the complex
everything gets progressively dirti er and dilapidated as they go
finally they reach a massive ste el door with
a computer access screen
miller puts his thumb in the lock
voice sample and thumbscan recognized
the door opens
miller turns to the guards
miller cont d wait here
ricos cell day miller steps inside
autoguns swivel toward him
read his badge
the autoguns swing away
the door closes
were in a large circular room
in the center is an isolated platform
a curtain of blue light surrounds it
behind this gure draws a bead of sweat from his forehead
ansently flicks it at the energy curtain
the icure moves closer
this is rico
have you come for another
a short one im afraid
were both prisoners here
you behind a desk
fargos reward for our services
when you killed innocent people you went far beyond service
moves toward the energy curtain
glares at miller
a meaningless word
the innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves
in the end guilt and innocence are merely a matter of timing
when did you become a perpetrator
was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account
or the time i was sentenced to death
youve been taking bribes for years warden
youre a criminal
and a stupid one you dont even know whos paying you
i dont want to know
if ignorance is bliss warden then x you must be very blissful
miller why are you here
your mysterious benefactor has sent you a package
er speaks into a console before ricos laser guarded cell
energy curtain drops
the autoguns on the wall swivel toward rico
miller moves onto the platform hands over the package
rico places his thumb on the lock and it opens
ricos judges badge rests inside
along with a photograph
of hammond the newscaster
what appears to be a rubics cube type tubular puzzle
rico begins to manipulate the puzzle
what is that
the ancient puzzle miller the one about the meaning of life
and what is the meaning of life
and he aims the puzzle
the shot from the tiny weapon hits him in the throat
gasping ne falls onto his knees
with one hand on his throat he staggers to the door while rico descends from his platform
ac active s shield
voice not recognized
scrambles for the door
hes cut down ten feet from the door
jack shells into their riot gins
charge inside the guards only see millers body
then rico swings down from his hiding place the turret of an autogun
he kicks out with both feet drives both guards ntothe energy curtain
theyre instantly fried
rico dismounts like an acrobat holds his badge up towards the autoqun scanner
the autoguns pivots away
the door opens
rico snatches up a weapon steps
academy a indoor training range tight on dredd kevlar nine helmet and body armor
dredd is lecturing to a group of cadets who hang on his every word
were in a training area like the one q ran in the bond movies
a tech nods target ready
dredd fires a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in judges gear
the bullets ricochet off
the class ooohs and ahhs
yours when you graduate
if you graduate
d edd moves to another training station
another tech nods ready
holding it up lawgiver two
twenty five round sidearm with mission variable voice programmed ammunition
x he turns fires
the flare explodes on the wall
again hs x and ahhs
yours when you graduate
she is exchanging her battered helmet
now she notices dredd lingers to watch impressed witn his style
now he moves to several techs who are hurriedly tweaking the most awesome lawmaster cycle weve seen
mark iv lawmaster improved model
with on board cannon vertical take off and landing
flight capacity and kilometer range
the head tech gives thumbs up while the other techs step back
the class waits expectant
the lead tech throws a remote
the motor coughs dies
the class groans
dredd glares at the embarrassed technicians
if they ever get it to work
dredd moves to a lectern
faces the class
all of these things are nothing x but toys
bottom line final word x end of the day when youre alone in the dark
all that counts
takes something from the lectern shelf throws it down
its all but holy book the law
and you will be alone
because when you swear to uphold these ideals x you are sacrificing whatever chance x you have for a life
x h t e frown this is not what they expected to hear from a legend
they become increasingly unnerved
the talk upsets her too perhaps more than the others
dredds voice contd for most of us there is only lonely death on the streets
or for those few of us who survive to old x age
the prouder loneliness of the long walk
holding up the book life liberty and the pursuitof happiness
old and noble ideas
x but they are what we give to xi others
not what we will ever receive for ourselves
the class breaks up on a definite low note
hershey is drying her hair with a towel
olmeyer a short x earnest underclassman approaches her
hes carrying a large x judge hershey the yearbook deadline x is only a week away
have you x changed your mind
x forget it olmeyer
im not gonna x be the yearbook centerfold
x its not a centerfold its a x calendar
and it wont be a tacky x d hologram
the yearbook is all x classic print and d
here let x me show you a dummy x he s ar s to open the book
she slams it closed on his fingers
x no let me show yoou a dummy
x she turns his head so he can see his reflection
when he turns x back shes gone
x she sees dredd at an end locker
x judge dredd
x he looks at her waiting
x i caught your lecture today
x do you really think thats what the x cadets need to hear
the least i can do is tell x them the truth
well i think your truth is relative
i have a personal life
i have lots of friends
how long since you saw any of them
well my shifts have been changed a lot lately
two three months x tops
youve only been on the street a year
youre still in denial
its not that bad
how many married judges do you know
uh well my class is young
none of them have found the right
e lust looks at her
has it really been like that for x you
havent you ever been in havent you ever had a
dredd takes off his helmet
its the first time weve seen his face and its filled with barely controlled emotion
i judged him
another aspen shuttle is docked here steam curling up from the x motors
x a ground crew member couples fat conduits to the underbelly of x the docked aircraft
suddenly an arm wraps around his throat
x he struggles and we see his captor hanging upside down in the x iand ng gear rico
he drops to the ground like an acrobat x c ding his victim all the way down
the mans neck snaps on x impact
rico drags the body into the shadows
x nc a nice part of town
the faces we see and the sounds we x ar are unnerving
this is not the shiny part of the future
x w e hold on the scene finally widen to find rico
wearing the x nes of the ground crewman he killed he walks past rows of x a
enraptured in violent erotic video games
hes searching x something and then he sees it x a w
i a busy ever changing sign geigers bazaar
pawn fax boxes vouchers cashed
he heads inside
je er s night isre squalid pawnshop
surplus and funk hangs from the ered walls
the rear is divided by a ceiling high locked en e that secures the better grade merchandise
geiger s sccw
s as rico enters
puffs on a cigar
weve closed for the night
youre holding a package for me
gimme a second
while geiger gets it rico quickly scans the store
a simple security camera in the corner
a jumble of crates and large antique weapons
including a few things
that look like rusting metal warriors
rico points to these
i thought they destroyed all the abc warbots
you can collect em if you make em non functional
like my wife
hands him box here you go
geiger pretends not to watch as rico unlocks the box
geiger x sneaks a look
sees a uniform
and a judges lawgiver
rico starts to reach inside
geiger stops him
whoa friend whoever sent you this is no friend at all
and whys that
thats a lawgiver
its programmed to only recognize a judges hand
you want a weapon i can get you something nice
but if you touch that itll take your arm off
geiger flinches then looks puzzled
how do you like that
he shoots geiger at point blank range
geiger hits the floor
i must be a judge
rico bends takes geigers keys and his cigars
then goes to the big cage
a huge armored combat veteran
we hear the metal cage rattle open
rico approaches crouches down and pulls a panel off the robots body
inside the circuit cards have all been pulled from their sockets
rico begins whistling
he pushes the boards back in hits the reset button
the robot starts to whir
a gush of steam rises from its powerful torso
the eyes glow red
it stands to its eight foot height slowly turning like an arthritic old man
rico strikes a match on the robot lights a cigar
status personal bodyguard
mission were going to war
r i tted thru almond and his wife lily are in their modest apartment
the ant cues and decorations hint at a warmer era our own
both wear nightclothes
hammond paces edgy with dec ision
lily weaves on a computerized loom
vardis if youre right then this judge dredd isnt really part of the conspiracy
no of course n t
it began before he was born
it had to have
then your report tomorrow will destroy an innocent man
doesnt dredds future bother you
but im more worried about all of our futures then about judge
the door thuds open
startled they turn standing in the doorway is a judge
finishing the thought dredd
elam blam blam
the judges gun fires and we citizens and merchants go about their business
camera cranes down finds dredd on patrol
something catches his eye
he stops his lawmaster gets off
we follow him towards a slick we dream of a future gull winged car
parked in a edd takes out a bar code reader scans the license plate
e gizmo searches its data base the fuppie future yuppie car v
runs into view with a cappuccino in a st yrofoam cup
he oeeos the lock but dredd blocks his way to the car door
is this your car
hey come on
what are you gonna do tow me
of course not
towing is the penalty for the first offense
this is your second violation
into lawg ever grenade
dredd aims fires
dredd walks casually away while the cars owner stands slack jawed with debris tinkling around him
the wreck burning behind him dredd head back towards his bike
he sees two figures in front of him
and the moment he does he knows without
looking that there are two identical ones behind him
theyre garbed for combat yet without even the trace of humanity that seeps through a street judges armor
these are the feared judge hunters
all have drawn weapons
the leader holds up a holo warrant with dredds picture
judge joseph dredd
you are under arrest
camera finds a broken figure here fargo
ashen he sits in the chief justices seat face in his hands
i cant believe it
are you sure
we see griffin is standing below him
im afraid the evidence is conclusive
the trial will be just a formality
fa c descends shakily from his seat
moves to the window
e axes a pill from his pocket tries to swallow it without i f r
seeing is it possible
dredd homicidal too
we went through
this nine years ago
we were able toahide the facts then
this time we may not be so lucky
what do you mean
the victim was a reporter
the media is already sniffing around
theyll get to the truth
and your part in it
how long have you known
does it matter
nine years ago when we buried the truth along with the victims the council ordered the termination of janus
the complete termination
you obviously a ie that order
otherwise this new disaster could never have happened
if the truth comes out it could destroy everything weve built
we could go back to the years of chaos
r cken he glances over at the great map
theres a way out chief justice
the long walk
youre suggesting i take it
you fiust really want to destroy me no
i want to save the judge system
the media wont stop digging into dredds case
when they get to the bottom
theyll find you
but if you take the long walk
theyll find nothing but your honored memory
my walk will give you the chief judgeship
it could also save dredds life
judges complex corridor night hershey is being quickly escorted along a corridor by the four judge hunters
the place is dark and empty
the judge hunters open a holding cell
hershey steps inside
ershey is surprised to see the inhabitant dredd
whats going on
and who x are those feebs
ive never seen x those uniforms before theyre judge hunters hershey
x theyre the ones who come out when x a judge has broken the law
x hershey reacts shes heard of them
x judge hunters
then its a full x trial before the council
that x only happens one in a generation
x judge hershey
i dont have anyone x else to ask
will you x be my defense attorney
x youre under
x explosion of gunfire on the main screen
were seeing the tail end of a surveillance video of the murders of x vardis and lily hammond taken by a camera outside their apartment
the place is absolutely packed
every off duty judge in mega city is here
so is every cadet from the academy plus the entire media brigade
we note that two oddly reassuring dements from our era are still here a courtroom artist with a computer sketchpad and lightpen and a courtroom stenogr apher with his hands
stuffed into a fist steno keyboard
make no mistake about it this is a real fair trial
and were g oing
before we go on i wish to make a personal comment
i have observed your career from its outset and i have the highest regard for you
nevertheless i must prosecute you to the best of my ability
that is the law judge mcgruder
i would expect no less
in judge fargos place sits judge griffin
he is wearing the uniform of the chief justice
the court shares in judge mcgruders sentiments
in a way i am glad that judge fargo is about to begin his long walk
ai continued c he will be spared the pain of this trial
proceed judge mcgruder
the video you have just seen is prima fascia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged
mark this video peoples exhibit so marked
at the defendants station hershey stands
objection your honor
this video is inadmissible as evidence
judge hershey are you serious
both of them recognized judge dredd
that is the states interpretation
i ec rewinds
then doesnt dredds future bother x you
but im more worried about x all of our futures then about x judge
x stop video
do you hear it
when lily hammond says dredd its x part of the conversation
and when vardis hammond sa s dredd it x could just as easily be the same
the suggestion that either has recognized their murderer is sheer supposition
or in the case of the prosecution wishful thinking
big reaction from the packed room
griffin bangs the gavel for silence
the defense table r hershey returns here to get another document
im really glad i picked you to defend me
you only picked me because you didnt have anyone else
im still glad
x camera follows hershey forward
all right counselor
forget the the audio
what about the video
x it clearly shows it clearly shows nothing
your honor i have here an affidavit from cadet olmeyer currently a junior at the academy
svc in the audience heads of the other cadets around him swivel to look at him new regard
he does his best to look cool
cadet olmeyer is acknowledged by x all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics
his affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used no positive identification can be made of the killer
since the uniform of a judge could be counterfeit i repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case
turning to griffin i ask for a ruling
judge dredd rev
you could hear a pin drop in the vast room
everyone watching is sure they know what griffin will say
theyre all wrong
the video is inadmissib e
the rest of the courtroom goes nuts
griffin bangs for order
the bailiffs call out
returns to the defendants table as the court quiets down
olmeyer whoops a second longer than everyone else
x embarrassed he quiets down but not before dredd notices him
that kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass
its not your ass hes interested in
i am forced now to enter certain technical evidence of a critical nature regarding x the mega city legal system
ai x will need the courts permission
x i will also need permission to x access the central computer bank
x they look at each other as puzzled as everyone else
x judge dredd rev
mcgruder contd x i can think of no evidence or issue x more critical than the murder trial of x a judge
you may proceed
x mcgruder approaches a special console
this is one of many in x mega city that permit access to central the judge systems main computer
most of the consoles look alike but this has the largest screen we will see
i wish to access weapons schematics judges division
describe the workings of the standard judges sidearm the lawgiver two and especially its improvements over the earlier lawgiver one
somehow its monotonous sexless voice hints at an actual personality
u omitted thru computer graphics illustrating these words appears on screen
nine years ago the lawgiver model two replaced the lawgiver model one
the difference lies in two areas the computer chip and the ammunition coding
like the model one the computer chip recognizes the thumbcode of all judges
judges may use each others firearms but a suspect dare not use a judges weapon against a judge
animation reminds us of this in non gory fashion
however the ammunition coding in the model two is not cued to the x thumbcode recognition chip
instead it is coded to the personal dna of the judge using the weapon
listening carefully wondering where this is going
this is obtained in a download from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded
each time a round is chambered and fired it is tagged with the relevant dna
we slowly tighten on mcgruder and her witness
were the bullets recovered from the bodies of vardis and lily x hammond so dna coded
yes judge mcgruder
it could not be otherwise
and what was the result of the computer check of the dna coding on those bullets
ould swear that the computer is going for drama
the dna is a perfect match for judge joseph d re dd
iamser wide shot a der o
griffin bangs for order
in shock to dredd dna evidence is irrefutable
do your job
she nods stands
the defense rests
griffin looks at mcgruder
your honor the prosecution rests
the jury may be sequestered
the foreman council judge esposito stands
your honor sequestering is not necessary
the evidence is irrefutable
we have reached a verdict
in the x charge of pre meditated murder we the jury find joseph dredd guilty as charged
gasps from the audience
its the fall of a legend
griffin cont d the defendant will stand
e ore hershey can tell him to dredd obeys
griffin looks him in the eye
dredd looks back unblinking
joseph dredd for this crime the x law allows only one punishment s ocr rebounds from every wall
as the gasps fade away griffin taxes out a sealed document
however i have here the last order of judge fargo written this morning before he prepared for the long walk
he orders that this court be lenient with judge dredd in gratitude for his years of service
setting this down it has always been our custom to carry out the last order of a walking judge
we will so honor this one
the sentence is life imprisonment to be carried out immediately
as it is written griffin picks up the book of the law kisses it
let the betrayer of the law be taken from our courts already the judge hunters are coming for him
you did your best judge hershey
he stands takes her hand
let the freedom he stole from others be stolen from himself pan
e judge hunters pull at him
hershey hangs on as long as she dredd
let his armor be taken from him and all his garb of justice
wrists manacled head down
the judge hunters pull off his x armor then literally rip away his uniform
hes naked helpless
it is the ceremony of the long walk
judge fargo stands alone wearing a long duster coat and a wide brimmed hat
before him he holds his uniform lawgiver and badge in a ceremonial bundle
a young female cadet in an sweet contralo that contrasts with griffins bass reads from a different part of the law let his name be recorded in every place of
let him take the law he served so well to those who have it not
the great city gate begins to open
under a fading sunset we see the forbidden land beyond the cursed earth
we tighten on fargo grizzled weary the girl fresh tearful
like so many she reveres this man and what he represents
let him be written in our hearts and our memories
she hands him the book
receives his bundle of worldly h ongings in return
a young male cadet steps forward hands fargo an ancient remington
shoved into a jammed prison shuttle
him in x s a
the shuttle door closes locks
let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories
a line of cadets raises lawgivers overhead
they fire a gun salute
fargo walks out
tyye gate closes
x the prison shuttle fires its engines
dredds shuttle thunders overhead
far below in the poisoned sand fargo looks up at it
lightning crackles around the eagles head
a floating tanker refuels at a nearby roof top
griffin comes inside
his chair turns around
rico is sitting x in it
griffin looks at him in shock for a moment
x are you out of your mind coming here
griffin angrily starts forward
stops when the abc robot moves to block his path
and you brought this too
griffin waves his hand over desk controls
the lights dim
s i tters block the windows
i like to do things my way
x yes i know
like framing dredd for hammonds murder
i thought that was a nice creative touch
sort of two birds with one stone
hammond had to be silenced when he found out abut janus
but i could have used dredd
he practically worshiped the ground i walked on judge dredd rev
dredd only worships the law
and hed blow you away the minute he found out just how much youre pissing on it
trust me its better this way
let him see what its like to freeze his ass off in aspen
let him see what its like i to be me
he moves closer to griffin smiles
dredd and i have so much in common
why not this
griffin looks at him decides to drop the subject
theres a lot of work to be done
the janus lab youll see it soon enough
in the meantime
i want chaos rico
that block war was just the beginning
now i want fear racing through every street
terror in every quad
panic in every block
until those miserable rezzies think even their judges cant save them
thats when the council will turn to me
and to janus
rico moves towards the door
fear terror panic
i think i can handle that
smile look how quickly i brought fear in here
his smile fades and he exits
a howling wind blows dust across the dead landscape
the aspen prison shuttle appears over the horizon
a wide body with the amenities of a galley
armed judges x patrol outside a long cage enclosing the rows of prisoners
x guards inside the cage are armed with stun clubs
x camera roams the ranks of hardened brutal prisoners
gradually x we realize that something is being whispered up and down the x rows
a slow humm that rises in level buzz and then a x whisper
gradually we discern it dddrd
x we reach dredd the same time the whispers reach him
manacled x i like the others he shows no reaction to the hateful
glances x aimed in his direction
x attention crew
were changing x course to avoid some chop
eta x aspen prison hundred twenty two
x the craft banks the prisoners chains clanking as they sway
a x mean looking prisoner behind dredd leans over hisses x i want a piece of you scumbag
h a snap and without looking dredd jerks his elbow x ba xwards
the prisoner is knocked unconscious
as he sags in x is hains camera adjusts
the prisoner on the side of dredd x we havent seen is fergie
now he stares at dredd
then x pins his hands over dredds
face leaving dre s jaw xi cs and parting his fingers at dredds eyes like the visor in she judges helmet
fergies eyes go wide
what are you doing here
i was convicted of a crime
that makes two af us
you got the sentence the law required
the proper sentence
five years just for saving my own ass
it was a mistake
the law does not make mistakes
then how do you explain what happened to you
oh you cant
but the law doesnt x make mistakes
so whats this x then
x youre wasting your breath brother x man
x the speaker is a menacing man of fifty or so with gaunt hard muscles the eyes of a mad prophet and eerie religious tattoos
three younger men flanking him have similar decorations
this x is reverend angel and his sons
x reverend angel contd x dredds a machine
see any man x even a lawman has a heart
but x not dredd
hes frozen inside
x thats how he could make this man x he indicates himself x and these boys watch while like x the grim reaper himself he coldly x cut down the
youngest fruit of our x tree
x angel maybe if your youngest fruit x hadnt taken those hostages he could x be here for the family reunion
x as one all the angels lunge forward as much as their short x chains will allow
fergie recoils dredd doesnt
but two x guards turn at the commotion
x problem here
actually x could i sit over there the guard moves away
the angel family stares hatred in x dredds direction
sotto to dredd youd better not be my roommate
x i in
dredds apartment night narrow window lets in the thinnest sliver of moonlight
two armchairs worn leather from our era
a couple of exotic ants now wilted
an antique bookcase of burnished wood a rare material in mega city

the lock glows briefly
the door opens

hershey steps in putting a small tool away in a belt pouch
she closes the door
takes in the monastic feel of the place
she moves to the bookcase a small collection of leather bound books maybe a dozen in all
plato more jefferson paine
hershey runs her fingers over the well worn titles
i dredds bedroom narrow bed
a small dresser and chair
if alarm is not reset
system will signal armed response in seconds
hershey opens a drawer
she slips her hands underneath feels around finds nothing
opens the next drawer
finds a framed viewie on the nightstand
it shows a couple in their s with a baby
off viewie amused well
at her touch the viewie becomes briefly animated
shes about to put it down when something about its weight makes her suspicious
she turns it over examines it finds a hidden seal
the frame opens
inside is a second viewie
it shows dredd mid twenties and rico the same age
bot are grinning graduation dav at the academy
shes puzzled quite clearly she has no idea who rico is
hershey folds the frame back up
slips out the door with it

the shuttle spirals towards the earth
the ground rushes up fills the main viewport the shuttle crashes skids across the ground smashing through rocks and cacti
stabilizer fins snap off
the fuselage breaks in two
the rear half with the engines explodes while the forward cabin keeps rolling
the forward half of the shuttle comes to rest
theres one last groan of metal from the cabin and then
in shadowy corners and dark alleys bodies and souls are being bought and sold
strange sounds of pain and pleasure assault our ears
somehow even these twisted and dangerous people know not to fuck with rico
they move out of his way almost instinctively
suddenly flies out of a doorway smacks into a pole near rico
he shakes off the blow wipes blood from his mouth
howls with animal fury
charges back towards the doorway
his adversary appears a whirling lean muscular figure in leather a woman named ilsa
now with four spectacular karate moves she hits him high low middle and the coup de grace right in the balls
his eyes glaze
he drops like a stone
she turns to leave
stops when she sees the amused eyes of the man watching her from four feet away rico
ilsa cont d r
off the environment i see youre still researching the dark night of the soul
the research ended when they condemned you
i live here now
you showed me that facing death was the only way to live
her eyes glisten as she moves towards rico touches his arm
they told me you were dead
cc reaches out gently
wipes a tear from her cheek
dont go woosy on me professor
we got work to do
he puts his arm around her
they step over her victim on their way out
movement inside the smashed aircraft
helmeted judge hunters move through the dim wreck using bar code readers to scan the
id tags of the dead
scanners attached to their weapons show readings
another hunter steps inside through a jagged hole in the x fuselage
we found tracks leading away x fromthe wreck
at least half a x dozenpeople
the hunter squad leader taps his helmet mike
this is capture team
no sign of dredd
he appears to have survived the crash
repeat he appears to have survived
you are in error capture team
dredd did not survive the shuttle wreck
no one survived the shuttle wreck
do i make myself clear
we found someone
we follow them forward
their flashlights converge on one of the wounded guards
thank his eyes widen as their laser gunsights moves to his chest
gunfire erupts within and we enough personal things to ell us shes both a danger crazed athlete
and a romantic
shes still in sleepware her uniform for today already laid out
she sips coffee from an academy mug
sits down at her apartments central station
central i need to access the graphics database
that could take several days judge hershey

come on you piece of junk
aside to his robot no offense
the bolt loosens
rico can open the panel

the overhead lights come on
perhaps we notice that the lab seems to be retro fitted into a n older metal structure with oddly irregular walls perhap s not
a pneumatic door opens

youve made a lot of progress
about time eyes narrow as ilsa comes in from another area with a i oboard
griffin i think you know professor haydyn
i havent seen her since your trail
when she testified that you were insane
she looks at rico with an expression worthy of a manson follower
judge dredd rev
since then ive learned innocence is just another lie
and that the best truths come only with pain
back to reality and
speaking of painful truths
heres our shopping list
she hands griffin the digital notepad
inducers nitrogen coils nano pumps
i can pull all this from mega city hospital

the bullets hit him
dredd wrenches the weapon from the mans dying fingers shoots the hunter beside fergie
reacts as the hunter falls beside him the scanner landing right front of his face

we hear the mans neck crack
dredd struggles hand to hand with the second one
they fall to the courtroom floor
fergie appears with a piece of timber tries to hit the judge hunter with it
the gun dredd and the hunter are both struggling for goes off
the piece of wood explodes in fergies hands
dredd forces the gun barrel towards the hunter slam
we did it
we got them all
a shape lunges up close to camera
its one of the hunters dredd took out earlier still alive enough to aim his weapon
dredd aims his stolen one his trigger click

you want me to go to x the go amn junior dance

but ill never get another chance like this
x its almost through processing the viewie
do we have a deal
through her teeth yes
low cut dress
graphics analysis coming up
he hits a control dramatically
the screen comes up
shows he picture of baby dredd and parents
hershey stares at it in disbelief
olmeyer you stupid futz
you x analyzed the wrong picture
x she gropes around on the desk finds the viewie frame with the s o of dredd and rico
you were supposed to do this one
you just wasted three hours
c rrputer beeps
messages run by the bottom of the screen
if this is the wrong picture why is it full of anomalies
slick ones too
somebody must have used a cgi terminal and a scan quadrupler to make this
he looks at the image uses the mouse
its not real
take a look
ill drop out all the artificial pixels
hersheys eyes widen in shock as one by one the picture elements disappear scan line by scan line
olmeyer contd x sky
theyre all fake
the only thing thats real is the baby
shes in shock
maybe we are too
x hru omitted thru fargo lies near the judges bench
dredd has dressed his wound x and made him as comfortable as possible
fergie is heating rations from the judge hunters cruiser over a fire
he brings soup over to fargo
fargo tries to swallow
bury me there under the blind lady
redd doesnt understand
fargo raises his arm points to the statue of justice weighing her scales
judge or citizen everyone got a fair shake
she treated them all the same
the jury sat there
worst thing we did was take justice out of their hands
you and the first judges
you saved mega city
and almost lost our souls
look it seemed like a wise idea create the perfect judge
breed courage wisdom integrity
the janus project
we used the old council for the base material
five dna samples were taken two were chosen
one was mine
you were the
r i continued dredd is stunned but
but the orphanage told me my parents were killed by lawbreakers they gave me that picture of them a fake
the psychs on the janus project came up with that story
it was supposed to motivate you into law enforcement
what do you mean both times
two infants created in the janus lab
they were x supposed to be perfect
one was x you
somehow it x was
not anything you x could see
indicating his head but up here
a genetic x criminal that one day just went
guess we werent the sterling specimens we thought
i have a
more than a brother
you knew him at the academy dredd
you judged him
the council tried him
he had to be put down
but i wouldnt let them do that to you
griffin blackmailed me into the walk dredd
dont trust him
continued leg like i trusted you
the breath goes out of fargos body
dredd stares at him his world torn apart
dredd stands in the fading light withdrawn within himself
fergie approaches carrying the remington
i buried him
except for this
dredd silently follows fergie to the grave
fergie shoves the remington into the mound of earth as a marker
he hands the book to dredd
after a moment dredd opens it
what is the end of a just man
the long walk and then nothing
no for whoever walks with the law walks forever and whoever honors the law will trod in his path
dredd looks at the fresco on the wall
sees the faded words find food and ammunit
load up that sand cruiser
where are going
dredd yanks the remington out of fargos grave
we track into dredds face until it fills frame
to find rico
a squad of judges on lawmasters ride into shot

package too late explosion

the explosion blossoms against the flank of thegreat metal eagle
as alarms ring we rake to rico amused
he lights a x cigar tosses the match towards the distant flames
x theres no way in dredd
dredd and fergie are standing beside the hunters sand cruiser
their faces are dry and their lips parched and they show the wear from this journey
dredd has a pack of gear on his back andfargos winchester
ignoring fergie he continues to x peerat the mega city wall
x fergie contd x hey did you hear me
they dont x have a welcome mat
x lowering binoculars x theres a way in six years ago two cursed earthers figured it out
dredd points sure enough theres a puff of flame at a vent low on the wall
smoke rises into the sky
then it stops
the vent from the city incinerator
theres a burst twice a minute
that means that theres seconds for someone to run through the tube before it flames again
and these cursed earthers they made it through
actually they were burned to a crisp
but the theorys sound
another fireball belches from the city wall
as fergie x stares at it dredd starts forward
its a few paces before x he notices fergie hasnt moved
dredd contd x whats wrong
x whats wrong
are you kidding
did that helmet you wore all those years compress your brain
youre gonna get me killed
theres a maniac loose in x the city x theres one loose out here too
big choice i got
dying of thirst or from a fireball up my ass
this is all your fault
if you hadnt arrested me x wouldnt be here in the first x place
x erc a sits down petulantly
x fergie contd x im through schlepping
im gonna x sit here until i die
or until x you apologize
x the law doesnt apologize
x youre not a judge anymore
x i was when i sentenced you
x dont get technical
just say im x sorry i misjudged you
and ill x never arrest you again
x dredd turns around
marches back to fergie
dread x whips a gun up points it at fergie
x after a moment x apology accepted
x dredd turns
fergie looks at another fireball emerging x from the city wall
then at the trackless wasteland hes just x crossed
with a groan he races to catch up with x dredd
x sirens wail
fire burns around the corner
several lawmasters guise past
looters run away from them
close to camera hershey throws two perpetrators against a fen ce cuffs them into radio x dispatch im in green quad
x need pickup
x we copy hershey
well bag em
x meanwhile i have central on line x for you
can you take it
x s e sakes a few steps away from her perps for privacy
x yes patch me in
x judge hershey you paged me
how x can i assist you
x you can start by telling me why x dredds baby picture is a state x secret
we can almost hear central thinking
meanwhile behind x hershey a figure in a judges uniform approaches her bike
x drops something into a storage compartment on it
even from this distance we notice a red arming light on the object
the figure moves away
i want an answer
im sorry i can neither confirm nor deny your statement
get a virus
annoyed she turns heads back for her bike and thats when it a fireball rolls toward the camera
we pan it
as it disappears into the sky dredd and fergie dive inside
c ouched over they race up the slight slope
as he runs thirty
r ti i
nd them e gies already beginning to drop back
the only guide in the dark is the slight reflection from conduit on the chute floor
faint light starts to fall on him
then he sees it up ahead the lights of mega city
dredd pushes on reaches the opening
turns to look at
still halfway back
eleven he falls
he tries to get up
his shirt is caught on the conduit
he struggles in a panic but keeps counting
oh god nine
dredd d help me
for gods sake he looks outside so close looks back so far its impossible to save fergie
fergie cont d dredd looks down sees camera rakes back
fergies caught on the same conduit
a he strength in his body he rips the conduit free from e floor yanks it forward as he shouts two he is whipped forward like a trout on a
per ie flies past dredd howling and as a fireball rolls right behind them dredd dives out of the opening behind fergie
has landed half buried in a mound of ashes
he looks around
dredd hears a muffled sound beneath him
he reaches down
yanks fergie into view
fergie spits out a mouthful of ashes
seeing dredd less oh
so are you
hief justice griffin council judges mcgruder espositio and yamamoto
a messenger hands a data pad to yamamoto leaves
latest casualty report
ninety six judges have been assassinated
whoevers doing it knows all our procedures
our security measures
even our scrambled frequencies
now the street criminals are taking advantage of the situation
its a nightmare
hell its a goddamn revolution
we cant replaee those judges
it takes years of training
we may never be at full strength again
there is a solution
on their desperate project janus
chief justice griffin
just mentioning that
is grounds for impeachment
we tried to play god once
it almost destroyed the council if this wholesale slaughter of judges continues there wont be a council
janus could come on griffin
a new batch of test tube babies wont solve this crisis
we dont need reliable judges years from now when theyre grown
we need them today
theres been over thirty years of genetic research since janus failed
what if we could create adult subjects fully grown andfu ly trained at birth
we could replace the judges weve lost in weeks
we could save our society
who knows if thats even possible
who knows if its safe
all im asking is that we unlock the janus files and ask
that way we at least have an option
please let us find out
if the council decides not to go forward
ill accept that decision
he has their attention
workers are still cleaning up after the earlier explosion
a hand reaches into shot steals uniforms and equipment
dredd in a stolen uniform marches fergie under guard through the building
this is a mistake
judges dont make mistakes
but fargo said you couldnt trust i dont
but i trust the council
when i tell them about rico
they pass peers at them but doesnt speak
they round just dont get us killed dredd
still want that apology
nges have all gathered around central
one by one they s ecyuz speak put their thumb in centrals scanner
authorize access to file code name janus
authorize access to file code name janus
on screen graphics show the software locks being removed one by one from the janus files
authorize access to file code name janus
authorize access to file code name janus
i have unanimous authorization for access to file code name janus
removing security blocks
awaiting password command from presiding chief justice
c en on him
hes been waiting for this moment
moves in front of the mac hi ne speaks tersely
griffin cont d central using current technology how long would it take for janus to produce a fully grown adult subject
given the current state of genetic engineering an adult subject could be incubated in approximately eight hours
astonishment in the room
dredd and fergie are almost at one of the council chamber doors
the judge who stared at them earlier is following them
in what quantity could these subjects be produced
although only two subjects were produced in the original experiment the laboratory was equipped with incubators
if fully operational subjects could be produced a week
we could replace our losses in a day you arent considering this madness
im just reacting to the possibility
a frightening possibility
i for one
think this is an idea that should be forgotten
judge griffin please x restore the security blocks
i see now that none of you have the force of will that these terrible times require
you will never open janus again
well just leave it
council chamber night a dredd is about to open the door when a hand spins him around
its the judge who followed
i thought it was y thats all he says before dredd k
mcgruder stands furious
griffin this is treason
you just sealed your fate
youve just sealed yours
steps into the room
a i the judges go for their lawgivers
but its too late
rico opens fire on full automatic
ffin averts his eyes from the moment he orchestrated
a y the gunfire stops
rico stands smoking gun in hand
who says politics is boring
rico whirls looks at he has arrived in time to see the murders
with another scream of fury he leaps over the fallen judge who tried to stop him makes a running tackle at rico
dredd takes rico to the floor
they both roll over and over
tries to get a shot at dredd cant
then griffin hears alarms shouts running footsteps
griffin steps quickly in kicks dredd in the head
get out of here now
hearing people coming rico obeys
he shakes his head gets up sees rico is gone but griffin is moose
moves forward youre mine
s moment we think hes going to shoot
then he turns his points it at his own arm fires
va nrown by the maneuver he hesitates
behind him the
ers rush in see the shocking scene the dead council wo
nded chief justice clutching at his own bloody arm stop him
he just killed the entire council
dredd realizes hes fucked
he turns runs
the judge hunters pause near their wounded leader who bravely waves them on
ey tear after dredd like woj ves
dredd tears around the corner
fergie appears from behind the hiding place he ducked into at the first shots
tell them im innocent
bullets rip up the wall just missing him
dredd grabs him by the collar and they both crash through doors marked academy bullets whiz past dredd and fergies heads
they turn another corner surprise a night watchman engaged in the ancient night watchman pursuit of eating a sandwich and reading a girlie magazine
thats all he gets out
dredd hi blocks him barrels past
his stiff plastic paged copy of mega sex lands on the floor a d animated holo pinup still posing above the open pages
they enter the training center and dredd runs right towards the marie iv lawmaster
leaps into the saddle and kicks over the en ine
spins around and heads back the way he came grabbing ergie en route
oht watchman gets up in time to almost be run over
t nues past him just as the pursuing guards appear here
reds drives rich at them
he turns again towards a wide open corridor but the judge hunters appear there and theyre smart enough to take cover behind the archway and pour on an awesome fusillade
turns again hes flanked
he spins on the bike takes the only direction left back into the training room a dead end
al the judges and guards follow blasting away
he races directly for the wall
his fingers stretch out hit a control marked cannon
cannon click into view
a hole is blasted in the wall
now we see mega city hundreds of stories below us
dredd youre not gonna dredd hits the button marked aerial mode
theres a beep and the sound fx we heard earlier
when the flying prototype failed
the indifferent half hearted sound of the aerial mode lifters isnt encouraging
they just groan
crash they go through the irregular hole
reds and fergie fly out of the building on the lawmaster mark barely hanging on they fall silently through the air
ass spinning all around them
ke begins to turn a somersault
the aerial mode lifters kick in with an eerie whine
he fivi nc motorcvc a comes out of its roll wit a blast of rccxets and roars upwards
the judge hunters react as the bike disappears in an instant streaking across the sky like a comet
ru omitted thru a medic leaves
griffin bandaged turns as rico comes out of hiding
why didnt you kill him when you had the chance
its better with him on the loose
hell keep the surviving street judges preoccupied while we work on janus
prepare the janus lab for full operation
while youre at it
id like to appoint judge rico to the council of judges
that may present some legal difficulties since judge rico killed the entire council of judges
may i suggest you pardon him and then appoint him
that would meet the legal requirements
excellent suggestion central
council judge rico may be the first to offer my congratulations
mc inc carefully dredd and fergie walk down the corridor
dredds still in the stolen uniform
they come to a nameplate with hersheys name on it
the door has been forced oiler
dredd and fergie look at each ether
dredd swings the remington out of hiding steps inside
a total wreck
electronic equipment still sizzles here
dredd lifts a viewie of hershey and some friends from the academy
the three women laugh and wave as he touches it
i guess youre out of friends dredd
hershey weapon in hand steps inside
shes battered beat up and edgy
the way the light hits the room she can only see one figure
up against the wall now
the figure complies
youre the hacker we arrested
what are you doing here
im with him
steps into the light
a moment shes elated
then her face hardens
she holds n steady
hershey cont d stay where you are
what is it
theyre dying out there dredd
a hundred and eight judges in hours
everyone whos left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin
i thought it was organized criminals revolutionaries something
then i was a target
you think im part of this r continued c i dont know what to think anymore
dredd moves like lightning pins her gun hand against the wall then freezes
its a challenge not a threat
she glares at him counter moves gets an elbow against his throat
but dredd doesnt break her hold or turn the gun on her
its deliberate check mate on both their parts
do you really think id hurt you
secrets can hurt more than anything
she relaxes her hold on him
throws something down
y s the picture of dredd and rico
tell me about him dredd
make me believe in you again the way i did when i defended you
his name is rico
and he killed like this once before nine years ago
and hes doing it again
we have to tell the council
there is no council hershey they were all murdered an hour ago
shes been on her feet for days and this is the last psychic blow
dredd catches her
judge dredd rev
hershey is on whats left of the bed
she holds a cup of coffee more interested in its warmth than its contents
dredd is nearby
with the borrowed helmet off we see how haggard he looks
in the other room fergie putters with the wrecked computer
clones from a genetic laboratory
pause wryly i guess i wasnt so bad in court after all
thats why the dna convicted you
you and rico are
he just broke down first
how many times have you said i had no feelings no emotions
now you know why
g children were born in laboratories even back in the twentieth century
test tube babies in vitro fertilization
no one ever questioned their its not the same
they had parents they embraced their humanity
they didnt hide it
the janus project didnt do that to you
you did that to yourself
he turns startled
realizes shes right
almost in wonder myself
ive been wrong about so much
never the law dredd
never the law
that means more than anything else she can say to him
he looks into her eyes
fergie comes in ends the moment
you can forget the terminal out here
were gonna have to go somewhere else to get in the system
after a moment hershey
you just said i was never wrong about the law
they took away my badge
im a convicted murderer
i have no authority any more no legal authority
without the law as a safety net dredd is in uncharted emotional territory
wi you help me hershey
not as a judge but
as my friend
s the most ordinary request anyone could make
anyone but dredd
hershey understands how much it means
she fights back ears puts her hand on his arm
id be honored
dredd reaches over squeezes her hand
theres absolutely nc n
nc sexual about it and that makes it even more powerful
rico is at the main control console
behind him ilsa is tinkering with a cleaning d id
eh ral the dna sample has been taken out of frozen stasis
i am ready to begin the cloning process
of plans central
i want to purge that dna sample
ilsa looks up startled as the computer whirrs
dna sample purged
if you wish to proceed with cloning i will require a new sample
what are you doing
the same thing you are house cleaning
mock annoyed she throws a cleaning rag at him
she turns on he droid
it moves off polishing the floor
curious she icins rico
central active the dna sampling console
nind rico another console lights up
rico crosses to it passing by his pet robot
r co the sampling console is ready
rips his sleeve open to the elbow
rnec arm in a special steel hollow
clamps close s arm down
rico cont d central
take dna sample
drill like device descends with a frightening grind anc stabs right into his arm
sumps startled a fleck of blood splatters on her clothes the drill like device retreats while another automated device slaps a plasti bandage on riccs arm
the clamps open
new dna sample being analyzed
ma rix scan complete
rico pulls ilsa into his arms
rico cont d kiss me professor
im gonna be a father
dark except for a glow in a cubicle at a bend in the corridor
camera creeps towards the light
meanwhile we hear the central i order you to give me the location of the janus lab immediately
by now the camera is in olmeyers student pod
olmeyer x fergie and hershey are in a corner watching and whispering
edd is on the other side of the cubicle at a central station
r es wearing his own helmet and badge again
i am sorry but the location of the janus lab is classified information accessible only to chief justice griffin and council judge rico
hes a council judge now
actually the onl council judge
chief justice griffin promoted him so they could both use me to get the janus lab up and running
youre helping them
they are the highest ranking surviving judges in mega city
i am programmed to obey them
but theyre breaking the law
who the hell programmed you
chief justice griffin and council judge rico are my lawful superiors unless and until criminal charges are filed against them
ill file charges
now weve already been over that one youre not a judge anymore and you cant file charges
flash of inspiration
dredd excitedly signals hershey
this is judge hershey
i hereby file formal charges of murder against chief justice griffin and council judge rico
and i order you to give me the location of the janus lab so that i may personally make the arrest
certainly judge hershey
however as per mega city code section paragraph a i need authorization from the chief justice to arrest a council judge
similarly as stated in paragraph b same section i need authorization from any council judges to arrest a chief justice
in this case that would be chief judge griffin and council judge rico
we need permission from them to arrest
and without their authorization you cannot file charges and without charges i cannot violate security and tell you the location of the lab
i hope this is finally clear
if there arent any other requests may i close this work station
these last few days have been a strain and i really need to defrag
the work station shuts down
fergie youve got to have something a password a kluge centrals a fuzzy a
the best fuzzy a
if reasoning didnt work
pause helpless nothing will
come on you cracked the food robot
the shuttle computer simple systems dredd
besides i was scared
those were life or death situations
thats when my adrenalin shoots up and my brain goes into overtime but you cant predict when thats gonna dredd grabs him tucks him under his arm like a newspaper
and leaves the pod
the others are so surprised its a second before they follow
x dredd strides down the hallway holding fergie up in the air
x first that goddamn computer turned x on me
fergies head hits a light fixture
the bulb explodes
x dredd have you gone craz ow
x dredd steers him into another hanging fixture
stop it ow
are you out x of your ow
x dredd youre scaring him
x thats the idea
x another bulb explodes
damn it dredd lemme down
im hitting every goddamn i c ice close i
his position we can see the flash of inspiration on x s ace
finishing the thought light
ou side the nearby window a galaxy ofillumination
x the city liahats
fergie cont d dredd instantly obeys
fergies actually excited
he races x back to the student pod the others right behind him
he pulls hersheys sleeve
have it show you the city power grid
i need to see the city power grid
certainly judge hershey
im glad weve finally changed the subject
the first level of the city power grid comes up
like the first page of the thomas guide its very general and low on detail
into her ear tell it to scan around all the grid sections
scan through all the grid sections
rapid images now different neighborhoods of mega city all depicted as computer graphics of color and pattern
what are we doing
getting it a whisper the lab was top secret
it had to be in an out of the way place to stay secret
out of the way places have low power demands
but a genetic lab would suck power likea motherfu they all rush forward look at the grid
its mostly dark just specks of light but theres one pulsing hot spot
red quad section the oldest part of mega city
olmeyer turns looks off
x did you hear something
its probably just the judge hunters
when i was off line a moment ago judge griffin asked me if i knew where you were
naturally i told him yes and gave him your location
get out quick
what about you ill tell them you forced me to help you get out
jx of pursuit are closer
fergie yanks dredds arm
at the last moment hershey spontaneously kisses mever
needless to say hes thrilled
x as redd co
break to leave theyre momentarily visible in the bend of the corridor
shots ring out
olmeyer makes his x deo s
he jumps into the aisle starts firing
olmeyer contd x over his
shoulder hershey run
he charges forward firing again and again handling the weapon like an expert
totally caught by surprise
they fire back for a second but then olmeyers fusillade of ricocheting bullets sends them diving for cover
almost at the flying cycle
hershey hesitates at the shots
dredd grimly pushes her towards the bike
gun empty he dives for cover
three of the judge hunters barrel past and the forth cracks him over the head and kicks away the weapon
roars into the sky
for the second time the judge hunters are too late
while his comrades radio report he angrily stalks back to where olme yer i s s i tting on the floor under guard
x youre under arrest cadet
anything you say will be held against you
woozy from the blow to the head olmeyer nods pleased
x judge hershey
comes in sees rico and ilsa
crosses quickly towards ne m
dredd got away from the hunters
he could be on his way here right now
hes going to be seriously outnumbered
correct council judge rico
the new dna sample has been multi plexed and the gametes are already dividing
what the hells going on
hey that old dna was in there for over years
sooner or later you gotta clean out the fridge
that sample was created from the finest specimens on the council of judges
what did you replace it with
rico just smiles
can you think of a better model
corners on the curves
ive test driven him
pulls rico away from her talks in a desperate whisper
you dont know what youre doing
software or wetware when you make reproductions theres always the danger of a defective copy
the last time there was one perfect copy me
and one defective copy lou
you had a mutation on the y chromosone
a mutat on that made me the next step in human evolution
a mutation that made you a genetic criminal
whats your excuse
rico for gods sake listen
youre a defective copy yourself
and now youre making more copies that will be even more mutated more youre lying
all you care about is control
well the next batch of janus judges wont be the puppets you want
theyll be my brothers and sisters mine to control
im going to breed some more of me
the old fashioned way
id like to be a fly on that wall
you will be
looks from rico to ilsa and back again suddenly seeing them clearly for the first time
i never should have started this
but now ill finish it i
he draws his lawgiver
but it has barely cleared the holster when the abc robot grabs griffins wrist
it plucks the weapon from his han as if hes a child hangs on to him
you shouldnt have done that
fido is very loyal
the robot grabs griffin with its other hand
hes completely off the ground now
let me go
im sorry chief justice
the abc robot is not tied into my main processor
judge rico has sole voice control
thats right griff
you gotta get with this hi tech stuff
robot tear off judge griffins arms and legs
save his head for last
camera adjusts as griffin screams with fear and then as we ghten on rico and ilsa and we see the horrible shadows on t ne wall the screams become far
cc watches with wincing amusement like a spectator at a par cularly rough hockey game
sa watches with a sick fascination and awe
ally the screams and horrible wrenching sounds stop
theres a t the robot returns to position metal hands stained
where were we
before we go on um
may i assume that judge griffin has uh
retired from duty
you may so assume
i a central i
well in the uh absence of any other um
surviving council judges you are now the presiding chief justice
how may i sex e you
send in the clones
the lab is completely on line
the clone incubators are on line
the first batch of clones from your personal dna can be hatched in eight hours
chief justice rico how many copies of you would you like
lets start with
camera adjusts to show the incubators as they begin to fill with beginning cloning process
and as an eight hour countdown begins we tne oldest part of the city with buildings and architecture rom our era and even earlier
camera dollies back
the flying lawmaster has just landed directly in front of camera
i ers i ev checks her lawgiver
dredd swing cocks the remington ixe a western hero
this looks like a really bad neighborhood
ill stay here and watch the bike we might need you to shut down the janus system
knew you were gonna say that
she checks a scanner
judge dredd rev
camera zooms back
theyre on the artiall ruined head of x the statue of liberty
now t ey descend into the torso
x dredd hershey and fergie move down through the long neglected monument
bats flutter past
only fergie ducks
this is fraggy
no ones been up here in a hundred years
someones sure down below
they come down to a curved landing
they walk along the curve
to a dead end
no wait it moved
as she turns to look around the abc robot lunges out of the shadows grabs her off her feet
she drops her lawgiver and scanner
the robot holds hershey with one hand opens fire with the other
fergie is hit
dredd throws the wounded hacker to relative safety swings up
the ancient remington fires at the robot
she flinches even though she knows dredd is aiming around her
but dredds bullets barely dent the robot
man and robot advance on each other like hong kong gunmen blasting away
dredds shots bounce off the robots armor
some of the robots shots miss dredd some bounce off dredds armor and one shot wings dredds shoulder
but dredd keeps a bullet hits a tendon like control wire
with an electronic scream the robot goes down
but it hangs onto hershey
suddenly a pneumatic door slides open
rico and isa are there backlit
drop your gun
starting to aim edsel here still has another t h e robot looks sharply at dredd
on a count of three
break judge hersheys neck
groaning the robot stands tenses
dredd throws down remington beside hersheys lawgiver
ilsa comes over to the v ea c s
she picks up the remington
starts to reach for the s a a dance towards each other
suddenly ilsa grins
and kicks it away
shes such a tease
dredd is taken away
the pneumatic door closes leaving hershey and fergie in darkness withthe robot
hes marched between rico and ilsa
he looks a lot like you
he is a lot like me
im nothing like you
the only difference between us joseph is that you destroyed your life when you embraced the law
i destroyed the law and embraced
dredd reacts startled to hear this twisted version of his own earlier words
ricos voice contd and speaking of life
a sw tch is thrown a u sts lab very wide night cr the first time we see it fully operational fully lit ea inc with cold efficiency
despite himself dredd is
rico dances into the great room expansive
ilsa oes dredd forward
this is where we were born brother
can you feel the magic
come see where we began
drawn despite himself he stands beside rico head turned up like his clone brothers
they never looked more alike
dredd looks into the glass of the incubator chambers just above him
inside still forming human shapes male and female suspended in milky fluid
look at them
full of promise
the dawn of the new day
pause turning the dawn of a new species
the abc stands guard hershey still in its metal grip
she struggles but cant free herself
fergie groans opens his eyes
he presses one hand against his wound
then sees hersheys predicament
then he looks at the robot from head to toe
rico points to the other banks of incubators
our brothers and sisters will be born in two hours
an endless supply of perfection to guard mega city forever
turning earnest dredd
i cant train them alone
wide them alone
you can help me
you have to help me its your x birthright
you get nothing from me rico
youve betrayed the law
you dare mention betrayal to me
i was your friend
more then a friend
i was oyal to you
and you judged me
you sent me up for nine years o frozen hell in aspen
and you dare say betrayal to me
he raises his lawgiver aims it between dredds eyes
dead serious x dredd
give me your word youll help me raise the kids
when aspen thaws rico
go to hell
rico grins boyishly lowers the gun
you knew i couldnt pull the trigger
he steps back
his face hardens
the pneumatic door opens
limping on its bad leg the robot clanks slowly into the room still hanging onto hershey
rico points at dredd
rico cont d rip his arms and legs off
one by one
save his head for last
e robot turns clanks
extends its free hand towards dredd
red backs up into a wall
the robot keeps coming moving ce weer
rico and ilsa and then the robot turns backhands ips over backwards drops down a level
ilsa runs z war and the robot knocks her aside too
until he sees fergie hanging on the back of the his hands deep inside it working its circuits
now theres one more sizzle and spark and the machine drops hershey
she throws the remington a sa dropped to dredd
whirls fires down at rico
rico dives for cover
manages to grab his lawgiver
he fires back up at dredd
jumps to her feet right into hersheys fist
hangs on to the robot as it staggers around trying to regain control of its own movements
it stumbles back out into the corridor
fergie sees its reaching for him
desperate fergie reaches into the robot as far as he can throws a switch
punches its own fist into its brain
the head explodes
hi s the floor hard
something inside him breaks
but he still has enough strength to look up and see smoke billows from its head
fist still buried to the wrist in a bizarre salute it slowly topples
erci e slumps
nue to struggle hand to hand
ilsa breaks free goes into
er blurring karate moves finishes as always with a savage k
k to the crotch hershey just grins
you dont fight girls much do you
she grabs ilsas ankle flips her
hes trying to keep rico at bay but hes clearly outgunned
reloading behind cover he sees fergie in the doorway
crawls over to him
fergies ashen his shirt soaked with blood
say it dredd
then dredd remembers
i made a mistake
im sorry i misjudged you
and youll never arrest me again
and ill never arrest you again
dredd closes his eyes
camera tightens on dredd as nis face fills with fury
he sees hersheys lawgiver on the cor
snatches it up
we crane up with him as he cocks it
wnrls charges into the open
hes a one man mobile artillery charge aiming firing and snou
nq commands to his computerized weapon
its like a fireworks display as round after round of special bullet roars from dredds weapon whirling all over the room
mind totally blown rico tries to aim but then the bullets start to seek him out
he dives behind some consoles
armor piercing rounds chase him punching holes just above his head
equipment sparks and smokes
rico takes cover lowers his voice
hatch the first set of clones now
the cloning process is not finished chief justice rico
the clones will be only per cent complete
fuck that i need reinforcements
hatch the goddamn clones now
beginning hatching process
i know were going to regret this
to the incubators
they begin to open
dughs as he passes a smoking console
moves forward feet rjnching on glass
shey and sa they roll into the workshop area
hershey gets a none nob or
ilsa grabs a wrench smashes it overhead
ilsa turns kicks her
hershey es to get to he feet
ilsa moves in ready to deliver the r l inc blow
and then she screams
a clone is oozing out of an incubator right in front of her face
its half formed raw muscle and sinew barely covering in shock ilsa backs away drops the wrench
the clone clumsy falls
hershey recoils from it in shock recovers her wits and tackles ilsa
fumbling along in the smoke
suddenly another half formed clone rears up in his face
it mews horribly clutches at him
dredd fires a burst at it
it fa s away vanishes in the smoke
x whirls at the shot
fires at the muzzle flash
we hear a x groan and a thud
grinning rico races in that direction
x still fighting
ilsa gets in one two terrific blows
x judge bitch to you
x hershey clobbers her with a right
x he rushes forward elated
tilt down to the body
its one of x clones dressed in parts of dredds uniform
x dread is on top of a big console
x dredd cont d x here comes the judge
x ives down on rico
each man grabs each others wrists
x h t e lawgivers both fire wildly
dredd and rico carom off x ec ua pment fall
ru omitted thru a short stairwell breaks their fall and separates them at the x bottom
rico rolls to his knees still armed
dredd is slowly x comina towards him unarmed
x all lethal rounds exhausted
all lethal rounds exhausted
dredd is almost on top of him
the round hits him like a pile driver
his shirt catches fire
he falls backwards over a railing as the smoke coils upwards
turn off overhead lighting
the lights go out
rico grins runs out of shot
s rprised by the darkness ilsa falls sliding on the slick floor
hershey limping comes towards her
lsa foot sweeps her to the floor
on the floor below chest blackened trying to catch his breath
he reacts as the lights go out
seeing a light in the smoke he crawls to it
his face falls when he sees its one of centrals central
can you x dont expect help from me escaped convict dredd
i have x explained your legal standing repeatedly
i advise you to surrender
okay you win
ill give myself up to chief justice rico
where is he
oh he went upstairs
the lights come on
central cont d straight ahead to your right
ricc is starting the lawmaster mark iv
turns too late dredds tackle takes him out of the sa
os fc b e and on the edge of the ruined head
the lawgiver skids x cu reach
high above the city they trade punches
for a moment dredd has the advantage
x thats for fargo
thats for the u co ncil
thats for fergie
waitll i get to me
then even from this distance we see rico connect with dredds chest wound
dredd almost folds
ricos almost as exhausted as dredd
on the other hand
dredd is in agony
this is how you repay me x for telling you the truth
that x we were born with a destiny to rule
x a destiny you spit on
x rico hits him on the wound again
dredd falls rolls to the edge of the rubble strewn platform
rico grins struggles to x full height
rico cont d joseph dredd
i hereby judge you
x to the charge of betraying your best friend
to the charge of betraying your flesh
rico leans over the helpless dredd
dredd slips over the edge dangles
to the charge of being human when you could have been a god
rico nicks up the lawgiver
puts it right against dredds head
the sentence is death
all lethal rounds exhausted
dredd dares everything grabs ricos hand
dredds finger makes contact with the pistol grip
and as he shouts it he uses his last strength to smack the weapon away
the signal flare round fires like a rocket
rico off balance
is knocked backwards
he falls screaming to his death
he watches his brother fall
starts to climb up
a boot steps on his hand
he looks up
w ilsa h bruised bloody angry
a fist smashes into her haw
sa falls next to the lawmaster iv
hershey reaches down for redds hand r
dm ted thru dbe i and hershey at the pneumatic door lower level sa cuffed is on the floor unconscious
hershey helps sa
they look at each other
dredd looks back in e lab
nods at hershey
she raises her weapon
speaks into grenade
the incubators explode
ha n reaction spreads through the lab
one by one consoles ant wcrx stations erupt
the unborn clones scream soundlessly as ev burn
iv e jmat i c door weary dredd closes it
as it blocks his face we go to a circle of light forms around ricos body
a squad of judge hunters has appeared on lawmasters
dredd and hershey come into view
they know judge dredd
olmeyer is with them a little banged up
x olmeyer contd x they know now
the judge hunters put away their weapons
the leader approaches dredd salutes
you saved mega city sir
youre a hero
just a judge
i did my job
camera adjusts and we see that he is holding fergies body in z
heres your hero
the other judges take fergies body respectfully
hershey and x ever approach dredd
x we have to reconstitute the council x judge dredd
you should be on it
x doesnt look convinced
hershey even less so
thats not for him
x this is for him
x camera adjusts
olmeyer is holding dredds helmet
hershey x akes it puts it on dredd
for a moment the shot matches the x one of fargo and the two cadets just before his long walk
x and then dredd too turns and walks
not into the wilderness x into his city
