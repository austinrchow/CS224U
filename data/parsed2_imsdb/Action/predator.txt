april with revision goldenrod january the infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars
as we slowly descend through the varied shades of blue of the earths atmosphere we hear the first strains of a haunting central american flute joined by a swelling background
of jungle sounds
we descend further through a lush jungle canopy backlit by a setting sun
through a collage of shimmering heat waves a dark other worldly object drops into view backlit by the fiery orange red sphere of a setting tropical sun heading slowly towards
us floating as if suspended by the rising heat of the jungle
continuing to approach the shimmering object resolves into a military assault helicopter its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight
drawing closer the sound of powerful turbines throbbing in the heavy air becomes dominant overpowering
guided by colored smoke and landing lights the chopper looms hard into view pitching forward and settling to the ground kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation where a
man wearing a military uniform watches through the large open windows the helicopter as it continues to approach
before the skids have even touched down he sees the first of the men dressed in civilian clothes but carrying full combat gear alight gracefully from the chopper double timing
in close order to one side the orders shouted by one man lost in the roar of the chopper
the man turns away from the window to a figure hidden in the shadows
he turns back lowering a bamboo shade obscuring the window
on adjoining pads two other helicopters are visible in the b
can be seen several concrete and thatchwork buildings a secret command post disguised as a coastal the post in a flurry of activity american advisors shouting directions to dozens of
latin american soldiers who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to load equipment into the other choppers
inside the chopper one man remains stretched out against the bulkhead as if asleep
he stirs sits up lighting up a cigar
with fatigue showing in his motion he leans forward descending to the ground
a jeep pulls to stop the man swinging casually into the front seat tossing his gear into the rear
with a lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post
in the doorway two men solemnly watch as the jeep approaches
reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep heading towards the two men
into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps major alan schaefer the team leader an intelligent and intense man
he informally salutes general h
philips hardened close cropped graying hair his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the u
he clasps schaefer warmly on the shoulder
with affection youre looking well dutch
its been a long time general
they walk up the stairs entering the palapa leaving the other man on guard
large two room concrete floor thatched walls and roof
behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen a naked lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of compact field radio equipment maps and aerial photographs
otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in stark contrast to this high tech invasion
philips and schaefer enter the room
growing serious weve got a real problem here something right up your alley
they cross to the center of the room to a folding table covered with a large topographical map of the central american highland jungle
philips leans over the table circling a set of coordinates and a mark on the open map
eighteen hours ago i was informed that one of our choppers transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming little country was shot down
point to the circled area the pilots radioed from the ground that they were all alive
their position was fixed by the transponder beacon onboard the chopper
schaefer studies the map
he looks up at philips
thats over the border general
dead serious thats the problem
apparently they strayed off course
pause were certain theyve been captured by the guerrillas
schaefer looks up puffing lightly on the cigar
quietly what have you got in mind general
we figure weve got less than twenty four hours to catch up with them
after that theres not much hope
we want a rescue operation mounted tonight
that doesnt give you much time
another puff on the cigar
what else it new
when do we leave
philips looks at his watch
you lift off in three hours
pause theres one other thing
whats that general
someone else will be going in with you
schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray
you know we dont work with outsiders general
who said anything about outsiders dutch
schaefer turns seeing the outline of a figure standing in the doorway of the communications room holding a sheaf of papers
wearing pressed fatigues dillon mid thirties black walks into the room
although as rugged looking as the others his bearing and grooming indicate hes been away from the business of soldiering for sometime
his quick intelligent eyes reveal his current profession
last time we danced it was lieutenant schaefer
a grin breaks out across schaefers face
dillon you son of a bitch
the two men step forward and simultaneous swing from the hip as it to land a punch
but their hands slap together in a gesture of friendship their forearms bulging testing each others strength
warmly how you been dutch
they continue the contest schaefer has the edge forcing dillons arm slowly downward
youve been pushing too many pencils dillon
grinning no way old buddy
you never did know when to quit
they look into each others faces each remembering something from the past
a moments hesitation and they quit the contest
they laugh dillon slapping schaefer on the shoulder
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something
blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat
like the old days dillon
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya
schaefer looks at dillon quietly considering him
wasnt my style
were a rescue unit not assassins
smiles this must be good
big shot from the cia leaves his desk to come back to the bush
whats so important
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world
theyre about to get squeezed
we cant let that happen
i needed someone who could get the job done quick and quiet
no screw ups
i needed the best
so i pulled a few strings at the state department
and here we are
dillon goes to the map
the set up is simple dutch
one day job
we pick up their trail at the chopper run em down grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there
youve done it a hundred times
nothing out of the ordinary
schaefer considers this
and nothing we cant handle alone
philips breaks in
im afraid those are your orders major
once you reach your objective dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge
schaefer looks from philips to dillon
he still doesnt like it
not to worry dutch
i havent lost my edge
theyve got a head start on us in some real tough country otherwise believe me its a piece of cake
gentlemen were losing time
to schaefer youd better get your men ready
pause good luck major
burst over the top of a ridge
rising up in silhouette they perform a radical left bank turn and descend rapidly into an adjoining valley racing over the jungle at treetop level
as the helicopters perform dizzying high speed maneuvers through the winding canyon the pilots voices can be heard coordinating their operations
voice over redbird two two
bearing south three five zero one ockock on the saddle ridge
voice over roger blue leader
three five zero on your move
the helicopters rise in perfect coordination over another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley leveling out as they go
illuminated by the eerie red glow of night lights are seven men dressed in jungle camouflage soft hats and camouflage face makeup
they wear no identity badges or insignias
the man are checking their weapons making last minute adjustments to their gear
the compartment reverberates with the noise of the thumping rotors and the roar of air from the open doors
blain weapons and ordinance specialist a frightening bull of a man a pound killer removes from his shirtpocket a think plug of tobacco
he looks across at mac a huge bear of a man black holding am m machine gun
blain holds out the tobacco to mac who refuses with a gentle shake of the head a knowing smile he knows whats coming
holding the plug between his teeth blain yanks free from his shoulder scabbard a wicked ten inch combat knife
placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips he slices through the plug as if it were butter
he chews throughtfully
seated by the open doorway is ramirez a slight angular man an east l
adding a final piece of camouflage tape to his pack harness he looks up and smiles faking a throw and the bulleting the tape to hawkins the radioman and medic
irish street tough reading a rolled up magazine as if he were a rush hour commuter
he snags the tape with an instinctual snap of the wrist continuing to read for a moment before looking up grinning at ramirez his boyish eager face belying the rugged
he turns his gaze to the man next to him billy the kit carson scout an american indian proud stoic a man of quiet strength and simplicity carefully replacing the
firing mechanism of his m working its action several times
he looks up with a smile at hawkins
shouting hey billy how many marines does it take to eat a squirrel
billy looks back shaking his head uncomprehending
one to eat it and one to watch for cars
hawkins laughs heartily at his joke
clearing another ridge the helicopters plunge into a steep descent turning quickly into a deep walled canyon the force of the turn accentuated by the changing pitch of the screaming
turbines and the biting of rotors into the air
the men suspended in restraining harnesses from the bulkheads lean forward nearly upside down in response to the radical maneuver handling the situation with ease
blain holds out the tobacco to ramirez who swats at the offending object as if it were alive
shouting get that stinkin thing out of my face blain
grinning blain proffers the plug to each man each one refusing theyve done it a thousand times
its an old gag but they obviously care for the man in a big way
bunch of slack jawed faggots around here
holds up plug this stuff will put hair guaranteed
chewing make you a god damned sexual ty ran toe sore ass
just like me
this brings a chorus of hoots and shouts from the others
the helicopter makes another radical turn
schaefer and dillon seated near the cockpit communicate through headsets also linked to the pilot
they consult a topographical map by red penlights
pointing to the map our rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed
awacs contact on four hour intervals
whos our back up on this
grinning no such thing old buddy
its a one way ticket
once we cross that border were on our own
this gets better by the minute
the pilot and co pilot are surrounded by an array of dimly lit gauges and switches
before the co pilot is a radar screen and an infra red display terminal on which the two helicopters appear as heat sources
roger bird two two
reconfirm insertion at tango charlie delta one zero niner on the grid at zero two two mark four by zero
voice over two two leader
roger your insert co ord
leader to bird two two
i bear two minutes to landing zone
the pilot throws a switch on the panel before him a blue light appears on the forward bulkhead
schaefer is speaking over a radio telephone
the co pilot turns and hands him a clipboard
schaefer reads notes his approval and hands it back
flares up into position over the jungle and hovers as the support helicopter holds in a protective position above
dillon seems comfortable with the men showing ramirez a battered cigarette lighter from a famed commando unit from the past
but his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing mac who regards dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an outsider
mac looks up at blain his eyes narrowing
blains massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew
he pauses eyes moving downward spotting his target
he hocks a thick vile stream of tobacco juice directly between dillons legs and onto the floor a gelatinous skein lacing across the toe of one boot
dillon looks up his face goes cold and menacing
icy man thats a real bad habit youve got
dillon turns back to ramirez ignoring mac and blain who continues to stare at him
mac looks across at blain wide grins breaking across their huge faces
cradled in blains arms as if it were a part of his body is a large canvas covered bundle
blain looks down at his bundle almost affectionately
the pilots voice breaks in over schaefers headset
voice over lz comin up in seconds
stand by the rappel lines
looking up schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest man who nods and in return passes the signal down the line
ramirez and blain pick up heavy metal conical devices attached to canvas bags filled with rope
from the open doors the rappelling lines hurtle into space crashing through the double canopy of the trees and to the jungle floor below
the blue light changes to green
rappelling devices snap into place
gloved hands grab onto rope
combat boots move into position
shouting to schaefer you dont know how much i missed this dutch
once you get this in your blood you never get it out
you never were all that smart
men leap from the chopper
the man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by the darkness below
the helicopters depart thumping their way into the night
a light shower passes through the trees
the sky clears revealing a lush and exotic foliage
birds are beginning to sing but otherwise all is silent
the dense growth seems impenetrable but from a solid wall of undergrowth a hand appears and signals in a downward motion
as if by magic the assault team materializes quietly cautiously
schaefer makes another gesture and the team moves forward in perfect harmony in point lock step taking their cue from ramirez the pointman
schaefer highly focused and alert to every sound and movement follows ramirez as if organically connected
descending the steep mountain slope the team encounters an even denser growth of jungle at times moving by instinct as they are often visually separated
at one point schaefer checks his compass flashing some hand signals to ramirez indicating a new direction
ramirez nods and moves on schaefer signaling to the rest of the men
blain in a defensive position sweeps the jungle slowly with his mp
he steps back and turns checking revealing in the b
the wreckage of a u
army uh h helicopter hanging upside down twenty feet above the ground entangled in vines in the heavy capony badly damaged rotors bent its tail section blown away
a grappling hook is hurled from the ground clattering into the cargo hold hooking the edge of the airframe
ramirez moves cautiously searching for trip wires using his knife to check the edges of the seats and door frames
grimly he glances at the two bodies slumped over the controls and then exits snapping into and rappelling down the rope to the ground
he joins schaefer standing in the f
they look up watching as dillon moves through the cockpit searching through pockets and compartments
schaefer turns his back to the helicopter
the pilots have each got one round in the head
and whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it
schaefer studies the clearing eyes always moving wary
he turns back looking at the chopper
took em out with a heat seeker
theres something else major
i dont think that was any ordinary army taxi
schaefer looks at him quizically
looks more like a surveillance bird to me
dillon rappells down the line and approaches
have you picked up their trail yet
schaefer taps ramirez on the shoulder and he moves away
schaefer turns to dillon billys on it
indicates chopper heat seeker
pretty sophisticated for half asses mountain boys
theyre getting better equipped every day
bill approaches from the b
major looks like there were ten maybe twelve guerrillas
looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper
points then a different set of track over there
puzzled what do you mean
six others u
issue jungle boots
they came in from the north then followed the guerrillas
schaefer turns to dillon
mean anything to you
probably another rebel patrol
they operate in here all the time
schaefer is obviously concerned about this
he turns to billy
get ahead see what you can find
to ramirez slow and easy
to dillon we dont want any accidents
billy takes up the trail disappearing in to the jungle
ramirez signals the team moves out
as billy reconnoiters ramirez looks back and gives a sign
schaefer nods and rappels down cliff
as he joins ramirez there seem to be butterflies everywhere whats he got
same business guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper
followed by men with american equipment
ramirez seems concerned by this
schaefer signals him to move on
before he follows schaefer looks around theres something dodgy about this
over his head is a butterfly on a limb as the assault team passes below a butterfly lands on what appears to be the bark of a tree
it fans its wings and flies on
the impression of the butterfly remains in perfect relief as is imprinted on the bark
the image fades revealing for an instant a gridwork of tiny scales on the bark
the bark moves
changing colors like a chameleon revealing for an instant the form of something alive as it flows into the leaves once again becoming indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage
two eyes faintly flowing yellow appear in the foliage
they blink disappearing and then become visible again
seen through heat seeking vision studying the teams careful silent movements at they pass by
the sounds of the forest are also altered and enhanced with an electric staticlike quality
the observer scans over the men
and then focuses on schaefer as he crouches down signaling forward and rear with a circular motion
he refers to an object in his hand studying it carefully
using a map in lining out a course on his compass
the other team members appear silently clustering around him
using hand signals schaefer indicates a course change
watches closely as schaefer continues with his hand signals instructing his team
the hillside of a steep valley dark and foreboding
billy passes by and halts removing his knife
with his other hand he pulls down from overhead a thick vine severing it
a thin stream of water emerges which he drinks
suddenly he stops letting the water drip to the ground
he quietly releases the vine and brings his m shotgun to bear listening intently
something seems wrong
he brings his eyes upward and stares hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside
as his eyes strain to penetrate the dense intertwined canopy he is engulfed by the rising sounds of the jungle a cacophony of buzzing and clicking amplified in the sweltering
heat of the day
unable to locate a source to account for his anxiety he relaxes moving on resuming the track
examines the ground as he moves growing confused and puzzled by what he sees before him
he stops scrutinizing the jungle probing the world around him with his keen senses
hearing a faint rustling sound he looks up seeing a curtain of moss several feet away
he takes a cautious step forward extending his weapon
he reaches forward with his free hand touching the moss
behind the curtain a slight shifting of dark forms occurs
he pauses and then with a sudden movement sweeps the moss aside
a black explosion of fluttering wings as carrion eating birds rush past billys body
billys face seizes into a mask of horror his expression descending into a state of complete primitive shock his eyes staring transfixed inches away from the leering death grin of
a human face upside down completely stripped of skin
reeling his body numbed by the sight before him he stumbles backwards and stops
vines threaded through their achilles tendons the bodies of three men skinned and gutted hang suspended in the think suffocating air buzzing with insects
billy turns away revulsed as ramirez moves quietly into view schaefer directly behind him
ramirez stares at the bodies now seen to be in the first stages of deterioration strips of flesh torn away by the birds and other scavengers
in an almost childlike manner he crosses himself
hoarse whisper holy mother
schaefer moves into the clearing kneeling beside a bloody pile of clothing and entrails
he examines the clothing and then rises holding a dog tag on a broken chain
he reads the tag his face growing hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag recognizing the name
to himself j
davis captain u
schaefers eyes move from the bloody dog tag to the bodies
cut them down
mac moves forward withdrawing his combat knife
the blade flashes cutting the vine as the first body thuds to the ground
he bends over picking up other dog tags
schaefer turns to dillon
i knew this man
green berets out of fort bragg
what the hell were they doing in here
you got any answers for this dillon
this is inhuman
to schaefer uh
i wasnt told of any operations in this area
they shouldnt have been here
angry well somebody sent them
schaefer walks off
mac steps out of the clearing sheathing his knife with a violent gesture passing ramirez
seething must have run into the guerrillas fucking animals
mac moves alongside blain
spits aint no way for a soldier to die
looks at blain time to let ol painless out of the bag
grimly blain rips apart the velcro closures of the canvas bundle slung across his shoulder revealing a truly awesome weapon a six barreled mini gun adapted for field combat
kneels at the side of the original trail examining the ground
he rises holding a spent cartridge
schaefer approaches kneeling beside him
what happened here billy
billy looks at him puzzled
there was a firefight
shooting in all directions
i cant believe jim hopper walked into an ambush
i dont believe he did sir
i couldnt find a single track
just doesnt make sense
what about the rest of hoppers men
billy shakes his head
uncomfortably no sign
they never left here major
pause its like they just disappeared
schaefer ponders a moment
then to billy stick with the guerilla trail
to team lets get it over with
five meter spread
blain feeds the magazine of belted shells into the weapon cocking it
he looks up at mac his eyes cold his face taut with anger
blain hefts the mini gun to his hip as mac draws back slightly on the breech bolt of the m letting it snap
they move on billy pausing to look at the jungle before disappearing into the foliage
carefully watching this exchange from high in the treetop canopy
the observer watches as schaefer turns and leaves the clearing cautiously moving into the jungle
mac appears suddenly materializing out of the undergrowth pausing cautiously his senses alert intense almost nervous
he moves on his huge body barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy undergrowth
as he moves on he crosses over a fallen tree
stepping down his foot breaks through a rotten portion a chuck of the log breaking free and rolling down the hill
dillon at once goes into a defensive position listening
the jungle is silent
he stands and starts to move forward
suddenly mac appears within inches of dillons face
macs face is menacing angry
hissing barely audible youre ghostin on me mother fokaaa
i dont care who you are back in the world
you give away our position again and ill bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin ass right here
hisses spits got it
dillons eyes are wide and fixed staring back in cold hatred at mac controlling his rage
he knows the rules
not waiting for a response mac turns and vanished into the jungle
seething with anger dillon focuses on a still moving leaf and stem indicating macs exit point
he moves on
crouches under heavy foliage waiting
he is joined by mac
they glance briefly at each other scanning in opposite directions for movement and sounds
they speak in whispers
whats goin down
we got movement
shithead with his trenchcoat and dee coda da ring was makin enough noise to get us all waxed
i dont like that guy
dont like him at my back
i aint winding up like those bastards back there
mac sweating heavily wipes the moisture from his brow with his finger
blain pats the mini gun affectionately
i know what you mean bull but dont sweat it me and ol painless here are watchin the front door
as always bro
they do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other
two men who have seen it all through a dozen no win situations and have lived to tell about it
mac advances a few meters and signals slowly
the assault team moving up the hill barely visible in the heavy foliage the team moves cautiously into defensive positions
a moment later they continue up the hill crawling
on their stomachs schaefer and ramirez clear the edge of the knoll seeing below a guerrilla village a huge spreading palapa covering implacements dug into a hillside descending to a
winding stream bed below
men dressed in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian clothes armed with ak assault rifles move about the camp
a heavy machine gun emplacement guards the entrance to the camp
two men sit in the camouflaged emplacement
sweeping the camp with binoculars sees a guard above the camp
one of the man picks up a hand held rocket launcher placing it beside a bandolier of rockets and a radio set and consuls taken from the u
surveillance helicopter as if preparing to take them away
schaefer puts down the glasses looking at ramirez who nods in acknowledgment
a sudden muffled cry brings schaefers attention to one end of the camp where a heavily thatched door covers and opening to the palapa
a guard stands at the door
the door flies open as a hostage shirtless hands tied behind his back staggers through the door as if kicked from behind
the man falls to the ground feebly trying to regain his footing
although difficult to see from schaefers vantage point the mans battered face and welt covered back indicate he has been severely tortured
emerging from the palapa a guerrilla leader moustached and wearing a sidearm approaches the beaten man kicking him viciously in the stomach rolling him to his side
kneeling beside the man he withdraws an automatic from his holster and cocks the hammer
grabbing the man by the hair he jams the muzzle into the mans ear and with a violent twist pulls the trigger
the guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back to the palapa still holding the pistol closing the door behind him
grim faced at having witnesses the murder lowers him glasses a look of cold determination on his face
quickly he and ramirez ease down the escarpment joining the other team members
schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb and the team members gather in close huddle formation
whispering angry just killed one of the prisoners
no time for invitations
we take them now
crawl silently through the underbrush
with nearly impreceptible movements blain slips out of the cartridge pack ditching the mini gun
he withdraws his combat knife placing it between his teeth
they move through the underbrush in tandem like two bug cats stalking
mac freezes the sweat pouring from his face holds up his hand as blain stops
using a blade of grass mac points out a metal trip wire following it to a hidden claymore mine
blain grins making a switching gesture
carefully mac detaches the lead wires
directing the mine towards the camp he reattaches the wires nodding at blain
seen through heat seeking vision focused on blain and mac lying in the grass below their bodies outlined in lumonous aureoles
the observer sees the network of trip wires guarding the approaches to the machine gun nests
the wires glow as if electrified standing out in hard edged relief in contrast to the jungle foliage
he moves higher into the forest canopy
on schaefers signal rises up pulling a sentry to him covering his mouth with his hand jerking him backwards and to the side knocking him off balance with a sweeping
motion of his left leg killing him with his combat knife
belly crawls silently through the tall grass just outside and above the main entrance to the camp
he stops studying the ancient rusted skeleton of a truck parked on a level spot above the camp its engine quietly idling
the truck is jacked and blocked up one rear wheel attached to a belt drive leading to a pump drawing water from a river nearby
in the open cab of the truck a guard is on duty watching the high ground above the camp
schaefer moves out heading for the guard
while one guerrilla attends to his equipment the other attentively watches the approaches to the camp
he is momentarily distracted by a buzzing fly which he annoyingly swats at with his hand
he hears something to his side
turning to investigate the huge hamhock fist of mack smashes into his throat
simultaneously blain rises up behind the other man grabs him by the hair pulling him down his combat knife driving downward
a satchel charge is looped over the gearshift lever resting on the floorboard
schaefer lying low across the seat of the truck turns and looks seeing the guard lying in a heap in the foliage
moves into position to the side and above the camp
he carefully checks the readiness of his six shot grenade launcher also setting his mp in front of him ready for action
crouched to the side of the truck watches the camp seeing below through the dense undergrowth ramirez barely visible signaling
before him are two fragmentation grenades
he looks at his watch and then up the hill to their weapons ready
dillon picks up his binoculars focusing on the machine gun emplacement seeing a man his face covered by a hat
the head rises revealing the face of blain who looks above the camp and slightly nods
putting his glasses down motions to hawkins
to hawkins ready kid
hawkins grins back
together they slip through the grass downward towards the edge of the camp
holds his huge commando machete on a diagonal pushing through the belt slicing it cleanly
turning he crawls silently to the rear of the truck positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton truck
he squats and with an enormous concentrated effort deadlifts the rear of the truck its rusted springs and frame beginning to creak and groan slightly
with a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of its blocks and then pushes forward
he rolls aside disappearing into the ground cover as the truck its tireless rims digging into the earth lops down the hill slowly picking up speed
a guerrilla alerted by the sound of the approaching truck looks up at the hillside seeing the vehicle still moving down the hill at a moderate roll
he calls out and several guerrilla leaves their posts moving out to prepare to stop the truck
the truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed heading towards the main palapa
the men rush forward surrounding the truck trying to slow it down but the truck rolls smashing through the front wall of the palapa
the men gather around truck and then look back up the hill
watching as schaefer pulls the pin and launches the grenade into the air the observer following its arc as it spirals dead center into the camp bouncing twice before rolling
into the fuel dump
which a moment later explodes into an incredible fireball
the expanding fireball released from the explosion is to the observer like an erupting sun momentarily blinding him
the truck is blown up into the air by the explosion
a moment later the satchel charge detonates with an ear splitting explosion tearing the truck apart
jumps to his feet firing an m round into the camp
schaefer races down the hillside joined by dillon leaving hawkins to cover them
bullets burst around their feet as they run low firing short bursts to his left and right
he fires the undermounted grenade launcher sending a round into a gun position in the trees
still running he breaks open the breach slamming in another mm round from the cartridge pack at his waist
blain and mac fire the heavy machine guns laying down a withering curtain of lead shredding the camp taking out five guerrillas at once
a man almost completely on fire is hit by an onslaught of gunfire ripping him back into the jungle
ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the six shooter
seconds later the machine gun implacement erupts in a series of explosions blowing two guerrillas into the air
at the hillside hut two guerrillas move into position by the window drawing down on schaefer as he appears racing down the hill
as they are about to open fire dillon appears yelling out a warning
on your nine
schaefer dives hitting the ground as dillon opens fire taking out the guerrillas
schaefer rolls to his feet spins firing the grenade launcher completely destroying the hut
as the observer regains its vision an eerie surreal experience of sight and sound unfolds bullets streak through the air leaving blood red trails of heat like laser blasts
as they impact into the guerillas we hear the enhanced slapping of bullets seeing tiny blossoms of heat mushroom out of their bodies
we hear the horrific deformed cries and screams of the dying men
another searing blinding explosion sends pieces of shrapnel ripping through the air some of them roaring past the observers position like tiny meteors
at the entrance way to the main palapa a guerrilla stands in the doorway giving cover fire to his comrades as they fall back inside
jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa billy drops directly in front of the guerrilla
from the side unseen by billy another guerrilla thrusts out with a knife billy ducking backwards the tip of the knife slashing his face
with a lightning move billy whips his arm up and around the guerrilla locking his elbow breaking the joint
still holding the man he fires blowing the other guerrilla off his feet with the shotgun portion of his weapon
he looks at the guerrilla out of the corner of his eye
he suddenly strikes breaking his neck dropping him in a heap
billy continues on racing down the stairs firing the meanwhile blain is crouched next to a tree providing cover
behind blain at the edge of the camp circling around from below two guerrillas appear and fire a grenade round which explodes behind blain fragments ripping into the tree next
to which blain is standing bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest one piece tearing into his upper shoulder
the hits have no effect on the huge man and with a savage growl he spins opening fire raking the two attackers with the mini gun
nearby mac charges from the jungle on a dead run diving over a fallen tree as machine gun fire rakes the ground around him
blain spotting the sniper high in a tree opens fire with the mini gun shredding the tree sending the guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the palapa
the sniper crashes through the roof landing on the floor near hawkins and ramirez who do a quick double take before opening fire on a group of fleeing guerrillas taking
out two giving chase to the others
schaefer and dillon appear at the top of the staircase schaefer freezing as he sees below a guerrilla raising an ak preparing to fire
schaefer tackles dillon the two men hurling into the air a moment later bullets ripping into the crates behind where they were standing
dillon rises up kicking over a crate shooting the guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire at him
schaefer crouches covering the upper entrances to the palapa as ramirez rushes past joining schaefer
from the corner of his eye schaefer catches a movement
with a whipping backhanded throw he lets fly his the machete impales the attacking guerrilla driving him backwards pinning him to a post
schaefer and ramirez run towards the lower levels side by side firing as they go
they reach a door schaefer taking out an attacking guerrilla
ramirez grabs the side of the door shoots a look to schaefer and throws it open
with schaefer covering him ramirez takes a quick peak inside and then rushes into the room
at one end is a stairway leading to an escape door
a guerrilla seen from the waist up scrambles down the stairs
at the base of the stairs a guerrilla holding an ak on his hip turns and starts to fire
schaefer and ramirez respond with full auto bursts which rip into the guerrilla spinning him around knocking over a crude wooden table scattering a briefcase with burning papers food cans
and liquor as he spins he fires the weapon an arcing line of slugs slamming into the tin roof sending down a shower of rust and dirt
he falls to the ground
ramirez charges through the dust and thick smoke to cover the fallen men schaefer following close behind jerking a new clip from his ammo belt
suddenly another guerrilla erupts from behind some ammunition crates drawing down on ramirez with a machine pistol
as the guerrilla fires schaefer smashes the butt of his empty weapon into the guerrillas shoulder knocking the gun aside the slugs thudding into the wall harmlessly
he hits the guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to the head with the barrel of his weapon
the guerrilla is hurled backward crashing into the wooden crates and to the floor
ramirez recovering quickly descends the stairs with catlike agility disappearing
schaefer crouches and spins jamming a new clip into the rifle scanning the palapa for any other movement
he races to the main door of the room shouting into the palapa
he sees blain charging down the steps
catching his attention he signals him on out the back to cover ramirez
to hawkins hawk get con
on the hook
position and situation now
as blain runs down the stairs hawkins already has the radio off his back setting up the portable satellite you got it major
ramirez blain and billy race down the back stairs of the palapa firing mini gun automatic and grenade rounds at the escaping guerrillas as they flee the area splashing charging
across the shallow river
the guerrillas are history
in no uncertain terms
for the first time schaefer studies the interior of the cavernous palapa seeing the enormous stockpile of weapons equipment and supplies stacked along the walls obviously a major military stronghold
hidden deep within the mountains
mac hustles up to schaefer a look of urgency on his face
any sign of the hostages
nods we found em both dead
and the gear from the chopper
if theyre central american im a fuckin chinaman
by the looks of em id say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia
pause another thing major we were lucky
couple of those guys we waxed are russians military advisors by the look of it
something big was about to happen here
schaefer looks at mac a moment a flush of anger beginning to show
good work mac
clear the area no traces
get the men ready to move
schaefer goes back into the room looking down at the unconscious guerrilla racking a round into the chamber reloading his weapon
he kneels staring into the face of a woman anna dark late twenties
despite her blood and dirt smeared face she is beautiful
closes eyes shit
he checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her pistol ejecting the clip
he stands beginning to shuffle through the papers scattered about the room
staring at one he looks up the pieces falling together
ramirez at a crouch runs through the jungle following the obvious signs of the guerrillas retreat
he emerges from the trees into an opening leading to a sheer rock cliff towering fifty feet above the ground
scanning the wall he sees movement and quickly takes cover as automatic fire rips up the ground before him
near the center of which a narrow cut two feet wide leads to the top of the cliff giving access to the adjoining ridge
two guerrillas scramble up through the chimney assisted by a rope which with withdraw as they reach the top
ramirez takes out one man the other taking cover returning fire
blain joins ramirez behind cover at the foot of the cliff
as they take cover ramirez notices the wound on blains shoulder
youre bleedin man
blain looks briefly at the wound
spits aint got time to bleed
on a signal they both clear cover and fire long bursts from their weapons up the cliff
the smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered by withering fire
they duck down as a grenade explodes nearby
ramirez quickly replaces the mm rounds into the six shooter
son of a bitchs dug in like a alabama tick
spits jack us around all day
hell dude we dont have all day
ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire blasting six rapid fire shots on a high arc trajectory towards the rocks
blain dives against the protective cover of the rock wall covering his head
ramirez casually hops across squatting next to blain
they make eye contact
whats your problem dude
before blain can answer ramirez puts his fingers into his ears and grimaces just as
the entire hillside explodes blowing the guerrillas into the air a torrent of vegetation and earth raining down the cliff obscuring blain and ramirez
schaefer is staring out the window his weapon slack in one arm still holding the paper
dillon enters obviously excited about what he has found
he sees the papers on the floor
he reads through them quickly growing even more excited
this is beautiful
more than we ever thought
we got the bastards
schaefer turns striding slowly to dillon handing him the paper he is holding
i think this is the one you want
dillon reads it
reacting two days
thats all we had
in two days three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this
after they crossed the border it would have taken a year to stop them
looks up weve averted a major guerrilla invasion dutch
schaefer moves in close to dillon face to face anger flaring in his eyes
slow deliberate it was all bullshit
all of it
from the start
you set us up got us in here to do your dirty work
angry thats right i set you up
youre a veteran at this dutch i had to
because i told you youre the best
i knew you could do it but i couldnt get you in here without a cover story
what story did you give to davis
weve been lookin for this place for months
the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down
hopper was sent in to get my men
he was just doing his job
when he disappeared i had to clean this up i had to stop there bastards
we were so close we couldnt quit
we couldnt sleep through this one
i needed you dutch cant you see that
to invade a foreign country illegally
you lied dillon
stacked the odds against us
set us up
you could have gotten us all killed
pause looking at him you used to be one of us dillon someone i could trust with my life
weve been through a lot together dutch
when we were together no one could stop us the hottest goddamned team the army ever saw
but things changed i woke up
were fighting them in a dozen goddamned countries
its a fight we cant lose dutch
were all expendable assets cant you see that
schaefer takes the paper from dillons hands
thats your problem dillon
you always did put ambition before the lives of your men
pause my men are not expendable
i dont do this kind of work
crumples up paper in fist this is your dirty little war not mine
he stuffs the crumpled paper into dillons shirt pocket
anna regaining consciousness groans a heavy flow of blood running down her face from her head wound
hawkins appears at the door
schaefer turns away from dillon and steps through the doorway into the palapa as anna moans again mumbling something in spanish
dillon kneels beside her
quietly in spanish are you all right
schaefer is talking to hawkins who has the field radio set on a crate just outside the door
urgent major we stepped into some real shit here
i got a hook up with aerial surveillance
nods guerrillas swarming like flies all over the place
cant be more then one maybe two miles away
place is going down major
how much time
half an hour maybe less
schaefer touches him on the shoulder
urgently tell mac we move in five
he starts to walk away
she goes with us
dillon is at the doorway supporting the still groggy anna
shes too valuable
shes got to know their whole network
the whole set up
we take her with us
we take her and shell give away our position every chance she gets
no prisoners dillon
dillon grabs the handset from hawkins radio shoving it at schaefer
youre still under orders dutch
you want to make the call or should i
schaefer looks at the handset
then at dillon he knows dillons won
he starts to walk away but stops turning back pointing a finger at dillon
im getting my men out of this damn jungle dillon
shes your baggage
you fall behind youre on your own
schaefer and billy are kneeling on the ground near the trailhead studying a map
in the b
the team hidden covers the hillside approaches to the camp nervous and wary weapons ready
this place is too hot for a pick up
they wont touch us until were over the border
we can lift at lz here
points to map spotter plane says were cut off
points to map except for this valley
billy shakes his head following the contour lines of the rugged terrain
looks bad major
its gonna be a real bitch
points to map if we follow above the river and then down here at this canyon we might find a way out
schaefer turns to ramirez kneeling close by
decisively not much choice
pancho take the lead
double time it
he turns and looks at dillon anna as his side her forehead bandaged her hands bound in front of her
he turns back to the others
lock n load watch your ass
blain moves out swinging the mini gun in front of him as he goes
watching as dillon leads anna onward seeing her bound hands
dillon pushes her
spins hurling a string of insults to dillon in in spanish you touch me again pig and i will cut off your balls
in spanish its a long walk back make it easy on yourself
she spits at him turning forward with a twist of her head
dillon picks up his back shouldering it
as they move on mac calls out to him
quietly hey dillon over here
dillon doesnt respond
louder dillon over here
dillon turns and approaches warily holding the girl
yeah what is it sergeant
mac unsheathes his knife
he gives dillon a cold look and turns him by the shoulders
crawling across the pack on dillons back is a huge scorpion
mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his blade holding it before the wincing dillon
anna smirks nodding to the writhing stinging insect
in spanish when my people catch you youll wish you were him
dillon looks at mac
mac flings the scorpion to the ground crushing it with his boot
he looks up at dillon walks away
dillon follows pulling anna behind him
billy guarding the rear glances furtively around the clearing
he moves a step forward and stops freezing
slowly he turns back his eyes riveted upon the treeline above the camp
his eyes strain his senses registering a fear he cannot name or see
something is out there in the trees waiting watching
billy turns and walks into the jungle pausing one last time to look behind him before he too disappears from sight
the jungle grows silent
looking down from his vantage point to the treeline below terraces like stepping stones focusing on a tree fifty feet away
the observer utters a low trill and springs outward into space hurtling downward towards his landing point the canopy of the trees approaching in a staccato rush of green
the sounds of the forest are again altered and enhanced with an electric static like quality as the observer descends fluidly through the trees and to the ground
he enters the camp surveying the terrible destruction and carnage
he sees the dead guerrillas the dissipating heat from their bodies leaving them pale and ghost like as if fading light about to extinguish
he sees their weapons the cold hard steel of the barrels registering ice blue in his vision
as it appears pulsing in a pale magenta heat low to the ground holding his weapon
he lays down the weapon picking up the scorpion turning it slowly in his fingers examining it
it looks like an exotic flower its color fading from sight turning to black
a low sound is uttered something vaguely familiar about it a nearly human voice a distorted imitation of mac
filtered dillon over here
again the phrase is uttered improving closer to macs inflection and accent
dillon over here
the hunter lowers the pitch
dillon over here
the last effort is a chilling simulation of macs voice
drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which changes instantly back to the observers skin tones
he turns and focuses on the area where the team left camp
he crouches and springs to the lower branches of a tree grasping them with his clawed three fingered hands pulling himself up and through the branches with astounding speed and
simian like dexterity his spurred prehensile feet grasping and thrusting him to a vantage point fifty feet above the ground
as he moves on the jungle grows suddenly quiet as if aware sensing that the hunter is now stalking no longer observing
the twilight world of a prehistoric forest filled with gigantic plants and towering trees overgrown with vines and creepers
the team with billy at point walk alongside a wandering stream bed weirdly illuminated by shafts of light streaming through openings in the trees as if from spotlights a hundred
it is midday hot and humid the air buzzing with the sounds of insects the crying of birds and monkeys
the men are moving fast and quiet straining to see into the dense jungle aware of every sound sweating quietly slapping at biting insects
lies across their path
as the man climb over a rotten section mac stops to assist blain with his mini gun
ive seen some badass bush before but nothin like this man
pause little taste o home
blain nods and pauses to rest looking around him as mac withdraws a small silver pocket flask
he takes a nip passing the flask to blain who also takes a sip
i hear you bro this is some shit
makes cambodia look like kansas
lose your way in here man you be in some kinda hurt
blain hands back the flask mac replacing it inside his vest
they do their hand dap looking warily behind them before they move on
have fallen behind dillon looking worriedly ahead at the them out distancing them
anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow
she trips on a root falling to the ground
she lies there motionless
he quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet
like an uncoiled spring anna turns flinging a handful of dirt into his face momentarily blinding him
she lunges for his rifle with her bound hands
suddenly the barrel of an mp is thrust into her face
looking up she sees ramirez calmly holding the weapon on her the look in his eyes indicating hed hove no trouble shooting her
in spanish dont try it
she looks back at dillon wiping the dirt from his eyes
she moves on
ramirez gives him a cold look as dillon hurries past
coolly you should put her on a leash agent man
if you cant handle her just say the word
dillon moves on ignoring ramirez who turns scanning the jungle behind him before moving on
dillon catches up with anna turning her sharply by the chin
cold in spanish try that again
she looks at him contemptuously undaunted
she will try it again
she breaks away from his grasp and moves on dillon watching her go he wont hesitate next time
as he travels directly overhead timing his movement with those of the team
he moves lower closer to the slowly moving humans
the team moves cautiously through the winding stream bed now wearing their clothing in various stages of disarray for comfort sweat dripping from their bodies
billy in the lead picks his way along the riverbank his concentration rapt aboriginal
his face a trancelike mask of expectation
blain cradling the heavy mini gun as if it were a toy swings the weapon relentlessly across his field of view
he pauses to adjust the hanging belted loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack magazine
an insect lands on his face and is trapped in the grease paint near his lips
he draws the hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly spits it out his concentration unbroken
mac follows holding the m high across his chest
schaefer bent cautious his feet moving aside the dry leaves on the ground heel to toe and on foot edges
he glances around checking the teams position and progress
hawkins follows his mouth open breathing deeply exhausted the radio a pound demon
anna struggling to climb a section of the stream bank slips on some loose dirt
unable to assist herself with her hands tied she nearly falls
dillon prods her with his rifle forcing her to her feet
she scrambles up the bank dillon following
as billy enters a small clearing bordered on one side by the towering trees carpeting the mountainside
high above in the thick impenetrable treeline brightly colored birds squawk loudly chasing each other from branch to branch
suddenly billy stops
schaefer holds up his hand and the team freezes in position
an eerie silence like a slowly falling curtain descends over the jungle until even the buzzing and clicking of insects have ceased
sensing an ambush move quietly into the foliage
dillon moves into the undergrowth dragging anna with him
he slings his mp over his shoulder withdrawing his knife
grasping anna by her shirt collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the weapon near her throat
dillon signals to ramirez who approaches
dillon hands ramirez the knife
before ramirez can respond dillon slips into the undergrowth
ramirez holds the knife on anna cautiously scanning around him for movement
unseen by ramirez annas outstretched hands slowly tighten around a stout root burl lying loose on the ground
he remains frozen and transfixed staring into the treeline
something is moving fluid silently and downward into the forest
billy remains rooted to the spot lost in concentration
sensing something very wrong with billy moves alongside mac
whats got billy so spooked
cant say major
been squirrely all mornin
sometimes i think that nose of his is too good
smells things that aint there
schaefer signals for mac to cover him and then moves low and quiet towards billy
dillon appears looking to mac for an explanation
mac ignores him concentrating on the jungle
dillon looks forward at
billy his eyes riveted to the capony above as he unconsciously reaches to his throat grasping a leather pouch secured to his neck by a thong
he fingers the medicine bag talisman
as he slowly descends through the trees moving towards billy whos eyes search the treeline for movement
approaches billy gripping his shoulders and in a hoarse whisper speaks his name
what is it
billy rigid does not respond
schaefer forcefully jerks his around to face him
what the hells wrong with you
in the trees
still closing in on billy
billy turns back looking high into the trees puzzled and frightened
hes lost sense of the hunters presence
he lowers his vision looking towards the hunter now on the ground yards across the clearing from billy
the hunter pauses
whispers can you see anything
schaefer stares hard at the jungle
moves behind a broad fern skirting around billy and schaefer heading away from the column
schaefer shakes his head continuing to stare into the jungle
he turns to billy
what do you think
billy turns a puzzled look in his eyes
he nods in agreement
sensing the danger has passed ramirez releases his grip on anna
as they start to rise ramirez sheaths his knife and unslings his mp
anna still stares hard into the jungle
suddenly without even looking anna with the trained reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the burl with all her might catching ramirez hard on the side of the head just
above the eye opening a wicked gash
spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin
as ramirez goes down doubled over in pain anna turns scrambling up the embankment running for the jungle
ramirez cries out
hearing ramirez cry schaefer signals to hawkins to move
hawkins moves out fast heading towards the sound
sees anna running away
he gives chase
anna although bound is light and fit and runs fast hurdling fallen logs and branches charging through the undergrowth
she has a good start
hawkins hampered by the radio and weapon but in tremendous shape thunders after her closing the distance
as he passes from behind a large tree surrounded by dense foliage seeing the fleeing anna
he watches her and then begins to move parallel with her only faster the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur
anna bursting through a grove of ferns drives on breathing hard with the exertion
hawkins ten yards behind closing the distance taking advantage of any hesitation anna makes struggling with the dense jungle
anna hits a small clearing an alleyway through the trees
she sprints hard across the clear ground
moving through the jungle
as he steps clear of the foliage he sees anna driving hard into the alleyway running directly towards him
twenty yards away hawkins closes in
only a few feet behind anna lunges forward knocking her to the ground
in a second hes on her his weapon ready
she struggles to her feet fighting gasping for breath
hawkins holds the mp on her looking at her almost pleading
he doesnt want to shoot her but he will if he has to
she looks at the weapon to hawkins and then hopefully to the jungle
she stops staring hard down the alleyway
suddenly she sees it
in spanish look out behind you
seeing the mottled outline of the hunters body racing towards them as if the entire wall of the jungle were rushing in
the hunters weapon flares to life
as he hurtles towards them their faces frozen in surprise
a splitting thud as hawkins is hurtled backwards into the undergrowth the hunters hand and weapon flashing through the air
blood splashes on annas face
she screams as hawkins mp fires a short burst into the air
hearing the gunfire schaefer whistles low and sharp
ramirez face bloody swings into action moving in a coordinated defensive offensive pattern into the jungle
the hunters arm and spur hook into hawkins leg and he is dragged into the jungle
ramirez runs forward ten paces drops to a crouch scanning to each side
immediately schaefer runs forward twenty paces
as he passes ramirez ramirez turns and scans the rear and flanks
dillon mac and blain repeat the maneuver leap frogging forward canvassing the jungle providing areas of intersection cover
entering the alleyway where hawkins was killed he sees anna cowering in the bushes her blood splattered face glazed with terror his eyes vacant
he approaches angry wary but the girl is so stunned
he sees the trail of blood and crushed grasses leading into the jungle
he gives a low whistle and then moves on the rest of the team assuming defensive positions around the clearing
he follows the trail finding first hawkins blood covered weapon and then a few yards later the radio
ramirez cautiously parts the brush before him
a look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes of his face
blain and mac at either end cautiously searching the jungle billy covering their flanks
schaefer and dillon approach anna
she seems unaware of their presence staring numbly ahead
schaefer checks her out looking for wounds he wipes some of the blood from her face
its not her blood
ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying hawkins mp and radio
he approaches dumping the equipment on the ground
major youd better take a look at this
oddly i cant tell
dillon in the b
as ramirez parts the brush with his weapon
before them covered with dirt and leaves are hawkins entrails
there is no body
shocked what in gods name
i think its hawkins
where the hell is his body
theres no sign of it
the entire team is gathered still holding defensive positions
anna still stunned is beginning to come around
she looks up at schaefer
he turns to ramirez
ramirez ask her what happened
ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in spanish
she mutters incoherently in spanish still dazed shaking her head
dillon listens closely to her response
ramirez turns to schaefer
he seems confused
the jungle came alive and took him
that isnt what she said
pondering to ramirez she doesnt make sense
growing angry couple of sappers been trailing us all the way from the camp major
billy heard them
she set us up ran for it
they were waiting
i shouldve wasted the bitch when i had the chance
schaefer looking at hawkins bloodstained equipment lying at annas feet looks up
quietly why didnt they take the radio and his weapon
pause why didnt she escape
ramirez and dillon look at the equipment and then to the girl still numb with shock
grimly remembering they did the same thing to davis
the two veteran commandos look at each other finding no explanation between them
urgent to the others i want him found
sweep pattern and double back
they move out
schaefer moves into the jungle searching
he crouches at the base of a huge mahogany tree covered with vines studying the jungle
he moves away from the tree and into the forest looking for signs on the ground
where he was sitting a drop of blood falls
another drop falls dripping from a leaf and above that from another leaf
above that high in the top of the tree suspended from vines from his ankles is hawkins body his chest a gaping wound
he hands there as if he were an animal field dressed
crouched in the undergrowth
there is a movement in the brush before him
he wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the mini gun to fire
the sound is growing closer
blain levels the weapon
a smile crosses his face
whispers come on in you fuckers
come on in
ol painless is waitin
the movement in the brush is growing louder
blains finger moves closer to the trigger
suddenly a small tapir bursts through the leaves startling blain
he relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight
something grazes his shoulder a gout of blood erupting
he starts to turn the mini gun held low ready to fire
from out of the jungle feet away the hunters weapon streaks toward him like a missile
he screams as it enters his back erupting from his chest in an explosion of blood
has heard blains cry
he moves fast through the brush
he hears a rustling in the bushes
a wet sucking sound
mac charges into the clearing
in the instant before the hunter disappears into the forest mac sees a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a hallucination
the hunters eyes flare momentarily from the green before they vanish
mac sees his friend lying on the ground his chest open the powerful man dead
shouting contact right
he opens fire with his m belted shells slamming into the weapon from the magazine at his waist expending it in one long burst
flying through the jungle weapons ready eyes searching for movement
he throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage lunges forward grabbing the mini gun
as he stands the cartridge belt attached to blain strings out between them
he opens fire and the foliage before him explodes with the fury of the terrible weapon
mac sweeps the mini gun from left to right like a man possessed mowing down the jungle
the other team members race into sight and begin firing with mac
ramirez opens fire with the six shooter grenade launcher
explosions rock the jungle
a piece of shrapnel cuts his shoulder
a splash of orange blood spatters across the leaves of a nearby tree bullet holes ripping through the surrounding foliage
mac his weapon expended continues to thrust the mini gun forward still squeezing the trigger
suddenly as quickly as it started the firing stops
the men move catlike into the jungle reloading searching their nerves taut stretched to the limit ready to fire again at any second
mac is frozen eyes wide unblinking his breath coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle still squeezing the trigger of the weapon its breech locked open gunsmoke
wafting from the chamber and barrel
schaefer moves in front of mac still staring into the jungle
dillon pushes anna into the clearing moving towards the body
anna looks at the body and then up to mac
schaefer sees a terrifying moment of recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at mac
he turns to mac
at these words anna reacts in shock drawing a slight breath
schaefer turns sees her staring at mac
he turns back
you saw what
still dazed i saw it
schaefer turns back to see anna staring fixidly at mac watching his lips
schaefer turns quickly to blains body and kneels alongside dillon
is at blains side shocked at the sight of the mutilated body
he is joined by dillon
to himself blain
puzzled just like the others
no powder burns no shrapnel
the wound all fused cauterized
what the hell did this
schaefer stands looking at the body
in the b
anna drifts away from the group
to mac mac
mac stares ahead dumbly not hearing
he grabs mac by his shoulders shaking him violently back to awareness
demanding angry mac
look at me
mac turn to face schaefer a shocked expression on his face
urgent mac who did this
mac is suddenly angry and frustrated he has no explanation
i dont know
goddamn it something
i saw something
ramirez runs from the jungle breathing hard shaking his head
the same thing
not a fucking trace
no bodies blood anything
instinctively the team has now grouped around schaefer their weapons pointing into the jungle ready their nerves on total edge
schaefer looks upward at the darkening sky
quietly were losing the light
mac i want a defensive position above this ridge mined with everything were got
man is again the hardened professional
schaefer looks down at blains body
he turns to ramirez and billy
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back
well bury him in the morning
ill take him
as they leave approaches the brush her attention focused on something clinging to the leaves well off to the side of where mac saw the hunter
she draws closer reaching out hesitant as if drawn magnetically to the leaves
clinging to the leaves thick viscous pale orange almost like the sap of an exotic plant
her fingers hover above it hesitantly and then touch it
examines the blood transfixed
dillon appears at her shoulder startling her
he motions for her to return
she turns wiping the blood onto her pants leg
the team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of trees a solid wall to their backs
the men are barely visible they blend in so well
nearby mac is stringing a trip wire low to the ground covering it with leaves and grass
he moves into camp and reports to schaefer
weve got most of the flares frags
and two claymores just outside
nothins comin close to here without trippin on somethin
thank you sergeant
mac starts to go but schaefer places his hand on his shoulder
im sorry bull
its never easy
he was a good soldier
hardened the best friend i ever had
mac turns and walks through the camp stopping beside a dark object on the ground
he kneels beside the poncho pulling back the zipper revealing blains face looking peaceful in death as if lying in state
mac removes something from his pocket holding it in his hand studying it
the small whiskey flash the chrome rubbed away in places revealing the brass beneath and a medallion depicting the st airborne division
takes a tiny sip from the flask
he replaces the cap and lifts the flap of blains shirt pocket placing the flask inside
he lingers on the face and then closes the zipper
softly good bye bro
is huddles into a foxhole her hands still tied in front of her
she looks down at her pants leg
the hunters bloodstain glows with a faint luminosity
she places her fingers near the stain
hawkins body impacts the floor with a thump
a momentary hush falls over the symphony of night sounds
anna and billy turn towards the trees with a growing look of wariness
the others setting up the radio show no response
the hunters foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse the prehensile spur digging deep pinioning the body to the ground
the hunters hand extends his fingers puncturing the skin at the base of the spine gripping the vertebrae
with otherworldly strength the arm pulls the entire spinal column ripping free from the body a sickly snapping and popping of cartilage separating from bone and tissue
ramirez is tuning in the compact field radio equipped with a crypto phone device
dillon holds the handset
to phone blazer one say again
a crackle of static over the radio
voice over red fox i say again
your request for extraction denied
your area still compromised
proceed to sector for prisoner extraction priority alpha
next contact at hours
to phone angry roger blazer one
he puts down the phone turning to the group huddled together in a tight circle ramirez and billy facing outward in defensive positions anna silent watching
schaefer is look at him
angry shocked were still too far in they wont risk coming in for us
expendable assets dillon
seems langley is never around when you need them
i can accept that it comes with the job
youre just like the rest of us
dillon glares back
schaefer leaves lost in thought
ramirez looks up at the impenetrable canopy
shit load o good a chopperd do us in here anyway
dillon turns to mac
who hit us today
mac is still obviously feeling the anger and bitterness of the mystifying event
dont know only saw one of em
he was there
remembering those fucking eyes
abruptly pushing what sergeant
returning angry those eyes
but i know one thing major
pause i drew down and fired right at it
capped off two hundred rounds and then the mini gun the full pack
nothin on this earth could have lived
not at that range
dillon ponders this for a moment staring hard at mac
mac gets up
ive got the first watch
dillon watches mac as he creeps forward to the sentry position
he turns to ramirez
ask her again
what did she see
what happened to hawkins
ramirez turns to anna
they talk quietly in spanish dillon watching listening carefully
ramirez turns back to dillon
interpreting she says the same thing
it was the jungle
ramirez looks up at billy who continues to stare into the jungle aware catlike reacting to every sound his nerves on edge as if ready to snap
ramirez rises moves alongside his friend dillon watching closely
whispering imploring you know something billy what is it
billy turns his face a mask of primal fear
he moves close to ramirez
ramirez is frightened by this
you aint afraid of no man
billy looks deep into his eyes chilling ramirez to the bone looking at his with eyes which have seen on an instinctual level what the others have so far only
begun to sense
theres something out there waiting for us
it aint no man
billy turns away moving a short distance away taking up his position
dillon looks after him and then into the blackness of the jungle canopy
dillon speaks to ramirez
hes losing his cool
theres nothing out there but a couple of men that were going to have to take down
despite his words there is an edge of doubt in his voice
hes overheard this exchange
hes holding the group of dog tags taken from davis men
he holds them up for dillon to see
you still dont get it do you dillon
he took davis
and now he wants us
close on an oval chamber made of an otherworldly looking metal with a strange copperlike patina its interior bathed in intense blue light
in the chamber is hawkins skull cap and spinal column still attached
the light field suddenly changes as all connective tissue flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony structures with incredible force disintegrating as they rush toward the sides of
the light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the hunters hands remove the glazed polished trophy from the chamber
he turns carefully placing it upon a glowing surface
he touches the trophy gently feeling its texture as a man might touch the hide of a big cat
he pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque force field covers the trophies
hunched down in a foxhole the mini gun on a tripod before him
its nearly a full moon the jungle a montage of shadows and reflections
mac stares into the night his eyes always moving
distant whispering its the same kinda jungle bro same moon
pause a real number ten night
only you and me the only ones out of the whole fuckin platoon who made it out
his eyes probe the darkness remembering
we walked out on top of em
not a scratch not a fuckin scratch
spits into the night no fuckin chili choker got to you bro
you were just too good
he ponders this a moment
i promise you this bro
whoever he is i hope hes plannin to hit us again
pauses spits cause hes got my name on em
a force field that permeates the jungle becoming one with the trees and foliage
the hunter walks down a corridor of solid light leading to an opening to the jungle
as the hunter reaches the doorway he changes from visible to invisible moving on into the night
the mist has thickened the night alive with a million jungle sounds
the team members sleep uneasily if at all
mac although weary stares hard into the night waiting each small sound a potential enemy
a lull spreads over the jungle animals and insects quieting
mac tightens his grip on the mini gun
billy awakens peering into the night
suddenly a metallic click a pop the sound of a warning flare rocketing into the canopy
a moment later a brilliant flash as the flare burns illuminating the camp
an echoing eerie scream fills the night as a dark shape in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards mac
mac spins hauling the heavy gun around just as something crashes into his upper body driving the huge man into the foxhole
a desperate battle for life ensues illuminated with the strobing light of the descending flare
macs enraged shouts and roars mingled with horrific screams fill the night
macs razor edged knife slashes in the light blood spatters his face as he attacks fiercely
schaefer and ramirez rush at a crouching run towards the foxhole their weapons ready
a tremendous climatic scream from the foxhole and then silence
schaefer and ramirez approach cautiously
mac stands his face and clothes drenched in blood some of it his his breath coming in rapid gasps
he looks at schaefer whispering hoarsely
got the motherfucker
as the flare breaks through the canopy dying out in great flickering bursts the man stare down into the foxhole
a huge jungle boar lies mutilated in a pool of blood still quivering in the final throes of death
the flare dies out
mac shaking from adrenalin breathing heavily looks down at the dying animal
incredulous a pig
just a fucking pig
schaefer shines his tekna light onto the boar playing the light along its massive hulk its razor edges tusks gleaming in the light
ramirez appears by his side looking down at the huge carcass
holy shit mac
nearby unnoticed by the men anna stoops her hands still bound picking up an mp from the ground
she turns looking for an avenue of escape running for the jungle
but the forest looks foreboding and sinister
she stops staring at the jungle the moonlight reflected off leaves like a thousand eyes
for a brief second she imagines she can see the hunters eyes crashing towards her the shifting patterns of light and dark making the jungle seem to strobe like it
is about to rush in at her
she freezes paralyzed by fear by her memories of the attack
she drops the mp to the ground
back at the foxhole schaefer and ramirez help the still shaken mac from the hole
schaefer looks at mac at the huge gash across his chest
get a field dressing on that right away
suddenly he remembers anna
wheres the girl
they all turn ready to move and then stop
coming forth from the shadows anna appears still frightened seeking the security of the soldiers
from the darkness nearby billys voice in a hoarse o
urgently major over here
schaefer turns apprehensive something in billys voice
he walks over to billy standing with a flashlight pointing to the ground
they see blains body bag slashed open covered in blood
came in through the trip wires took it right out from under our noses
anna appears between schaefer and ramirez staring down at the empty blood soaked body bag
she looks up into schaefers eyes
a patchy ground fog covers the area
anna in her foxhole awakens listening to the rising sounds of the jungle
monkeys begin to forage their noisy chattering and screeching filling the air
a bird flutters back to its nest a chameleon emerges onto a leaf directly above annas head
anna carefully extends her arm allowing the lizard to crawl onto her watching fascinated as it changes colors
she carefully places the chameleon back on the leaf which changes color again becoming nearly invisible
near the empty poncho schaefer billy and ramirez are examining the ground and the trip wire to the flare
billy stands turns to schaefer
boar set off the trip flare major
no other tracks
schaefer kneels and examines the thin well hidden wire
he stands looking around the camp
how could anyone get through this carry blain out right under our noses without leavin a trace
he knows our defenses
why didnt he try to kill one of us last night
schaefer looks at him
he came back for the body
pause hes killing us one at a time
schaefer turns and looks at billy asking with his eyes for a viable explanation
like a hunter
schaefer stares at him the words sinking in
he looks up reconstructing in his mind the possible events of last night his eyes following the tree line tracing the path of the intruder as he might have travelled
through the trees and down to the ground
he looks up at billy
he uses the trees
billy and ramirez stare up at the trees a wave of fear passing through them
from the trees
schaefer turns moving to where dillon is guarding anna sitting on the ground
reaching down schaefer pulls her firmly to her feet looking at her intensely
what did you see
she stares back at him
youre wastin your time
no more games
she looks at him a long moment and then answers in english
i dont know what it was
dillon does a double take
schaefer continues to look at anna
he wasnt surprised he knew it yesterday
it changes colors like the chameleon
it uses the jungle
derisively shit you trying to tell me blain and hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard
dont listen to her
itss a psych job
two maybe three of them thats all
we keep our cool out think them til were across the border
ignoring him schaefer takes her hands drawing his commando knife looking squarely into her eyes
whats you name
she looks back into his eyes
hes hunting us
you know that
with a sudden movement he slices through her bonds
what the hell do you think youre doing
were going to need everyone
what are you talking about
well be out of here in ten minutes
were not going
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles at most
were almost home
but the chopper wont wait
schaefer turns to face him
this thing doesnt care who we are who she is
we make a stand or there wont be anyone left to make that chopper
dillon stares back not wanting to hear what he already knows to be true
anna touches schaefers arm
there is something else
when the big man was killed you must have wounded it
pause its blood was on the leaves
she touches her pant leg the stain is faded but still there
schaefer turns to dillon
if it bleeds we can kill it
anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with binoculars watching the tree line
mac moves past her uncoiling a trip wire linking up four claymore mines hidden at various points with leaves and foliage
in a tree at the edge of the clearing billy tosses an uncoiling roll of wire to ramirez who attaches it to a grenade wedged it the crouch of a
wires attached to grenades and claymore mines lead off through the underbrush and trees leaving a long unmined corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle
at the corridors end where the rocks merge with the jungle schaefer hauls down on a heavy vine straining with every ounce of strength his muscles bulging while dillon takes
up the slack of the vine around the base of a tree
the vine is attached to a forty foot sapling arcing closer to the ground in a gigantic bow with every pull creaking and groaning with tension
with a last mighty heave schaefer draws the tree almost within reach gesturing to dillon to tie it off who does
straining im tellin you this little boy scout stunt is a godamned waste of time
stands weve got to get the hell out of here now while weve still got the chance
ignoring him schaefer rapidly drags into position a net crudely woven of differing sizes of vines their leaves still attached
he carefully begins to cover the net with leaves and debris
dillon watches him in growing frustration as schaefer moves quickly picking up a framework of sticks he has tied together a treadle spring trigger
he holds up the framework hurriedly examining his work before placing it on the ground
hell be looking for the trip wires
if were lucky he wont see this
now what dutch
you going to send your mystery guest an invitation
schaefer turns there is a touch of fear in dillons eyes
youre catching on dillon
schaefer returns to his work on the net and trigger
fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle
insects swarm and are fed upon by birds and other predators
at the entranceway to the rock outcropping the net and trigger are hidden beneath the leaves the framework of the trigger bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to
the bent tree
at the other end of the corridor several meters above the jungle floor schaefer and his team heavily camouflaged nearly invisible lie hidden waiting
the team members as if hypnotized by the buzzing din stare into the jungle fixated alert
anna while waiting at the net hushed when i was little we find a man she struggles for the words like a butcher
the old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy things
demonio cazador de trofoes
only the hottest times of the hottest years
this year is grows hot
and we begin finding our men
we find them sometimes without their skin
much much worse
cazador de trofoes
means the demon who takes trophies
slow rack to schaefers face
suddenly an eerie silence moves over the jungle he whips his face forward
the silence is shattered by a bird flapping from the brush
schaefer sits back and scratches his head frustrated and a little chagrined
whatll you try next cheese
schaefer glares at him
turns to go he stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the waiting snare
behind him sighting down their well hidden gun barrels the others scan the jungle alert for the slightest sound or movement covering him
schaefer reaches the trap carefully skirting the trigger hidden beneath the leaves
he reaches the end of the corridor moving out into the jungle
he moves further away from the others the silence crushing down on him
he stops and waits sweat pouring down his face his finger tightening on the trigger of his m eyes scanning the jungle
he turns his back on the jungle waiting
he moves back towards the corridor reaching the net again waiting listening sensing
he turns around looking at the jungle one last time his face measuring defeat and then with carefully measured strides he walks back to the camp
schaefer looks at billy who shakes his head in puzzlement
nearby dillon starts to rise
low whispered satisfied
now lets get the hell out
suddenly behind schaefer at the end of the corridor with a resounding swish and snap the net explodes off the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and
sticks rocketing upward into the treetops
schaefer spins the others leaping to their feet as they see the net as it tears into the treetops a large struggling bulge trapped within as a long unearthly trilling
scream echoes through the jungle
schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards the jungle and the bobbing net their weapons ready
anna remains behind watching terrified from the rocks
they arrive under the net raising their weapons to fire
but before they can fire the entire net explodes into a flurry of leaves twigs vines dirt and a flash of pulsating crimson
as the hunter leaps from the net his weapon activates his arm slashing out severing a thick limb of the spreading tree capony entangled in vines
the limb crashes down from the trees schaefer dillon billy and mac diving for safety
but ramirez following the hunters leap sees too late the pendular movement of the severed limb and is struck a thudding blow in the ribs which lifts him off his
feet hurling him backwards like a rag doll his shirt torn open exposing a bloody wound
as anna runs to ramirezs side the others still stunned look upward frozen in shock seeing the hunter clinging to a side of a tree flushed bright crimson
dillis is dumbfounded like the others rooted to the ground staring upward
what is gods name
the hunter utters an unearthly snarl and hiss from his open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight
a rapid furtive movement through the trees
mac opens fire with the m the others joining in shredding the foliage but they know the creature is gone
with a shout mac races into the jungle in pursuit of the hunter
schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the m slamming in a new one
he shouts an order to billy
to billy get ramirez on his feet
take the girl and get the hell out of here
he turns to run after mac
dillon steps in front of him putting his hand on schaefers chest
no way dutch
you get these people and get the hell out of here
this isnt your style dillon
guess ive picked up some bad habits from you dutch
now dont argue with me you know im right
get to that chopper and hold it for us
well be along
you know you cant win this one
dillon stares at him
you know me dutch i never did know when to quit
dillon turns and begins to move out
picking up the spare mp schaefer tosses the weapon to dillon who grabs it with one hand
they share a look knowing this is farewell
ill see you there
right behind you
hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after mac
schaefer watches him leave
he breaks and goes to ramirez attended by anna and billy who is now sitting up holding his ribs and gasping for breath
hes busted up bad major
gasping i can make it major
schaefer lifts him to his feet supporting him
come on poncho were getting out of here
to billy billy take the radio leave the rest
creeping low to the ground his eyes searching through the trees
whispered come on you motherfucker
moving through the underbrush hears a slight rustling in the foliage
he strains to locate the source of the movement
he hears a sound too faint at first it identify
he hears is again the sound of a voice barely audible
a very quiet whisper
dillon over here
dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it
barely audible dillon over here
dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth
he carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters a tiny opening
he looks around seeing nothing
suddenly a hand appears and covers dillons mouth
dillon gasps as mac pulls him down to where he is hiding
whispering close out there
past the rocks
can you see it
something seems to move in the direction mac is pointing
whispering i see it
pause were gonna take this thing
dillon points to an outcropping of rocks covered with take a position over there
ill work around towards you
when i flush him you nail him
a mean look right i got a score to settle for the bro
we both got scores to settle
dillon silently disappears into the jungle mac watching him go
mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping working his way between the rocks and the vines
he takes up a position and scans the jungle before him
moving quietly his face intense determined
he stops and listens
straining to hear vague sounds coming from the jungle
he reaches out and grabs a vine and carefully pulls himself forward into a better position
he goes into a crouch
there is movement in the undergrowth
he begins to sweat
he moves the safety to fire reaches out and grabs another vine to pull himself forward
mac reacts in shock
the vine is alive
before he can move the hunters hand appears from the vines grabbing mac by the wrist
in the moment before he is killed mac turns and sees the hunters glowing eyes
a flash as the hunters other hand moves with blinding speed macs face contorting in pain as the hunters razor sharp spur rips deep into his throat
he falls forward into the leaves
he hears the faint disturbance in the leaves
he pauses turning in macs direction listening
hearing no further sound he relaxes moving on
anna in the lead followed by schaefer carrying ramirez on his back
billy carrying the radio is covering them from above as they skitter and slide down the loose gravel of a rocky slope leading to a river crossing
he stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines and moss leading to the rock outcropping on the other side his face alert showing no signs of fear his weapon
through the thick tangle of undergrowth there is movement a slight undulating distortion drifting through the hanging vegetation as if cast by a passing shadow
as he stops and crouches slightly listing behind him
did he hear something
he moves on
behind dillon and to the side of the corridor
the hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those of dillon
the hunter freezes in position
he does sense something behind him
he crouches and spins leveling the weapon
the corridor behind him is empty quiet and undisturbed
he studies the trail intently
peering out through the vines
dillon is looking directly at him
dillon turns moves on as the hunter resumes his stalk timing his movements perfectly with those of dillon
as he approaches the rock outcropping
receiving no response he moves closer turning cautiously to right and left
he moves closer to the rocks eyes probing
through a gap in the rocks he sees macs face staring up at him eyes frozen wide in death
dillon spins hard
he stares at the solid wall of undergrowth
he looks from one side of the corridor to the other
something it out there
something in the vines has caught his attention
he stares hard at a section of moss
suddenly the right combination of light and shadow prevail and dillon sees in an instant the hunters eyes materialize and then disappear
with a growl and exhalation of breath charges bringing the weapon to bear
a short burst of gunfire erupts from the barrel
in an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his weapon
screams his arm instantly severed halfway between his shoulder and elbow
the weapon drops to the ground the forearm still attached still firing
with his left hand he fires the second weapon shouting insanely as swings it towards the blurred image of his unseen attacker hitting nothing
the hunter reloads his weapon which turns invisible again
dillon continues to fire
the hunters weapon appears from below cutting into dillons unprotected abdomen which as if hit by a samurai sword bursts open
dillon cries out as the huge man hits the ground
spanning the narrow gorge schaefer and anna with ramirez between them move onto the log preparing to cross
they stop hearing dillons gunfire
moving through the jungle with incredible speed leaping tearing from tree to tree the jungle a rush of heat trails as he charges on
the jungle is still deathly silent
schaefer anna and ramirez cross the log moving onto the other side
billy still at the foot of the log providing cover turns to face the jungle
he lifts his head towards the trees feeling the onrushing presence of the hunter
he shrugs off the radio letting it fall smashing into the rocks below
he casts away his weapon
staring forward he reaches into his cargo pocket withdrawing a small grease paint tin
covering his finger in black paint he applies dark slashes under his eyes and again vertically down his cheeks
taking another dap of paint he makes a symbol on his bare skin over his heart
he drops the tin withdrawing his combat knife
holding the knife he grasps the medicine bag around his neck yanking it free with a quick snap
he wraps the leather thong around his hand and knife binding the weapon and bag together
staring outward as if in a trance he begins a low on the other side schaefer carrying ramirez on his back laboring up the steep slope nearing the top turns
and sees billy standing waiting at the foot of the bridge
but billy stands at the foot of the bridge knife raised waiting accepting his oncoming destiny
in frustration schaefer hikes ramirez higher onto his back digs in and sprints to the top of the hill anna waiting at the top
crouches low knife extended in a fighting position
over the top in a low depression schaefer props ramirez against some rocks reaching for his weapon
they hear billys echoing scream
instantly their weapons are raised cocked and ready
get back into the rocks
schaefer sweeps anna behind him as ramirez struggles to his feet
together they back up covering the ridgeline over which theyve just come
suddenly from one side near ramirez the hunter bursts from the jungle ramirez seeing the hunter spins raising his weapons to fire
ramirez sees the hunters onrushing face still in camouflage a montage of organic textures and colors his yellow eyes burning
whipping the mp is the direction of the hunter he is hurled backwards from the impact of the hunters weapon his neck gushing blood the mp flying through the air
landing in front of anna
she moves for the weapon
the hunter with unearthly speed turns towards anna as schaefer starts to spin seeing the hunter about to strike as anna dives for the weapon
schaefer lunges kicking the mp out of annas reach
to anna run
get to the chopper
schaefer spins and fires bullets thudding into the ground the barrel arcing towards the hunter as anna stumbles to her feet running into the jungle
in a blur the hunter spins back hurling his weapon at schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the rifle sparks flying as it severs the trigger guard and
the m flies out of schaefers hands as the hunters weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder laying open the flesh
the m hits the ground where it lies broken in half useless
schaefer hits the ground and is rolling up and running for his life the hunter charging after him
crashes headlong through the jungle
he leaps a fallen log stumbles struggles to his feet running on pure adrenalin his shoulder pulsing blood his eyes filled with terror
behind him he can hear the hunter in pursuit closing
schaefer spins to look behind him a wild desperate look on his face he turns back ducks an overhanging limb and lunges on
another few yard
runs like a madman the sound of the hunters footsteps close behind
hes losing ground
he knows hes going to die
suddenly the ground before him collapses and he disappears from sight
in a shower of leaves flailing arms and legs schaefer crashes through the trees at the canyons edge free falling into space
with a sickening impact he hits the branches of the first trees lining the canyon and falls a hundred feet through one canopy after another desperately grabbing for limbs and
branched to break his fall
he hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees impacting crosschest on a large branch knocking his wind out
semi conscious he hangs momentarily before he slides off fingers digging into the bark falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving river
weighted down by his boots and clothing schaefer struggles to stay afloat
gasping for air he ducks underwater untying one of his boots
he surfaces fills his lungs and dives again releasing the other boot
he surfaces strips off his shirt and pants and begins to swim towards shore stroking with one arm
as he nears the edge of the precipice from which schaefer has fallen
the hunter in close pursuit does not hesitate but launches himself off the cliff in a spectacular leap streaking downward towards the tops of the trees that grow out from
the canyon wall
the hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree the branches and leaves rushing past in a kaleidoscopic the hunter bounds off of one branch after another moving through
the trees as an expert skier might negotiate a series of downhill gates
the hunter leaps free of one tree bounds across twenty feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree affording a good view of the river below
from his vantage point looking down at the windening slowing expanse of river schaefer is nowhere to be seen
he is swept into a still faster current and is carried helplessly downstream
boiling whitewater appears
out of control he is swept through a series of rapids pulling his further and further downstream until he is finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the top
of a six foot falls driven deep underwater by the pounding force of the water
there is no sign of schaefer
precious seconds pass
slowly looking like a drowned rat he surfaces taking a feeble breath
he is nearly finished his energy sapped
but the water is calm and a few strokes are enough to carry him near the shore
his feet hit bottom
he tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick mud slurry at the river bank
with his last ounce of strength he crawls panting and gasping into a sheltered mud overhang collapsing beside the exposed root system of a dead tree his body completely covered
in thick gray mud
nearly unconscious he raises his head and looks to the opposite side of the river scanning the bank
there is no sign of the hunter
he collapses in relief
suddenly the hunter impacts the water throwing up a huge splash
he stands up in the waist deep water
as the water streams off of his body the chameleon effect rapidly changes struggling to match the shifting color patterns of the shimmering water
his glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where schaefer lies helplessly trapped
the hunter surges forward relentlessly closing in on this prey
is frozen in terror paralyzed with fear his eyes locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to kill him
closing rapidly another ten feet
he leaves the water and walks through the mud stopping towering over schaefer
as the hunters feet surge though the mud and stop three feet away
realizing his life is about to end closes his eyes awaiting the hunters killing blow
the fierce yellow orbs look downward
hes looking directly at schaefer except he cant he can clearly see the exposed root system but because of the heavy mud blocking schaefers body heat schaefer registers in the
hunters vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay unrecognizable to the hunter as a human being
he scans the bank searching looking for heat sources
detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning trill several times
disbelieving that hes still alive opens one eye seeing the hunters feet move away his prehensile spurs dragging in the mud
he rounds a bend and disappears heading for the undergrowth
astonished he tries to raise up on his hands but a sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to collapse falling onto his side unconscious in the mud
as a huey attack helicopter breaks over the top of the ridge diving forward moving down the canyon
the chopper flares up into a holding pattern
in the open doorway a soldier searches the top of the canyon with binoculars
seeing no sign of life the chopper flies on disappearing down the canyon rim
lies unconscious in the mud the distant sound of the helicopter thrumping into the distance
she runs into a clearing stopping momentarily gasping for breath
she is startled by a sudden movement behind her
she spins looking
there is nothing there
she runs on
schaefer gasps as his eyes bolt open in fear
as if the hunter were still attacking schaefer rolls to his feet and runs slogging through the thick mud stumbling lunging forward gasping for breath
schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow pool scuttling crablike into the chest deep water
schaefer backs into the moss covered wall by the waterfall looking for movement regaining his senses
as the water settles he looks down seeing the image of himself reflected in the pool his hair and face covered in thick clay
he stares mesmerized at the image
he lifts his arm from the water his fingers wiping the mud from his face exposing a patch of skin
he studies the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of himself in the water seeing the exposed skin
he stares at it a wave of realization rushing through his mind
he places the mud back on his face again looking at his image
you couldnt see me
he looks up out into the failing light at the treeline of the deepening forest realizing that fate has given him a fighting chance
slowly a look of vengeance and hatred crosses over his face
using his machete he carves magnesium shavings from a fire block into a pile of kindling
he removes a match from the hollow handle of the machete also containing a coil of piano wire green tape and medical supplies
he lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white light
schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf until the flame dies down
he feeds the fire with more kindling fanning it with a leaf
holding a three foot section of fire hardened sapling between his feet and shoulder he scrapes the char from the seasoned wood with his machete
he bends the bow and attaches a long piece of piano wire to one end carefully wrapping it for strength using strips of green tape to cover the sides of
the wire where the nock of the arrow will fit
he attaches split quilled feathers with fishing line to an arrow its tip fashioned into a series of barbs rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth stone
when finished he places the arrow on the ground next to three other identical arrows
one chance thats all
schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones
he pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass
he scrapes the milky substance onto a banana leaf mixing it with a sticky sap holding it over the coals until the mixture steams
schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and smokes
he spins the arrows in his hands blowing on the tips to cool and harden the mixture
using the tip of his machete he pries open the casing of one of the mm grenades discarding the warhead
he dumps the propellant powder from the shell onto a leaf mixing that with a mound of magnesium shavings
he opens the narrow tight roll of gauze taken from the first aid kit of the machete handle fluffing it into a large loose bundle the size of a baseball
he pours the powder mixture into the gauze mixing it into the fabric
he transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a pliable dry leaf closing it into a bundle binding it at the top with a long strand of jungle grass
he twists the remaining gauze around a match leaving the head exposed forming a self striking fuse
he coats the fuse with sap and then thickly covers it with more powder from the mm grenade
he pokes the fuse down into the leaf
taking a long strand of jungle grass he makes a large loop tying it onto the grenade slipping the loop and grenade over his head
finally using several sections of bamboo of differing diameters he fashions a crude anti personnel spear bomb a bang stick like weapon using the sharpened tongue from his belt buckle
for a firing pin and a mm grenade from his belt pouch as an explosive charge
schaefer appears he has covered him entire body with a variety of clays and ochers creating a mottled earthen camouflage pattern
holding his weapons in one hand he moves up the canyon ascending into a rising boulder field
where the river flows into a series of falls and pools surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks their crevices jammed with large amounts of driftwood swept down at
high water from the forests above
on a flattened section of rock schaefer drags a large section of branches into view adding it to a growing mound of firewood
he kneels tending to a pile of dries grass leaves and other tinder
using the last of his precious matches he sets fire to the tinder gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming fire flames starting to lick upward through the
he stands staring into the rapidly growing blaze
he turns facing the canyon rim raising his weapons in one hand
from the depths of his soul a sound emerges primitive and visceral as if from an animal in pain
he throws back his head and shouts
a hundred feet below schaefer stands in the boulder field his mud coated body bathed in red firelight looking like a fierce primitive warrior a timeless prehistoric sight his long
and wailing cry echoing endlessly through the canyon
backlit by the light of the open door the hunters head in three quarter profile his eyes gleaming rears into view looking up at the sky hearing schaefers cry
responding with a low hiss he turns back raising in one hand his weapon in the other a u shaped sharpening device
as he passes the weapon through the device it flashes into life a deep harmonic hum emitted as the blade grows with energy growing hotter hotter and hotter with each
he draws the blade now white hot through the device for the last stroke
he lifts it testing its balance the white hot blade illuminating his alien face
emerging from his camp the hunter swings into the nearby tree line moving to the uppermost branches
the hunter travels silently from tree to tree arriving at the canyon rim where far below he sees in the canyon the bonfire a leaping shifting multi colored collage of
heat waves and flares luring him onward
hidden back within the deep notch of several large logs and broken trees in the river canyon
below him on the rock plateau is the bonfire illuminating in shifting patterns of light the awaiting arena of destiny
his eyes shift trancelike moving from side to side watching the approaches to the fire below
his senses are alert his nerves on a wire edge
his shadow form descending through the canyon a rippling movement of grays and blacks passing through the shifting light patterns on the rocks cast by the growing bonfire below
his eyes probe the canyon drawn to the swirling patterns of heat given off by the gaseous combustion of the bonfire
continues on moving silently down through the canyon
sits motionless nearly invisible in his mud camouflage amid the darkness of the logs
suddenly over the crackling of the fire the buzzing clicking of insects and the croaking of frogs suddenly slowly painfully he draws the bow to full arch his wounded shoulder
trembling the blood beginning to seep through the bandage
the bow straining at full draw schaefer stares intently concentrating searching for the hunters form in the dancing light below
like a giant insect drops from above fifteen feet above schaefer his steel like spurs digging deep into the log
he freezes at the sound of the hunter dropping his eyes wide with fear
the slightest movement will bring an instant attack from the hunter behind him
but to wait his back exposed
jumps from the log above and to schaefers left onto a boulder gaining a better vantage point of the arena and fire below
he raises his weapon his eyes glistening in the dim light searching
a quiet hiss emerges from his mouth
spins and fires at the movement of the hunter
flies into the night lodging into a branch of an exposed tree just missing the hunters head
in a blur the hunters arm streaks downward a dull flash of light leaving his fingers as he fires the weapon the projectile streaking downward exploding into the log inches
from schaefer sending a shower of wood chips and bark flying in every direction
in a flash is up and running clutching his weapons leaping from boulder to boulder
he jumps down into the lighted area below landing hard rolling into the protective shadows of the rocks putting the loping fire between he and the hunters position on the
he moves forward darting to look backwards before leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder field below a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped water erroded
rocks forming a giant stone ampitheater
shadows leap and dance across the boulders cast by the bonfire from the plateau above
schaefer crouches between two large boulders quietly breathing through clenched teeth feeling the pain of his now freely bleeding shoulder wound
a nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the rim of the plateau above
over the sounds of the fire and the softly flowing river distinguishes a new sound one that brings fear and a savage determination to his heart the rhythmical click scrape
click scrape of the hunters feet moving over the rocks somewhere above him
drawing back on the bow schaefer moves around the boulder to his left heading towards the sound of the hunter
revealed in flashes of strobing light pauses at the juncture of several towering rocks
he stands erect tilting his head slowly turning it from side to side his ears trying to orientate to the diversity of sounds reflecting off the circular walls enclosing the
his vision accustomed to another spectrum has little available heat to register vivid images of the inert lifeless forms of the stones
he sees instead a world of soft ill defined shapes in a pale magenta field of flickering heat
creeping forward carefully placing one foot in front of the other suddenly stops hearing the click scrape click scrape now on his right
starting to move in this new direction he stops again hearing the sound now directly across from him
listening he hears the sound again from yet another direction the sound echoing in the natural ampitheater of rock
schaefer uncertain of where to turn waits
suddenly he crouches and freezes hearing the unbelievable sound of a human voice softly echoing through the ampitheater
filtered in spanish look out behind you
schaefer spins his breath catching at the sound of annas voice
wide eyed straining he waits hearing only the muted flowing of water the hissing and popping of the dying fire above the shadows growing longer darker with each minute
and then again annas voice
in spanish look out behind you
to himself anna
tracelike he moves towards the sound
his head canted throat distended utters another mimicry
moving towards the space between two boulders from which the voice seems to emanate
his ears now directed towards the sound of schaefers voice his slowly approaching footsteps raises his weapon
pauses before the opening of the passageway
all is silent
he hesitates to enter
he starts to move and then hears a new voice o
macs voice dillon over here
schaefer horrified at the sound of the dead mans voice backs quickly into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the ampitheater
his feet moving quietly over the rock the shadow light deepening with the dying fire above closing in
bow drawn trapped against the rock hearing the sound of the hunter approaching from the left now the right is helpless not knowing where to fire the hunters deadly strike
only an instant away
still holding the bang stick in his bow hand he carefully releases the draw on the string reaching to his neck for the flash grenade
with painstaking care he removes the grenade from his neck
focusing on the rocks before him and the still approaching sound he reaches down with the grenade gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse placing it against the rocks at
with a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws the grenade snatching up the bang stick with his good hand
the matchhead sputters as the grenade flies through the air an instant later a blinding white flash of light illuminates the ampitheater
in that instant schaefer sees above him and to his left the hunter poised on top of a rock his weapon raised about to strike
momentarily blinded by the flash of light the hunters head recoils to the side
darkness swallows the image of the hunter but in that second schaefer seizes his advantage hurling the bang stick spear
it smashes into the boulder at the hunters feet
the hunter leaps as the grenade detonates shrapnel tearing into his body
with a terrifying scream of pain and anger the hunter clutches frantically at the wounds in his neck and chest
another bloodcurdling scream of rage and the hunter is gone
cascades over the rocks fed by a small stream running through the ravine
a pile of boulders breaks the falls filling the area with an everconstant mist
schaefer appears holding the bow and arrow following the luminous blood trail of the hunter over the rock
moving behind the falls schaefers body is briefly soaked by the water the hardened and camouflage beginning to dissolve running off his body
he continues on slowly cautiously following the blood trail
next to the flowing stream surrounded by an open area of rock
schaefer smeared with blood and sweat his clay and ochre camouflage partially washed away climbs up a log onto the boulder
oblivious to the searing pain in his shoulder he breathes in hot powerful exchanges his eyes wide and glowing with vengeance
bleed you bastard
his bow down schaefer follows the blood trail across the rock edging alongside a huge vertical boulder
the blood trail stops
he takes another step forward past a darkened alcove
schaefer spins seeing in the alcove the surprised hunter whirl and spring towards him
schaefer in a bound closes the distance savagely kicking the hunters arm
the weapon flies from the hunters hand clattering to the rock
before he can recover schaefer follows with a karate kick to the chest hurling the hunter to the ground his back exposed
in a flash schaefer is standing over the hunter the bow drawn poised the blood from his open wound dripping onto the hunters back
the hunter slowly rolls onto his back revealing his face his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of blood
the hunters body rippled out of control trying desperately to orientate itself to the environment
incredulous who the hell are you
schaefers body looms over him mottled and streaked from his exposed skin blood oozing from the shoulder wound his eyes like black sockets in his almost skull like face
seen from this perspective schaefer is a frightening horrible visage
shudders gasping hungrily for air strugging to speak
from his throat schaefer hears the feeble distorted efforts of the hunter at first garbled incomprehensible and then slowly chillingly taking on the timbre and quality of his own voice
electronic filtered who
improving the hell
nearly perfect are
the hunters strength seems to fade even more
then suddenly with the last of his diminishing strength he lashes out with one arm activating the lethal razor sharp spurs on his wrists
the hunters coiled leg kicks upward with incredible force his terrible spur ripping into schaefers thigh hurling schaefer into the air flipping him over sending him crashing to his back
into the shallow pool of water momentarily losing his bow
he flounders desperately in the water searching for the bow
he finds it just as
the hunter rises slowly to his feet gasping desperately for breath
he inhales deeply hungrily gaining strength with each breath
schaefer looks from the pool to see the hunter raising his weapon to throw
in one totally instinctual movement schaefer draws back on the arrow to its very tip and fires
the arrow with a deadly thud penetrates deeply into the hunters neck
another bloodcurdling scream of rage as the hunter clutches his throat dropping his weapon
an instant later and the hunter is gone
emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the canyon schaefer holding the hunters weapon pauses several times finding more traces of the hunters blood the deep wound
in his thigh flowing heavily
he continues across the log and climbs the bank following the traces into the jungle
moving along the rim of the coulee schaefer follows the thick orange blobs hanging on leaves and spent on the forest floor
too weak to move through the trees the hunter has left a swath of trampled grasses broken twigs and branches in his headlong retreat from schaefer the hunter turned hunted
powering upward from the canyon the waterfall in the b
clear the rim racing along at treetop height heading towards the island promontory
staggering into the clearing bleeding severely
the hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability his skin turning a pale green flexing and pulsing in shock
the glow of light from the energy field reflecting off the spreading apron of blood flowing from his wound
with trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks it pulling the shaft from his neck
he screams in pain
schaefer follows the blood trail deeper into the incredibly dense vegetation ripping aside the heavy growth plunging onward
before him covering a narrow passageway is a huge spider web intricate four feet across
schaefer starts to sweep aside the web
with a sharp intake of breath he halts inches from the wed
something is wrong
examining the web closer he sees not silken threads but a hard and shiny network of hair fine wire a trap
he backs up picking up a hefty branch from the ground
he swings the branch with a mighty heave clenching his teeth in pain
the branch sails end over end into the web impacting the strands
a metallic snap is heard a high pitches whine and the log is violently severed the pieces flying in opposite directions with great speed
schaefer runs on again picking up the blood traces of the fleeing hunter
at the edge of the site
he sees the hunter staggering through the foliage
schaefer starts after him but then stops dumbfounded by the incredible images that crash in on him translucent human skins stretched over frames the hair of the attached scalps moving
lightly in the wind skinned bodies some lying on the ground others hung from the trees like hopper and his men were
he turns back seeing the hunter as he passes through the shimmering distortion of a forcefield enveloping the forest
within the force field he sees the vague nearly transparent outline of the hunters ship
he approaches it wide eyed his senses reeling with astonishment and rage
from within the force field a passage way of blue light appears the hunters form backlit as he ascends the ramp to his spacecraft
as he passes his hand through a light beam the ship instantly responds as a low turbinelike howl is heard building slowly in volume and pitch
in his weakened condition staggers forward looking up seeing the passage way of light diminish as the door begins to close
as rising heat waves begin to envelope the ship the hunter stares out at schaefer the heat waves increasing as the keening whine of the ships drive builds
he enters the force field the door now inches from closing
on the ground nearly obscured by the grass and leaves schaefer sees the hunters weapon lying where he dropped it in his desperate flight to escape
schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it
how the hell does it work
he squeezes the handle of the weapon feeling it resist
with the last ounce of his strength and with a bellow of rage his arm muscles bulging he crushes down on the handle
in a flash of blue white light the weapon becomes schaefer raises the weapon sensing its power and function
in the final seconds before the door closes schaefer with a triumphant scream fires the weapon
the weapon flaring with deadly energy drops and turns sideways accelerating through the door and into the spacecraft
the weapon impacts the hunter his head exploding in a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue
the weapon continues on burying itself into the energy field bolts of plasma energy begin arcing from the force field
schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees staring at the hunters ship
the sound of the hyper drive continues to increase as the ship begins to tremble
as suddenly the instrument panel goes wild gauges spinning digital readouts racing out of control
the sound of the turbine faltering changing pitch
the pilot lurches forward with the stick fighting for control
the multi harmonic whine of the hunters ship is still building as the ground begins to shake
schaefer realizing that the ship is going to explode and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg runs desperately searching for cover
he sprints for the edge of the clearing diving over the embankment just as a blinding purple flash blows the ship to pieces
enveloped in the flash of intense light
cries of surprise fill the ship as the shock wave hits the chopper heeling it hard over to one side
below the concentric waves of energy race outward from the center of the blast an unearthly sight like the miniature birth of a star
the helicopter suddenly regains control its power restored
holy fuck what was that
check it out
the helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking devastated site of the blast
the jungle has been completely transformed
no longer lush and verdant the area is clear cut two feet above the ground covered in fine white smoldering ash
amongst the shattered stumps debris from the ship bright as magnesium flares burns with exotic colors
if the f
schaefer a living dead man streaked with the alien ash rises up from a shallow depression staring dumbstruck at the site
breaking in low over the treetops the helicopters flare up into position one preparing to land
as the chopper descends the crew standing in the door way stare transfixed at the devastation their eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke
as the helicopter slowly descends its propwash creating a raging storm schaefer materializes from the swirling smoke and ash his features taking form as he approaches his naked body covered
in mud blood and ash
as the chopper emerging from the vortex settles towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood
through the distorted veil the helicopter bristling with weapons visored and helmeted men now covered with white ash looks like a landing spacecraft
the door gunner swings the m into firing position pointing it at schaefer
he racks the bolt loading a round
the crewmen look tense frightened
anna standing next to the door gunner stares at the strange creature before her narrowing her eyes uncertain
is there something familiar about the figure
stands in the clearing staring at the helicopter and the array of weapons pointed at him
he looks dazed like a man making contact with members of an alien race for the first time
hovers low to the ground the tension inside building as schaefer approaches
more weapons swing into position
fingers tighten on triggers
suddenly anna recognizes the figure
realizing the danger she holds up her hands shouting flash overhead heading across the trackless jungle their rotors thumping like heavy machine gun fire
schaefer a blanket over his shoulders still in the remains of his mud camouflage his body laced with deep cuts his chest and shoulder caked with dried blood is seated
on a bench in the cargo hold
near the cockpit are general philips an army medic two machine gunners
they look at schaefer in awe
the medic holding an open field kit a syringe and bandages turns to philips
shaking his head looks like hes been through hell
cant believe hes still alive
what the hell went on down there
if it hadnt been for her hed be dead now
that story she told us
i still cant believe it
he looks at anna her eyes meeting his as if asking for an explanation
she looks at him a moment before turning back to schaefer staring at him as if he were risen from the dead
she looks into schaefers face schaefer returning her look recognition passing between them
anna extends her hand
schaefer slowly reaches out touching her fingers then clasping her hand
schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door beyond the passing jungle below out to the heavens
he turns back looking at anna a faint smile crossing his face
they made it
pull away and head towards the distant green horizon
