written by james cameron the sound of drums from a great distance growing louder
we are flying through mist a dimly glimpsed forest below
when i was lying there in the va hospital with a big hole blown through the middle of my life i started having these dreams of flying
we are very low over the forest now gliding fast the drums building to a peak sooner or later though you always have to wake up
a screech of brakes as a vehicle wipes frame revealing jake sully a scarred and scruffy combat vet sitting in a beat up carbon fiber wheelchair
at his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years
jake stares upward at the levels of the city
maglev trains whoosh overhead on elevated tracks against a sky of garish advertizing
they can fix a spinal if youve got the money
but not on vet benefits not in this economy
the traffic light changes and jake pushes forward with the crowd pumping the wheels of his chair
most of the people wear filter masks to protect them from the toxic air
in a long lens stack it is a marching torrent of anonymous isolated souls
the room is a tiny cubicle prison cell meets bathroom
narrow cot wall screen droning away in the b
the bengal tiger extinct for over a century is making a comeback
these cloned tiger cubs at the beijing zoo are
jake laboriously pulls his pants off rocking to one side pushing the fabric down past his hip then rocking to the other and so on
his legs are white and atrophied
but his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled
a born loser tattoo prominent on his shoulder
i became a marine for the hardship
to be hammered on the anvil of life
i told myself i could pass any test a man can pass
jake struggles with his pants a long time
not the kind of place youd bring your mom
we find jake near the pool table balancing his chair front wheels off the ground while holding a tequila shot on his forehead
onlookers including some other disabled vets clap and whoop
jake grabs the glass slams down the shot as they cheer
a wall sized screen filled with the world cup game men running on antelope legs
cu jake watching what he cant have
lets get it straight up front
i dont want your pity
i know the worlds a cold ass bitch
jakes eyes shift his pov seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd
a man on a barstool slaps the woman hes with
she cowers but hes got her arm shouting raising his fist
an eternal tableau
people look away
cu jake not looking away
you want a fair deal youre on the wrong planet
the strong prey on the weak
tight on jakes hand as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair
tracking with him as he rolls forward
its just the way things are
and nobody does a damn thing
jake stops unnoticed next to the bullying man
he leans down and grabs one leg of the mans barstool and yanks
the chair flips
the guy goes down hard and jake hurls himself from the wheelchair toppling on the guy getting a grip on him like a pit bull and punching the crap out
of him right there on the floor
the bouncer jumps in trying to drag him off and it goes into slow motion everybody yelling and pulling
all i ever wanted in my sorry ass life was a single thing worth fighting for
the bouncer hurls jake out the door sending him sprawling on the pavement
a moment later his chair crashes down on him banging across the alley landing in the trash
jake struggles to rise on one elbow
hes bleeding and bruised but still crazed and ready to fight
i hope you realize youve just lost a customer
he collapses onto his back panting
to himself candy ass bitch
he stares upwards at the levels of the city
magtrains roar overhead
it starts to rain
he just lies there blinking then shouts jauntily to no one in particular if it aint rainin we aint trainin
camera pulls back high and wide as jake lies spread eagled amongst the trash getting drenched
two long shadows enter frame coming to rest across him
jake sees two pairs of shiny shoes stop next to him
he squints up at two men
their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of fbi agents and auditors
are you jake sully
youre ruinin my good mood
its about your brother
down angle on a large rectangular cardboard box
hands enter frame pulling open the top to reveal a dead mans face
he looks exactly like a clean shaven version of jake
his the strong prey on the weak
a guy with a knife took all tommy would ever be for the paper in his wallet
wider showing jake and the two agents in a high tech crematorium a row of stainless steel furnaces
jake stares down at his own face
the suits concern was touching
your brother represented a significant investment
wed like to talk to you about taking over his contract
the attendant closes the box and seals it with a tape dispenser like its a package for shipping
the cardboard coffin is rolled into the furnace
the egghead and the jarhead
tommy was the scientist not me
he was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers
pushing in on jake as he watches bathed in orange light
me i was just another dumb grunt gettin sent someplace i was gonna regret
inside the furnace the burners quickly eat away the cardboard tommys face is for a moment wreathed in flame but not touched by it as we jakes face in icy
close on his eyes they open suddenly and he takes a sharp breath
jakes pov the inside of a metal coffin
a servo whine and we are moving emerging into a large chamber jakes pov a tech in medical scrubs floats weightlessly toward us
wherever we are were not on earth
jake squints as the lights flicker on revealing wide shot the multi tiered cryo vault
hundreds of cryo capsules are opening like morgue drawers as med techs pull themselves about in zero g tending to their patients
a hoarse whisper are we there
were there sunshine
time cut scores of people emerge from their cryo capsules in zero g
pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open coffins
the med tech floats among them using his announcement voice
people you have been in cryo for five years nine months and twenty two days
you will be hungry you will be weak
if you feel nausea please use the sacks provided for your convenience
the staff thanks you in advance
following jake as he pushes away from his capsule gliding to the lockers across the aisle his paralyzed legs not an impediment in weightlessness
against the cold infinity of stars glides an interstellar spacecraft isv venture star
as it moves past like an endless train we realize this thing is enormous over half a mile long
pan with it to reveal a gas giant planet called polyphemus ringed with dozens of moons which cast beauty mark shadows on its vast face
the isv diminishes away from us toward the largest moon a blue and surprisingly earth like world called pandora
the ship dwindles to a speck against the blue moon
isv venture star drifts above a spectacular vista the sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of pandora
close on isv two massive valkyrie shuttles are mated to a docking node
one of them separates from the starship and moves away its thrusters firing in short bursts
as the shuttle moves away descending toward pandora we hear the sound of drums building louder and louder until we flying over a landscape of massive cliffs and towering mesas
carpeted in rainforest
great scarves of cloud swirl around the mesa tops
a primeval landscape vast and forbidding
the trees are alien the color too cyan
there are waterfalls rivers and distant flocks of winged creatures
suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to an open pit mine
a lifeless crater as if a giant cookie cutter took a chunk out of the world
down among the terraces are excavators and trucks the size of three story buildings
and beyond the mine is the human colony
hells gate is a cluster of squat concrete and steel structures surrounded by chain link fence meters high topped with razor wire
at the corners are towers with automated sentry guns swiveling on servo mounts
visible beyond the gun towers the valkyrie shuttle roars in across the treetops
vectoring nozzles change angle bringing the ship to a slow hover
through a screen of jungle canopy we see the valkyrie thunder overhead
camera tilts with it until leaves block the view
a blue inhuman hand reaches into shot parting the foliage to reveal the shuttle hover taxiing across the compound
reverse ecu of two intense cat like golden eyes watching
the crew chief stomps down the aisle yelling exopacks on
passengers don their exo pack breathing gear with practiced moves
everybody except jake whos turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps
remember people you lose your mask youre unconscious in seconds and youre dead in four minutes
lets nobody be dead today it looks bad on my report
the crew chief stops by jake long enough to bark exopack on lets go
beneath the shuttle air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear
inside everybody is queued up in the aisles with duffles ready
rows of tense expectant faces in breathing masks and we dip down to find jake wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone elses waists
the cargo ramp opens with a hydraulic whine
go directly into the base
do not stop
go straight inside
hand held running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp
they jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in chainlink which leads to the complex
inside the chain link tunnel are a couple of sec ops troopers corporal lyle wainfleet and private fike
sec ops is the colonys private security force
these guys are laid back hardened and haggard
look at all that new meat
their pov jake rolls down the ramp
check it out man
meals on wheels
that is just wrong
jake pumping his chair looks around as a huge tractor taller than a house roars past on muddy wheels
he notices something sticking in the tires arrows
the neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology
beyond the tractor two vtol vehicles take off
armored and heavily armed they are at scorpion gunships
mitsubishi mk ampsuits human operated walking machines meters tall patrol the perimeter
they are heavily armored and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a gau
beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high
a sentry gun opens fire from a tower
tracers light up the twilight
a shadowy shape shrieks and drops off the fence
it is an armed camp in a state of siege
wainfleet and fike give jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches
whatre you two limpdicks starin at
as jake rolls past something swoops down behind him and
smashes against the chain link right next to his head
a vicious aerial predator a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel
it stabs at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto
wainfleet casually blasts it with his pistol
it drops off the fence tail still lashing
seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair
never seen anybody show up in one
jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien
on a walkway of the ops center seen from above a uniformed figure grips the railing watching jake pump his chair through the tunnel below
the hair is clipped short
the scalp is etched by long parallel scars where some pandoran denizens claws raked across it
the bare arms below tightly rolled sleeves seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood
criss crossed by scars
the man raises his masked face to look at the sky
he eyes are an icy steel gray
his pov the mighty polyphemus seems to fill the sky beyond the clouds
you are not in kansas any more
the man from the balcony colonel miles quaritch is the head of security for the hells gate colony
a hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria
he stops stance wide
without his mask we see that quaritchs features are rugged and handsome except for the scar which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face
on one hip he carries a very large pistol
you are on pandora ladies and gentlemen
respect that fact every second of every day
jake rolls in watching from the back
colonel quaritch raises his hand and points out the window toward the dark treeline
out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees
the room gets very quiet
we have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the navi
theyre fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute
we operate we live at a constant threat condition yellow
pan across the solid faces of miners cat machine drivers engineers geologists as they take that in
as head of security its my job to keep you alive
i will not succeed pausing for effect not with all of you
if you wish to survive you need a strong mental attitude you need to follow procedure
push in on jake watching as the briefing continues
nothing like an old school safety brief to put your mind at ease
people are roaming in both directions looking for rooms lugging duffels and cases
an eager young xenoanthropologist staggering under an overpacked duffel runs to catch up to jake
hey youre jake right
you look just like him
off jakes wary look sorry im norm spellman i went through avatar training with him
norm offers his hand and jake shakes it
he was a great guy funny
it was a big shock to all of us
jake pumps the wheels of his chair rolling on
norm walks with him
obviously you look like him
i mean if you werent genetically identical you wouldnt be taking over his avatar
thats why im here
so you want to go check it out
jake and norm enter the bio lab a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms
me and norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars
theyre grown from human dna mixed with dna from the natives here
a scientist doctor max cullimore is supervising the uncrating of two shipping containers
the nearer has the sides removed revealing a ceiling height acrylic tank
norm stops to stare and jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force toward the amnio tank
there is a figure floating lanquidly inside which looks like a man
a very large very blue man
blood circulates through a synthetic umbilical in the abdomen
as the figure turns in the amniotic fluid we see that it has a lemur like tail
the skin is cyan blue
long black hair drifts graceful as seaweed
they got big
yeah they mature on the trip out
to max so the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well
yeah theyve got great muscle tone
give us a few hours you guys can take them for a spin
the figures sleeping face turns toward us and the features are despite feline ears and a long feral snout definitely jakes
it looks like him
no it looks like you
this is your avatar now jake
on jake mesmerized as he stares into the tank
the idea is every driver is matched to his own avatar stereocam video shot of jake facing the camera talking directly to the lens
jakes voice over up until now has been part of this videolog
so their nervous systems are in tune
which is why they offered me this gig because i can link with tommys avatar which was insanely expensive
looking off camera is this right
i just say whatever in these videologs
wider showing norm working nearby with max
you just need to get in the habit of documenting everything what you see what you feel its all part of the science
good science starts with good observation
to camera so whatever
here i am
looks around never been in a lab before
its time to meet your boss for the next five years
he leads jake and norm through the short corridor to the the link room contains a dozen psionic link units which look like coffins crossed with mri scanners
grace augustine is a legend
shes the head of the avatar program and she wrote the book i mean literally wrote the book on pandoran botany
low over his shoulder thats because she likes plants better than people
grace augustine sits up in her link stretching and cracking her neck after a long session
shes fifty with a strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes
whos got my goddamn cigarette
a tech scurries to bring it to her already lit
around here they jump when grace barks
grace stands scowling as jake norm and max approach
and here she is cinderella back from the ball
grace id like you to meet norm spellman and ja norm
i hear good things about you
hows your navi
navi subtitled may the all mother smile upon our first meeting
grace nods approvingly taking a drag on her cigarette
you sound a little formal
there is still much to learn
jake waits while they ignore him chattering in fluent navi
uh grace this is jake s turning to jake yeah yeah i know who you are and i dont need you
i need your brother
to max you know the phd who trained three years for this mission
i know its a big inconvenience to everyone
how much lab training have you had
ever run a gas chromatograph
any actual lab work at all
high school chemistry
but i ditched
grace wheels on max
theyre pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain
turning away im going to selfridge
she shoves past jake
grace thats not a good idea
but shes already out the door and clomping down the corridor
max turns to jake with a pained look
here tomorrow oh eight hundred
try to use big words
it looks like an air traffic control tower with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex
administrator parker selfridge takes a ball from a newly opened case of titleists and sets it on the floor
selfridge is young charismatic focused
some would say ruthless
he assumes the stance and lines up his putt toward a practice cup across the control room floor
he glances up as grace strides toward him
parker i used to think it was benign neglect but now i see youre intentionally screwing us
you know i enjoy our little talks
i need a research assistant not some jarhead dropout
selfridge looks down and hits the ball
grace kicks the practice cup aside and the ball rolls past
selfridge looks at her with a sigh
actually we got lucky with him
how is this in any way lucky
as selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball
well lucky your guy had a twin brother and lucky the brother wasnt an oral hygienist or something
a marine we can use
im assigning him to your team as security escort
the last thing i need is another trigger happy asshole out there
look youre supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives
isnt that the whole point of your little puppet show
if you look like them if you talk like them theyll trust you
selfridge crosses to his office behind a glass wall nearby
but after how many years
relations with the indigenous are only getting worse
that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them
on selfridges desk is a magnetic base and hovering in mid air in the invisible field is a lump of metallic rock
he grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger in front of graces eyes
this is why were here
because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo
no other reason
this is what pays for the party
and its what pays for your science
he places it back in the magnetic field
those savages are threatening our whole operation
were on the brink of war and youre supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution
so use what youve got and get me some results
next morning grace norm and jake approach their link units
jake glances through a pressure window
in an adjoining chamber the ambient room jakes avatar lies on a gurney breathing slowly in pandoran air
norms avatar is on a second gurney
both are attended by med techs in exo masks
norm slips into his link chair expertly donning biometric sensors
how much link time have you logged
five hundred and twenty hours
grace looks pointedly at jake
like an hour
tell me youre joking
grace opens the hood of jakes link unit
jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair
she reaches to help him but dont
i got this
grace steps back hands raised
he drags himself into the unit
so you just figured youd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man with no training of any kind and see how it went
what was going through your head
he meets her eyes with a defiant glare
maybe i was just tired of doctors telling me what i couldnt do
grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand
jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit
it seems to enfold him
grace adjusts his biometric sensors then lowers the upper clamshell relax and let your mind go blank
that shouldnt be hard for you
kiss the darkest part of my lily white but the slamming hood muffles the rest
the link tech touches some controls
on a large monitor a d scan of jakes brain appears
regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors
thats a gorgeous brain
walking away alright im going in
phase lock at forty percent
hes in transition
max watches a display showing the avatars nervous system aligning with jakes two ghostly networks of light merging
find your way home
ecu jake inside the link unit
his eyes move under the lids like a dreamer in rem sleep as inside jakes mind radiant streamers coalesce into a pulsing tunnel of light and the screen flares white
resolving into an overexposed out of focus image two blurry faces wearing masks looking down
ecu jakes avatar two very intense eyes fill frame the pupils contracting
golden irises pulse with life
phase lock ninety nine percent
the link is stable
blinking jake slowly sits up on the gurney
he looks down at his avatar body touching his chest with one hand
take it slow jake
we need to check your motor control
try touching your fingertips together but jake isnt listening
hes staring at his legs
he eases them off the gurney and his blue feet touch the concrete floor taking his weight
jake stands feeling the strength in his legs
his expression is child like with wonder
his pov looking down at the med techs who seem the size of children next to his tall frame
he sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he jerks around in alarm
as he turns to see it the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash
jake laughs and grins at max
easy jake i need you to sit down but jake takes a step then another
the wires to the bio monitors pull taut and he yanks them off his chest
wait we have to run some tests but jake pushes past the protesting med techs toward the door and jake emerges blinking in the morning sun
he finds himself in the avatar compound a living and training area
nearby a couple of avatars are playing one on one in front of a non regulation height basketball net
others go about their daily activities around the compound
jake flexes his legs jumps and lands a little unsteadily but his expression is joyful
he takes a few steps and breaks into a run
people are calling to him somehwere but he doesnt hear them hes running
he finds himself in the compound garden and stops amid neatly tended rows of alien plants
he looks down wiggling his toes in the warm soil
then inhales deeply revelling in the alien smells earth plants the nearby forest
he looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world
jake turns at the familiar voice to see a statuesque female avatar walking toward him
avatar grace is magnificent with panther thighs flat muscular stomach and firm athletes breasts
she wears shorts and a t shirt
in human years she would be about
well whod you expect numbnuts
she throws him a piece of pandoran fruit which he catches
motor control is looking good
jake bites into the fruit the juice running down his chin
hey check it out
jake turns to see norms avatar posing like a bodybuilder chest shot back shot bis
i am a living god
a wide shot of the terraced crater of the unobtanium mine
a quiet beat then
the entire face of one terrace is blown skyward in a chain of explosions
the shot blasts hundreds of tons of rock loose
long lens angles of enormous wheel loaders shovelling up ore rich rock and dropping it into dump trucks
a wall of steel fills frame
the dozer blade crushes everything in its path reducing trees to kindling
wider showing the clear cutting operation near the mine as a road is cut through the jungle
remotely operated dozers three stories tall rip into the tree line
one of the dozers has rotating slash cutter a vicious spinning head mounted on a hydraulic arm that hogs through the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood shrapnel
the heavy machines are escorted by ampsuits
colonel quaritch on foot leads a squad of troopers wearing breathing masks and carrying almighty big automatic weapons
a banshee a fearsome aerial predator hurtles from above diving toward them on wings meters across
we get a glimpse of glassy fangs before p p poom
quaritch cranks off three rapid shots with his massive sidearm and the creature drops with a shriek
it crashes near them and quaritch fires two more well placed rounds
the newbies stare at the things barracuda teeth
for you pogues this is a banshee
a small one
see they like it when i bring fresh meat out here
and this clearcutting really stirs up the hornets nest
so keep your head on a swivel
if it moves shoot it
if youre not sure its moving shoot it
if it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to sally rottencrotch shoot it
whatre you gonna do
shoot it sir
quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest his eyes scanning
flanking the squad lyle wainfleet drives an ampsuit his massive feet crashing through the underbrush
as his gaze comes down he sees something ahead of him on the trail an intricate totem of woven sticks bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orb
he tears it down with the barrel of his rifle and stomps it into the mud as he moves on
jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical style construction beamed ceiling open sides covered by screen
around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night pulling insect netting around their cots
in one hand jake holds the end of his long braided queue of hair
close on the queue the ends of the hair writhe slowly with their own life like tendrils of a sea creature
thats kinda freaky
grace switches off the overheads
lights out amigos
see ya at dinner
jake sits in the twilight listening to the screeches and hoots from the forest
finally he lies down closing his eyes and ecu human jake his eyes open
jake blinks disoriented as max opens the upper clamshell of his link unit
in the next chair grace sits up yawning and cracking her neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette
looking down damn
same old sack a bones
jake struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls himself out of the unit
jake sits with grace norm and the other avatar drivers while around them miners troopers and other base personnel wolf their breakfasts
grace is engaged in a heated conversation with another scientist
jake isolated from the conversations around him notices pilot trudy chacon approaching dressed in her flight suit
shes a rock hard former marine with thousands of flight hours out in the badlands
sully colonel wants to see you in the armor bay
jake gives norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table
he wheels away led by trudy
tight on grace scowling as she watches him go
jake and trudy enter the armor bay passing tilt rotors under repair
there are the heavily armed scorpions as well as several sa samson work horses outfitted with door guns and rocket pods
you guysre packing some heavy ordinance
yeah cause were not the only thing flyin around out there
or the biggest
im gonna need you on a door gun im a man short
yeah no problem
she extends her fist and he taps it with his
see ya on the flight line zero nine
she points hes down there
jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the armor bay passing rows of ampsuits standing in service racks
techs clamber over the suits loading ordinance with cranes and lifts
at the end of the row is a makeshift gym area
quaritch is bench pressing massive plates
this low gravity makes you soft
pushing the last rep you get soft pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning
quaritch racks the bar and sits up sweating but not winded
i pulled your record corporal
venezuela that was some mean bush
nothing like this here though
you got heart kid coming out here
i figured just another hellhole
quaritch chuckles appreciatively claps him on the shoulder
the chief mechanic yells from the nearest ampsuit that servos in colonel if you want to try it
quaritch crosses to the suit with jake following
i was in first recon a few years ahead of you
more than a few
two tours in nigeria not a scratch
i come out here and he points to his scarred face
they could fix this if i rotated back
but you know what
i kinda like it
reminds me every day whats out there
besides i cant leave he looks out as if he can see through the wall to the tree line
this is my war here
quaritch climbs the suit and reaches into the cockpit throwing some switches
the suits gas turbine spools up with a rising whine
the avatar program is a joke buncha limpdick scientists
but we have a unique opportunity here you and i
a recon marine in an avatar body could get me the intel i need on the ground right in the hostiles camp
the whine is now a roaring whoosh as the suit trembles with power
the air boils above the exhaust vents
quaritch reaches in and operates the controls flexing one huge hand
he nods to the waiting mechanic looks good
to jake i need you to learn about these savages gain their trust
find out how i can force their cooperation or hit em hard if they dont
maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you
or bagged and tagged
that sounds real good colonel
so am i still with augustine
you walk like one of her science pukes you quack like one but you report to me
can you do that for me
quaritch brings the suit to life
he steps forward and pivots smoothly
he balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong graceful arcs
jake realizes he is doing a wu shoo kata
a flawless display of strength and control
hes impressive and jake is impressed
quaritch is the kind of man he respects focused hard
look son i take care of my own
get me what i need ill see you get your legs back when you rotate home
your real legs
he raises the suits hand and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet
jake watches quaritch walk past huge feet clanging kung
grace is on the move gulping coffee in a hurry to get their first sortie started
she hands a clipboard to max
were on the flight line in ten minutes
max nods and jogs ahead toward the link room
jake and norm fall in with grace as they enter the connecting corridor
what did atilla want
just marines comparin tattoos
not buying it yeah
well listen to me marine she stops turning to drill him with a look
youre driving an avatar now
that means youre in my world got it
she turns and enters the link room
grace crosses to the controls of jakes link unit
as the others catch up that son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough
all this indicating link room exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people who could teach us so much
but thanks to quaritch and his thugs the navi wont even talk to us anymore
then hows this supposed to work
we have a new face
turning to norm youre fluent youve studied the culture
youre non threatening
the ones we know best the omaticaya clan may give you a chance
maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits up for good
this is failing as a pep talk
jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link
how do we contact them
they contact us
if they see us taking our samples treating the forest with respect pointedly to jake not trampling everything in sight they may reach out to us
or they may skin us and make a drum
jake lies back lowering the sensor array over his body
just keep your mouth shut and let norm do the talking
she closes his clamshell hard and we flying over a carpet of rainforest past sheer cliffs and cloud wreathed mesas
trudys samson tilt rotor chases its shadow across the treetops
though big as a blackhawk it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape
angle through the open side doors of the samson
trooper wainfleet in exo mask and body armor leans on his door gun scanning for aerial predators
in avatar form jake grace and norm watch the forest unrolling beneath them the wind blasting their clothes
jake mans the other door gun his feet propped on the skids
trudy flies from a pressurized cockpit
she banks to follow a shallow river
sturmbeest herd one oclock
norm grins and points excitedly
jake looks in time to see a herd of sturmbeest massive six legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo thundering across the river
looks like a bull six cows and some juveniles
the bull has the red on the dorsal armor
grace nods approvingly
time cut hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake startled by the samson
they skim the water above their own reflections
time cut the ground drops away as the samson flies over a waterfall hundreds of feet high
trudy banks hard rolling in on the gorge below like its a gun run
wainfleet whoops while norm looks like hes about to puke
jake grins into the airstream
a small meadow among towering trees
the fern like grass is beaten down in waves by the rotor wash as the samson settles to the ground
jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle
he and wainfleet leap out to secure the lz scanning the tree line warily weapons aimed
grace jogs forward to the cockpit motioning trudy to shut down
trudy kills the samsons turbines
grace towering over wainfleet motions him to hang back
stay with the ship
for jake one idiot with a guns enough
whatever you say doc
jake takes point as they enter the jungle
yall have fun out there
the forest engulfs jake grace and norm in cyan gloom
the shadows are alive with the chittering sounds of unseen alien wildlife
tracking with jake as he moves through the foliage hyper alert looking around like a tourist in hell
a monkey like prolemuris leaping from limb to limb overhead flashing through the sunlight streaming down in shafts
a plant with swaying tendrils which reach toward jake as he passes
this forest is more alive than any on earth with plants that react and move like animals
jake white knuckles his rifle as if every shadow conceals razor fanged death
youre making me nervous
she pushes ahead of him on the trail forcing him to lower his muzzle as he follows her
grace moves nimbly on the path seemingly unconcerned
wide shot as the party moves between the huge trees tiny as ants
the trail has gotten steeper the going tougher
they enter a clearing with an overgrown building made of timbers cut from the local trees with a thatch roof
it is covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it
how will they know were here
im sure theyre watching us right now
jake looks behind him as they approach the school feeling unseen eyes
tracking with jakes boots as he steps among dried leaves and a few moldering childrens books
the kids were so bright so eager to learn
they picked up english faster than i could teach it to them
wider as jake explores the room
grace and norm are selecting instruments from storage cases on a wooden table
bring the soil probe right there yellow case
jake looks up at a rustling among the dark rafters
roosting stingbats eye him warily fluttering their wings
grace picks up a moldering copy of the lorax by dr
seuss from the floor and puts it back on a shelf
the stingbats knock them off
i guess i always hope somebody will come back and read them
why dont they come back
the navi learned as much about us as they needed to know
jake sees something and approaches the blackboard reaches out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate
unmistakably bullet holes
turning to her what happened here
are you going to help with this gear
weve got a lot to do
she turns away
jake watches her as he jams equipment into his pack
close on graces blue hand gently brushing away soil exposing a tangle of root tendrils
see right here where the roots of the two trees interact
wider grace and norm crouch among enormous octopoidal roots
she takes a tiny sample using a needle like probe
norm uses a digital device to scan the roots
jake bored scouts ahead a few meters
he comes to a glade filled with shoulder high spiral plants called helicoradians
he brushes one and shtoonk
it sucks down into a tube in the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish
curious jake touches another shtoonk
and another like popping balloons after a party
a chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground revealing a hammerhead titanothere
like a six legged rhinoceros but twice that size
its massive low slung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark
its baleful eyes lock onto him
jake raises his rifle
grace alerted by the creatures snorts runs to where she can see the tableau
she presses her throat mike
youll piss it off
the bull hammerhead bellows and lowers its meter wide sledgehammer of a skull
its already pissed off
jake that armors too thick
jake starts to back away
the hammerhead bellows again pawing the earth
its a territorial threat display
do not run or hell charge
what do i do
hold your ground
the hammerhead slashes its head sideways splintering saplings
it bellows again lowers its head and charges jake screams at the top of his lungs spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing
it stops abruptly with an oversized bleat
on jake amazed the gambit worked
something rises up behind him out of focus a thanator
the most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived this thing could eat a t rex and have the alien for desert
it is a black six limbed panther from hell with an armored head and massive distensible jaws
jake unaware of the advancing thanator is still bracing the hammerhead thats what im talkin about bitch
the bull wheels around trumpeting in fear and crashes away through splintering undergrowth
thats right motherf a guttural snarl behind him
jake spins in time to see three tons of rippling thanator launch over him landing between him and the hammerhead
the ground shakes
the thanator emits an earsplitting roar enraged that the hammerhead got away
it twists on itself turning to face jake and bares its fangs with a lethal hiss
what about this one
run dont run
jake bolts as the thanator leaps after him and jake launches himself between two large trunks forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while jake scrambles
up around over a tangle of roots and sk rash
claws slash the air behind him exploding bark off a trunk as jake wills himself forward in a frenzy
with rippling muscle the beast is airborne again blacking out the sun but jake dives under a massive root system and crash
kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root trunks above him
claws slash down next to him as he rolls and crawls glistening jaws smash and snap against the barrier trunks sending chunks of wood flying
its spittle sprays across jake jaws inches away as he rolls onto his back and fires his ar point blank but the rifle is snatched out of his hands
the beast screeches an ungodly wail of pain and rage and rips the entire trunk away
jake scrambles to escape but glistening jaws lunge downward snap shut and the creature rips jake out of the tree shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit only
it has him by the backpack so jake unlatches it and he flies free as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth
giving jake a moment to sprint away but with a hideous bellow the thanator crashes after him splintering trees
jake runs in a blur dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and he sees water ahead and dives outward with all his might
the thanators jaws snap shut inches behind him as he flies out into open space and jake splashes down into a swiftly moving river
the thanator leaps down after him pursuing from rock to rock its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon
jake ducks under as fwhoosh
black claws slash past his face amid turbulent bubbles
a waterfall ahead
jake is swept over the falls with the thanator swiping at him from a rock just missing and jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract
the water boils below the cataract
jakes head bursts through the surface and he gasps for breath
he is carried along by the current but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree
he weakly pulls himself up and just lies there gasping on the trunk
above him on the cliff the thanator bellows a roar which echoes across the jungle
jake wet and bruised crouches under a screen of giant leaves
he hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife forming a crude but sharp tip
tracking with jake as he walks through the forest like its a minefield carrying his spear white knuckled
he is freaked and hyper alert
the trees here are a hundred meters high blocking out the sky
a few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom
pov from above looking down through leaves we watch jake move warily through the forest
ecu two golden eyes bright in the shadows
downangle as jake passes under a tree limb
invisible to him draped on the limb like a leopard is a striking navi girl
she watches only her eyes moving
she is lithe as a cat with a long neck muscular shoulders and nubile breasts
and she is devastatingly beautiful for a girl with a tail
in human age she would be
her name is neytiri nay tee ree
jake passes less than meters beneath her oblivious
neytiri rises soundlessly
in one fluid sinuous movement she nocks an arrow to her bow and draws aiming right at jake
below her jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his on neytiri as she follows him with the bow muscles tensing for the shot and something drifts down
in front of her f
rack focus to the tip of the arrow where a single woodsprite floats down to land on the arrow head
like a dandelion seed but larger the woodsprite waves its silky cilia feather light as it balances on the deadly point
it glows faintly in the dark shadows
neytiri frowns puzzled and lowers her bow slowly
the woodsprite whirls away into the gloom
grace and norm peer down into the shadowed forest as trudy banks in a search pattern
im going to have to call it guys
were not allowed to run night ops
grace looks to the west
the sun setting behind alien trees
hes just gonna have to hang on till morning
hes not going to make it till morning
grace stares into the dark forest as the samson banks hard thundering away toward the setting sun
long lens polyphemus
the giant planet rises behind the black trees
jakes got a new problem
he sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the night shadows behind him
he is being stalked by a pack of viperwolves
jake catches only glimpses a glint of eyes a slinking black movement then nothing
time cut tight on jakes hands as he knots his t shirt around the butt end of the spear
angle on thick sap trickling down a tree trunk
jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap soaking the shirt with it
a waterproof match from his survival kit lights the torch
the torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing leaping shadows
jake turns warily as he moves along the trail
behind him are several pairs of reflective green eyes
another pair flanking him beside the trail
black on black shapes which seem to flow like liquid
he looks up sees one cross a limb overhead
another on his opposite flank
then a hideous sound like a hyenas psychotic laugh
the viperwolves can run like a dog and climb like a monkey
they are hunting jake from the ground and the trees
jake runs by torch light on the edge of panic
he reaches a steep banked stream and without thinking runs across it on a horizontal trunk and stops dead on the other side
the torch illuminates green eyes cutting ahead of him across the trail
the viperwolves have him encircled
the psychotic barks become more intense as they signal each other getting excited
one makes a run at him angling on his legs from behind but jake whirls jamming the torch in its face
it yips and goes past but another moves in he jabs it with the business end of the spear and it snarls retreating baring its fangs
now half a dozen are circling him in the open and he sees what hes up against
the viperwolves are six limbed with shiny chitinous skin their paws leathery black hands
glistening black teeth in dead white gums
jake realizes that he is making his final stand
he whirls the torch in an arc keeping them at bay and feels a rush of adrenaline
it goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone
i dont have all goddamn night
with snarls and a blur of motion they attack
jake cracks the spear down on one then spins as another leaps at him and he plants the spear in it striking true but its momentum wrenches it from his
hands and the torch goes flying
left in semi darkness jake draws his knife as a wolf lunges sinking its teeth into his arm
he yells in pain and fury slashing with the knife which cuts deep into the beasts shoulder and it lets go
jake sprints trying to escape but a snarling viperwolf leaps grabbing him by the ankle with its fore hand
jake tears away sprawling scrambling to get up as
three wolves charge at once
the nearest leaps at his throat just as thunk
an arrow appears in its chest
the wolf lands on him already a dead weight
he pushes it off in time to see a blue amazon emerge from the trees nock another arrow draw and fire in one fluid motion
an unearthly yowl as another wolf falls
neytiri leaps right over jake and cracks her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf
another springs at her and she drops under its weight but rolls coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand
her knife flashes down buried to the hilt in its chest
snarling a wounded wolf attacks jake and he kicks it away but it spins and leaps back onto him and jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the
snapping jaws away from his face
meanwhile neytiri swings her bow in a big arc cracking it across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves
the wolves slink and circle yelping as the bow whistles past them
finally they break and run with neytiri chasing and they bound away through the foliage as she shouts after them raaaarrrr
jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight
finally it stops thrashing
panting he releases it and looks up at neytiri
her tail lashes as she scans the forest listening to the fading yelps of the wolves
satisfied the attack is over she turns
she regards him coldly for a second then walks past him
neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream
jake blinks around at the darkness realizing he can still see
in fact with the blinding torchlight gone the forest is transformed
the jungle has come alive with bioluminescence spots and patterns ghosts and galaxies of blue green light
jake scrambles to recover his spear
neytiri kneels beside a dying wolf
its cries are pitiful
it paws the air trying to raise its head
she pulls her knife from its chest
in navi forgive me my brother
she cuts its throat ending the pitiful cries
she touches its head gently regarding it with sadness
neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist
she crosses to another slain wolf and kneels pulling the arrow from its heart
look um i know you probably dont understand this
i owe you
neytiri ignores him assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal
in navi forgive me
may your spirit run with the great mother
i would have been screwed if you hadnt come along she rises and walks away without looking at jake
where you goin
he crashes through some plants catching up to her
slow down a second will you
i just want to thank you for killing those he makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and
she wallops him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing laying him out flat
he looks up to see a fury standing over him
a fury who speaks english accented halting angry english
you dont thank for this
this is sad
very sad only
okay im sorry
whatever i did im sorry
she gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves
all this is your fault
they did not need to die
they attacked me
howm i the bad guy she silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat
you are like a baby making noise dont know what to do
you should not come here all of you
you only come and make problems
jake gets up slowly facing her
okay fine you love your little forest friends
so why not just let them kill my ass
whats the thinking
cu neytiri looking away
finally reluctantly her eyes meet his for the first time a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs
why save you
yes why save me
you have a strong heart
she leans closer
ignorant like a child
she turns away stalking off but jake goes after her
tracking with neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge root
wider as she trots with perfect balance along the root which forms an elevated walkway
jake runs to catch up realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor
throughout the following they move through a glowing phantasmagorical forest
if im so ignorant maybe you should teach me
sky people can not learn
you do not see
she leaps to another elevated root
jake follows surprised that he made it
he runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace
then teach me to see
she stops and he almost runs into her
no one can teach you to see
then she turns and trots on
they run across the elevated root of an enormous tree a horizontal trunk big as an oak
wide shot as they cross a deep gorge
a waterfall shimmers silver in the polyphemus light
vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers
hey slow down
look i think we just got off on the wrong foot and
jake looks down suddenly aware of the height
you just have to get to know me
jake sull a vine catches his spear and spins him off balance
he drops the spear and almost falls off the root
neytiri catches him with one hand gripping his bicep
he watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river
she pulls him upright
shouts at him in english and navi
i need your help
you should not be here
so take me with you
you go back
down angle from far above several woodsprites float down through the trees
follow them as they descend silently toward jake and neytiri
neytiri sensing a presence looks up to see the woodsprites pulsing with purpose float right towards jake
they dance gently around his shoulders and head
off her amazed look what
more woodsprites gather around him
several alight on him
jake holds still knowing he should be afraid but somehow hes not
he spreads his arms
more sprites come landing all over his arms hands body
what are they
cu neytiri reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread
seeds of the great tree very pure spirits
jake now a pulsing glowing fluttering mass of light moves one hand slowly not wanting to break the spell
he studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until whoosshh
the woodsprites whirl up and away scattering into the darkness
what was that all about
neytiri seems shaken
she seizes his hand and pulls him after her
tracking with jake as he gazes about him in growing wonder
he touches leaves as he passes watching the bioluminescence shiver through them
jake looks down as they cross a bed of purple moss which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps
rings of green light like ripples on a pond expand outward from each footfall
exploding rings of light where his feet touch down
dream like surreal beauty
wide on them as they run over a large root across a mirror like pool at the base of a waterfall
jake follows neytiri running along a raised root trunk
whats your name
jake hears whoosh whoosh and snaps a look as a bolo flies at him spinning end for end and shwhap
tangles around his legs
he topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below
jake untangles himself getting up to run just as several navi riders thunder toward him
they are riding direhorses six legged armor skinned alien clydesdales
we see that the riders queues are connected to the horses long moth like antennae a neural link with which they can command the horse leaving hands free for weapons
the riders aim bows and spears at jake as they approach
jake turns to bolt but navi hunters melt out of the shadows weapons aimed blocking his retreat
neytiri drops to the ground next to jake and confronts the lead rider
she shouts sharply in navi tsutey what are you doing
he is my captive
tsutey tsu tay is young and powerfully built with sculpted features and a proud jawline piercing eyes
tsutey swings off his mount with fluid grace
these demons are forbidden here
i will kill this one as a lesson to the others
tsutey draws his bow but neytiri leaps between him and jake confronting him warrior to warrior
there has been a sign
this is a matter for the tsahik
tsutey clenches his jaw with frustration frustration with her as much as the situation
he turns and angrily remounts his direhorse barking a command to the hunters
they grab jake and haul him to his feet
encircled by spears and bows he is shoved forward along the trail as tsutey and the others ride ahead
jake is hauled roughly toward neytiris village which is sheltered inside one of the great trees
hometree is meters tall with a trunk four times the diameter of the largest sequoia and a base of massive mangrove pillars
tsutey rides inside the columns at the base of hometree shouting an ululating warning
jake is force marched through the pillars into an open central area
the villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party
we see the people of the tribe mothers with babies old women young hunters
they gawk at the alien expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility
the huge eyes of the children follow him
jake is amazed at the size of hometree inside
by the light of the cook fires he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery a living cathedral
clear membranes sturmbeest bladders filled with fluttering bio luminescent insects act as area lighting
the central space is dominated by the skull of some enormous creature mounted with much embellishment on a totem
standing in front of this awaiting their approach is eytukan ay too kahn the clan leader
eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of thanator claws
his normally stern features are clouded further by anger
why do you bring this creature here
neytiri addresses eytukan in navi
i was going to kill him but there was a sign from eywa
he glowers at her as he responds pointing at jake
i have said no dreamwalker will come here to offend our home
his alien smell fills my nose neytiri stands her ground answering in a respectful but not submissive tone
father many atokirina came to this alien
whats going on
my father is deciding whether to kill you
to eytukan uh good to meet you sir
jake steps forward offering his hand and the hunters jump to restrain him shouting
but they all freeze as a commanding female voice echoes through the chamber
everybody looks up
moat moh aht stands on the second level looking down
she is a severe woman in her s
her bearing is haughty her expression friendly as a hanging judge
her outfit is elaborate denoting her rank as clan matriarch
i will look at this alien
there is an expectant hush as moat descends the helical core of hometree a kind of natural spiral staircase
that is mother
she is tsahik the one who interprets the will of eywa
neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as moat passes
the villagers stare silently as the matriarch circles slowly around jake examining his tail and the end of his queue
thick accent what are you called
she produces a long thorn between her fingertips
with a flourish she strikes his chest
red blood wells up and moat rubs some between her fingertips
she tastes it
why did you come to us
i came to learn
we have tried to teach other sky people
it is hard to fill a cup which is already full
my cup is empty trust me
just ask doctor augustine
im no scientist
what are you
i dont know
i was a marine uh a warrior
of the jarhead clan
i could kill him easily
this is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen
we need to learn more about him
whats going on
what are they saying
to neytiri subtitled daughter
you will teach him our way to speak and walk as we do
neytiri looks shocked then angry
thats not fair
i only it is decided
neytiri subsides turning to glare at jake
to jake my daughter will teach you our ways
learn well jakesully
we will see if your insanity can be cured
she turns to neytiri her expression stern he is your responsibility
neytiri nods accepting but shes not a happy camper
she grabs jakes arm and pulls him roughly away
so its all good right
you and me do not speak
later neytiri leads jake up the spiral to the second level
he now wears only a ratty loincloth
his wounds are bound with plant fiber bandages
the entire clan is squatting at dinner in a huge circle
they stop talking and turn to gaze at jake as he enters the circle
dont get up
neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with several large leaves heaped with food
she kneels next to jake placing the food in front of him almost defiantly
you never told me your name
neytiri te ckaha moatite
okay again a whole lot slower
exaggerated slowness neytiri
nay tee ree
jake knows shes baiting him
he smiles in response
nay tee ree
nay tee ree
across the circle tsutey moat and eytukan sit together glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger
these aliens try to look like people but they cant
he seems dim to me
and his eyes are too small
neytiri motions for jake to take portions from the serving leaves onto his own leaf
your mom likes me
i can tell
moat watching jake and neytiri leans over to eytukan
neytiri will test this warrior
hey may learn nothing but we will learn much
you speak truth
we must understand these sky people if we are to drive them out
jake munches on a white shrimp like thing
what are they
you call beetle larvae
she heaps some more onto his leaf a challenge and jake meets her eyes takes a handful and starts munching enthusiastically
thats some damn fine teylu
thats like grandmas teylu
cu tsutey warily eyeing jake i say she will kill him
the sleeping level families nesting in groups on woven hammocks the size of trampolines
the hunters sleep along spokes joining the inner trunk to the trees outer shell
jake lies awake in a hammock people rustling in the darkness around him
neytiri is nearby curled up like a little girl
she stares at him for a moment then closes her eyes
jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night light a pulse of life energy
a strange peace spreads through him
he closes his eyes and grace is over jake in the link slapping him as max and norm hover
come on back kid thats it
he looks around blinking
reality crashing in
damn you were dug in like a tick
she helps him sit up is the avatar safe
huge grin yeah doc and you are not going to believe where i am
breakfast the next day
the other drivers lean forward hanging on graces re telling of the tale
so the kids out there one night and hes got the queen bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys
its not something you can teach
some of the other scientists clap jake on the shoulders in congratulation
thats awesome jake
norm chomps his bacon fuming
to jake getting serious for reasons i cannot fathom the omaticaya have chosen you
god help us all
jake has reported to selfridge and quaritch
quaritch turns from gazing out at the wall of forest displaying a feral grin
he laughs and that worked
they want to study me
see if i can learn to be one of them
thats how you seize the initiative
i wish i had ten more like you
look sully find out what these blue monkeys want
selfridge contd we try to give them medicine and education
but no they like mud
i wouldnt care except selfridge turns to a large d graphic display pointing
a road runs from hells gate to a proposed new mine miles away
their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction
which sucks for them because they need to relocate
taking that in does augustine know about this
yeah she does and shes on the next ship back if she tries to cock block me on it
so who talks them into moving
what if they wont go
im betting they will
killing the indigenous looks bad but theres one thing shareholders hate more than bad press and thats a bad quarterly statement
find me a carrot to get them to move or its going to have to be all stick
jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility
you got three months
thats when the dozers get there
im on it
jake pumps his chair across the lab flanked by grace and norm
grace holds stereo still pictures in front of him one at a time images of clan members she has shot over the years a kind of flash card drill
next photo moat
next photo eytukan
hes the clan leader indicating moat but shes the spiritual leader
like a shaman
the dialogue is continuous as they enter
so whos this eywa
oh only their deity
the great mother
the goddess made up of all living things
youd know that if you had any training whatsoever
he hauls himself from wheelchair to link
whos got a date with the chiefs daughter
knock it off
jesus its like kindergarten around here
as jake settles into the soft embrace of the link grace inputs commands at the control station
neytiri was my best student
she and her sister silwanin
just amazing girls
i didnt meet the sister
no shes dead
turning to him okay lets go village life starts early
link is ready
grace lowers the bio sensor array over jakes chest
dont do anything unusually stupid
she closes the clamshell and we cu jakes avatar blinking awake staring up at hometree like a gothic cathedral overhead
sunlight streams down through gaps in the towering vault
jake walks among the villagers who go about their daily tasks
young girls sit together weaving and singing
they look up as he passes then go back to work
two men clean the fish theyve caught
a young mother pounds seeds into meal while nursing an infant
children chase each other and climb like monkeys
one bold little girl runs up to jake stops staring then shrieks with laughter as she runs back to her playmates
grinning jake turns to see neytiri cantering toward him on a direhorse
she leads a second horse an old sway backed mare
his grin drops
jake nervously grips the surcingle of the mare
neytiri holds its nose ring while jake clumsily mounts
jake bends one of its antennae down to the tip of his queue
he hesitantly touches them together and
tight shot the tendrils interweave
jakes pupils dilate and his mouth drops open
the horses eyes also go wide and it honks nervously
neytiri touches her fingertips to the neural interface
this is shahaylu the bond
feel her heartbeat her breath
feel her strong legs
jake closes his eyes nodding
one with the horse
tsutey and another young hunter come out of the forest leading two direhorses
the magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool
tsutey watches jakes riding lesson with disdain
you may tell her what to do she touches her head inside
for now say where to go
the horse launches into a gallop
jake flops around with no idea how to sit the animal and is promptly thrown off
he lands painfully in the mud
he gets up brushing mud off knees and ass as neytiri leads the horse back to him
series of jump cuts jake falls off the horse in various ways seemingly landing harder each time
on jake face down in the mud of the riverbank
he painfully rises to hands and knees
which is when he sees tsutey and another hunter thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses
spray blasts up from their hooves
jake stands covered in mud as tsutey stops his horse next to him looking down with disdain
you should go away
to neytiri i knew this guy could speak english
tsutey turns to neytiri who is leading the old mare back
this alien will learn nothing
a rock sees more
she sighs in agreement
tsutey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and thunder off into the woods
neytiri gestures to jakes horse
grouped around a table are jake colonel quaritch selfridge and few engineers and officers
jake is talking them through plans hes made of hometrees inner structure
youve got outer columns then a secondary ring here and an inner ring
then a core structure its like a spiral thats how they move up and down
im going to need accurate scans of all these columns
angle on max at the stairwell
hes been watching jake talking rapidly to quaritch but cant hear him
frowning he backs away down the stairs
jake grace and norm are packing science gear and supplies
im not about to let quaritch and selfridge micro manage this thing
she looks pointedly at jake were going up into the mountains
grace contd theres a mobile link up at site that we can work out of
the hallelujah mountains
off jakes look the legendary floating mountains of pandora
heard of them
a samson thunders over the rainforest climbing into the mist shrouded mountains
in the sealed cockpit norm is up front sitting left seat so trudy can talk him through the flight controls
jake and grace are behind them in the jump seats
grace and norms unconscious avatars ride in the open back compartment
it only takes tiny inputs
here put your hand on the cyclic she points to the stick between her knees
norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers
feel how small the moves are
you barely have to think it and the aircraft reacts
on norm reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady pilot
the samson is dwarfed by enormous arches of rock
see these magnetic formations
were getting close
yeah we are
look at my instruments
on the dash many of the displays are fritzing out
were in the flux vortex
ahead a cloud bank parts revealing the hallelujah mountains
right in front of them
jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy
jakes pov enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground
they are overgrown with rainforest and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them
waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom
on jake staring in amazement
it is both awe inspiring and disturbing
trudy turns grinning at jake
you should see your face
wide aerial the samson is tiny as it approaches the floating islands of rock
an archipelago among the clouds they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below
yeah so what does hold them up
grace explained it to me some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor or something
at least somebody understands it
just not me
a remote research station two shacks and a few clusters of instruments perched on a promontory near the hallelujah mountains
the shacks are airlift modules the size of buses
the samson lands beating the grass with its rotor wash
the humans hop out wearing masks
they move toward the shack taking in the spectacular panorama
norm and trudy assist jake with his chair as they cycle in through the airlock
grace is already inside starting the genny
she turns on the lights and equipment
there are bunks a clutter of science gear and through a short connecting corridor three link units in the second module
as grace powers up the link equipment jake stops to look at stereo still pictures which are taped and tacked up around her workstation
close on pictures grace posing at the school with various grinning children
there is one of her with two lanky girls a younger neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her
jake take number two its the least glitchy
norm i need you to operate jakes link
norm glares at jake as he passes
you got a problem
norm turns to grace his frustration boiling over
i trained three years for this mission
i speak the language fluently
he points at jake he falls off the frickin turnip truck and all of a sudden hes cultural ambassador
its not our choice norm
he glowers at jake
yeah well i didnt come out here to wash the dishes while youre on some interspecies booty call
he stalks off
he cant go far
she points to jakes link
lets get you in
looking down the central shaft of hometree meters to the ground
villagers are ant like
jake tries to keep up with neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur
he climbs the last section arriving out of breath beside her
she leads him outside onto a large branch
through gaps in the foliage jake can see other great trees scattered across the landscape like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest
neytiri strides out across the branch toward some kind of structure a web made of thick woven fiber
dark shapes clinging to it stir with a leathery rustling sound
neytiri makes a series of trills and clicks
one of the shapes moves toward them emerging into a shaft of sunlight
a huge mountain banshee
much larger than the forest banshees this thing is taller than a navi with a meter wingspan
a leathery fwhoop like the crack of sails as it alights on the branch right in front of her
do not look in her eye
neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat which it snatches and gulps down
she murmurs to it and strokes its neck
it lets out a signature shriek and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer
neytiri flip catches her queue and gently connects it to the banshees antenna
it shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made
ikran is not horse
once shahaylu is made ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life
she climbs smoothly onto the animals back
to become taronyu hunter you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you
when you are ready
the banshee shivers with anticipation
jake ducks as the great wings explode open and the banshee drops off the branch
it swoops down across the forest canopy banks hard lets out a cry and beats its wings in a power climb
completing the bank neytiri directs the banshee into a close swooping flyby and jake instinctively ducks
on neytiri flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount the rainforest rolling beneath her
stereo video log image jake has just switched on the camera
he looks tired
do i have to do this
i need some rack
grace behind him looks up from her microscope scowling
no now when its fresh
to camera the days are starting to blur together
the language is a bitch but i figure its like field stripping a weapon
jake and neytiri kneel together inside hometree
neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips
she touches her nose her ears her eyes in quick sequence
ontu mikyun nari
neytiri stands next to him correcting his position as he draws a longbow
barking commands she smacks him on the shoulder then the elbow repositioning him roughly
neytiri thinks im some kind of retard
human jake emerges from the link to see trudy and norm caught in the act on norms bunk
norm blushes and trudy waves pulling the blanket over their heads
norms attitude has improved lately
norm works with jake at the small table in the shack kitchen
norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation
youve gotta roll the r r r r oll it
norm makes jake repeat the word getting more frustrated
its good hes back on board but he thinks im a retard too
tracking with jakes feet as he runs over rocks leaping onto a thick root running on across the rough bark
my feet are getting tougher
i can run farther every day
neytiri leads him along a massive root and soon they are running meters above the ground
he sprints with her through the trees trying to keep up
she climbs and leaps with the ease of a spider monkey
i have to trust my body to know what to do
with neytiri its learn fast or die
neytiri leaps off into space falling falling until she catches an enormous palm leaf and gripping it allows its droop to slow her fall
she lets go plummeting and catches another
jake follows in a leap of faith
the camera plunges with him from leaf to leaf down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush
he drops down from the last leaf landing next to her on a game trail
he is exhilarated to still be alive
neytiri is surprised that he followed
that he lived
tight on human jake in the shack
thinking as he looks at the pictures of grace with the laughing kids at the school
in the commons avatar norm formally greets moat
the matriarch looks on as grace kneels to hug children she knows
graces eyes sparkle as she chats with them in navi
i sweet talked moat into giving norm and grace a hall pass
now grace even makes me coffee before link every morning
grace looks up to see neytiri approaching
it is an awkward moment between them
grace makes the formal gesture of greeting
navi subtitled i see you neytiri moatite
i see you doctor grace augustine
another day neytiri kneels on a game trail pointing out the tracks in the mud to jake
she touches the edges of the plants around her and sniffs the air
im learning to read the trails the tracks at the water hole the tiniest scents and sounds
jake and neytiri watch through a screen of leaves as a herd of huge armored sturmbeest walks through the shallows of a lake
in the middle of the herd the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents legs
one of the bulls trumpets and a flock of tetrapterons takes flight an explosion of purple wings
jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau
another place neytiri stands utterly still except for her ears which move with a life of their own
her eyes are closed
she speaks very softly to jake when you hear nothing you will hear everything
when you see nothing you will see everything
sometimes i have no idea what shes talking about
jake and neytiri creep quietly stalking a large male hexapede a six legged deer like creature
jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as neytiri watches
he takes a bead on the hexapede tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow then relaxes his arm
its been a month and im still not allowed to make a kill
she says the forest hasnt given permission
neytiri and jake crawl through the undergrowth
she points and he parts some leaves to see a mother viperwolf bringing meat to her cubs which frisk around her legs
she licks their faces
theres a lot of crap like that
shes always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of the animals and what not
video log image human jake talks into the lens
hes changing un shaven cheeks hollow
i just hope this treehugger shit isnt on the final
visible behind him grace is hunched over her samples
without looking up this isnt just about eye hand coordination out there
you need to listen to what she says
try to see the forest through their eyes
excuse me this is my video log here okay
neytiri and jake move through the night forest surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence
they move gracefully soundlessly two forest spirits
cu jake the pupils of his cat eyes dilated
the night forest floods his brain with its million bio sources
night shot from overhead jake and neytiri bow fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing anemones at the bottom of a pool
a large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow
jake drills it
he holds up the fish triumphantly
another day neytiri stands close behind jake adjusting his position as he draws his bow
only now her hands are gentle as they move on his arms his shoulders
aware of her touch jakes focus is broken
their eyes meet and she pulls away quickly
night they enter a clearing filled with chest high ferns
neytiri signals him to move slowly
they approach a creature on one of the ferns
an ugly stick like lizard thing perched on a frond
as he approaches snap
a long spine whips in a circle unfurling a bioluminescent membrane a disk a meter across opening like a chinese fan
it flies off a living frisbee
the fan lizard floats across the clearing
neytiri plunges among the ferns with a sharp cry
an explosion of color as dozens of fan lizards take flight
grinning widely she hops around like a little girl until they are all flying
and for the first time she is unguarded and joyful totally herself with him
inside the link jakes eyes open in the darkness
he doesnt know where he is
he weakly pushes open the lid blinking at the light
everything is backwards now
like out there is the true world and in here is the dream
tight on avatar jake silently drawing his bow his eyes focused in intense concentration
a beat the arrow flies
jake pulls the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede
he dispatches it with his knife
he speaks haltingly but with feeling in navi
i see you brother and thank you
your spirit goes with eywa your body stays behind to become part of the people
neytiri watches with approval
a clean kill
you are ready
lying in the link jake looks exhausted pale thin
norm helps grace get him to his chair
youre still losing weight
here she hands him a microwaved burrito
he looks at the now alien food
bites into it without enthusiasm
i made a kill today
we ate it
i know where that meal came from
you need to take care of this body
jake im serious you look like crap
youre burning too hard
jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out
get rid of this shit then you can lecture me
im telling you as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday to take some down time
tomorrow we leave for iknimaya
grace walks past jake starts making herself coffee
yeah youre gonna go ride a banshee
or die trying
thats right grace
this is what ive been working for
and this is your check up from the neck up marine
youre getting in way too deep
she turns away trust me i learned the hard way
jake scans the pictures tacked up around graces workstation
what did happen at the school
grace looks up from making coffee
her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children
neytiris sister sylwanin stopped coming to school
she was angry about the clear cutting
grace sips her coffee grimaces at the taste
one day she and a couple of other young hunters came running in all painted up theyd set a bulldozer on fire i guess they thought i could protect them
graces voice stays oddly calm as he tells this terrible story while getting milk out of the refrigerator
the troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse
macro as she pours the milk her hand is shaking
they killed sylwanin in the doorway
right in front of neytiri
then shot the others
i got most of the kids out before they shot me
jake realizes that grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it
a scientist stays objective we can not be ruled by emotion
but i poured ten years of my life into that school
they called me saatenuk
turning to him that kind of pain reaches back through the link
grace sits down at the table looks intently at jake
its a job
learn what you can but dont get attached
grace looks at him with real pain in her eyes
its not our world jake
and we cant stop whats coming
tsutey leads three direhorse riders up the trail two teenage hunters and jake whos riding well enough to keep up
the horses hooves clop right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon
iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven
its the test every young hunter has to pass
tsutey signals a stop
up slope ahead is an astounding formation
thick vine like trees have trapped large floating boulders of unobtanium in their gnarled grip
a hundred meters above them more boulders are woven into the twisted vine trunks
this is some sort of freak natural occurrence like the mythical beanstalk going up into the clouds
there is a thundering roar like an artillery barrage and the ground shakes
jake looks around at one of the floating mountains grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa
a huge rockfall is set loose
the mountain is drifting toward them filling half the sky
the hunters dismount
jake looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds
he turns to tsutey who is checking the young hunters gear
we doin this
jake leaps to catch up as tsutey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk
meters up the beanstalk the hunters nimbly climb along the vine trunks
they clamber over one of the unobtanium boulders which is lifting this incredible tree
jake looks down the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick
a chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it it floats upward
they reach the upper branches of the beanstalk
above them the craggy underbelly of mons veritatis looms
spray from one of the waterfalls hits them
some of the hanging vines are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss
one by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass
jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine his feet dangling over nothingness
they climb toward the floating islands above
tiny figures cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of mons veritatis
wide shot looking down a rock face bigger than half dome the sheer side of mons veritatis
banshees circle next to the cliffs flashing in shafts of sunlight
waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below
a waterfall thunders down into the void like a faucet of the gods
jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below a view from olympus
a shriek and the thwap thwap of leathery wings neytiris banshee swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto
she dismounts and like a falconer covers its eyes with a woven hood
it waits docile as she joins jake and the hunter party
tsutey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a cliff face
and jake sees the banshee rookery
hundreds of banshees huddle on rock out croppings as far as the eye can see
they cling to the walls with the fore claws on their wings or perch on ledges
jakesully will go first
tsutey smirks at jake a challenge in his eyes
the two teenage hunters are scared but trying to act tough
tsutey scowls when neytiri leads jake out onto the ledge
now you choose your ikran
this you must feel inside
if he also chooses you move quick like i showed
you will have one chance
how will i know if he chooses me
he will try to kill you
out of sight of tsutey neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it
jake feels a rush of emotion but she breaks away like it didnt happen
he is on his own on the ledge with the banshees
they eye him as he approaches
several shriek and take flight
others flap their wings and yawn showing rows of fangs in a threat display
jake unrolls a weighted leather strap like a one ended bolo
a large male spreads enormous wings shrieks and glares straight at him
jake looks directly into its eyes and strides toward it
the challenged banshee hisses and leaps at him jaws wide as jake times the lunge swinging the bolo feinting and then slipping aside as the banshees jaws miss him snapping
jake whaps the bolo across its snout
the weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws tying them shut
a muffled scream and it slashes at his stomach with razor talons but
jake is already leaping over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck
it topples on its side and he swarms it arms around its thrashing head
jake grabs its whip like antenna and brings it toward his queue but the bony head slams sideways and bam
clocks him right in the face almost knocking him out and it writhes flinging him to the ground
he slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as neytiri gasps
tsutey laughs and yells mockingly
the bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head way pissed off now but jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it
claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and clamps down hard
they flop to the ground and he scrambles on top pinning it and grabs its whipping antenna locks it under his arm and jams the end of his queue into
they fuse together and the banshee stops struggling
it lies there panting
they are locked together literally eye to eye
ecu banshee the pupil like a deep black well
jake relaxes his grip and slowly warily slides his leg over the creatures back
neytiri runs to him
first flight seals the bond
you cannot wait
jake sits astride the creature feeling its power
he grips a hank of the beasts main and heeeyyyaaaah
the banshee is off like a shot
jake screams as they plummet off the cliff the banshee wails and
they fall together spiralling out of control and he is almost tossed lose
the thing is squawking and shrieking so much he cant think
shut the hell up
it levels out
jake cocks his head only thinking bank left and the animal complies
he settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings while he catches his breath
neytiris banshee falls into formation with him
she signals follow me and dives
jake guides his banshee clumsily after her
neytiris banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips while jakes wobbles and dips almost falling out of the sky
the camera swoops after them as neytiri leads an arcing dive around the flank of mons veritatis
the scenery is stunning
they pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines
neytiri leads jake in a sharp bank skimming close to the cliffs
they punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight
jake is getting the hang of it
he jinks left then right then dives tucking himself tight against the animals back
hes reckless fearless
half in control and loving it
neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long whoop of joy
neytiri squats with jake using her hands to explain flight principles like one fighter pilot to another
looking down a sheer cliff
jake and neytiri dive their mounts straight down past camera pulling out and soaring into a series of aerobatic turns
i may not be much of a horse guy
but i was born to do this
they fly in close formation with tsutey and the young hunters banshees flashing through scarves of mist
jake dives playing hide and seek with neytiri among the clouds
they are wild and free in a wild world
she grins and banks hard diving catch me if you can
he dives after her
in the grotto by firelight jakes banshee snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back
hes teaching it to take the food more slowly
he strokes its long head
tsutey is nearby with the young hunters
he eyes jake with frustrated hostility
another day jake and neytiri fly abreast soaring easily
she points and jake sees a bizarre geological formation
arches of magnetic rock form rainbows of stone above a deep caldera
in the center of the caldera is a single enormous willow tree gnarled and ancient
this we will be told is the well of souls
jake flies with neytiri along a forested ridge
she is teaching him to hunt from his banshee
they carry their bows at the ready scanning below them for prey
a huge shadow covers him and neytiri shouts a warning
jake looks up to see a leonopteryx in a delta dive whistling straight at him
like a banshee only several times larger it is the king predator of the air the great leonopteryx
striped scarlet yellow and black with a midnight blue crested head it is both gorgeous and terrifying
the hunter has become the prey
jake snap rolls and dives toward the forest canopy
he plummets into the gloom as k crash the leonopteryx tears through foliage following him down both diving like missiles and jake yanks into a hair pin bank right through
a gap between two huge branches forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud fwoosh of wings
it banks away with a frustrated shriek
two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone back above the canopy
close on the leonopteryx as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling screech which echoes among the mountains
the lord of its domain
on jake shaken
neytiri flies up her expression the navi equivalent of oh my god
a beat they both crack up
jake ponders images grace has called up at her workstation science graphics of the leonopteryx
trudy and norm are crowded around as well
the great leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator
not only rare but the sightings tend not to get reported
trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb
there usually isnt time to key the mike
the people call it toruk
last one you ever see
i saw one take out a gunship once wham
total frickin yard sale
ate the crew like peanuts
time cut grace is scanning through images and jake stops her on one a d aerial shot of the strange arched formation
vitraya ramunong the well of souls
its their most sacred place
she moves the virtual camera and we seem to fly around the well of souls catching only a glimpse of the interior
something big is going on in there biologically
id die to get samples but outsiders are strictly forbidden
time cut jake looks through the pressure window at human grace and norm outside
wearing masks they are taking readings from some time series experiments grace has set up
as trudy watches jake works fast to download graces images of the well of souls onto a memory chip
theyre coming back
jake pulls the chip then hesitates
torn by what he is doing
if you dont give him something hes gonna shut us down
he hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her flight suit just as grace and norm enter from the airlock
jake stares up at the totem skull which we now recognize as that of a great leonopteryx
neytiri watches as he reaches up to touch the tall indigo crest
my grandfathers grandfather was toruk macto rider of last shadow
toruk chose him
it has only happened five times since the time of the first songs
thats a long time
neytiri takes his hand because thats what the navi do when theyre telling you something important
toruk macto was mighty he brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow
all navi people know this story
push in slowly on the skull totem then jake neytiri and other flying hunters swoop low above a herd of sturmbeest a rapids of thundering muscle
dust rises from this living river like steam from a pythons back
tracking with the herd
a hunter appears in fg astride a direhorse at full gallop
the sight is breathtaking
he hurls a meter spear and one of the sturmbeest crashes down flipping twice from momentum
jake rolls in like a fighter jet his banshee screaming
he draws and fires his bow
the arrow strikes true in the plexus between the armored shoulders and the beast crashes to the ground
skids to a stop in a cloud of dust
neytiri swoops in next to jake arms raised and grinning wolfishly
cu tsutey banking around jakes kill
jake looks up and tsutey salutes in grudging admiration
the central space is lit by a bonfire around which the hunt festival is in full swing
people gnawing on massive sturmbeest ribs
a bowl of some kava like intoxicant is passed around
neytiri dances in a flowing costume as the banshee spirit
norm is dancing seductively with his own tail
jake surrounded by young hunters acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands
the leaping fire light plays across the eye sockets of the toruk skull bringing it to life
it seems to watch jake
tsutey squats next to jake the usual scowl on his face
jake braces himself and tsutey holds up the kava bowl offering it to him
a challenge or an olive branch
jake takes a long hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm
watch that stuff
itll knock you into next week
jake offers the bowl back to tsutey
they lock eyes
later an empty bowl drops landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire
wider on jake and tsutey sitting amid the rowdy hunters
tsutey looks a little blearily at jake
finally he grins
i thought enough drink you would not be so ugly
tsutey looks deep into the fire
your warriors hide inside machines fight from far away
he looks at jake i did not think a sky person could be brave
before jake can answer neytiris lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them
she takes jake by the hand and pulls him up you must dance
it is the way
tsutey watches as she leads him away his face darkening the moment of connection to jake lost to anger
the hunters whoop and cheer as jake joins the circle of dancers
jake takes graces hand and pulls her up protesting
jake lets the drums and chanting flow through him
he lets himself go dancing from the inside channeling the primal energy
grace is rocking out grinning
we see the young girl so repressed who lives within her
jake and neytiri flow amongst the dancers but they are looking only at each other
a couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them
moat and eytukan follow their look seeing the obvious connection
we cannot let this seed grow
her path is with tsutey
on jake dancing with abandon to the primal beat eyes locked with neytiri
wide vista mist blowing through the treetops as the morning sun burns it away
a spectacular panorama of a vast primeval land
up angle tracking among the trees the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral
its hard to put in words the deep connection the people have to the forest
high in the branches of a tree jake watches as neytiri gently bends a large pitcher like flower toward her sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey
an incredibly sensuous image
they see a network of energy that flows through all living things
they know that all energy is only borrowed macro shot of a purple flower beaded with raindrops
a blue hand picks the flower
and one day you have to give it back
looking down into a hole dug among tree roots
the body of an old omaticaya woman lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth
the purple flower is gently placed on her body joining flowers totems and beads
moat recites a prayer as neytiri acting as acolyte places a woodsprite a seed of the great tree on the body
earth is poured over the lens and we cut to
jake waking up in the link
dark as a coffin
he pushes the lid off letting in light and lies there
he looks pale and haggard with a scraggly beard
hard to believe its only been three months
jake sits in front of the video log camera late at night
it is many log entries later
he has lost a lot of weight
he looks like a junkie watching a test pattern
to the lens i can barely remember my old life
im not sure who i am anymore
under a sky of thunderheads the forest is a dark wall beyond the fence
selfridge wearing an exopack tees up while grace and jake approach from the direction of the ops center
good of you to stop by
hows it going out there
our blue friends all packed up yet
selfridge swings his driver with good form
see i keep hooking it
its the damn pack
the ball drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
a trooper walks over to retrieve it
the low gravity and the high air density cancel out so you called us back to report you want to hear it or not
jake is making incredible progress years worth in just a few months
but we need more time
not what i was hoping to hear
it starts to rain
selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open
parker its their ancestral home
theyve lived there since before human history began
you can spare them a few more weeks
this thing is inevitable
what does it matter when it happens
im sorry dr
youre out of time
he leaves them standing there to get drenched
a break table under a harsh overhead light
quaritch pulls up a chair turns it around and sits astride it facing jake
he studies jakes pale sunken face
the scraggly beard
youre not gettin lost in the woods are you son
jake cant meet his eyes
your last report was two weeks ago
im starting to doubt your resolve
from what i see its time to terminate this mission
jake eyes flare with alarm
i can do this
look youve given me plenty of usable intel
like this well of souls place ive got them by the balls with that when it turns into a shit fight
which it will
jake feels hollow inside knowing what hes done
so youll get your legs back like i promised
puts his hand on jakes its time to come in
jake ponders this
isnt this what he was doing all this for
ive gotta finish this thing
theres one more test the dream hunt
its the final stage of becoming a man
then im one of them
theyll trust what i say
its hard for him to even form these words and i can negotiate the terms of their relocation
then you need to get it done corporal
strange horizontal lightning branches through the floating mountains twisted by the magnetic fields
the sky is black and heavy with clouds
jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot looking pretty strung out
grace is smoking furiously
jake i cant allow this
youre just not strong enough
its the last door im going through it
you can help me or get out of the way
jake pushes past her toward the corridor grabbing him will you listen to me
sometimes the navi themselves die in these vision quests
the venom takes you to the edge of death
grace contd and the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm we have no idea what thatll do in an avatar brain
jake breaks free and wheels away down the corridor
grace follows jake as he crosses to the link
a sheet of lightning flashes across the sky outside
norm is initializing the link
she puts her hands on his shoulders
no matter what you prove out there you are still in here
shaking him right here
i have to go all the way become one of goddammit jake you can never be one of them
norm looks up startled at the vehemence in grace voice
our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain
you visit and you leave
during this jake pulls himself from his wheelchair levering himself into the link hauling his useless legs inside
you can never truly be with her
jake stops pinioned by the truth
he seems suddenly very lost
you know why im here
because quaritch sent me
thats right to embed with the omaticaya
to find out how to screw them out of their home
by deceit or by force he didnt care
and if it turned out to be force then how best to do it
norm is in shock
but grace is eerily calm
and what about now jake
im not that guy any more
shes been on his journey every step of the way
but if i tell quaritch the truth he yanks me out i never see her again
and if i tell her the truth the clan throws me out thats if they dont cut my heart out and show it to me
jake looks hopelessly at the two of them
in his own perfect hell
they wont understand what youve done
they dont even have a word for lie they had to learn it from us
grace sees he is on the verge of tears
lost and alone between worlds
i taught it to them
ive gotta go
link is ready
grace stops him as he tries to close the lid
you cant carry this burden much longer
smiling wanly its okay
moat says an alien mind probably cant survive the dream hunt anyway
grace closes the lid
it feels like closing a coffin
she watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar somewhere out in the night
to norm prep my link
im going in
jake sits eyes closed as neytiri and another young hunter paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron the dream hunt
when your spirit animal comes you will know
their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer
grace stands with the crowd at the ramp to hometrees lowest level
jake barely sees her as he goes down the spiral
she tries to follow but is barred by a hunter
below seemingly in the womb of the earth jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters
an elder is slowly rapping a large water drum
time cut moat purifies him with smoke from burning herbs chanting in a low monotone
jake squatting washes the smoke over himself with his palms
macro moats fingers unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes
she catches the end of a glowing purple worm and draws it out of the wood
oh wise worm eater of the sacred tree bless this worthy hunter with a true vision
moat places the worm on jakes out stretched tongue
it twists on itself lighting his mouth before he closes it
she indicates he should chew
macro an earthen jar is opened
eytukan removes a writhing black arachnoid the pandoran equivalent of a scorpion
he places it against the back of jakes neck and presses
the insect drives its stinger into jakes skin and jake grimaces
moat and eytukan step back leaving jake alone in the circle
neytiri watches intently joining in the low chant
slow dolly in on jake
his eyes open
he looks around at the faces they seem to transform becoming threatening
jake looks down at the palms of his hands
jakes pov his hands recede his whole body the ground and instantly the circle of navi recedes as if to a distant horizon leaving vast ground in between
space is utterly distorted and sound as well echoing thunderous
ecu jake pupils dilated black
he looks around and the onlookers are gone replaced by a ring of glowing trees which seem miles high
the whole image is bathed in spectral radiance
jake looks down jakes pov his body and hands transforming fingers stretching into tendrils legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to
the roots of the trees and cut to reality jake is on his hands and knees puking in the dirt
he contorts crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but in his vision jake stands serene on a floating mountain cliff
a great black shadow covers him the unmistakable x silhouette of a diving leonopteryx
the last shadow
camera screams down on him as the shadow grows larger we rush into his face into the blackness of his pupil which fills the universe and
real jake writhes in the dirt his back arched as his muscles seize
he foams and thrashes his eyes rolled back in his head while inside time itself has accelerated clouds scream around the mountain tops mist boils through the forest
he feels the wind of time blowing through him as real jake claws the ground moaning staring blindly while inside in pov he flies over the landscape of pandora but
the forest is blasted
fires flicker among trees that are burned black and lifeless in a smoky twilight
a great winged shadow is cast below rippling over the devastated ground
avatar jake looks down at the shadow
realizes he is casting it and we rush in to his pupil and pull back from the eye of a great leonopteryx flying lordly and terrible over the land
it lets out an almighty shriek which seems to echo to eternity and slam cut to jake on his back gasping back in his body
he weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room
it is finished
neytiris face is flooded with relief
the faces of the clan elders look at jake expectantly
did your spirit animal come
jake looks from eytukan to moat tsutey and the elders
how can he tell them what he has seen
moat puts her splayed fingers against his face seeming to peer into his troubled soul
to jake something has come
to the others subtitled it will take time for the meaning to be clear
she steps back and eytukan motions for jake to stand
he gets up weakly
outside the enclosure eytukan emerges with jake and the others
the entire clan is gathered waiting to hear what has happened
jake looks up at the leonopteryx skull totem which seems to stare down at him
grace watches her eyes brimming
eytukan places both hands on jakes chest and holds them there
you are now a son of the omaticaya
you are part of the people
all the members of the clan press forward crowding around and putting their hands on jakes shoulders back chest hands upon hands until he is connected to everyone
jake and neytiri run silhouetted in the night
behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light
polyphemus rises behind the trees
neytiri dives from a rock slicing into a mirror of water
jake follows her and underwater they swim over glowing anemones
they seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes
tiny purple fish swirl around them
their hands come together fingers twining as they float weightlessly as if between worlds
laughing they run together into a stand of willows
their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai
long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains
underfoot a bed of moss glows faintly
it reacts to their footsteps with expanding rings of light
it is an exquisitely beautiful spot
the willows stir responding to their presence
she holds up her hands letting the tendrils caress her
this is a place for prayers to be heard
and sometimes answered
jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers his palms his forearms
his eyes go wide
we hear the whispering of ancient navi voices
its like a sound you feel
we call this utraya mokri the tree of voices
the voices of our ancestors who live within eywa
a few woodsprites circle around them some alighting on their shoulders and arms
they stand very close together now
her eyes are intense almost luminous
he feels drawn into them
but she pulls back a little
you are omaticaya now
you may make your own bow from the wood of hometree
she looks away and you may choose a woman
the amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual
jake suppresses a smile
we have many fine women
ninat is the best singer i dont want ninat
there is beyral she is a good hunter jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her
ive already chosen
but this woman must also choose me
she takes his hands and their fingers intertwine moving gently over each other
she already has
he puts his face close to hers
she rubs her cheek against his
he kisses her on the mouth
they explore each other
then she pulls back eyes sparkling
kissing is very good
but we have something better
she pulls him down until they are kneeling facing each other on the faintly glowing moss
neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it
jake does the same with trembling anticipation
the tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own straining to be joined
macro shot the tendrils intertwine with gentle undulations
jake rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers
the ultimate intimacy
they come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss and ripples of light spread out around them
the willows sway without wind and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we dissolve to later
she is collapsed across his chest
he strokes her face tenderly
neytiri you know my real body is far away sleeping
she raises up placing her fingertips to his chest this body is real
she touches his forehead this spirit is real
her eyes are luminous honest infinitely deep
when i was first your teacher i hated all sky people
but you have also taught me
spirit is all that matters
she lays her head down against his chest listening to his heartbeat
i am with you now jake
we are mated for life
it is our way
i forgot to tell
he rouses up making her look at him
really we are
jake considers this
he lays his head down and her arms enfold him sheltering him as he sleeps
jakes eyes open in the darkness
he just lies there thinking
in his coffin
in another world
dawn breaks in the sacred glade
shafts of orange morning light
jake and neytiri asleep in each others arms
maxfield parrish painting
but then the roar of engines
neytiri awakens with a start
the splintering crackling of forest being crushed under enormous treads gets louder
she watches in growing horror as the blade of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows
she shakes jake shouting at him in navi to wake up
where ever you are come back to me now
human jake is in a hurry to get back to the link
grace still groggy chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs
here eat this
id hate to have to force feed a cripple
she slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the plate under his nose
shes not going anywhere
he sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs
neytiri screams as the willows begin to fall before the blade to be ground under the treads
avatar jake is directly in the path
she tries to lift him but he is too heavy
she is screaming at him frantically trying to wake him as jake adjusts himself in the link chair
he hands grace the empty plate
and when was the last time you took a shower
jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down
avatar jake wakes up to see neytiri dragging him screaming
he leaps up as the dozer pushes inexorably into the glade splintering the trees plowing the earth before it
jake runs into the path of the bulldozer waving his arms
he positions himself where the camera eyes of the robotic juggernaut will see him
close on monitor jake shouts but theres no sound feed
wider as the tractor operator sees him and pulls back on the remote throttles
he yells to his supervisor
hey i got one of the natives blockin my blade here
this attracts the attention of selfridge who comes over to the workstation
on the screen jake in his omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint is unrecognizable
to selfridge what do we do
these people have to learn that we dont stop
tight on throttles as the operator pushes them forward
on the screen jake stumbles back tripping disappears below the blade for a second reappears running to the side
jake grabs a rock and leaps onto the dozer
he climbs quickly to the camera mast
the rock crashes into the lens of the camera
jake beats the rock furiously against it pounding it to junk
close on monitor as jakes demonic face is replaced by noise
he pulls back on the throttles
the juggernaut grinds to a stop
but the roar of engines continues because more dozers and tractors advance nearby crushing the forest before them
trees are slashed down by the plasma cutters
terrified animals flee before the onslaught
powersuits and troopers stride through the ravaged forest blasting anything that moves
a trooper sees jake on the dozer
he rips off a burst and rounds clang into metal as jake dives off the machine
he grabs neytiri and they run into concealing foliage
from behind a screen of leaves they watch as the dozers advance obliterating the sacred site leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path
cu neytiri stunned by the nightmarish unfathomable wrongness of it
she sobs as the willows die
minutes later the operator is playing back the cameras feed for quaritch and the others
freeze it right there
on monitor the image expands until jakes face is clear frozen in an animal snarl
son of a bitch
push in on quaritch as his jaw clenches in cold fury
he turns and strides toward the door shouting to his watch commander as he passes
get me a pilot
a raiding party of hunters their bodies painted raise weapons overhead
avatar grace watches with growing alarm
tsutey will lead the war party
tsutey steps forward face full of hate raising a war cry among the hunters
please this will only make it worse you do not speak here
jake and neytiri cross the commons toward them
jake feels all eyes turn toward him
he takes her arm stopping her
to neytiri low okay listen
theres something i have to tell you
its gonna be hard
i just need you to he sees tsutey striding toward them his face a mask of fury
tsutey walks right up and slams jake in the chest with both hands
it is so unexpected that jake topples on his ass
you mated with this woman
he reaches out for neytiri
she goes to him clutching his hand
is this true
we are mated before eywa
it is done
tsutey turns to moat and eytukan his face anguished
neytiri was promised to me
everything is changing
everything is being destroyed
tsutey points at jake his pain shifting to rage
these aliens kill everything they touch like poison
if you choose this path you can never be tsahik
your life will be wasted
neytiri looks at her mother sees the grief in her eyes
i have chosen
tsutey draws his knife and yeeeeeaaa
lunges at jake whos ready this time he sidesteps blocking the knife and elbows tsutey hard in the face
tsutey reels back nose bleeding
he starts forward on a second attack but eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around
this is not a proper challenge
tsutey glares at jake while sheathing his knife
i challenge you
jake dont i accept
quaritch rides left seat as trudy pilots through the mountains
she glances at him then toggles the aircom
loveshack this is samson one six inbound hot to your pos
i have colonel quaritch with me and but quaritch slams the switch cutting her off
did i tell you to announce us
sorry sir its procedure
norm punches buttons on the comms console
samson one six
no answer crap
he looks helplessly at jake and graces link units no way to warn them
tsutey and jake square off
each holds a long solid staff
the entire clan crowds around them in a circle
what the hell are you doing
its the only way to get him to goddamn listen
tsutey leaps at jake with a sharp cry and jake parries with his staff
the staves clack off each other as the two combatants leap duck and strike furiously
tsutey sweeps jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the ankles but jake rolls out of it and catches tsutey in the belly with the blunt end
trudys samson lands
quaritch and a posse of troopers jump down and rush the shack
tsutey wades in with a series of short sharp blows
jake swings with equal fury
both fighting from the heart
the staves whistle through the air and clack together like gunshots
jake presses hard and tsutey staggers back stumbling as jake lands a solid hit dropping him to his knees just as the inner door bangs open and quaritch stomps toward
graces link controls
hey hang on you cant interrupt a link in progress its dangerous wait
quaritch shoves him aside and smacks his fist down on the power switch
graces unit goes dead and avatar graces eyes roll back and she keels over
neytiri barely catches her before she hits the ground
jake parries as tsutey swings but then jakes eyes go blank just as k rack
tsutey puts one alongside his head
jake sprawls completely inert
tsutey pokes him with his staff then raises it and lets out a piercing victory cry
jake slams open the link amped from the fight furious are you out of your goddamn mind
you crossed a line
quaritch punches him hard
jake flops back dazed
the troopers yank him out and zip tie his wrists
tsutey draws his knife and bends down grabbing jake by the hair
this is a demon in a false body
it should not live
he puts his knife to jakes throat but neytiri blind sides him at full tilt
tsutey sprawls rolls comes up to see neytiri crouched like a lioness over jake her knife and teeth bared her ears flattened
she snarls with primal fury
tsutey stands panting
he pushes through the crowd and walks away calling for his hunters
tight on monitor showing jakes avatar face on the dozer camera as he pounds a rock into the lens
the shot freezes on jakes animal snarl
wider human jake sits bruised and bleeding watching himself on the monitor
grace and norm stand nearby rubbing their wrists where the zip ties bit in
selfridge and quaritch watch with disdain
you let me down son
you got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for
jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare
parker listen there may still be time to shut your fucking hole
grace is momentarily stunned by quaritchs fury
but she meets it with her own intensity not backing down an inch
or what ranger rick
you gonna shoot me
to selfridge you need to muzzle your dog
can we just take this down a couple notches please
to quaritch you say you want to keep your people alive
start by listening to her
jake nods to grace to continue
to selfridge this is bad parker
those trees were sacred to the omaticaya in a way you cant imagine
you know what
you throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern
im not talking about pagan voodoo here im talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest
which is what exactly
graces nerve fails
a rush of conflicting emotions the need to act to do something colliding with her scientific rigor
to jake i cant do this
how am i supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate
just tell him what you know in your heart
she turns to parker steeling herself
alright look i dont have the answers yet im just now starting to even frame the questions
what we think we know is that theres some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees
like the synapses between neurons
each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it and there are ten to the twelfth trees on pandora thats a lot im guessing
thats more connections than the human brain
you get it
its a network a global network
and the navi can access it they can upload and download data memories at sites like the one you destroyed
what the hell have you people been smoking out there
you need to wake up parker
the wealth of this world isnt in the ground its all around us
the navi know that and theyre fighting to defend it
if you want to share this world with them you need to understand them
we understand them just fine
thanks to jake here
jake shares a look of alarm with grace as quaritch selects a new clip on the main monitor tight on monitor video log image of jake looking haggard and borderline
deranged rambling in a late night monologue
theyre not going to give up their home theyre not gonna make a deal
lite beer and shopping channel
theres nothing we have that they want
were a horror to them
were the monsters from space
jake watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love
theyre never going to leave hometree
quaritch freezes the recording
since a deal cant be made it gets real simple
to jake icily so thanks
im getting all emotional
i might just give you a big wet kiss
parker we have to talk like rational people
well id cherish that but unfortunately youre out of here on the next shuttle
all of you
im shutting down the avatar program effective now
on jake grace and norm speechless
a wall of fire
silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in slow motion spears and bows held high
monitor screen image wainfleet pans a camera across the smoldering hulks of burned dozers
the toppled remains of a charred ampsuit
dead troopers bristling with arrows
they hit with banshees first
set the ampsuit on fire
quaritch and selfridge look on grimly
the rest of the squad
six bodies thats all of em
and the equipment is totalled
selfridge is stares soberly as quaritch outlines the plan
i can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous
well clear them out with gas first
itll be humane
more or less
selfridge sighs and rubs his face
hey dont go limp on me now
this is exactly the incident we needed
alright lets pull the trigger
max and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment under the watchful eye of armed sec ops troopers
jake grace norm stare bleakly at each other
they bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response
theyre fabricating this war to get what they want
i cant believe that
thats how its done
when people are sitting on shit you want you make them your enemy
then youre justified in taking it
trudy runs into the lab breathless
shes wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet
sec ops is rolling the gunships
theyre gonna hit hometree
were spooling up now
i gotta go
jake pumps furiously toward the door grace following
selfridge surveys the airfield where crews swarm over the gunships loading ordnance
he turns as jake and grace charge toward him
these are people youre about to theyre fly bitten savages who live in a tree
look around i dont know about you but i see a lot of trees
they can move
for gods sake there are children in there
look selfridge you dont want this kind of blood on your hands
let me try to talk them out
they trust me
on selfridge considering this
selfridge and an escort of armed troopers accompany jake and grace to the links
the two enter their units as norm and max prep the system
youve got one hour
unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down you get them to evacuate
jake lowers the upper clamshell
norm starts the sequence
the entire clan is gathered with eytukan and moat presiding
jake looks around feeling the gaze of the people upon him
he steels himself and speaks in clear navi
eytukan i have something to say to everyone
a great evil is upon us
the sky people are coming to destroy hometree
they will be here soon
a murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd
you have to leave or you will die
are you certain of this
they sent me here to learn your ways
so one day i could bring this message and you would believe it
what are you saying jake
you knew this would happen
he is unable to meet her eyes
at first it was just orders
then everything changed
i fell in love with the forest with the omaticaya people he looks at her with you
and by then how could i tell you
neytiri can barely breathe
she is shaking with the enormity of it her voice cracking with rage and pain i trusted you jake
please i only wanted to you will never be one of the people
tsutey yells to his hunters bind them
they grab jake who doesnt resist
others seize grace
both are driven to their knees and their arms bound
scorpion gunships darken the sky as they come over the tops of the trees
at the head of the formation is one much larger ship a monster feet long the general dynamics quaritch next to the pilot of the dragon surveys the world below
like napoleon astride his horse
jake and grace are lashed to posts at the front entrance to hometree
the people look up as the dragon and its escort of gunships arrive over the trees
the down blast from their rotors creates a maelstrom of flying leaves and debris
in the dragon cockpit quaritch watches a targeting screen a telescopic image of jake and grace tied to posts
well id say diplomacy has failed
tsutey and another hunter hold knives to the throats of the two avatars glaring defiantly at the gunships
i think they mean to cut their throats if we dont back off
make sure you get a nice close up of that
i can tack it onto the after action report
jake yells to neytiri tsutey the others gathered nearby
you have to get out of hometree
run to the forest
please im begging you
eytukan scowls at jake then grabs tsutey and yells take the ikran
attack from above
tsutey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of hometree
in the cockpit quaritch grows impatient
alright lets get this done
give me forty millimeter gas rounds right in the front door
on the dragons stub wings the mm rocket launchers open up with a barrage of leaping fire which flashes down and k whoom
the inside of hometree erupts with multiple explosions of teargas
the gas rolls across the confused villagers
they begin to cough and gag
eytukan and the remaining hunters bravely fire at the gunships with their longbows
in the dragons cockpit quaritch laughs as arrows clink against the armored windows
amid clouds of teargas the omaticaya run stumble collapse
yelling subtitled everybody outside
go to the forest
the villagers pour out of hometree
everyone is yelling
piercing screams in the boiling gas
jake eyes streaming struggles with his bindings
an incendiary round explodes inside the commons
flames roar through the base of hometree
inside hometree it is a burning smoky hell
flames roar up the inside like a chimney
stragglers scramble outside coughing and dragging wounded with them
high up in the trunk tsutey and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke climbing barely ahead of the fireball
outside the fire is driven by the rotor wash toward jake and grace who are still bound tightly to the posts
out of the smoke moat appears in front of jake
she raises a knife and slashes downward
jake looks down surprised to see his bonds falling away
he meets her eyes which are filled with horror but also something else
call it faith
you are one of us
jake takes the knife and cuts grace free
weve gotta move
hes gonna blow the columns
as grace realizes what he means he grabs her and they run
around them the omaticaya flee in horror and confusion
in the cockpit quaritch watches as the omaticaya stream away from the great tree running along roots and branches
thats how you scatter the roaches
okay switch missiles
give me h es at the base of the west columns
copy switching missiles
in trudys samson she hears the other pilots acknowledging quaritchs order
she takes her finger off the fire control and pulls her aircraft out of formation
pushing in on quaritch the hometree reflecting in his glasses
bring it down
missiles stream down from the dragon and the other gunships and the base of hometree vanishes in a chain of high explosive blasts
the massive pillars fragment into matchsticks and the omaticaya watch in horror as hometree groans and starts to move
in a cacophony of cracking splintering roots the mighty tree topples with agonizing slowness
at the banshee eyrie tsutey and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight
they swoop among the branches as the tree the one fixed thing in their lives moves
it crashes down through the forest canopy crushing the lesser trees in its path falling ponderously
hometree hits the ground like the end of the world raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris
in the dragon cockpit quaritch surveys the destruction
nice work people
alright lets light it up
incendiaries launch from the gunships exploding into gouts of fire in the debris of hometree
the gunships fan the flames through the trees like a fire storm
the omaticaya retreat as a wall of fire advances
jake searches for neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks
grace is gathering crying children and herding them away from the fire storm
neytiri stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the inferno
she sees eytukan
a large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear
he recognizes her as she kneels over him
daughter take my bow
protect the people
in his last living moment he places his bow in her hands
she collapses over him her face crumpling in grief
jake reels out of the smoke
kneels next to her
im sorry she shoves him away and stands screaming at him as tears stream down her face
get away from me jake
never come back
jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her fathers body
sparks and smoke swirl around him
he watches as netyiri kneels grieving
slumped over clutching her stomach
keening like an animal
slow motion jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest
i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace
sooner or later though you always have to wake up
selfridge watches a video feed of the destruction on one of the monitors
max and norm stare in shock
pull the plug
a trooper crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the the strings are cut
jake flops to the ground limp
elsewhere in the smoky hell grace slumps unconscious
the crying kids pull at her
moat leading a group of omaticaya comes upon the scene
she grabs the kids and pulls them away leaving graces avatar helpless in the path of the flames
she hesitates then bring her
then the top clamshell of jakes unit is yanked upward and troopers grab him zip tie his wrists as we on a hillside a grieving neytiri stands with moat and
the omaticaya refugees
two hunters pull graces avatar on a travois
they watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below
a great pall of smoke darkens the landscape
jake grace and norm are in a common holding cell
they sit staring in silence
too wired to sleep too emotionally drained to move
they never wanted us to succeed
at the desk outside the lone trooper looks up as trudy approaches along the corridor pushing a stainless steel trolley
personally i think steaks too good for these traitors
they get steak
let me see that the guard bends to look into the hot cart and the muzzle of trudys pistol presses behind his ear
shoving him down all the way down pendejo
she whistles and max trots around the corner
trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip ties as max grabs his key card and runs to the cell
swipes the card
the door is rolling open when another trooper rounds the corner
trudy takes him down with a sharp blow to the windpipe and a thai knee to the ribs
meanwhile the first trooper is getting up but max clocks him heartily with a coffee urn
he goes down and stays down
that was unexpectedly satisfying
trudy plants a kiss on norm as he runs out of the cell
baby you rock
jake wheels out grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper as trudy binds his wrists
to max and trudy thanks
jake faces his motley group chambering a round
so what do you say
time for a revolution
trudy grins and taps his fist
in the utility corridor under the base jake pumps the chair furiously as the others jog
they reach an airlock and start donning exopacks
to trudy get your ship fired up
she grabs norm and enters the airlock
jake turns to max
i need somebody on the inside i can trust
jake grips his hand tightly
in the samson norm is helping trudy race through the preflight checks as the turbines spool up
a light hits them
an armored trooper approaches aiming his ar at them
i need you to shut down and step out of the vehicle
jake rolls up behind him aiming his pistol
take it nice and easy troop
the trooper turns sees the gun
on the ground face down
hands behind your head
the trooper hesitates
do what he goddamn says
norm jumps down and grabs the troopers rifle and side arm covering him while grace helps jake from chair to the back bay of the chopper
she throws his chair in and jumps in herself
quaritch watching a monitor sees whats happening down at the airfield
he slams his palm down on an alarm button
he draws his pistol
strides toward the emergency door
he undogs it
holding his breath quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides onto the outer landing
inside people scramble for masks
the samson lifts off in a blast of rotor wash just as quaritch opens fire and rounds rake the ship
trudy banks hard using the bottom to shield them
bullets whack into the ship as she climbs out over the tree line
jakes fist pumps the air exultantly
oh yeah baby
he looks over at grace and freezes
she is looking down at a bloody hand
she clutches her abdomen covering the spreading stain
looks at jake wide eyed
this is gonna ruin my whole day
hang on grace
norms avatar with an ar slung over his shoulder stands on the roof of the link module
he gives a thumbs up signal
the lift cable goes taut and the shack lifts off the ground
trudys samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow straining to lift the module on a long line sling
the shack sways as trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper into the hallelujah mountains
outside the windows clouds and cliffs pass by lit by polyphemus
jake is yanking stuff out of the samsons trauma bag while grace lies curled across two back seats hugging her blood soaked abdomen
she is pale and shocky
trudy is flying on visual only by the light of polyphemus
her instruments are showing gibberish
well at least they wont be able to track us up here
not this deep in the vortex
its strongest at the well of souls right
good cause thats where were going
he gives grace an ampule of morphine for the pain
im gonna get you some help grace
forget it it doesnt matter
jake grabs her shoulders
the people can help you
i know it
dawn light paints the massive arches of magnetic rock above the well of souls
tiny as an insect the samson passes
the well of souls
the heart of the forest
i knew the people would go there
the well of souls is a deep caldera meters across
it is ringed with enormous willows whose roots seem to pour down the sheer rock walls like candle wax
at the bottom in a natural amphitheater the omaticaya refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping which forms a kind of dais and altar
shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto lighting a single willow the mother tree
ancient and gnarled it grows in the center of the rock
its roots spread down to the grotto floor where they merge with the roots of the willows ringing the well forming a braided mat resembling the surface of a brain
moat stands on the dais leading them in a chant
wise ancestors who live within eywa guide us
give us a sign
the shack descends from the sky like a gift from the gods
it bumps to the ground
grace lies comatose in her open link
trudy gives jake a look that says not much time
jake feels graces cold forehead then crosses to his own link
as trudy helps him in norm rapidly preps the system
tsutey is oloeyctan now
hes not going to let you get near that place
ive gotta try norm
jake pulls the clamshell down and we cu jakes avatar his eyes open
he sits up
the forest is silent shrouded in smoke that the sun cant penetrate
the animals have fled
ash blows on the wind
to ever face them again i was gonna have to change the rules
dissolve jake reaches the top of a rise
the forest beyond is utterly devastated
the trees burned and fallen
small fires still flicker across a landscape in hell
it is his vision made real
he stumbles through the dark wasteland sparks and ash swirling around him
jake looks up as his banshee bonded for life flaps down to a landing in front of him
he steps to it and strokes its head
it nudges his chest like a horse
sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move
come on boy
time to fly
the great leonopteryx glides effortlessly along the ridge where jake and neytiri first encountered him
it scans for prey below its magnificent indigo crested head cocking left then right
the way i had it figured toruk is the baddest cat in the sky
nothing attacks him
so why would he ever look up
from above the small shadow of jakes banshee falls across the back of the mighty toruk
but that was just a theory
jake dives and we rush down toward the great beast and our own shadow then the omaticaya people lift their voices in a song filled with tragic loss and yearning
close on neytiri singing
a shadow crosses her face
she looks up and her eyes go wide as a terrible cry echoes turning all eyes skyward
an enormous shadow covers the crowd as toruk comes out of the sun beating its huge wings to slow its descent
its crimson and black wings backlit by the sun seem to glow from within
the people cry out in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst
and thats when they see jake riding high on its shoulders plugged in to its antenna
it folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed navi
toruk lowers its body
they stare in awe as jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animals flank
neytiri tsutey and moat watch in stunned amazement as the legendary rider of last shadow walks toward them
breathing the words toruk macto
neytiri raises her arms
on the faces of the omaticaya new hope dawning in their eyes
whispers flow among them the words repeated toruk macto
jake walks through the crowd straight to neytiri at the foot of the dais
he looks into her enormous eyes and the emotion between them is powerful and pure
i see you
a hoarse whisper i see you
neytiris eyes brim with tears
i was afraid jake for my people
im not any more
jake takes neytiris hand and climbs the steps of the dais
moat steps back in awe as he approaches
he turns to tsutey who stares at him with fear and incomprehension
jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says tsutey of the rongloa son of ateyo
i stand before you ready to serve the people
then just for tsutey you are oloeyctan and you are the best warrior
i cant do this without you
tsutey struggles with his emotions
finally i will fly with you
jake turns to the matriarch
grace is dying
i beg the help of the great mother
bring her jakesully
time cut avatar jake carries graces human body lightly in his arms like a child
jake walks through the crowd to the dais followed by norm who carries graces avatar
look where we are grace
her eyes flutter open
she looks up wonderingly at the mother tree
with a wan smile i need to take some samples
moat directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the altar rock
moat touches jakes shoulder and he steps back
the great mother may choose to save all that she is moats hand indicates graces avatar in this body
cu jake realizing the enormity of what shes saying
is that possible
she must pass through the eye of eywa and return
but jakesully she is very weak
jake kneels next to grace taking her tiny human hand in his avatar hand
hang on theyre gonna fix you up
grace is barely conscious
she grips his hand
i always held back
but you gave them your heart
im proud of you jake
jake feels his throat close with emotion
graces eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint
you do whatever it takes
you hear me
time cut moat stands in a kind of trance amongst the tendrils of the mother tree
neytiri and the other acolytes dance hypnotically
all the omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums
macro shot fine hairlike threads have emerged from the roots and are gently spreading over graces human skin
jake still holding her hand watches her body being fused to the root floor by a thousand connections
graces avatar is gently connected by the same questing root cilia they entwine with the queue and spread over the body
the grotto is dark except for the spectral glow of the willows
the chant continues hypnotically
moat on her knees beneath the mother tree writhes her arms in the trance state
her eyes are rolled back showing only white
grace gasps and her eyes snap open
her expression is amazed as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be explained
on her hand gripping jakes convulsively as she tries to anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds im with her jake an amazed whisper shes real grace
shudders as pain shoots through her
blood seeps through the silken white root cilia growing across her abdomen
drowning white in shocking crimson
she exhales a last shuddering breath and goes still
he sees the roots falling away from her human body
jake turns hopefully toward her avatar but the roots are falling away from it as well
it sleeps vacant
moat stops the chant
she crosses to jake and kneels with him touching his shoulder
her wounds were too great there was not enough time
she is with eywa now
neytiri removes graces mask and gently closes her eyes
jake stands slowly barely holding it together
neytiri comes to him and he sees the despair and hope conflicting on her face and he raises his head
turns to face tsutey and the with your permission i will speak now
you would honor me by translating
tsutey gestures assent and they face the clan together
jake speaks the pain of graces death in the passion and fury of his voice
tsutey translates beside him
the sky people have sent a message that they can take whatever they want and no one can stop them
but we will send them a message
ride out as fast as the wind can carry you tell the other clans to come
tell them toruk macto calls to them
fly now with me brothers and sisters
and we will show the sky people that this is our land
tsutey finishes with a bloodcurdling war cry and the entire clan responds their shouts echoing across the forest
jake takes neytiris hand and runs to the leonopteryx
he vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him
the hunters run to their banshees mounting quickly
jakes leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky
with a thunder of wings the banshees take off after it
long lens polyphemus
across its face the banshees rise like a swarm of bats
groups of riders peel off in different directions
jake and neytiri stand before the gathered members of another clan
jake speaks as she translates
we dont hear the words
track across the faces of the clan a sea of eyes in flickering fire light
we rode out to the four winds
to the horse clans of the plain to the ikran people of the mountains
when toruk macto called them they came
various angles slow motion as riders vault onto their armored direhorses
banshee riders raise spears and bows spurring their mounts to leap skyward
with a whoosh and the crack of mighty wings jake returns
jake and neytiri alight from his legendary mount
around them hundreds of banshees are landing
a gathering of eagles
from above we can see hundreds of navi streaming down into the well of souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it
direhorse riders are arriving along many trails
banshee riders circle and swoop darkening the sky above the grotto
jake standing next to the leonopteryx watches his army gathering
its standing room only as all base personnel are crowded into the dining hall
a portable d graphics projector has been set up and the lights are down
quaritch stands in front of the display image a classic pre mission briefing
people you are fighting for survival
theres an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack
the display shows an overhead image of the well of souls
it looks like woodstock in the jungle
these orbital images show the hostiles numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day and more are pouring in
by next week it could be twenty thousand
then theyll be overrunning our perimeter here
we cant wait
our only security lies in pre emptive attack
we will fight terror with terror
tracking across the grim faces of the miners and troopers
fear transforming to hatred in their eyes
this mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity
when we destroy it we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they wont come within a thousand klicks of this place
troopers issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line of mine workers
the miners lock and load like the red blooded redneck nra supporters they are
blasting techs are setting radio detonated primer charges into two ton stacks of explosive compound
the stacks are band strapped together on pallets
tracking with selfridge staring around him in growing dismay as he walks through the full scale mobilization
he approaches quaritch who is barking orders amid a hive of activity around the ampsuits
this thing is completely out of control
quaritch ignores him turning away to focus on ordnance loading
listen to me
i am not authorizing you to turn the mine workers local into a freakin militia
i declared threat condition red
that puts all on world assets under my command
you think you can pull this palace coup shit on me
i can have your ass with one call quaritch grabs him and pins him against the side of an ampsuit
youre a long way from earth
selfridge is paralyzed
physical force against him
quaritch releases him and walks away
to his men get him out of here
several troopers converge on selfridge
you touch me youre so fired
he pushes through them and they escort him toward the door
human jake norm and trudy are gathered around the comms monitor talking to max
i dont know how secure this channel is
its crazy here jake
its full mobilization
theyre rigging the shuttles as bombers
theyve made up these big pallets of mine explosives
its for some kind of shock and awe campaign
to max can you talk to selfridge
maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way
no quaritch has taken over
hes rolling and theres no stopping him
oh six hundred tomorrow
jake takes that in
max signs off
you know hes gonna commit those bombers straight to the well of souls
because i gave it to him on a plate
we both did
if he takes out the well of souls its over
its their main line to eywa to their ancestors itll destroy them
then i guess we better stop him
jake looks like hes about to collapse
hes gaunt eyes deeply shadowed hands shaking
you need to get some rack
he grabs a packet of freeze dried crystals and pours them directly into his mouth chewing them up
gonna have to settle for coffee
tracking through the warrior camp above the well of souls
hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons
hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies
direhorses are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers
the navi paint and pierce themselves
bathe in the smoke of cleansing herbs ritual purification
huge drums are beaten
a dark primeval energy
they are psyching themselves up for battle
i was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace
but there was only one thing i was ever really good at
time cut jake neytiri a group of banshee riders squat around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of a scorpion gunship like a hunt totem
navi subtitled strike here and here
jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing the rotors
the navi absorb the lesson eagerly like kids
he sees trudy approaching and breaks off
neytiri stays with the hunters talking about what theyve learned
you know our chances suck
going up against gunships with bows and arrows
whats your point
she taps his fist and walks away toward her samson
the cook fires of the battle camp flicker like a constellation around the edge of the well of souls as jake slips down into the darkened empty amphitheater
he moves to the mother tree gnarled ancient majestic
the roots spread in all directions like the center of the world
jake steps forward
the willow like tendrils sway toward him moving in a breeze that isnt there
ive never done this in my life
he squats at the base of the tree
and im probably just talking to a tree right now
but if youre there i need to give you a heads up
he looks up into the tree
the hanging tendrils undulate softly
its easy to imagine a presence
if grace is there with you look in her memories she can show you the world we come from
theres no green there
they killed their mother and theyre gonna do the same thing here
from up in the tree looking down
woodsprites float in silence moving around aimlessly
more sky people are gonna come
theyre gonna come like a rain that never ends neytiri approaches silently behind him listening
until theyve covered the world
unless we stop them
jake contd look you chose me for somethin
and ill stand and fight you know i will
but i could use a little help here
jake senses neytiri and turns
our great mother does not take sides
she protects only the balance of life
she comes to him intertwining her long fingers with his
it was worth a try
they lean in foreheads touching bodies pressed together
holding each other in this the last moment of peace
tight on a turbine as it starts to turn
its rising whine carries over magazines are slammed into automatic weapons
ammo belts are fed into rotary cannons
missiles are attached to gunship stub wings
tight on blue hands sharpening wooden arrows
cinching direhorse harnesses
troopers drop into ampsuit cockpits
pilots close gunship canopies
troopers run up shuttle ramps
long lens stack tight and abstract on gunships as they rise in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor wash
wide shot tiltrotors fill the sky
deadly armored beetles
the dragon leads the formation flanked by scorpions
behind that is a wave of samsons and last the two enormous valkyrie shuttles packed with troops and ampsuits
inside the dragon quaritch surveys his armada as they skim over the tree tops
they sweep toward the hallelujah mountains in a thundering wave
squadrons of banshees darken the sky in waves led by a single great leonopteryx
jake sits astride his mount flanked by neytiri and tsutey on their banshees
the dragon descends on final approach to a large clearing the lz
the samsons flair and touch down disgorging troops while the gunships hover protectively
the valkyries blast the ground with their powerful lift jets
the ramps drop
troopers pour out weapons leveled advancing in a cordon
up angle as ampsuits descend from the dragon on cables
their massive feet smash down and they march forward leading the army into the forest
lyle wainfleet walking point in his hydraulic suit scans his cockpit screens
he sees movement on the flir display ghostly thermal signatures
two hundred meters
a chilling sound echoes through the forest the ululating war cries of untold navi
the troopers look around spooked
they cant tell where the sound is coming from
then they feel it the ground itself shaking
they grip their weapons bracing themselves as three hundred navi horsemen charge through the forest at a full gallop their hooves pounding the earth
it is an awesome sight
norm spellman rides with the navi hunters carrying an assault rifle
the navi charge thunders toward the human line
the hunters raise their bows as the ampsuits raise their gau s
on the thermal imagers target cursors track the ghost riders
fire for effect
the entire line of troopers opens fire
tracers riddle the jungle blasting foliage into confetti
charging direhorses crash down flipping over
riders are flung off
the withering fire continues and the ranks are decimated as riders launch their arrows at a full gallop
a few hit their marks among the troopers
norm fires his ar on full auto
two charging direhorses have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram
at a full gallop they hit an ampsuit flipping it onto its back with a blown out canopy
victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down
norms horse is hit by tracer fire
he is flung off as the creature cartwheels
he hits hard scrambling for cover as a warrior hurls his spear a moment before his horse is cut down
it slams through an ampsuits canopy but the merciless fire continues
horses rear and collapse
riders pivot their mounts to flee and the thermal screens show the remaining ghost riders scattering
lyle signals and the line advances firing sporadically at moving targets
overhead navi hunters stream through the trees running along the branches
as the troopers advance into bow range the navi open fire and troopers sprout arrows in throat legs masks the targets jake taught them but the firing line aims upward
tracking the thermal targets
tracers rip through the foliage and navi fall while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet
norm sprints frantically through the woods shouting into his jake
were falling back
surviving navi flee the horrific onslaught
it is a total rout
in the dragon quaritch catches glimpses of the figures streaming through the forest below
blue team switch forties
fire at will
led by the dragon the gunships fire streamers of mm rockets ahead of them
the jungle explodes with he bursts
circular shock waves flash outward through the jungle stroboscopic glimpses of terrified horses rearing navi leaping as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught
hunters look up as a dark shape hovers overhead
the downblast of the valkyries lift jets shreds the forest
inside the shuttles cargo bay a row of daisycutters are lined up
troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp
the pallet falls into the jungle below and ba whooooom
an enormous high explosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest
a white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions
at ground level it is an apocalypse
running navi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves
in the cargo bay the troopers whoop and high five
ground troops advance firing flamethrowers ars and gau s
quaritchs fleet flies into the shadow of the mountain of truth
blue team stay with the ground units
red team with me
were punching for the main target
quaritch glances up to see a squadron of winged shapes diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey
close on jake rushing straight down screaming a war cry as he leads the charge and scores of banshees slam into the gunships and samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys
the air battle is joined
jakes great leonopteryx flairs into its signature crimson x shape just before k wham
it knocks a scorpion tumbling
it coils around the gunship slashing furiously as they spin together
jake can barely hang onto the gyrating creature
the pilot of the scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy
jake releases the gunship and it careens into a cliff tearing off one rotor then plummets into the trees
there is a satisfying fireball
scorpions fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders firing cannons and rockets
jake banks as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds
screaming down on him is another scorpion
jake tucks and dives along the cliff feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and the scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among
the floating mountains or dive down into the trees
door gunners in a samson are shooting down banshees like messerschmidts from a b as we follow tsuteys banshee in a full delta dive
he swoops in from its blind spot and the gunners swivel too late as tsutey flashes past them shooting arrows with deadly accuracy
a scorpion gunship dives after a banshee
it fires an air to air missile and the banshee vanishes in an explosion
wide shot as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and dive like the battle of britain
banshees are hit by guns and missiles falling out of the sky
the occasional trail of smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt rotor
in the center the dragon is pouring out hellacious fire tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the stub wing pods
neytiri banks hard as tracers flash past her
a scorpion is right on her ass as she rolls inverted and dives under the edge of mons veritatis then rolls out zig zagging through the dangling vines but
the gunship stays on her
it rips through the vines and tracers flash toward us as she jinks the banshee around a thundering waterfall but her pursuer explodes right through the curtain of water
it launches an air to air missile
neytiri jinks hard diving
the missile hits a rock outcropping pummeling her with the shock wave
the gunship follows her through a narrow slit between mons veritatis and a smaller floating island
they run this slot rolled up on their sides and the scorpion gunner locks up neytiri for a missile shot but a shadow crosses his canopy
out of the sun comes a crimson demon shrieking over the roar of the turbines and k whammm
the leonopteryx slams the gunship driving it downward in a dive
the leonopteryx lashes at it with claws and teeth as they fall together out of control
jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick breaking its back on a rocky promontory and exploding
flying with a samson as a second samson falls in beside it
this one has its pilot door off and the pilot is wearing a breathing mask
the door gunners wave at trudy her expression grim behind her mask
she holds the cyclic stick between her knees while she rakes the other ship with bursts from an ar in her lap
the pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control
youre not the only ones with guns you pricks
neytiri jinks her banshee hard an enemy samson right behind her
the pilot is a hotdog following her down into the trees under the canopy
they slalom among the trunks at high speed
the gunners hang half out the doors firing
bark and leaves explode around neytiri as she zig zags through the jungle
the banshee dives under a huge tree limb and the pilot follows
he looks up at the last second catching a glimpse of blue skinned figures
the hunters drop a net of woven vines behind neytiri and
the samson hits it hard
the net fouls the ship flipping it backwards
it crashes upside down to the forest floor
neytiris banshee is hit by ground fire
it folds up like a broken kite crashing down through branches and she slams into the ground stunned
in the dragon quaritch looks ahead seeing the well of souls
he taps the pilot and points there it is
into his headset valkyrie one this is dragon
target is in sight
in the cargo bay of valkyrie one the troopers ready their deadly loads
target in sight
circling above tsutey falls in beside jake who talks to him by aircom headset
we have to stop the shuttles no matter what it takes
he signals gathering other hunters who fall in with him as he dives
jake rolls in after them but a gunship drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as tsutey leads the attack on the first shuttle
hunters jink and weave through withering fire from the escort ships
gunners with jerry rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of the shuttles picking off banshees who get past the escort
tsutey is raked by a burst from the dorsal gunners
his mount crumples plummeting with a dying scream and we spiral down with him the forest rushing up and a blinding blizzard of green as he tears downward catching at
leaves and vines
he slams to the ground badly injured
nearby ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest floor firing their cannons and flamethrowers
the gau s rip the forest to shreds
norm firing as he retreats is hit
he collapses his avatar body mortally wounded as hydraulic feet approach passing the bodies of direhorses and navi hunters
norm painfully tries to load another magazine panting in fear and pain as an ampsuit stomps up
aims its cannon point blank
the top of norms link bangs open
he reels out collapsing onto the floor clutching himself as if he can still feel the pain of death
he sits huddled shivering crazed
tsutey lies gasping mortally injured
he looks up grimacing as an ampsuit looms over him
lyle wainfleet reaches down and grabs tsutey by his queue lifting him painfully
i hear this is worse than death for you chief
wainfleet cuts tsuteys queue off near the base
tsutey screams in agony his nervous system exploding on overload
grinning lyle holds up the queue tsuteys only connection to the world consciousness which is his life
neytiri bleeding bruised staggers amid burning wreckage
ampsuit footsteps approach and she crouches behind a tree
troopers are seconds from seeing her as neytiri knocks an arrow to her fathers bow and readies herself for a last kamikaze shot when the trooper on the far right
of the firing line sees something on his screens
right flank somethings coming
its all lit up out there
the troopers become aware of the ground shaking
a slow building thunderous roar and an ampsuit comes flying out of the trees cartwheeling past them and the shaking builds
moat opens her eyes in sudden realization as the troopers pivot to face a wall of charging hammerheads crashing out of the foliage in a shower of broken branches as
the troopers open fire but the stampede drives over them like a wave
tree trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits
troopers are crushed or asphyxiated
nearby the foot soldiers see living shadows flow out of the gloom as viperwolves race among them with flashing jaws
the troopers fire wildly as they go down hitting each other as much as their attackers
the survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of the shadows
jake banks watching as hundreds of rider less wild banshees converge on quaritchs ships
they literally darken the sky
what the hell
the wild banshees wheel among the ships ripping into them
on jake slowly getting it
eywa is in the fight
a gunner fires from the door of a samson
there is a crash and the head of a banshee lunges in the open door jerking him out
other banshees tear at the pilots windshield
neytiri watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in disarray
the viperwolves flash past her ignoring her
she senses something and turns slowly to see a thanator emerging from the smoke behind her
a glistening black demon
she stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze and the thanator lowers itself until its head is just above the ground
it holds that position waiting
trembling she approaches the waiting demon
a smoky hell
fires burn all around
the troopers are disorganized falling back
shooting at shadows
panicked yelling fills the comm freq
wainfleet and another ampsuit are charging together through the smoky gloom
a and c squads rally at my pos
i want screaming on the comm whos screaming god damn it
we gotta get outta here
whoevers in charge call for extraction
shutup you crybabies
something slams into the other suit tackling it out of frame
wainfleet whirls to see his squad mate missing
he moves through a screen of foliage to reveal the ampsuit ripped open
blood inside the cockpit
he whirls at a sound in time to see a thanator leaping straight at him wainfleet raises his cannon but wham
its on him slamming him to the ground
the cannon goes flying
hes face to face with its nightmare jaws right outside his canopy on its back is neytiri and its a toss up which one looks more pissed off
the thanator rears back muscles rippling as it poises to strike and k kraaackk
slams its teeth right through his canopy
wainfleets scream is brief
neytiris demon mount rears up and its triumphant roar echoes through the forest
max runs down the hall leading the other scientists
hes yelling into an aircom handset
rogue one rogue one this is max
tell jake we are in motion
to the scientists get in there
barricade the door
the door is hurled open and the scientists charge in
science geeks barricade the door as avatar drivers scramble into their link units pulling the clamshells down
max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a connecting corridor
human norm emerges from the airlock wearing breathing gear and carrying an ar
he stumbles dazed toward the battle
jake signals and a formation of hunters rolls in diving at the lead shuttle which is already besieged by winged creatures
the cargo ramp is the scene of a pitched battle
navi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves overwhelming the troopers
hunters are shot falling out of the ship as others fly in
they shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage
the panicked crew chief slams a switch and the ramp begins to close a second before he is cut down by a spear
jakes leonopteryx plummets at the shuttle from behind
he swoops down flairs to reduce speed rolls off his mount and lands tumbling on the shuttles broad back as gunners try to swing their guns toward him but he
rakes them with his ar still running forward and jake pulls two grenades from his battle harness yanking the pins out with his teeth
he hurls them down the intakes of the vtol turbofans as his leonopteryx banks in a tight arc back toward him and
he sprints on as the grenades explode shattering the turbines which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and jake leaps into space landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting
they flap away gaining altitude as fire blasts out of the bottom of the shuttle
on the flight deck the pilot feels the ship dropping
mains to a hundred percent
get me airspeed
the pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and the fusion engines blaze thrusting the shuttle forward
it still falls its remaining lift fans screaming until its clipping the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and the pilot pulls back on the stick
lifting the nose
behind him a surviving navi hunter runs forward and thoonk
arrowheads sprout from the pilots necks and chests
the shuttle climbs out of control at full acceleration
it slams into the underside of mons veritatis
it explodes and hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest
on the flight deck of the other shuttle the pilots watch the wreckage falling
valkyrie two is breaking off
and if any of yall want to get off this piece of shit planet you better cover our ass cause were the only way back to orbit
from the dragon cockpit quaritch watches the shuttle bank away with most of the remaining gunships following
get back here you worthless pukes
are we breaking off
quaritch draws his pistol
what do you think
he is over the edge no logic in his brain now
techs and troopers crowd around consoles listening to all the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the disintegrating battle
in growing alarm what the hell is going on out there
regular troopers and volunteers flee through the jungle scrambling to board samsons as they touch down
the pilot listens to comms from hells gate
sir all ground units are falling back to the lz
quaritchs jaw clenches
stay on target
moat looks up as the dragon appears over the trees like the shadow of death
around her the navi mothers clutch their children to them
we see akweys boy among them
quaritch sets the target cursor on the mother tree and what we recognize is the ghostly figure of moat
arm all pods
lets see what these blue bastards do when i bitch slap their goddess
jakes leonopteryx drops toward the dragon like a mig
he pulls out skimming over the ship
uncoupling he rolls backward off his mount and jake hits skidding on the hull of the dragon
he rolls to his feet already running as quaritch sees the leonopteryx whoosh overhead and flap away with no rider
he snap looks aft to see jake sprinting along the spine of the ship yanking two grenades from his battle harness pulling the pins with his teeth then quaritchs hand
shoots out and slams the pilots cyclic stick hard over
the dragon lurches sideways rolling sharply with a roar of protesting rotors and jake is flung off his feet
the grenades miss the turbine intakes
one bounces off the ship
the other lodges against a cowling and jake slides off the ship falling as k blam
the grenade blows a two meter hole in the hull whoooshh
pandoran air swirls inside
to the pilot put your mask on
quaritch leaps out of his seat heading aft as jake grabs the edge of a weapons pod his feet dangling over open space
holding his breath quaritch blows a rescue hatch and leans outside
jake sees him aim his massive pistol
rounds clang next to jakes head
he lets go plummeting into the trees jake plunges through jungle canopy
he catches a huge leaf as neytiri taught him it bends down breaking his fall
he lets go dropping again only to catch another leaf and then another and we rush down with him through this green blur
jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch
into his headset quaritch is gonna take out the well of souls
hes got a clear shot
hit him anybody that can
do it now
in her samson trudy chacon is all business
she banks hard pulling gs coming around on the dragon
she pours on the coal and the samson leaps forward straight at the warship
quaritch drills a stream of tracers at her tearing through her canopy ripping chunks off her fuselage
in the jungle below norm watches her kamikaze run no
clipped pilot like norm i love you
trudy dives raking through treetops and then at the last instant yanks back on the stick and the samson leaps straight up and k krash
shears off the cockpit of the dragon as quaritch throws himself aft along the aisle and trudys samson disintegrates the wreckage burning as it tumbles into the jungle
miles quaritch grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open front of the fuselage
wind howls through wreckage where the pilot used to be
the forest rushes up to meet him and the dragon crashes through splintering trees impacting in a lake with a white blast of water
norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees
imploded by grief
on the plotting display as quaritchs transponder icon disappears
dragon is down
its off the board
what do you mean off the board
selfridge is stunned
suddenly the roar of an engine makes them all look up
outside the window max sits in the cab of an enormous slash cutter
max flips selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward oh shit
selfridge dives as k rashhhhh
the spinning teeth of the slash cutter tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air
alarms go off
the technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris
the slash cutter head pulls back and avatars scramble through the gaping hole into the ops center the troopers look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them
the battle is over in seconds
the avatars are holding the ops center
selfridge lies there gasping in his emergency mask
how could this be happening
the dragon lies half submerged
out of the water fg a shape rises a ampsuit
inside miles quaritch his face bloody his eyes burning
he slogs out of the water covered with mud then strides into the forest
quaritchs ampsuit thuds relentlessly through the jungle
he sees something through the foliage ahead the shack
inside the shack jake is oblivious under the link
through a window we see quaritchs ampsuit step into the clearing
quaritch levels his gau at the shack
his finger goes to the firing button wham
a six legged black demon tackles him
quaritch pivots as he falls firing the cannon
it misses neytiri by inches
he grapples with the thanator as its razor claws screech over his metal armor
the titans twist and struggle
quaritch unleashes a long burst from the cannon
rounds tear into the creature which shrieks but neytiri wills it to smash the cannon hard against a rock tearing it loose from the suits hand but quaritch slams the
thanator back against a tree trunk almost crushing neytiri
close on one hydraulic hand as it draws the suits knife and quaritch twists violently ramming the knife up under the thanators chest armor
the creature roars and quaritch flips on top of it stabbing
quaritch stabs down again
the thanator slumps pinning neytiris legs under its great bulk
she is trapped
quaritch looks down at neytiri
she glares back at him panting scared but defiant
its all over quaritch quaritch turns seeing jake dropping from a tree limb
the suit rises slowly knife glinting in the morning sun
nothings over while im breathing
kinda hoped youd say that
quaritch surges forward
jake closes fast snatching up the broken cannon as
quaritch slashes down with the knife and jake parries blocking it with the cannon
he closes faster than the suit can move and k crack
slams the end of the cannon into the canopy crazing it with a web of cracks as quaritch slices air with the huge knife
jake ducks coming up to meet the next slash and smashes the knife hand with the cannon once twice again in a furious attack knocking the knife flying
quaritch catches him with the other arm hurling him away
jake rolls just before thuddd
the massive foot stomps down where he just was
he scrambles up as quaritch charges and jake ducks another round house leaping forward to smash the canopy again then again until it is white with cracks
quaritch manages to grab the cannon barrel but inside the cockpit he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass
he hurls the cannon blindly but jake ducks
the massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and from inside we see it crash against pressure window crazing it but not penetrating
jakes link sits just inside
inside the cockpit quaritch yanks a yellow handle and p foom
the canopy blows off flying through the air
quaritch can see again
he dons his breathing mask
bends to pick up his knife
nearby neytiri struggles furiously trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator
quaritch panting glowers at jake
how does it feel to betray your own race
then inexplicably he turns
from inside the shack we see him charge straight toward us and crash
he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window
he is reaching inside for the link when jake hits in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has knocking the ampsuit sideways and
jake reaches around the suit grabbing quaritchs shoulder and yanks him forward hard smashing his face into the edge of the cockpit but quaritch flings him off with a sweep
of his arm and jake slams to the ground
inside the link jake is holding his breath as the toxic pandoran air swirls in
gas alarms shriek
neytiri shoves with one free leg desperately trying to pull her other leg out
the ampsuit charges the knife flashing down and jake just manages to catch it in both hands but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as quaritch
pushes the knife down inexorably until jake is pinned against a rock the blade now inches from his throat
inside the link jake is straining to stay conscious to stay connected as the knife reaches his throat as thwap
an arrow appears in quaritchs chest
he looks up
neytiri stands a fury released
a classic archer figure she nocks another arrow
then draws and releases smoothly
the machine topples off jake and lies still
quaritch stares at the two arrows in his chest
he touches the feathers of the ancient weapon then with an ironic laugh he dies
neytiri runs up another arrow nocked bow drawn
seeing quaritch she lowers her fathers bow
jake sees her then goes limp his eyes rolling back and human jake explodes out of the link slamming to the floor where he gags for breath
with his last strength he claws toward an emergency breathing mask across the room
he scrambles toward it on the edge of unconsciousness
neytiri vaults through the shattered window landing in the debris like a cat
she grabs the mask and flashes to jakes side puts the mask over his face and
jake drags in breath after breath
he looks up at neytiri studying him as she holds him seeing his human body for the first time
jake touches her face his pale human hand against the blue of her skin
there eyes meet across the glass of the mask together separate
moat tends to the mortally wounded tsutey as avatar jake arrives with neytiri
moat has bound his wounds but by her expression it is clear he cannot be saved
jake kneels and tsutey opens his eyes
through a haze of pain he recognizes jake
i see you jakesully
i see you tsutey te rongloa ateyitan
are the people safe
tsutey weakly clutches his severed queue
i can never ride again or bond with my woman or hear the voice of eywa
i can not lead the people
you will lead them jakesully
im not officer material
it is decided
now do the duty of oloeyctan
set my spirit free
im not killing you
i am already dead
it is the way
and it is good
i will be remembered tsuteys voice is weak but thick with emotion
i fought with toruk macto we were brothers and he was my last shadow
tsuteys hand clasps with jakes in a fierce grip
jake draws his knife
tsuteys pov jake leans forward blocking the sun
his shadow falls across tsutey
forgive me my brother
go now to the mother spirit
by his movement we know that he has ended tsuteys pain
jakes eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the prayer for the dead and his navi words carry over as we navi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of
banshees roost on the roofs of the modules and stingbats flutter about unimpeded
the sentry guns are silent and the gates are open to the forest
a few chose to stay
fewer were chosen
max norm and a few of the avatars hold ars as the personnel of hells gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle
the evicted humans are sullen and angry like pows
jake and neytiri stand together watching the departure of the sky people
parker selfridge shuffles up the ramp
his eyes the eyes of a lost soul meet jakes
he disappears into the ship
isv venture star hangs suspended against the dark side of pandora
the isvs antimatter engines blaze to life and it accelerates out of orbit
what remains in frame is a virgin primeval world
spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lace work of bioluminescence a ghostly web connecting all of pandora
the suns rays shaft down through the layers of canopy
the forest will heal and so will the hearts of the people
new life keeps the energy flowing like the breath of the world
neytiri obviously pregnant is bow fishing in the shallows
children jump and squeal with laughter in the river
this is my last videolog
video image jake sits in a chair talking straight to camera
he is thin pale
he looks around the high tech room
the science guys will keep the lights on here
but i wont miss this place
the willows glow softly
the entire omaticaya clan is gathered seated in a prayer circle around the mother tree
i better wrap this up
theres a funeral tonight and i dont want to be late
it was someone very close to me
wide shot moving in across the concentric rings of people all plugged in and softly chanting
moving toward the center over the figure of moat to hover above neytiri kneeling beside two figures on the dais
jake and his avatar lie head to head
human jake is wearing an exomask
both figures are still hands folded covered in translucent silken shrouds of root cilia
camera closes in as neytiri removes the mask from jakes human face
she gently closes his dead eyes with her fingertips
then bends and kisses him
move into cu on avatar jake as neytiris hand comes into frame stroking his cheek
tightening slowly to ecu jakes eyes
hold a beat then they open
