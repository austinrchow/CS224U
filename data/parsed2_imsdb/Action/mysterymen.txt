mystery men revised june by neil cuthbert based on the dark horse comic created by bob burden revised june camera moves through a tangled jungle of razor wire finally coming
into view of a foreboding fortress like old institution surrounded by towers and gun turrets
screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within
close on a sign that reads erie hospital for the criminally insane this is where the worst killers and psychos go
the camera pans the expressionless faces of the review board as casanova frankenstein sits across from them
dressed in an immaculately tailored prison smock with casanova exquisitely embroidered above the pocket he sits contritely as doctor emmet bierce the hospitals fatherly chief of psychiatry presents his case
no one can deny the horrendous nature of mr
frankensteins crimes but in the twenty years he has been with us i have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use
casanova the picture of remorse and repentance
just look at his accomplishments
three volumes of poetry two rock operas a sculpture garden four romance novels
and who can forget his touching portrayal of billy bigelow in our all psychotic production of carousel
on several of the board getting misty eyed at the memory of that brilliant performance
directed by our own doctor anabel leek
on doctor anabel leek the hospitals icily beautiful ultra cool top shrink
a moment later casanova addresses them
his manner is charming sincere his voice soft filled with emotion
he is a master of seduction
twenty years ago i was a lost soul
with a son like glance at doctor bierce fatherless
chokes on the word a
breaks down sobbing oh
how could i have done it
all of those lovely young girls
weeping a brilliant performance im sorry
im so so sorry
doctor bierce wipes the tears from his eyes
reactions from the board moved as casanova weeps convulsively
doctor leek shows no reaction
pulls himself together but my deeds have been done and my youth is gone and we can only go forward in this cruel world
and if i have learned anything from my wretched life it is that
when you walk through a storm keep your head held high
singing and dont be afraid of the dark
tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the fully a hand stamps casanovas file cured
casanova shakes hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board finishing with a paternal hug from doctor bierce
in his cell a guard delivers casanova his favorite old disco suit thats been waiting far him for twenty years
casanova dressed in the suit walks down the central aisle of the lock up
a moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the hospital and takes his first deep breath of freedom
while in an office window high above bierce and the members of the review board stand watching very proud
but suddenly the music changes to seventies disco as a black ferrari drives up and doctor leek now dressed very sexily gets out
as the review board watches in stunned silence casanova and anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl finishing with a very lewd kiss
bierce watching realizes hes been duped
as casanova grinning up at him puts a long gold chain his favorite weapon around his neck
bierce horrified picks up the telephone
as casanova and anabel get in the car
casanova and anabel drive off
the massive old hospital is seen through the rear window behind them as casanova calmly looks at his watch
as the second hand just swings toward the twelve
it is exactly twelve noon
almost wistfully boom
and the hospital explodes in a huge fireball that completely consumes it
those gas leaks can be murder
the ferrari drives past and the camera holds on a sign that reads we come to champion city home of captain amazing
the city itself a crumbling rust belt metropolis ala detroit can be seen stretched out along the shore of lake champion off in the distance
the ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the road showing a picture of captain amazing himself a square jawed classic superhero staring fiercely into the camera
the caption reads crime
dont even think about it
letters read six months later
as the camera explores the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards cruising past piles of tires and abandoned train cars
camera picks up a battered van as it drives through the yard then pulls up beside an old boxcar
the back of the van is thrown open a ramp is thrown down and the red eyes a gang of vicious small time thieves all of whom wear sunglasses with
red lenses start unloading their nights haul
red eye drives a golf cart with clubs down the ramp
several more red eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes still attached a barber pole a virgin mary lawn statue and a top of the line baby
while their leader big red stands in the door to the boxcar watching approvingly
not a bad nights work
who said crime dont pay
the red eyes laugh
as red eye takes the cover off the baby stroller and sees
that theres a baby still in it
hey boss we got a stowaway
the crooks gather around the baby a jolly little kid who just laughs at them
about to slug him who you laughin at punk
hes just a tyke
hes kinda cute
if you like drool
hey why dont we sell him back to his parents
for a million bucks
the others think thats a great idea but big red doesnt
and what if he rats on us
the others hadnt thought of that
so what should we do with him
stick a brick in his pampers and dump him in the lake
the others think thats a good idea and look around for a brick
come on kid youre goin for a swim
but suddenly there is another presence
a man in a blue turban and cape with the initials br on his chest has appeared
he is the blue not so fast gentlemen and i use the term loosely
unhand that youngster
another man steps into the light
he wears a construction helmet and mask
there is an s on his chest and he carries an old shovel
he is the shoveler
or youre mulch
he brandishes his shovel for effect
the red eyes look at these two highly amused
what are you guys supposed to be
a third man steps out
his costume is less dramatic than the others
he wears only an old leather jacket and a faded torn shirt with flames on it but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his haircut make
it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous of the three
he is mister furious
we are superheroes
did you mother make those costumes
the crooks howl with laughter
this is our territory
over your dead body
big red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear
ooooo hes scary
the red eyes laugh but suddenly a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in big reds backside
he howls with pain pulls it out and examines it
its a silver dessert fork
the raja holds up his hands each of which hold a spread of silver forks
and theres plenty more where that came from
big red gives a shrill whistle and a dozen more red eyes step out of an old caboose
including mikey a four hundred pound behemoth
he is eating a container of ben and jerrys like it was an ice cream cone taking huge bites out of it container and all
raja and shoveler reacting
this was more than theyd bargained for
but furious just growls hes game
the red eyes attack
mister furious goes into a furious face his hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming crooks
a red eye takes a swing at the shoveler but he simply puts up his shovel and lets the crook slug the shovels pan
the crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand
as the raja fends off crooks poking them with salad forks
and the baby sits in his stroller watching and laughing really enjoying the show
theres no real martial artistry or teamwork here this is a classic back alley brouhaha
but theres too many of then
the raja goes down under swinging fists
and so does the shoveler
furious holds his own taking out crooks with powerful lefts and rights until mikey runs him down like a truck falling right on top of him and crushing him under
his massive weight
crush him mikey
barely audible under all that meat is that all you got
he wants more
finish him off
faintly your mother
mikey sweating bears down
but suddenly a calm very authoritative voice is heard
is there a problem
everything suddenly stops as the red eyes look up and see
captain amazing standing on tap of the boxcar hands on hips framed in the light at the moon his biceps bulging his state of the art physique sculpted body armor
gleaming in the moonlight his cape wafting heroically in the wind
he is superhero perfection incarnate
on the red eyes as their viciousness turns instantly to panic
big red and a couple others try to run for it but amazing leaps ca like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash
as the baby claps his hands in delight and our three heroes watch in beat up awe amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows
he is the consumate superhero and he doesnt even break a sweat
the remaining red eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in surrender
we had terrible childhoods
police cars and a tv truck come screeching into the train yard
and the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and reporters
our three heroes try to approach captain amazing who still looks fresh as a daisy
nice work captain
but amazing just walks past them ignoring them completely as if they didnt even exist
he goes to greet dawn wong champion citys answer to connie chung
turning on the old superhero charm hi
putty in his hands pudding in his bowl looks like youve done it again captain
its what i do
our heroes just watch feeling ignored humiliated
suddenly two cops are accosting them
okay shows over
on your way
wait a minute officers
you dont understand were superheroes and we just busted up this gang
let me guess youre towel head and hes
meaning the shoveler captain pooper scooper
the cops crack up
furious growls at them
the cops yank out their nightsticks
get a life
and leave crime fighting to the real thing
shoveler and raja pull furious away before he gets into real trouble
the cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night
an inner city greasy spoon
on which captain amazing the laughing baby in his arms is being interviewed by dawn wong
hes playing the cutsy photo op for all its worth gootchy gooing the kid etc
dawn is creaming
our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner watching the tube
nursing a sore jaw he doesnt miss a trick does he
what a jerk and like nobody knows who he really is
oh dont start that again furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good looking guy in a tux at a benefit
the headline reads lance hunt hosts benefit
he holds the picture up next to the television so the faces of lance hunt and captain amazing are side by side
it is obviously the same guy
hes lance hunt
just take off the glasses and its him
theres a vague similarity
a vague similarity
its the same guy
downing some aspirin h who gives a damn who he is
i cant take this anymore
night after night were on the streets busting our humps and for what
we take the licks and he gets the chicks
how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize its not gonna happen
we need a break thats all
nobodyd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein
but look at him
and look at us
the camera loves him
a depressed silence
furious turns his attention to the napkin dispenser
furious why do they always fill stuff these things so full you cant pull em out without ripping em
rips one out i lost another fork tonight
shes getting suspicious i know it
so why dont you just tell her
upset because i cant
she wouldnt understand
leave him alone
shes his mother not yours
we had an off night thats all
so when are we gonna have an on night
a waitress is standing at the table
they look at her taken aback
shes very pretty
its my first night
my names monica
close on furious smitten by her but almost afraid to look at her
under all that rage hes in fact shy
you guys going to a costume party
like captain amazing
are you famous
so youre like
we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung
i am the blue raja master of silverware
does a very impressive little flipping thing with his place setting wow
and these are my associatiates the shoveler
and mister furious
his anger is his power
intrigued by furious really
usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill
in his case its entirely emotional
so what can i get you
burgers all around
meaning himself medium
meaning the shoveler rare
meaning furious raw
a moment later as monica walks away furious cant help but watch her
the raja replaces the diners dinnerware with the good stuff from his coat
she likes you
ask her out
roy when was the last time you had an actual date
getting very pissed off what does it matter
women just want to control you and talk about their feelings
they want to know why youre angry all the time and what can they can do to help so you tell them theres nothing nothing just leave me alone but
they bug you and they bug you and they bug you until you just cant stand it anymore
so you finally open up you pop like a blister and it all comes spewing out all your emotions your feelings your fears all of it
after a beat and then they dump you
so youre chicken
fiercely whos chicken
gets up monica stands at the counter placing her order
furious approaches her leans against the counter
for a moment he just stands there fuming unable to think of anything to say
she isnt sure what to make of this
doesnt it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you cant think of anything to say
are you always so angry
only when im awake
you busy after work
want to go out and get drunk
shes visibly turned off by that
picks up an order and walks away furious the raja and the shoveler step out
maybe you should try a more romantic approach
gets on his old harley like what
cutting off my own ear
see ya tomorrow
furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the shoveler opens the door of his battered ford esquire station wagon and the raja gets into his
the shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house
the front yard looks like a battle zone
bikes and kids junk are everywhere
as big a disaster area as the front yard
his kids eddie jr
lenore butch tracy and roland are all sprawled in front of the television
the shoveler enters and his kids dont even bother to look up from the tube
hey when are you guys gonna clean this place up
when youre on tv
right like that will ever happen
save any babies lately
on the shoveler silent hurt
faster than a speeding turtle more powerful than a deodorant able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting look snoring in his chair sitting on the john its
the kids all laugh in that derisive way that kids do so well as the shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen
the shoveler enters dejected
his wife lucille is doing the dishes
she looks up sees him
feels for him rough night eddie
the rajas datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little victorian house
the room is dark
someone is sneaking around
a drawer is quietly opened and we hear the gentle clink of silver
suddenly the light goes on and we see the blue raja now dressed in a sport shirt and slacks with his hand in the drawer
his mother in her nightclothes stands by the door where she has just switched on the light
oh hi mom
what are you doing in the silver drawer
the tv guide
she just looks at him very suspicious
its on the television
im such a fool
go to bed
he kisses her and goes into the next room
camera holds on mom she doesnt trust him
a billboard overlooking the city
captain amazing is posed wearing a pair of bright blue nikes
the caption reads
its a nice world
sonebodys got to save it
the nike supershoe
furious sits on his harley taking long hauls from a pint bottle of cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign
whats so amazing about him
id be amazing too if id inherited two hundred million bucks
or two bucks
or two cents
hurls the empty bottle smashing it against the sign who am i kidding
dreams dont come true
a moment of despondency and then he hears a strange sound overhead and looks up
as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above him
it is captain amazing wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back
wheres he going
kicks his harley started as furious following captain amazing rides roughshod down the steep hill skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential area
he cuts onto some railroad tracks hops his bike up on a rail and rides smoothly along it following amazing
he turns off the tracks rides roughly through some woods then emerges from the trees and sees
a foreboding looking old mansion
captain amazing lands on the highest part of its roof
furious pulls up gazes at the front gates of the mansion
letters across the iron gates read
captain amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate roof like spiderman leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking along a high ridge like a tight
finally he approaches a skylight looks down and sees
a huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it
casanova frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire
anabel perches on the arm of his chair
in the other chair sits a once good looking now paunchy guy with a meticulously coiffed haircut
he is tony pompadour head of the infamous disco boys
just as he suspected uh huh
he sees that the skylight is open and quietly lets himself in
casanova and tony p savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars
i hope you enjoy these cigars
i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them
have you considered my offer
you know mr
f me and the boys always loved workin for you
you had such style the clothes the dancin the elegant way youd snuff a babe
you were the king
casanova accepts this graciously
but times have changed and you been in that bug house a long tine
i can see you still got the style but i dunno for sure you still got the edge
i got it
what about captain amazing
casanova and tony p look up and see captain amazing posed noncalantly on the iron catwalk gazing down at them
tony p jumps out of his chair scared
but casanova just smiles at his ancient rival cool as a cucumber
i knew youd cone
i left that skylight open for you
i know you did
i knew youd know
i know you knew id know
but did you know i knew youd know id know
tony p makes a move for his pistol but captain amazing instantly whips out his pistol getting the drop on him
id hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of scum like you tony
the jig is up casanova
ive spent six months watching you and know exactly what youre up to
i know that youre recruiting your old henchmen
nervous reaction from tony p
i know who your girlfriend really is
icy reaction from anabel
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city
i guess you know just about everything dont you lance
except for one little thing
supremely confident and whats that
that ive hot wired the citys entire power supply through that catwalk
casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch and the ugly hum of a million volts instantly fills the room
as all the lights in the house go out except for a frightening orange glow in an upper room
off in the distance furious sees
the lights of the entire city flicker and then black out
a moment later the mansion and the citys lights return to normal
as furious watches not sure what to make of this
traffic is snarled
horns are blasting
tempers are frayed
close on a hammering jackhammer
camera widens to reveal that it is being operated by the shoveler dressed in work clothes
wiped out from the night before the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off to sleep
he nods out
as his boss whacks him on the arm
get your shut eye at home or youll be a full time superhero
the raja lies sprawled on his bed depressed still in his pee jays as he watches
an anthony robbins infomercial on the tv
its all within your power
the only thing thats in your way is you
easy for you to say
an auto junkyard and demotion yard
a giant press mashes an old car
while nearby mister furious does the job by hand demolishing an old grand prix with an iron bar
he does it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box ripping off the doors then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing the
pieces onto a big pile
his big boned red faced boss sally is calling out to him
in a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard sally and furious stand looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle
it is a herkimer battle jitney a heavily armored windowless soundproof personnel carrier designed by the pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on battlefield fact finding tours
overgrown with weeds home to an extended family of pigeons its fighting days if it ever had any are over
how many times i gotta tell you about this
sally thats a herkimer battle jitney
they dont make em like that anymore
its a classic
its a hunk of junk
i want the iron
she walks away
he picks up his iron bar and is about to wedge it under the front bumper of the herkimer
but the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at hint imploring him for one last chance
and he just cant do it
he throws away his iron bar and climbs inside the cab of the herkimer
furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat up old dashboard then turns on the radio which miraculously still works
he tunes in a local station puts his feet up on the dash
and continues to deny any knowledge of the incident
in local news millionaire lance hunt has apparently disappeared
on furious taking immediate notice
members at his household told police that the playboy philanthropist failed to return home last night after going out for a walk
police say they have no reason yet to suspect foul play but a search is under way
furious the shoveler and the raja all sit at their booth
i saw him go in and he didnt come out
but we dont know for sure its the same guy
casanova is being interviewed by don stouffer the local mike wallace
well don ive done some terrible things in my life but now im cured and i just want to give back something to my old home town
thats why im using whats left of my fortune to build
close on a model of a huge concrete bunker like institutional structure i
the getty the frankenstein center for the arts
youve changed havent you
back on furious raja and shoveler no he hasnt
the wall of the estate
as our heroes three heads rise up over it
and survey the grounds
about to climb over lets go
in a whisper holding him back wait
a group of men are hanging around the door to the house smoking chatting and laughing
a closer angle reveals that they are all dressed in the height or depths of seventies disco fashion
one of them is showing off some steps
our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer
this is bad
who are they
the disco boys
the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced
twenty years ago they were casanovas personal bodyguard
but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork
well theyve crawled back out
we may be getting in over our heads here
this looks like a job for superman or batman or both
dont you guys get it
if captain amazing is still in there we can rescue him and get on goes right over the wall they share an exasperated look then scramble over the wall after
casanova and dr
anabel leek are preparing for bed
anabel sits in front of a huge mirror brushing her long hair as casanova moves up behind her and puts his hands around her throat massaging squeezing just barely resisting
the temptation to strangle her
she loves it
everythings going exactly as we planned
puts the sharp point of her comb handle under his chin not quite
you havent announced our engagement yet
it must have slipped my mind
your mind is so slippery
dont worry pootchkie
my womanizing days are over
youre my lady macbeth my imelda
pulls her into his arms were such an incredible team
who could possibly stop us
kisses her as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard
dont crunch the leaves
be a mohican
bumps into a lawn chair wait
they all stop
i hear something
they all listen there is a low rushing sound
it is the sound of water rushing through pipes
suddenly the lawn sprinklers all pop up
and our heroes get drenched
they duck off the lawn behind the cover of a large tree
sneezes oh great
be a mohican
furious sees a pair of french doors off a small patio
one of the doors is slightiy open
they start sneaking toward it but as they cross the patio
they trip the automatic security lighting and suddenly find themselves bathed in light
as our heroes look around as a dozen disco boys armed with pipes chains brass knuckles step into the light and encircle them
the french doors open and tony p steps out
oh im sorry
we must have the wrong house
you sure do
the disco boys attack
the raja is instantly clubbed down
the shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes down too
these guys are not the red eyes
only furious holds his own
he grabs a pipe away from one of them and swings fiercely keeping the others off
suddenly the disco boys pull back
furious doesnt know why until he turns and sees
casanova standing right behind him smiling
with a cat like move casanova slashes his gold chain viciously and repeatedly across furious face
furious stunned with pain lunges at casanova who neatly steps aside then catches him with a fast combination of spinning disco kicks
finally he lassos the chain around furious neck and pulls it tight strangling him
on the disco boys watching snapping their fingers with admiration
casanova releases furious who slumps to the ground
casanova steps away and the disco boys gather around furious and kick him viciously
as casanova and tony p watch amused chuckling
should i kill them
completely disdainful why bother
the disco boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like bags of garbage into the street
where thay lie in a moaning agonized semi conscious heap
furious rubbing his neck a thin red mark runs around it
the three of them are sitting at their usual table in very bad shape moaning and groaning
shes made them ice packs and cold compresses
here you go
sits with them applies a compress to the rajas head ow
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something
a fussy customer is calling out from another table
she moves off
maybe shes right
still furious are you serious
this is the break weve been waiting for
what are you talking about
what have the famous superheroes got that we dont
casanova isnt just a criminal hes a supervillain
stopping him could be our ticket to fame fortune and babes
and it would be the right thing to do
dismissively yeah yeah and that too
but theres only three of us and hes got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal
then maybe its time for us to form our own brotherhood
more furious contd a brotherhood of righteous crime fighting skull cracking disco boy bashing warriors of the night
im liking this
i say we send out the word and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know
after a moment yeah but
who do we know
they take a long moment to ponder this
theres the spleen
shoveler and raja make disgusted noises
do we have to
i got this cousin
hes a real doofus but he claims he can become invisible
have you ever seen him
how could i see him if hes invisible
and theres the sphinx
hes a legendary masked mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete
no ones sure that he actually exists but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the
get outta here
a funky mexican restaurant by the bus station
our heroes in normal clothing have just finished a taco lunch
furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen
you sure thats how you spell it
which reads spinks we need you
they crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant
a moment later a shy looking mexican man busses their tray
but in a close angle we see him secretly pocket the napkin
a little brick house
a teenage boys room decorated to the max with models and posters of the great superheroes batman spiderman captain amazing etc
invisible boy about fifteen is being interviewed by the raja mister furious and the shoveler
so let me get this straight
you have the power to become invisible
only when no one is looking
if someone looks at you you immediately become visible again
so youre only invisible
if i look at myseif i become visible
so youre only invisible when abuolutely no one is looking at you
so how do you know that youve ever been invisible
i just know
our heroes are less than impressed
look kid weve got a lot of heroes to interview desperate i know i havent got it entirely worked out yet but ive always dreamed of becoming a superhero
werent you guys ever a kid
didnt you ever need someone to just give you a chance
on our heroes looking around the room
and softening up
our heroes sit at their usual table along with invisible boy and a weird looking guy in a greasy stained yellow superhero outfit
across his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads the spleen and thats exactly who he is
furious the raja and shoveler sit as far away from him as possible
he is a totally noxious hyperactive person
and he is thrilled to be there
boy i cant tell you how thrilled i was when you guys called you gonna eat that pickle
sucks it in ive always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team and to have friends real friends i mean guys i could live with sleep
with die with eat with
he puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into his mouth
i love mustard
furious raja and the shoveler react they cant believe theyve actually invited this guy to join their group
so what exactly is your superpower
well when i was a kid i grew up on love canal remember that
and my brothers and i used to go swimming in it make kool aid out of it stuff like that
anyway my brothers all died but i lived and i grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before
so now i can do things like this
he leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle dribble onto the table
as the spittle burns a hole in the formica
the spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp and our three heroes duck out of the way or under the table
the people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion put their hands to their mouths and immediately leave
hey why dont you just put a cork in it
i tried that once
the cork melted
our heroes mull their situation over coffee
monica freshens their cups
the spleen squirts mustard in his coffee
theres just not enough of us
but we know theyre out there
hundreds maybe thousands of lonely unknown superheroes who desperately need a cause
and a social life
yeah but how do we get to them
obscene phone calls
they ignore that suggestion
why dont you throw a barbecue
moves off to another table on our heroes realizing thats it
invisible boy sits at the desk in his room writing immaculate little notes on small file cards
hes made a whole pile of them
which reads got superpowers
want to fight evil
then join us and lets party hearty
as our heroes post these notes all over the city in places where lonely superheroes night find them
the raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store
the shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley
furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone booth
at an abandoned drive in movie theater
invisible boy walks through the empty lot taping a note to each of the old speaker posts
a white castle hamburger joint
inside the pay toilet spleen is scratching something on the wall with a nail
he stops and admires his handiwork and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the wall
a small typical working class backyard
a round aluminum above ground pool
a weber grill with burgers on it
unopened packages of hamburger rolls
an old vic damon record plays on a boom box
the spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool
come on in
the waters great
in fact the water is turning a yellowish green
the rest of our heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs
no superheroes have shown up
the shoveler at the grill serves burgers to his kids who stand in line waiting for them
heavy on the sarcasm great picnic dad
are these guys real superheroes
they think so
the kids scoff
a moment later they head back to the house with their burgers
but wheres captain amazing
he wouldnt be caught dead here
they go into the house
no one says anything
the shoveler just stares at the burgers on the grill
vic damon sings
furious chugs his beer hes working himself into a really morose mood
on the spleen munching on a chlorine tablet
hey these pool mints are delicious
raja looks at his watch
maybe there was traffic
who are we kidding
no ones gonna show
were living in a fantasy
come on guys were fighting against evil
good or evil whats the difference
theres a big difference
i used to believe that
now im not so sure
roy remember it is all within your power
the only thing thats in your way
oh shut up
suddenly there is a knock at the gate
everyone immediately perks up
a moment later they open the gate and see
half a dozen burly guys wearing various superhero outfits
hey man is this the superhero wingding
this is it
come on in
at first glance these guys seem promising
but their outfits are decidedly improvised weird goggles and sunglasses shower curtain capes baseball caps with beer cans on them
their leader holds a squeegee with a long handle
furious is suspicious
i am the blue raja master of silverware
i am squeegee man and these are my compadres the invincible dudes
the invincible dudes spot the keg
they go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling them down
the raja tries to hand out some forms
would you mind filling out these forms names addresses description of superpowers that sort of thing
but they just toss the forms away on furious watching starting to get pissed off
hey man like where are the babes
it said on the card thered be babes
actually we lied about the babes but theres plenty of burgers
thats false advertising
we came all the way from south champion man
we coulda gone plinking
we coulda gone bunqee jumping
invisible dudes chanting no babes no peace
no babes no peace
no babes no peace
lets trash the place
furious fed up confronts squeegee man
if youre a superhero whats your power
i am squeegee man
holding it out threateningly touch my squeegee
and you die
the invincible dudes are cracking up
can you fly
as squeegee man comes flying and screaming over the fence landing none too gracefully in the front yard
a beat and his squeegee come flying out after him
another beat and the invincible dudes come running out the gate in a panic
lets get out of here
that dudes crazy
they take off down the street running right past a woman carrying a bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded threadbare old rayon superhero costume with a decidedly fifties
she is the bowler
our heroes sit around the patio dejected miserable
they look up see her standing there and arent quite sure what to make of her
who are you
im the bowler
i remember him from when i was a kid
he was killed years ago
im his daughter
our heroes share a look
look honey being a superhero
its a guy thing
she takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger like a harlem globetrotter
for a long moment she just looks at them smiling
on the others watching almost mesmerized by the spinning ball
suddenly she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the ball around her in wide ferocious arcs like a cannibal with a war club or a twirler on
meth going so fast she almost becomes a blur
then just as suddenly she stops aims and rolls her ball
it shoots straight through invisible boys legs
as the ball smashes into then pulverizing them
it goes into a reverse spin passes through invisible boys legs again and returns to the bowler who is holding its bag open for it
the ball rolls in
on our heroes left absolutely speechless
if it could zip up its own bag then youd be impressed right
she turns and walks out
our heroes share an amazed look then run after her
as furious catches up with her
can i buy you a beer
i thought youd never ask
she takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the shovelers backyard
but the camera pans across the street to the dark place between two houses where a man wearing a strange steel mask with a frightening impassively powerful expression stands in
the deep shadows watching them in motionless predatory silence
we do not know who he is and we cannot tell if he is good or evil
a faded old snapshot of the original the bowler holding a little girl in his arms
he was more than just a superhero
he was my father
the others touched by this have gathered around the bowler who is holding the old snapshot in her hand
and then one day he didnt come home
the police said it was an accident
but cargo containers dont just fall on people
he was murdered
after that i fell apart
i dropped out of school became a mud wrestler married and divorced a jerk
when my mother died i hit bottom
but then when i was cleaning out her attic i found my fathers old bowling bag and costume almost like hed left them there for me
and i knew what i had to do
so who killed him
the disco boys
you know something
those guys are really starting to piss me off
but theres still only six of us
thats two more than the fantastic four
half a dirty dozen
twice the three stooges
and only one short of the magnificent seven
and you cant count horst buckholtz anyway
he was cute though
but they all had one thing we havent got
all the great superhero teams have got a fabulous name
they all think about it for a moment
you can almost smell their brains overheating
the savage six
the inscrutable six
the six pistols
wait i got it
the spleen team
he gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans
to hell with a name
lets get to work
music up as furious stands and starts out
the others stand and follow him
as our heroes form up for their first heroic group shot
music continues as a little old lady crosses the street when suddenly she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast
an immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her
disco boys sit in the front
casanova anabel and tony p sit in the back dressed for a night on the town
there is a thud as the limo hits the old lady and everyone in the car explodes into laughter
little old lady
thats a hundred points
as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for milk with a milk mustached captain amazing looking at the camera
he knows your every move
tony p imitates a massive electrical convulsion and the villains crack up
but as they pass the billboard a pair of headlights illuminate in its shadows and the shovelers ford esquire pulls out and follows
the shoveler is driving
mister furious sits in the front seat next to him and our other heroes are packed into the back
lets say hello
as the limo stops at a traffic light
and the esquire pulls up alongside it
for a moment good and evil stare each other down
not these guys again
the disco boys howl with laughter
the d boys laugh
furious stares at casanova and casanova stares right back at him as cool as a snake
what did you do with captain amazing
spots the bowler hey in the backseat who are you supposed to be the bowler
im his daughter
well guess what sweetheart
im the one who squished your daddy
and he squished real good
the villains laugh and mister furious explodes into rage
he swings open his car door mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent
he starts punching the limo like its a punching bag putting big dents in it
tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols but as they yank them out the spleen sticks his head out of the station wagon puts his
face right up to the open window of the limo and lets loose with a tremendous belch
as the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes mister furious goes on a demolition rampage working his way around the limo punching big dents with his fists breaking
the windows with his head flattening the tires by kicking them knocking off the rear view mirror with the back of his hand
then he leaps up on top of the limo
while inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into the roof above them
angle through the windsheild as furious leaps down onto the hood and gazes in at them
shall i check your oil
he plunges his hand through the metal of the hood pulls out the cars dip stick and checks it
he tosses the dip stick away then leaps off just as tony p gets off a shot exploding the windshield of the limo
furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon
as the shoveler throws the esquire into gear furious shouts
and our heroes streak off into the night
casanova and the others stagger out of the demolished limo sucking in the clean air
impressed by furious that boys got talent
and im gonna nip it in the bud
where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen
a very typical nondescript neighborhood place
our heroes stand at the bar celebrating their first victory
whatever our name is
they toast and drink
the spleen is passed out at a table snoring
shoveler and invisible boy sit next to him
even his snores smell bad
raja and bowler sit at the bar deep in it
but shes your mother
you gotta tell her
dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid waste of time
but he plays golf right
im her only son and she always had such high hopes for me
but youre a superhero
she wouldnt understand
my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask
they thought id lost it
but in fact
youd found it
they clink their glasses and drink
this is your dream
and you cant ever give it up
the spleen makes weird noises in his sleep
i wonder what he dreams about
we dont want to know
furious sits alone in the corner brooding lost in his own angry thoughts
a black van drives slowly past the bar
the van is packed with disco boys
tony p sits in the front seat
he has spotted the ford esquire parked in the lot
im headin home
to invisible boy come on junior its a school night
as our heroes carrying the spleen leave
anybody up for a little white castle
but suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they are bushwhacked by the disco boys
as he comes to with a qroan and sees
the bowler and invisible boy tied up and gagged with the raja shoveler and the spleen trussed up right next to them
furious looks up sees tony p standing over him
furious struggles but he has been secured with some very heavy tire chains
tony p takes out a large caliber revolver flips it open to make sure its loaded
got any last words angry boy
you know what im gonna do angry boy since youre so colorful
im gonna save you for last
he turns and points the pistol right at invisible boys head
furious struggles against his chains to no avail
sweet dreams punk
invisible boy closes his eyes
tony p cocks the pistol
but suddenly there is the ring of steel a broad blade sweeps through the air and tony ps pistol is sliced neatly in half
holding half a pistol the man is the strange steel mask is standing there the drawn machete still in his hand
the disco boys rush the newcomer but he slices through their baseball bats with his machete and sends them reeling and crashing into each other with expert forearm blows whacks
with the flat of his blade and head butts with his mask
furious struggles to break free and join the fight but the chains are too strong
and the stranger doesnt need any help
tony p flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger who sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him
tony p turns about to charge again
mexican accent would you like me to trim the sides
tony p feels the top of his head and realizes that the blow from the machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco do leaving only stubble on the
top of his head
freaking out tony and the disco boys run for it
furious and the others study their masked savior who stands before them machete in hand
youre the sphinx
and you are a fool
he raises his machete above furious head
and then slices clean through the chains
our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum
they sit on the ground and on old car seats feeling like schmucks as the sphinx chews theu out his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in the flickering light
you call yourselves superheroes
a rooster fights more intelligently than you
you have shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your powers to him and what have you accouplished for this
you have destroyed his car
if you want to survive you must fight like a wolf pack not like a six pack
furious sulks but the others get the point
the wolf is cunning
he knows that stealth is his greatest weapon and he always fights as a team
more sphinx contd at furious not like some drunken tejano on saturday night
casanova frankenstein is a a master of evil
you will need more than shovels and dessert forks to stop him
what else have you got
they are silent
angrily so what else has superman got
hes got the fact that hes superman
bullets bounce off him
furious sulks again feeling that the others are turning against him
firepower costs money
anybody got any
we didnt think this through very well
after a moment my father had this friend
he was an inventor
our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse
the place is an absolute wreck
it hasnt been painted in twenty five years
windows are boarded up
half the shingles are gone
theres visible fire damage around the kitchen window
are you sure hes still lives here
are you sure hes still alive
he was the last time i saw him
when was that
i was eight
she is about to knock but the door is suddenly yanked open and an eighty year old guy is standing there
hes got a wild head of white hair that looks like a living explosion and he wears a stained old lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it
non matching slippers and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded together into a fantastic concoction
he is doc heller
doesnt recognize her yes
why youre so
hows your dad
oh thats right they squished him
heck of a guy
furious throws a look at the shoveler and raja
this guys out of it
theyre wasting their time
doc these are my friends
were superheroes and we need your help
well i give to the united way and i feel that sort of covers doctor we need your weapons
ecstatic my weapons
you need my weapons
as doctor heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard toward
the military establishment has never understood me
they wont return my phone calls much less field test anything
but i knew that someday id get my chance and now
here you are
pulls open the barn door as our heroes step into hellers laboratory arsenal
a stack of small aluminum cans lines one wall
there are weird lookinq sprayers tubes and strange homemade toy like devices
but there isnt a firearm in sight
wheres the machine guns
you dont need that junk
you see for thousands of years mankind has been immolating disemboweling and exploding itself
because we have this built in screwed up need to go to war
more heller contd so as a young man i thought why nat have the fun and excitement of war without all that unnecessary bloodshed
thats why i have devoted my life to developing an arsenal of highly sophisticated non lethal military weapons
points to a hand held tube air cannons
feet seeking missiles
and perhaps my ultimate invention
picks up one of the small cans the canned tornado
furious groans and the others share a look
this guys really a nut
now heres a beauty
picks up a purple and orange sprayer that looks like a suped up water gun i call it the shrinker
i developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners i could find
it instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size
anyone caught in its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing
lets get out of here
furious turns and goes out and the others start to follow
but the bowler picks up a canned tornado
as furious walks away the bowler steps out of the barn
hey mister bad mood
furious stops turns back
pulls the ring on the can catch
she tosses the can to him
he catches it just as a small angry tornado funnels out of the can
it catches furious and lifts him high in the air
then dissipates to nothing
a beat later furious lands on the ground with a painful thump
on the others amazed
furious gets to his feet unhurt but really pissed off
he starts back toward the barn violently kicking the empty can
the others get out of his way as muttering angrily to himself he goes back into the barn
and emerges a moment later toting the air cannon
hes got the air cannon
the others think hes going to use it on them and scatter for cover
but furious steps out into the yard looking for a suitable target
he sees an old abandoned outhouse puts the air cannon to his shoulder aims and fires
there is a loud whoooomph of compressed air and the huge recoil of the cannon instantly flings furious back against the wall of the barn
but the big rush of air hits the shed dead center
and blows it to pieces leaving only the old seat
furious gets up dusts himself off and moves to doc heller
doc youre a genius
hugs him i know
turns to the others okay
we got the firepower
i say we throw it into the car drive over to casanovas house and kick some ass
the others ignore furious and listen to the sphinx
we are not yet ready
now we must learn to fight together
as one thing
the others nod in agreemnt
while furious fumes
close on doc heller aiming his air cannon
camera pulls back to reveal our heroes minus furious standing in a pack right behind him holding him down
he fires and the recoil jolts them all violently but it doesnt knock them over
as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces
our heroes chieer and shake their fists
furious sits alone on the sidelines drinking bourbon and feeling very alienated
various shots as our heroes learn to fight as a team
crawling across the grass together
charginq in a line
hurling canned tornadoes
while furious sits it out brooding drinking and getting very jealous of the sphinx
shoveler bowler and the sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder as invisible boy spleen raja and the doc throw small stones at them
they deflect the pebbles with shovel bowling ball and machete
theyre having fun
theyre becoming a team
furious drinks alone while the rest of our heroes sit around an old picnic table feasting on sodas and pizza like a football team after a great practice
raja explains the history of the situation to the sphinx
twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil and casanova was their king
crime was rampant
it wasnt safe to stay in your home
much less go outside
then captain amazing appeared
he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since
pissed off but now casanovas back
and were gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories
hey lets toast some marshmellows
the wise snake coils before he strikes
lunges at the sphinx and a skunk stinks
furious and the sphinx square off their faces only inches apart
you drink too much
when are you going to take off that mask
pointedly when i am sure i am among friends
roy snapping at him go dance with your mother jeffrey
on the raja hurt
your rage is a very great power but it blinds you to your heart
my heart died a long time ago
it is not dead
it is hiding
blow it out your bean hole pancho
and to hell with the rest of you
look at you
bunch of rejects
i didnt need you before and i dont need you now
jumps on to his motorcycle the great ones ride alone
kicks the engine started adios muchachos
and he rides off across the field on the others watching him
has he always been like this
the wind whipping against his face as he rides his harley at about a hundred miles an hour
the languorous sound of an old dean martin song is heard as we
as a little boy sitting in the backseat of the family car
it is thirty years ago and mister furious is a sweet very shy well behaved perfectly normal three year old
his mother and father sit in the front
dean martin is playing on the car radio
little furious looks out the window and sees the mohave desert going by
a sign reads las vegas miles
to husband oh this place looks great
an old sign reads bar as the family car pulls into the parking lot of a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere
now honey you just wait in the car
mommy and daddy will be right beck
they get out lock the car and head for the bar leaving the windows up
little furious watches them go never suspecting that his entire life is about to change
he sits quietly in the backseat and plays with the little superhero figurines that hes brought with him
as the parents enter
a very western motif
an old gene autrey song is playing on the juke
the air conditioning is on
theyre the only customers in the place
its nice and cool in here
as they sit at the bar barkeep a couple of cold ones
angle on the midday son blazing down on the car
as little furious still plays with his superheroes but the interior is starting to bake and the sweat begins to pour ofr him
he looks out at the bar
he tries the windows but theyre automatic and wont open
back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers as the bartender finishes telling them a joke
and heres a banana for your monkey
mom and dad have a good laugh
angle from outside tue car as little furious sweat and tears pouring out of him his hair wet and sticking out and starting to take on that familiar look pounds
on the window
as back in the bar his parents now very drunk down more beers and chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball
angle on the mohave sun beating down mercilessly barely able to breath little furious flops back onto the seat his face a mask of heat and terror
but suddenly a change begins to take place in him as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in
and his fear begins to give way to rage
his teeth bare
as they crush the superhero figurines in their grasp
while back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to hank williams your cheatin heart
as the big desert moon shines down on the family car still parked there
the parents are asleep in a booth
furious mother wakes up looks around groggily and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers
as she runs toward the car hysterical
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
she unlocks the door throws it open and sees something that makes her pull back in horror
little furious sits in the backseat
his hair sticks out wildly his face has become that now familiar mask of prisordial rage
another old dean martin song is heard as we
sitting alone in the booth a look of profound pain and lonliness on his face he is still that little boy
the dean martin song is playing on the juke
he looks up and sees monica
armed disco boys guard the front entrance
while on the hillside above invisible boy looking through binoculars and the spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds keeping the mansion under surveillance
in a whisper adolescence was the worst the other kids made fun of me so id spit on them and theyd scatter ive never had a girlfriend unless you count
that night with my cousin she recovered fully though we exchange cards every christmas well i send her one and she sends it back
spritzes somathing into his mouth then offers it to invisible boy bug repellent
suddenly the gates of the mansion open and several sedans
followed by a truck drive out
casanova and anabel sit in the front of the truck
where are they going
invisible boy hesitates for just a momnt then gets up and runs down the hill
runs after him kid
as the small convoy drives past invisible boy slips out from behind some trees runs after the truck jumps up and sits on its rear bumper
the spleen comes running after him and invisible boy reaches out grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him
invisible boy tries the rear gate
the two of them pull it up just a foot squirm inside then pull it closed behind them
invisible boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the inside of the truck
there is nothing in it except for a large pile of packing blankets
as the convoy drives through champion citys seedy waterfront area and out onto a long pier
dawn wong and don stouffer report the nights news
still no sign of millionaire lance hunt and now in an unrelated story another one of champion citys leading citizens has apparently disappeared
captain amazing has not been seen or heard from in a week
authorities believe that the hard working superhero may just be taking a well deserved rest
sounds good to me don
furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as monica serves him his burger and fries
i was wondering if uh maybe we i mean you and i could uh you know get a i mean have a
i get off work in fifteen minutes
walk me home
that was easy
goes back to work on furious feeling a whole lot better
from across the street
furious head is clearly visible in the brightly illuminated window of the diner
a disco boy stands in the shadows gazing at the diner he recognizes furious
the convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter docked at the pier
casanovas men throw the gate of the truck open and the camera moves in
no one is there but we notice
two large lumps under the packing blankets
casanova holds anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate being lowered from the deck of the freighter
honey our ships come in
casanovas cellular phone rings
the disco boy is on his phone
his pistol is drawn and hes got it aimed right at furious head
just give me the word
gets an idea wait
ill be right there
hangs up starts off peeved where are you going
a minute later casanova and two or three disco boys drive off in one of the sedans
as the crate is loaded onto the truck and the gate is pulled closed
the engine starts up and the truck starts to move as invisible soy and the spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets
they approach the crate and invisible boy shines his flashlight on it
the crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands theres no way theyre going to be able to get inside it but in the light of the flashlight they
faded red lettering in russian and the distinctive old hammer and sickle of the former soviet union
furious walks monica home
i admire you
being a superhero wanting to save the world
most people just want to make money or be famous or something
but you risk everything just to help people
after a moment i wouldnt mind being famous
in the shadows behind them
casanova follows stalking them as silent as a vampire
ive never been able to figure out what to do with my life which is why i guess im still a waitress
nothing wrong with being a waitress
whats your real name
have you always lived here
i love this stupid old town
its falling apart
monica smiling looking lovely
close n casanova he wants her
ive thought of leaving going to chicago or new york but
what have they got that we aint got
champions going to bounce back and i want to be here when it does
you dont seem very angry right now
and they kiss very tenderly
you know what
underneath all that anger i think theres just a little boy who wants everyone to love him
i just want to be a superhero
thats what i mean
she turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes inside as furious watches feeling emotions hees not used to
he really likes her
he starts walking back down the street past a man sitting on the stoop
the man looks up
its casanova frankenstein
going my way
furious is caught completely by surprise he takes a stand ready to fight
take it easy take it easy
i just want to have a little chat
that was quite a number you did on my car
youve got a lot of violence in you
and i like that in a guy
you know what the difference is between good and evil roy
furious reacts to the fact that casanova knows his real name
evil is more fun
when you want something you just take it and if somebody gets in your way you kill them
you seem like a very frustrated guy roy
what is it that youve always wanted always desired
because whatever it is i can give it to you
snaps his fingers easy
laughs the easiest of all
close on furious as out of the corner of his eye he catches movement in the alley across the street
he knows what it is
ill let you in on a little secret roy
in two days this entire city will belong to me and theres not a damn thing your little pals can do about it
its the perfect time to switch teams
so what do you say
quietly youre nuts
flairs they always call the great ones nuts
and the nuts always call themselves great
his psychosis showing are you with me
or against me
gunfire rings out from the alley as the disco bays step out their pistols blazing
but furious has anticipated them
he leaps right at casanova pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of fire
the disco bqys stop firing
furious drags casanova back into an empty lot using him as a shield
to casanova thanks for reminding me which team im on
so are you
furious releases casanova then runs for it and leaps over the wooden wall at the end of the lot
as the disco boys open fire again and their bullets punch holes through the wall
furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night
the convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure that we recognize from the model on the tv interview with casanova earlier
a high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of featureless concrete
it looks both totally modern and completely ancient but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully
angle on a plaque that reads
frankenstein center for the performing and non performing arts
the gates of the center open and the convoy passes through
invisible boy and the spleen stand listening waiting as they feel the truck pull to a stop
a moment later the gate is pulled opened
anabel is there with several thuggy looking security guards
be careful with my baby
there are two lumps under the packing blankets again
the crate is being carried away by a forklift
a beat and then invisible boy and the spleen slip out of the empty truck
and run down the road back toward the gates
which are still open
theyre just about to pass safely through them when a pair of armed security guards step in their path their guns pointed at thern
they freeze their hands held high
what are you two doing here
our heroes are mute
not talking eh
that can be fixed
turn around start walking up the hill and no funny business
invisible boy and the spleen turn hands in the air and start up the hill the guards right behind them
after a moment to invisible boy in a whisper pinch em
invisible boy pinches his nostrils and the spleen lets out with a horrendous fart
the guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as our heroes turn and run for it
escaping out the gates
invisible boy and spleen report to the others
whatever was in that crate
is from russia
the others consider this then hear a familiar voice
is there room in the pack for one more wolf
they look up and see that furious has just returned
the sphinx moves to him
for a moment they stand face to face
i was wrong
i need my friends
sphinx takes off his mask revealing that he is the busboy from the tacky taco
a few mimutes later
the others are gathered around furious listening to his story
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him
and there wasnt a thing that we could do about it
what did he mean
through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside the frankenstein center silhouetted ominously against it
raja shoveler and furious gaze at it
maybe its time we checked that place out
but how do we get in
after a moment sounding very sphinx like we just become like the wolf
who wears the sheeps clothing
classic disco stayin alive if we can get the rights furious raja and shoveler in street clothes walk down the street together and step into the doorway of
the salvation army thrift shop
close on three pairs of legs wearing polyester pants and vintage shoes ala the classic shot from saturday night fever
camera widens to reveal our three heroes dressed in full blown seventies attire with vintage sunglasses doing their best travolta strut down the street
music continues as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the art center right past the security guards
they climb the long stairs toward the center which looms above them
then pass through the big wooden doors and into
end music as our heroes move through a vast but empty main hall
a small army of heavily armed security guards marches about
so wheres the art
he hasnt stolen it yet
this place is built like a fortress
because thats what it is
they hear a wild burst of drunken laughter echoing through the hall
following the sound come on
they approach a doorway
the noise is coming from within
as our heroes step inside and see
a big luncheon is in progress
casanova anabel and tony p sit at the head table
the room is lined with banquet tables which are filled with vicious looking characters drunk eating laughing and giving the waitresses a very rough tim
stunned oh my god
every crook in the city is here
the bone heads from the south side
on three insipidly evil looking guys in hip suits
the bland boys from downtown
on a dark haired white guy dressed as a rapper
on a guy with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his face
the elvis brothers
a more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch
furious recognizes one of the waitresses
casanovas got his eye on her too and he remembers her from the night before on the street with furious
on anabel noticing his interest
our heroes see monica walking straight toward them
they turn away lean against a wail trying to be totally inconspicuous
but as she passes them not noticing them
casanova approaches her
she stops turns to him while our heroes listen in only a few feet away
reading her name tag monica
it suits you
close on furious getting jealous
i hope you wont take this the wrong way but i couldnt help but notice
that youre a dead ringer for veronica lake in the blue dahlia
raja gives him an elbow
are you an actress
just a waitress
you underestimate yourself
mister furious is fuming
the strands of his perfectly coiffed disco do start to stand straight up
you know im writing a play its just a little broadway thing but thures a part in it that i think youd be perfect for
id love to hear you read it
could you stick around after the luncheon
sure i guess
she turns and walks into the kitchen
close on casanova watching her his intentions are sinister
he turns and sees
our heroes hanging by the wall
what are you three doing here
this is invited guests only
our heroes skulk out
as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief
that was too close
but we gotta find out whats going on in there
furious has spotted
a large covered dessert table waiting to be wheeled into the hall
as the dessert table is wheeled in
and in a closer angle under the table cloth we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along
a few minutes later monica steps up to the dessert table
suddenly she is yanked under
monica struggles tries to cry out but a hand is clamped firmly over her mouth
she calms down and he takes his hand off her mouth
what are you guys doing here
the waitresses leave the big doors to the dining room are swung closed and the cigars are lit
the meeting has begun
casanova takes the podium
thank you all for coming
i hope you enjoy the cigars
i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them
tony p chuckles loudly but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with the rest of the crowd
twenty years ago this town was yours
and i on the hoods listening bored puffing on their cigars this is a sad old story
tragically but they called me a psycho and they put me away
for twenty years i rotted in my cell painting watercolors writing haikus just waiting for the day i could take my revenge
well brothers that day has come
on our heroes under the table listening
monica begins to realize whats going on
they thought i was crazy
well the jokes on them because tonight at precisely midnight on the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest every man woman and child in this city is going to turn
into a raving psycsotic
mothers will murder their tots
old ladies will strangle their cats
children will bump off their babysitters
the guests think casanovas completely lost it
italian ice speaks up
youre outta your mind
i beg your pardon
nobody could drive a whole city crazy
tell you what ice
ill mke you a friendly little wager
it i cant do it
you can blow my brains out
if i can ill blow out yours
now the hoods interest has been perked
to anabel with a smile honey give the boys a taste
anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors then presses a button on a small remote control device
angle on a speaker placed above the podium
as the air is suddenly filled with a weird stridulating horrific noise somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear and everyone in
the room except anabel goes completely berserk
camera pans the tables as the guests laugh dementedly punching gouging strangling and stabbing each other
under the serving table our heroes go crazy
casanova in a state of psychotic ecstasy whips out his pistol and empties it into italian ice
who drops to the floor dead
anabel presses the button again the sound winds down and stops and everything returns to normal
the entire event lasted only a few seconds but the guests are dazzled
that was great
what the hell was that
how did you do that
casanova throws anabel a kiss
tonight at midnight that sound will be amplified across this entire city
murder and mayhem will reign supreme
and champion city will be ours again
this will be our castle
and i will be our king
and theres no one to stop us
suddenly a familiar voice is heard
not so fast casanova
a pair of curtains suddenly part
and captain amazing looking a bit singed is standing there in classic superhero pose
camera pans the crooks as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to terror
they yank out their pistols dive for cover under the table throw up their hands in surrender etc
but casanova just grins
dont worry fellas
moves to captain amazing and puts his arm chummily around him i killed him
and ive had him stuffed
casaova reaches behind captain amazings back and pulls a string like the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls
in a canned voice isnt my butt cute in these tights
pulls again blue is my color
pulls again oh my abs are killing me
the crooks are beside themselves with laughter
on our heroes under the table stunned
the king is back
long live the king
the crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air as disco music fills the air and casanova dances basking in their adoration
and our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their escape
our heroes and monica pow wow sobered by what they have seen
what could have made such a horrible noise
after a moment gravely hes got the psychostridulator
ten years ago the kremlins top secret psychiatric warfare division developed a prototype for a weapon that emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a violent psychotic reaction in
any mammal within hearing distance
but when the old soviet union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor doctor kopov disappeared
this kopov what happened to him
they react to that piece of news and then the bowler opens up the newspaper
did she look like that
close on a photo of anabel and casanova announcing their wedding engagement
silence this is bad
hopefully maybe it wont work
a village in siberia was wiped out when a cleaning woman switched it on by mistake
another grim silence as they realize how desperate the situation is
for the first time theyre really scared
weve got to warn the city
no one will believe us
theyll think were just a bunch of weirdoes
camera cuts between them as they look at each other their frightened faces their sad faded costuznes
even the sphinx looks scared
after a moment grimly we know what we gotta do
they look at him
were outnumbered twenty to one
but this isnt about living or dying
its about good versus evil and were good whether we like it or not
maybe we look a little funny
and smell a little funny
were not bulletproof and we cant fly
but were superheroes and that means doing whats right even when its impossible
this is our city these are our friends our famlies and if we dont save them nobody will
so i say we take a ride up that hill blast our way in there destroy that psycho whatchamabob and teach those deviants a lesson theyll never forget
now youre talking
sounds good to me
lets do it
and well take a bunch of em with us
theyre all with him
monica steps forward
i just want you guys to know i may not be a superhero but im with you and i want to help
oh thats great
we could really use some coffee and some sandwiches with mustard
her feelings a little hurt sure
a few minutes later monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes plan
but that place is huge and we dont know where this psycho thing is or even what it looks like
and he must have it well hidden
well just have to get lucky
on monica as she gets an idea
a moment later she slips a canned tornado into her purse
as the others put their arms around each other in a group huddle embrace
go do what you gotta do
well meet back here at sunset
do or die
do or die
victoria o morte
heroic music as
the front grill of the herkimer battle jitney
as mister furious hooks it up to the sallys auto demolition tow truck
a moment later he drives the tow truck towing the off the lot as sally steps out of her office pissed off
on the sphinx standing as immobile and silent as a statue
as a falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him
in a flash his machete slices through the air and the leaf continues fluttering down but in two pieces
doc heller fine tunes his shrinker spray
as the bowler sits quietly in the hayloft studying the old dog eared photo of her father and herself as a little girl
invisible boy stands in front of his mirror eyes closed concentrating for all hes worth trying to become invisible
he suddenly pops opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror
but hes still completely visible
he flops onto his bed in frustration
close on a table full of food
eggplant parmesan broccoli chili
cakera pulls back to reveal the spleen sitting alone in the booth stuffing his face gassing up for battle
the shoveler standing in his bedroom has just put on his freshly laundered suit
camera opens wide to reveal lucille his wife standing there holding his just polished shovel
he takes it from her then takes her in his arms
baby if i dont make it
a normal guy
i dont want a normal guy
and they kiss
a few minutes later
in the living room the shovelers kids lie sprawled in front of the television
the shoveler in battle array steps into the room
be wants to say something to them but the kids dont even take their eyes off the tv look at him
he turns and walks out in silence
the shades are drawn
the raja in full costume quietly loads silverware into the secret pockets of his cape
suddenly the light switches on
its his mother
shes caught him red handed
jeffrey you thief
its not what you think
and why are you wearing that silly costume
im a superhero
on his mother shocked
oh mother im sorry
i know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family but its just not who i am
i use it
to fight evil
after a moment jeffrey
this is wonderful
stunned it is
i always knew that you were special
ever since you were a little boy
gets an idea excited come with me
she pulls down the stairway to the attic
she switches on the light and leads the raja to a far corner
where she moves a couple of old hat boxes revealing an ancient leather bound box with the word excalibur engraved in gold on the top
this is for you
the raja opens the box and registers astonisha nt as he sees
a fabulous victorian silver set packed with formidable looking servers cake knives ice cream forks
your great great grandmothers wedding silver
the raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server
mister furious wrench in hand covered with grease and oil cussing to himself as he works under the hood of the herkimer
try it again
invisible boy sitting behind the wheel tries the ignition of the herkimer and the old engine grinds as it turns over but doesnt catch
come on baby
come on baby
i said come mister furious slugs the engine with his fist and it sputters and backfires into life
shaking rattling leaking exploding but running
furious kisses the herkimer
as the bowler calls out to him from the barn
mon capitan its for you
tosses him the phone hello
on a phone speaking very softly its me
monica where are you
revealing that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center
shes wearing make up and a sexy little dress she looks shes dressed for a date
disco boys and security guards go about their business all around her
at the frankenstein center
are you nuts
get out of there
im going inside
what are you talking about
listen casanova may be a supervillain but hes got a weakness and im it
maybe just maybe i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing
hes a psycho
hell kill you
just shut up and listen
hold off the attack as long as you can
if i can discover the location ill call you and what if you get killed
then at least i will have died trying right
furious silent taken aback by her courage
we might never see each other again so id better tell you now
i think youre wonderful
caught completely off guard what
and she hangs up monica
as monica approaches a guard standing by the main door
could you tell mr
frankenstein that monica is here
furious stands by the herkimer phone still in hand
he seems speechless dazed
something inside him has changed
worried about him hey
casanova steps out and sees
monica looking very sexy
i thought youd chickened out on me
just wanted to
powder my nose
his eyes roam all over her he knows shes up to something but she looks yummy and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves
how bout giving me the tour
as casanova leads monica across an open courtyard toward
the sheer walls of the imposing central tower
big isnt it
he leads her to a massive archway the only apparent entrance to the tower
but just as she is about to pass through monica looks up and sees something that makes her pull back with fear
a very sinister looking security eye gazes down at her from the top of the archway
its not activated
they pass through and into
which is filled with immense bronze sculptures of voluptuous scantily clad females in various poses of bondage
monica reacts these things are scary
whos the artist
the bowler spleen invisible boy and doc heller load up the herkimer with hellers weaponry
as mister furious lies sprawled on the hillside
breathing in the night air contemplating a dandelion gone to seed and listening to the sounds of the night
the raja shoveler and sphinx stand nearby watching trying to figure out whats wrong with him
a whippoorwill is heard singing
and he doesnt care who knows it
raja and shoveler share a bewildered look
the bird sings again
were all the same really
our songs our dreams our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever
blows the dandelion seeds into the wind he is in love
his anger is gone
has monica called
casanova leads monica into
a palatial room filled with priceless objects dart all of which reflect casanovas dark psyche
a munch painting
weird german furniture
a huge glass chandelier hovers over the room
a massive bronze sculpture of a wolf done in the same style as the other sculptures is perched in the balcony
it seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a spectacular view spread out alonq the lakeshore below
this is where i come to
he turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to the room
close on monica sensing her danger
oh look at that view
she moves out onto the balcony
as casanova slips the gold chain from around his neck and follows her
our heroes have gathered around furious who sits in a chair getting the third degree
snap out of it
get on to yourself
shouting right in his face but i just dont feel it
hes turned into a completely normal person
does normal exist
and if it did how would we know it
the shoveler slugs him sending him sprawling
you know eddie that was really uncalled for
gazing out onto the city as she senses casanova slinking up behind her
she turns elegantly avoiding him and moving back inside
spleen holds up furious favorite sunglasses
your favorite sunglasses
snaps them in two your roy rogers coffee mug
hurls it against the wall your spiderman pez dispenser
breaks the head off it okay you win
im pissed off
im seriously peeved
the others groan with frustration
monica moves nervously around the room as casanova sprawls languorously on the bed toying with his gold chain
im not that kind of girl
then why are you here
with a smile remember the cat
suddenly he hears high heels in the hall
a key is put in the lock casanova leaps off the bed grabs monica and roughly shoves her into the closet
he leaps back onto the bed just as the door opens and anabel dressed in a lab coat and wearing high heels enters
casanova is completely relaxed nonchalant
what are you doing all alone in the dark
she crosses the room to the wolf sculpture
i thought you were done
one last tweak
she opens a secret panel on its back revealng a flashing high tech interior
and monica watching from the closet realizes that she has found the psychostridulator
a boom box
a cd jacket tells us that kenny g
if this doesnt do it nothing will
on furious a pair of headphones on his head
the music is so loud that we can hear it even though its being played only through the headphones
on the others gathered around him waiting to see if this will work
and then furious begins to respond
as his face turns into a contorted grimace
furious groans and writhes
the others are thrilled theyve done it
this music is just so beautiful
he starts to weep
the others give a collective groan of defeat
as anabel works on the psychostridulator monica looks at a clock
which reads almost eleven
time is running out
which also reads eleven
with or without him we gotta go
as anabel closes up the wolf
and starts to leave
our guests are waiting
ill be down in a jiffy
she goes out
casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away then he goes to the closet and lets monica out
id better go
youre a spy
i saw him walk you home
she makes a sudden try for the door but he blocks her way a cold look in his eye that makes her step back in fear
dont be afraid
i never hit a lady
he lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand then starts coming for her a sadistic grin on his face
this is the real casanova
monica pulls back then reaches into her purse and takes out a canned tornado which she holds out threateningly
or youll what
he laughs dementedly as monica pops open the can and a swirling funnel of air shoots out of it and engulfs casanova throwing him across the room
monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the door
on casanova pulling himself together
as monica runs for it dialing the phone on the fly
but no one is there
our heroes are climbing into the herkimar whose noisy idling engine obliterates the ringing of the phone
but she still might call
are you coming or not
not a chance
he shoves him in the back closing the heavy steel door behind him
hiding behind a large planter
listening to the phone ringing on the other end
come on guys
suddenly we hear casanovas voice on the line
whats the matter
casanova is listening in on another phone
as she moves quickly down the hall
the shoveler is at the wheel
the raja sits in the passenger seat
the others are in the back
here we go
he forces the stick into gear and the herkimer lurches forward
weve got lift off
may the forks be with us
as the herkimer backfiring smoking clanging rumbles down the driveway into action
shoveler tries to put the car in second gear but it wont go
he yanks and pulls and struggles until the stick comes off in his hand
first is good
casanova instructs three security guards
i want her alive
camera pans up the top of a staircase
where monica is crouched listening
various shots as the herkimer rumbles and smokes down champions main street in first gear and the citizens step out of houses and bars to watch this bizarre sight
daddy what is that thing
i dont know son
a couple of grizzled characters stand in front of a bar
those yuppies will drive anything
on furious and the others in the back
amigo we need you
just get mad
furious closes his eyes and tries but its hopeless
a sumptuous hotel like lounge
anabel is holding court with all of top crooks from the luncheon charrning the pants off them
casanova slithers up behind her
fellas this is woman without whom i would have gone sane
kisses her neck a pair of security guards the same two who got gassed by the spleen are on duty when they see
a strange looking vehicle chugging up the hill straight for them
what the hell is that
a ford dumpster
they have a good laugh at it then hold up their hands for it to stop
but the herkimer just rolls past them hitting the iron gates and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks
they open fire
bullets are heard pinging off the herk as through the windshield just ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art center
several more guards open fire as the herkimer hits the stairs and starts bouncing up them
checking his watch
but then they all hear
the sound of gunfire
as the herkimer chugs and bounces
toward the entrance of the center
our heroes get bounced all over the place
as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center
on a guard wearing a headset
frankenstein were being attacked
casanova sits at a security console
anabel tony p and the top crooks stand behind him listening
we dont know
as the herkimer climbs to the top then rams into the doors with a thud
but the doors hold
theyll never get through those doors
but the plucky little herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes against the doors like the little engine that could
as our heroes encourage the herk
come on baby
do it big boy
on its wheels grinding chewing up the concrete
as the herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the center scattering the guards
our heroes cheer pat the herk
watching on a security monitor mr
frankenstein theyre in
well kill them
the herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of security guards swarms in guns blazing
casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor
the bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the herk as our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle
the sphinxs puts on his mask
the bowler unzips her bag
doc heller cocks his air cannon
spleen and invisible boy load a bag with canned tornadoes
while mister furious watches anxiously
the shoveler drives intently bullets splattering like bugs on the windshield
where am i going
pointing to an archway on the other side of the hall through there
but suddenly something under the hood blows up the engine gives a long groan and the herkimer rolls to a dead stop
right in the middle in the most exposed position of the main hall
more guards arrive and open fire
an armored golf cart with a fifty caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall blasting the herk
inside the sound of the big bullets is deafening as shoveler tries to restart the engine
on casanova and the crooks watching the monitor and laughing as bullets pulverize the herk
spam in a can
the crooks laugh
butsuddenly the herkimers door is thrown open revealing our heroes holding down doc heller his air cannon at the ready
he fires there is a whoomph of air and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent tumbling
as our heroes come charging out of the herkimer using their various skills to blow through the surprised guards
furious comes out last not quite sure what to do with himself
but suddenly a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony overlooking the floor
bullets splatter all around them and several unlucky guards are hit but our heroes dive for cover
the raja tries to get off a fork but the firing is too intense
our heroes are pinned down
furious as he sees
the bag of canned tornadoes
hes got no superpowers and hes scared to death but he grabs a canned tornado
bullets dancing all around him furious runs a desperate but impressive zig zag pattern across the floor
he performs a wild somersault comes up on his feet pops open the can and executes a perfect jump shot lobbing it right into the balcony
the tornado funnels out and the guards are sent flying
on casanova and the top crooks watching
who are those guys
close on casanova who knows who they are
while back in the hall our heroes rally around a shaken mr
not bad for a normal guy
do or die
the security eye watching
as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower
as he types something into the security computer
on the screen a computerized image of the eye appears
casanova highlights the word activate and then presses enter
as it comes to glowing sinister life
a hapless guard retreats under the arch the eye instantly focuses on him and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams
that sizzle a moment later our heroes arrive at the arch
furious is about to run through but doc heller holds him back
he points to
a man shaped pile of charcoal all that remains of the unfortunate guard
and its a humdinger
the raja takes out a butter knife aims and hurls it straight at the eye but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into
a formless blob of silver
well take care of these clowns
piece a cake
as tony p the top crooks and the disco boys march en masse toward the camaera
they are an ugly formidable looking bunch
our heroes are blocked by the eye
doc theres got to be a way
but the doc is stymied
suddenly they hear a womans voice calling down to them
its up here
its up here
looks up monica
monica leans over the edge of the balcony the wolf sculpture looming over her shouting down at them
but strong hands suddenly grab her
as high above he hears monica scream
casanova hand held tightly across monicas mouth shouts down tauntingly to furious
shes just my type
you can have her back
when im done
as he hears casanovas evil laugh and monicas scream
he is desperate to find a way up but the wall is completely sheer
he feels helpless frantic near tears
flash to the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p arents car crying pounding on the windows
furious hands clench into fists his hair stands up and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage
his button has finally been pressed
he reaches up as high as he can
as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall
and he pulls himself up
casanova throws monica onto the bed puts his hands on her throat and strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength
fifty feet up and climbing
he pulls himself up one hand then another digging in his fingernails catchng his toes on whatever tiny cracks he can find
as the others gaze up at him
hell never make it
meanwhile invisible boy stands staring at the security eye a look of fierce determination on his face
this is his moment
to himself i can do it
he takes a deep breath closes his eyes and concentrates
on furious as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold gives way
for a desperate moment furious is dangling off the wall by the tips of the fingers of one hand
only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut
suddenly there is a flash of silver and a large cake fork embeds in the concrete not far from his head
furious grabs hold of it and throws a grateful look down to the raja
who salaams up at him
as invisible boy eyes closed in concentration walks very slowly hands at his sides in an almost egyptian pose
toward the eye
which stares down mercilessly waiting for its next victim
we notice that invisible boy has become
just slightly transparent
a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles monica
her resistance fades
her hands fall away
she is pale beautiful almost gone a picture of exquisite death
admiring her some girls just know how to die
suddenly we hear someone cursing casanova in russian
he turns and sees
anabel standing there pistol in hand
you two timing psychotic bastard
darling youve got the wrong idea
aiming at his heart do i
i was only strangling her
ive killed hundreds of women
it doesnt mean a thing
moving toward her turning on that old frankenstein charm pootchkie youre over reacting
this is our night
its what weve lied for
shes just a plaything a trifle
youre the only woman whos ever meant anything to me
i adore you
i worship you
i want to make you my bride
she succumbs to his charms and he gently takes the pistol out of her hand
theres just one thing
with a psychotic smile i dont need you anymore
a look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his eyes
dont worry darling
i never hit a lady
still climbing as he hears a scream looks up
and sees anabel go plummeting past him
on our heroes down below
camera holds on our heroes wincing as anabel hits with an ugly thud
suddenly they hear invisible boy calling to them
guys i did it
i did it
they all turn and see
invisible boy totally visible but standing on the other side of the arch
can you see me
kid turn that thing off
invisible boy turns and sees
a computer screen built into the wall with the same image of the eye on it that was on casanovas computer but he doesnt have a clue how to turn
suddenly he hears running feet turns and sees
the top crooks and the disco boys rushing towards him through the giant sculptures
he gets an idea
and stands right in front of the computer screen
he makes a face at them and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him
he jumps clear behind a pillar as the bullets smash into the wall
one of them demolishing the computer screen
as it goes dead
on invisible boy hiding behind the pillar
realizing hes been shot in the shoulder
this is it
do or die
the villains form a line bristling with pistols
as our heroes led by sphinx shoveler and bowler come running through the arch
the threesome go shoulder to shoulder with our other heroes right behind them as the villains open fire laying down a deadly fusillade
on shoveler bowler and sphinx standing together deflecting their bullets with shovel bowling ball and machete
as they practiced with pebbles at the farm
with the raja right behind them hurling silverware
on the villains rapid firing
but their own bullets ricochet back into them dropping them
they start to fall back
casanova is about to finish monica
and the light goes out
casanova turns and sees
furious standing on the balcony
what took you so long
furious starts at casanova who aims anabels pistol at him
let me guess
bullets dont hurt you
but they dont stop me
furious lunges at casanova who gets off a shot before furious grabs the gun out of his hand
casanova ducks clear
furious tosses the pistol away
then realizes hes bleeding from a shoulder wound
smarts doesnt it
shall we dance
he turns on his stereo and the sound of disco music fills the air
downstairs the villains have regrouped
lets rush em
they charge en mass at our heroes
who are waiting for them
pinching their noses closed the spleen bent over at their forefront
while casanova dances around furious like a cat
furious fighting the pain of his bullet wound lunges at him and casanova neatly sidesteps him
the crooks and disco boys fall back gasping choking in the noxious fumes
as casanova attacks
advancing shoulder to shoulder fighting as a team our heroes wield machete fork shovel bowling ball and canned tornado
forcing the villains back
casanova comes at furious relentlessly kicking and spinning
and furious gets the worst of it
suddenly a squad of disco boys comes charging at our heroes from the flank
but doc heller turns to face them shrinker spray held rambo style on his hip
he lets them have it blasting them with a dense when the spray clears the d boys lie squirming on the floor prisoners in their now child sized disco suits
get me out of this
upstairs casanova pummels furious
while downstairs the shoveler dispatches the elvis brothers with some nifty shovel work
but suddenly the bland boys pistols blazing are advancing on him forcing him back against the base of a sculpture
but the raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture
the bland boys look up and see
the raja both hands filled with silverware
which he hurls
a beat later the bland boys bristling with forks and grapefruit spoons run screaming through the sculptures
as tony p pistol in hand skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots
upstairs furious goes flying against a wall
roy youre making this too easy
as tony p takes a careful bead on the bowler
say hello to daddy for me
he opens fire but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy
he fires missing shes too fast to keep a bead on
finally his gun clicks empty
she turns and faces him
grimly daddy says hello
she hurls the ball at him like a fiery softball pitch
going straight for tony ps screaming head
on the bowler watching as tonys scream is cut short by a gruesose thud
back upstairs casanova cornmes at furious again
but furious ducks the kick pops back up and smashes casanova with his good arm
sending him flying across the room
lets change the tune
he reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device that anabel used at the luncheon
he presses a button
on the wolf sculpture as the jaws open its eyes glow red
and the dreadful sound of the psychostridulator grinds up and fills the night downstairs the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the villains all go into a
full blown psychotic episode
the villains start shooting and stabbing each other
on main street cars slam into each other
pedestrians start screaming and fightinq
a man and his dog snarl and snap at each other
the customers at the lakeside diner go insane hurling plates and food
at the shovelers house the kids turn psycho in front of the television
as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be heard coming from all the houses
as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city
in full psychotic ecstasy
tosses the remote off the balcony on monica still motionless on the bed
casanova and furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength
casanova gets his hands around furiouss throat and crushes it
furious drops to his knees and casanova thinks hes got him
but furious grimacing with rage looks him right in the eye
raspy voiced is
all you got
furious grabs casanovas wrists
and crushes them
casanova howls with pain loses his grip
furious slugs him again and again
then he grabs casanova by the belt swings him around and hurls him into the air
casanova crashes into the huge crystal chandelier there is an explosion of crystal and glass
furious averts his eyes as cut glass rains down all around him
then he looks up and sees
casanovas gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier
casanova kicks and flails
as he is hanged by the neck on his own gold chain
furious moves to the wolf sculpture
be plunges his hand through its bronze casing and rips out the heart of the psychostridulator a flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed but higher pitched and
more irritating sound
furious hurls the device hard against the floor and it smashes into a thousand pieces
in insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched even more disorienting sound
this is the very nerve center of the psychostridulator
furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel
furious drops to his knees wounded exhausted
he looks up
at casanova who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier
nice dancing with you
as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished crooks
the traumatized reunants of whom run for it
things also return to normal
on the street
at the lakeside diner
and at the shovelers house
furious moves to the bed where monica lies motionless and pale
he touches her face her eyes open and she looks at him
youre beautiful when youre angry
he takes her tenderly in his arm
as the raja the shoveler and the others rush into the room and see
furious and monica embracing
police cars and news vans arrive
as our heroes battered wounded but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs
furious and monica hold each other up
wounded invisible boy has his arm around the spleen
while policemen and news people run up the stairs past them into the center ignoring them as always
but this time our heroes could care less
they are superheroes and they dont give a damn who knows it
as the raja opens the door and enters
she is there waiting up for him
don stouffer is reporting
few details have emerged
on the shovelers kids on the couch still rattled by their psychotic episode glued to the tv but the dawn patrol got this exclusive interview vith two of the suspects
dawn wong interviews the battered handcuffed elvis brothers as they are led away
i dont know who those guys were but i never want to see em again
especially that big dude with the shovel
near tears he was the worst
on the kids collective reaction as they realize who it was
and then they hear the front door open
in the front hall the shoveler enters wearily his shoulder hurts his back is killing him
as his kids come running to him
shocked by this welcome im okay im all right
lean on me dad
ill hold your shovel dad
they lead him back into the living room and give him the prime spot on the couch
you want a soda dad
he runs to get it as eddie jr
slides a footstool under his feet and tracy puts a pillow behind his back
roland the little one cuddles up next to him puts his arm around him
you really are a superhero arent you
the shoveler nods
a few minutes later
the shoveler sits on the couch feet up soda in hand
the television is off
his kids all huddled around him hanging on his every word
and thats when the engine blew up
what did you do
on lucille as she comes in and sees
her husband surrounded by his kids a happy man at last
sitting between the bowler and a bandaged invisible boy
the bowler has her arm chummily around the spleens shoulder
the spleen finally has real friends
doc heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the raja as the shoveler listens in
the sphinx sits at the end of the table silent
so youre never actually conscious of range or trajectory
i just chuck em
monica in her waitress outfit sits close to a bandaged mister furious
dawn wong reports
its been twenty four hours since the deadly psycho sonic attack and bloody shoot out that left casanova frankenstein and dozen of the citys top hoodlums dead
but tonight the question remains
who were these heroic mystery men who saved our city
could have been anybody
wait a minute
thats our name
the mystery men
they all like it except for the bowler
hey do i look like a man
well we cant call ourselves the mystery people
singing ala macho man mystery mystery man
i want to be a mystery man
eat your mustard
it doesnt matter what we call ourselves
we know who we are
yes obie wan
the others see
that the sphinxs chair is empty
raja spots a crumpled napkin on the table opens it up and reads
until you need me again
reactions from our heroes as they realize that the sphinx is gone
i miss him already
suddenly somewhere in the night a burst of gunfire and screams are heard
the final music begins
amigos duty calls
the mystery men wolf their burgers then stand and start for the street
as monica watches them leave a patron asks her miss
who are those guys
after a moment i dont know
heroic group shot as the mystery men merch down the middle of street toward the sound of the gunfire
and into the night
