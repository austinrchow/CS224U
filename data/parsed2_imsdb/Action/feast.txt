written by patrick melton marcus dunston revised draft the white sun beats down on the rocky terrain
theres not a cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill
far in the distance a medium sized flat bed truck makes its way to the entrance of a large cavern opening
two vultures perched on a barren tree watch the intruders
the truck screeches to a dusty stop
three men in matching coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab chief stocky weary lanky withered and college boy clean cut and naive
chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth before them
this is it
why did it have to be these caves
is something wrong
to college boy dont mind me buddy
chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck
the logo on the rear gate reads wigwam waste management
lets get that first barrel
the gate drops revealing their full load of yellow barrels bearing the familiar biohazard waste symbol
college boy and lanky steer a cart loaded with the first barrel inside
chiefs lone beam of light leads the men
whats with the awkward silence
you dont know
college boy shakes his head no and they set the cart down
last winter a man kidnapped a little girl and holed up in one of these caves
the cops had him pinned down and began to move in
this guy started shooting
but he wasnt aiming at the officers
getting closer he was firing at something inside
college boy is rapt
when the dust cleared all they found was the little girls shoes
beat with the feet still in em
something grabs college boys ankles causing him to jump
lankys on his knees having grabbed him from behind
the two men mockingly laugh
college boy settles embarrassed
hey relax i nearly shit myself when my boss pulled that one on me
i went well beyond nearly
then a sound
all eyes turn
what was that
once was plenty fellas
as chief moves forward pulling out his pick axe
instantly the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight
a group of greenpeace hippie activists stand in the cave chained together at the waist startling the men into screams
mean green crooked glasses on a face that has launched a thousand craps barks into a mini bullhorn that hangs around her neck
she charges towards chief
stop it right there
you will not rape mother nature one more day
panicked chief drops his pick axe and stumbles back
in unison the hippies start chanting
mother nature is not a whore dont dump in her any more mother nature is not a whore dont dump in her any more
a bearded cameraman with a huge key ring on his belt films the whole event
the three men are stopped in their tracks
take it easy
we have a permit
handing a document and we have an injunction from the state to prevent any dumping in these caverns
this is virgin land
the aqueducts in these caves bring drinking water to our families and its piping provides drainage for our farms that enrich this barren land
and it wont be tainted by waste of any kind
chief shaken confirms the injunction and hands it back
fine just back off
he snaps his fingers motioning to the barrel
now now now
backing away looking to mean green
how do you guys always know where were going
with a smirk ill tell ya next time
now move it
hastily the men roll the barrel out of the cave
score one for the green team
the hippies let out a spirited cheer
one pulls out a tambourine drums the beat for kum bi ya
the rest join in the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their truck and peel away
hey man that was righteous but i need a shot with the sign up
at the end of the human chain an earthy woman fuzzy moves to hang a greenpeace sign
mean green strokes the cave wall
we saved you today ol gal
fuzzy hammers the sign in but hits too hard causing a breach in the rock wall
sister why do you always swing for the fences
eyeing breach its okay but i
i think i see something in there
fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look
the rest of the hippie chain moves in closer
oh my it looks like diamonds
a set of giant ravenous teeth bite into fuzzys skull
blood splatters on the hippies
bearded cameraman jumps to pull fuzzy from the breach
fuzzys body is yanked into the hole
the group tumbles forward
mean green tries to stop herself from sliding but cant
one by one the hippies are being dragged to their death
ripping tearing and howling echoes off the walls
bearded cameraman stumbles back
mean green spots him
give me the keys
bearded camerman just stares at her in shock
hes missing both his arms
mean green lunges and grabs chiefs dropped pick axe
she hammers at the chain around her waist
foot by foot shes dragged closer
at the last second she breaks the chain popping herself free
she spins running for safety
a guttural howl behind her fills the cavern
mean green sprints toward the cave opening
shes gonna make it
only a few more feet
something grabs her neck and yanks her back into the darkness
the whiplash sends her bloody bullhorn flying into the light
as it lands it lets out one last weak honk
the title shatters
we frantically emerge from the burning wreck
run from the crash over desolate prairie land
neon light flashes united nations tavern
laughing and music emanates
besides the bar theres nothing around for miles
a pristine black pontiac trans am with a golden eagle on the hood pulls up
the rear bumper sticker reads my other a weasel like man with a fat belly and tank top emerges from the hot rod carrying a velvet pool cue case
freeze on him
the rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup trucks
bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes through the front entrance bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well over six foot five
with frazzled black hair and olive skin
talking with a thick greek accent he pleads into a pay phone
into pay phone they took my laptop with my powerpoint presentation my blackberry my cell
and to top it off my car crapped out on the side of the road
im not making the conference and i have fourteen leads waiting for me
you gotta help me out here
im not kidding ive have fourteen primo leads waiting in the lobby of the mariott
freeze on him
the pay phone goes dead
son of a deep breath soothing in with anger out with love
further into the bar a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter into an old jukebox but he is instantly pushed away by bozo
freeze on him
bozos tank top reads only cool chicks can do me
rolling away hey
shut up fag
bozo punches in his selection
edgy cat samurai pony tail dont you dare call him an alcoholic stands by the bars pool table powdering his cue
to bozo youre late
dont dilly dally then
the cd spins and an s heavy metal classic kicks in
bozo mouthing the lyrics struts away
note music plays over all the bar sequences
we continue to run
beer guy kinda handsome
just kinda sets a keg of beer behind the bar
freeze on him
he talks with bartender thinning hair chiseled face big earring who preps a drink
i mean wed been together for so long and then
she drops me
since then its been like a damn country song shes gone the cars repossessed and a father figure made a pass at me
im not saying i ever had it
but i have definitely lost it
beat now i haul this swill from armpit to armpit
i used to be a model for christs sake
coach has been eavesdropping on beer guy and approaches
for what may i ask
beer guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder and delivering his model cheese smile
you know chach catching you at this low point is pure serendipity
why is that
because i take the rubble of man and build superstars
in my briefcase here is a doorway to a self help sensation
give me a minute because id like to buy you a drink and change your life forever
i have a brochure save it
we dont deal in pamphlets round here
we stick to chemistry
and his drinks are on me
bartender puts a shot in front of beer guy
behind him a mounted deer head is prominently displayed
freeze on him
with coach stumped bartender turns to beer guy
was that the last keg
yup one keg of beast for the basement then the trucks dry
if youre stayin move the truck boss gets pissed about you using primo parking
beer guy downs his shot and hoists the lone keg into the waiting keg elevator
right cause this joints hopping
he hits a button and the keg slowly lowers to the basement
we jump over a bush and crash in the dusty earth
a glass of beer slides down the bar
a hand grabs it and puts it on a tray
the woman is pretty though haggard stained apron and dirty blond hair
freeze on her
tuffy carries the tray toward a table
she passes a tv mounted on the wall
on tv a newscaster dressed in a coat and tie talks
the search for the missing protesters will be further complicated by the unstable conditions of these deep tunnels
thus far no sign of life has been detected yet town officials are still optimistic
newscaster spins and an eclipse graphic appears on screen
on a brighter note or should i say a darker note tomorrows solar eclipse will bring out adults and children alike for a citywide fair of this metrological event
stay tuned for our man on the street to take a closer look
beer guy pulls the keg from the elevator and places it next to other kegs
a faint conversation brews behind a curtain
boss man paunchy sweaty ugly and roadie english accent light hair leather skin thin build talk shop
i got a load ready to move and your mans not here
and if he doesnt show we got a problem
we are trucking
tuffy moves to a table where adulterer bushy mustache sweater vest dress shirt sits with trampy designer glasses hair pulled back tight blue business suit closet tramp
freeze on trampy
he said there was no reason i had to stay a teller and that if i did good work and didnt mess up i could become an assistant manager within
pause can you believe that
that sounds great
freeze on him
adulterer reaches into his pocket to pay the tab but he inadvertently pulls out his hidden wedding ring
that sounds like bullshit
i could be an assistant manager at the lake arrowhead casino for knowing the fuckin alphabet to g
ill be twenty in three months
the damning wedding band falls and bounces
as it rolls tuffy trampy and adulterer watch
the ring stops standing still on its side
trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver
adulterer slides a wad of cash to tuffy
just bring the whole bottle
sprinting and wheezing
the bar lights are ahead
tuffy walks back over to the bar adding adulterers cash to a fat roll of money
belle stringy blond hair cute face brand spanking new employee looks up with surprise
freeze on her
if i could made that kind of money id be in hollywood next week
boss man walks by and nods to tuffy making his way to the rickety side staircase to the second floor
tuffy grinds her teeth and moves to the staircase
round here there are ways
boss man winks at belle
freeze on him
running approaching the distant bar
bozo looks grimly at a pile of cash on the ledge of the pool table
edgy cat sinks the eighth shot of a nine ball game
that cash is gonna look much better in my pocket
re mounted head ya know that deer only looks scared when youre in the room
para rolls up behind edgy
excuse me please
edgy looks to para distracted
bozo quickly replaces the white cue ball with one hidden in his waistline
the bars a quarter mile away
paras chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which edgy cat is lining up for the winning shot
thats all she wrote
the nine ball sinks in the pocket the cue ball ricochets away as intended
para flips a switch under his wheelchairs arm rest
the cue ball strays oddly into the pocket near para
ohhh now thats a rough one
thats motherfuckin impossible
crude oriental accent yoh anga will be yoh downfah
oh come on
bozo takes the cash from the table
edgy cat sulks away cursing to himself and moves to the bar
roadie looks on sipping a beer
freeze on roadie
the bar is getting closer
bozo hits the table of grandpa elderly white hair bushy white mustache and grandma curly white hair glasses
freeze on them
check your pants
get outta here
mocking whats that
to grandma how much for the whole night grandma
you should be so lucky
re his fists this one will stun ya but this one will put ya to sleep
bozo approaches old vet long hair with bandanna dirty beard harley mom bruiser grizzled tough as a saddle and drunk guy at the bar
the sad trio toss peanut shells into three nearby tall fat peanut barrels
you boys wanna try your luck at the loot
harley mom is offended
not a word from the others
come on ill even throw with my left hand
he turns in disappointment
nothin but a bunch of butts and pussies in here
the bar is close we leap a ditch
belle drops a tray full of drinks behind the bar
dont sweat it just clean it up before hes done
he points up to the second floor
tuffys son cody innocent cute sits on the floor watching tv
freeze on him
tuffy puts headphones over his ears
keep these on sweetheart
mommy i want nemo
mommys working on it
tuffy kisses him and then moves to an adjacent room
tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her breasts
she pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost
lets get this over with
boss man walks up naked except for red cowboy boots
i love a woman with enthusiasm
bozo walks to the middle of the room
i got two hundred bucks says none of you can beat me
get quiet or get out
cmon guys p
hurtling toward the double doors and gimme some action boom
the double doors to the bar are kicked open by hero s rugged alpha man built to kick ass
belle drops a second tray of drinks hero is scraped bruised and bloodied
he is dressed in blue denim and holds a rust red shotgun and gunny sack
he slams the double doors shut and props a chair against the handles securing them
unless you people want to die youll do what i say and youll do it fast
bartender cocks his shotgun
you hold it right there mister
a storm of hells coming down on this place any minute
drop the canon
hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards bartender
im not armed now just hear me out
ill drop you and not even think about it
let me explain
you got one second to hero reveals a drool dripping white grandpa beast head from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see
take a good look and listen to me
theres at least a four of these things out there
grandpa beasts head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full of jagged ivory white teeth
it is like an albino jackal head with spiked hair
i saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob
off silence shock i dont know what they are
i dont know where they came from
all i do know is that these fuckers are fast nasty and hungry
the bar stares at him slack jawed
and they can fly
not to mention they got claws like ginsu knifes and more teeth than a chainsaw
the bartender lowers his shotgun slightly
fast as a snake hero grabs it
he notices the engraving the judge
theyre like goddamn blood hungry biker tattoos come to life
theyre clocking us
and we have to lock this bar down
moving around that means doors windows drains and basements
we have to do it fast
hero looks out the lone front window
looks to belle you
get on that phone
call the cops national guard townies whoever kicks ass and get em out here
belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar
who are you
im the hero crash
a white beast arms bursts through the window and splits hero right down the middle
the judge fires into the ceiling the judges blast blows a toe off boss mans right foot as he reaches climax with tuffy
boss man hollers
heros right half is jerked outside through the window
the double doors are kicked open splintering the propped up chair
heroine native american rugged ripped pants wickedly hot rushes in slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks up the rust red shotgun
she flips it sideways and slides the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors securing them
a massive hit slams into the doors from the outside sending heroine sliding across the floor
she springs to her feet and drives her weight into a table attempting to hoist it over the now open window
old vet and harley mom rush to heroines aid
they raise the table to cover the gaping hole
heroine looks outside
a beast nails the rising table just missing heroines face
the table falls pinning heroine
junior beast enters
hes small and too fast to see well
he swipes the heads off old vet and harley mom
bartender grabs the judge but hes scratched down the back
junior beast rips out the pay phone
knocks over the tv
yanks out half of trampys hair
edgy cat charges the spastic monster with a stool
i got you
edgy cat misses
junior beast sends him flying into a wall
bartender fires the judge at the creature hitting lights instead
an errant shot destroys edgy cats face
para covers as junior beast rips the back of his wheelchair
roadie whacks junior beast with a chair
stunned it flies across the room landing in a metal ice cooler
bozo slams it closed capturing junior beast
shadows of three shrieking beasts close in on the window
bartender runs across the bar and slams shut the thick wood shutters
the beasts hit cracking the middle
roadie power lifts the table with heroine and braces it against the window for reinforcement but a furry arm busts through and grabs the other half of hero
blood starts to spray from outside as the rest of hero is being devoured through the smallish hole
heroine works a gold ring off of heros ring finger
the feeding momma beasts head breaks in through the hole
it grabs heroines left forearm
bartender aims the judge at the beast
youll hit her
roadie knocks the judge up blam
the judges shotgun blast blows off another toe on boss mans right foot
he cries out in agony
heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken chair into the attacking momma beasts right eye
the beast screeches and jerks back dragging the rest of hero outside
heroine clutches the ring
shrieks and flapping wings are heard outside
a moment of calm
belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone
the other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding spaces in various states of shock
junior beast has momentarily stopped moving
bozo secures the lid with a nearby what the fuck was that
wild eyed and with a trembling hand heroine pours herself a shot from the bar
she downs it and takes a long breath
the jungle has a new king
freeze on her
pan and scan over various newspaper headings with pictures and newsreel footage that read there is a holler at the top of the stairs
is it clear
is there a gun pointing at you
nah i got the gun
boss man hobbles down the stairs with the help of tuffy
his foot is a bloody mess
he is holding a
alright goddamn it
who shot me
who did it
belle and bartender move to his aid
my goddamn foot is gone
who fuckin shot me
who fuckin shot me
motioning to heroine her fella
well wheres the sonuvabitch
noticing destruction what the hell happened down here
boss man looks to bozo
i didnt do it
it was fuckin monsters asshole
jesus christ on the cross
someone make sense
were surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before
some kind of animals
real fast volatile predators
one went through three of your patrons like nothing
so your dead hubby shot me twice three of my customers have been eaten and there are angry creatures outside
he only shot you once
re bartender he shot you the other time
it was an accident
boss man squints skeptically
adulterer points to grandpa beasts head on the bar
look at it
fan fuckin tastic
what is that
thats one piece of four problems
that head over there thats the oldest of the bunch looked like the grandpa
we caught the little one junior in the cooler there
as weve seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed
and the rest of em
unfortunately the worst of em are still outside
note as heroine describes each beast we see a slight glimpse of their virtues hidden mainly by shadows and fog
the next one is taller but all out of proportion
like a teen beast
teen beast has a big head and awkward body
he clumsily moves and seems uncomfortable in his own skin
he was spastic clumsy but deadly just the same
heroine tends to her scratched arm
i just took the eye out of the mother
she calculates guiding the attacks
momma beast flashes out from the dark
shes shorter than teen but much wider
she has a big mouth and national geographic boobs that hang down to her waist
she covers her stabbed right eye and screeches
heroine taps her right eye
if you are face to face with her dive left
and the last one is the father
the biggest the strongest
a blur of muscles bloody fur and teeth
the entire bar stares at heroine with their mouths agape
no sign of any weaknesses
no sign at all
hes an eating machine
of all the friggin bars to be stuck in
thats not it
four are here but theres three others
which i cant account for
heroine eyes the room
we need to lock this place down
is everyone in this room
oh my god
tuffy races toward the staircase to the second floor
tuffy is halfway up the stairs
tuffy bursts through the door
cody sits by the tv unmoved
mommy tuffy pulls cody into her arms
heroine and bartender halt to guard the doorway
heroine spots a small portal window
what was i thinking
mommy is never gonna let you go
lets lock off this room
moving to exit never ever never
never ever never baby
i love you smash
papa beast bursts through the portal window and rips codys torso from tuffys grasp
tuffy holds his dangling arms
blood sprays everywhere
papa beast lunges at tuffy
bartender shoots nailing papa beast
he hisses but cant fit through the small window
bartender aims again for a kill shot but papa beast projectile vomits codys remains at bartender
papa beast retracts out the portal window
heroine slams the wood shutters closed
tuffy drops codys arms
she moves zombie like to the staircase
bartender follows covered in papa beasts bile
heroine locks the staircase door shut
beer guy stares at the bile covered bartender
he hands him a towel
tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of the patrons
the blood on her face and chest tells them what happened
the horror hits home
heroine eyes the destroyed phone
to tuffy are you heroine puts a hand up to silence coach
just let her be
beat is that the only phone
bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic and wires
the back phone is wrecked too
trampys eyes light up and she digs through her purse
this is really happening
i cant believe this is really happening
grandpa and grandma have calmly re taken their seats
whatd you say
i didnt say anything
bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the grandpa beast head at the end of the bar
para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair
belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming from the wheelchairs back rest
thank you but i dont need any help whats this
a power magnet or something
belle puts together his scam with a smirk
i didnt peg you for a con man
hey it pays more than the couch
lots of stuff around here does
trampy pulls out a cellular phone from her purse
the group looks over
adulterer grabs it
beer guy walks from behind the bar
so what now
did those things leave
why dont you go check it out
into cell phone i have a signal
i have diane
diane listen to me
get the kids and get in the basement

trampy stares with grief in her eyes
ill explain later
im at a bar
just shut diane
i lost the signal
adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed
look now i gotta get outta here
i gotta go
see my wife is alone
she could be in trouble
i gotta go
he moves towards the front door
heroine moves into his path
i wouldnt do that
adulterer violently grabs heroine to shove her away
fuck you bitch
heroine nails adulterer with three hits to the chin throat and chest flipping him to the floor
she pulls a knife from her belt buckle and has it under adulterers chin
you can risk your life but not mine
my daughters no more than twenty miles from here waiting for me
i have just as much reason to leave this place as you do
but i also know that if theyre here then theyre not there yet
you understand me
get the fuck off
you understand me
now pull that tough boy shit again and ill slice you from neck to nuts
adulterer nods obediently
heroine removes the knife from his neck and plants it back into her buckle
you cant keep me here
this is bullshit
this is fucking bullshit
we cant risk letting them in
trembling pissed right
adulterer takes his seat
he looks over at the half bald trampy
she looks at him hurt
at the bar bozo puts the tv back into place he jiggles with some wires in the back bringing back the picture
yeah you got it
the bar takes notice
trampy cell phone in hand paws through a phone book as she watches the broadcast
this has to be isolated
thats a local broadcast
on tv the newscaster reads the teleprompter
and now we head to our man on the scene with a live look at tomorrows event in red mountain
heroine eagerly looks on moving closer to the tv
my daughters in red mountain
on tv there is an awkward pause from the newscaster
the broadcast doesnt cut to the reporter
can you hear us
apparently were having some technical difficulties
heroine sinks in her skin
oh there we go
on tv a reporter in an even worse suit stands in a field with several people looking through telescopes
thats right the crowds are lining up early to witness tomorrows meteorological phenomenon
heroine sighs a gust of relief
but always remember dont look straight into the sun because a special filter is needed to avoid damaging your cornea
the reporter beams
and were all looking forward to it tomorrow
back to you
in the studio the newscaster smirks
and in other news
roadie points to the tv
that studios local we can call in
i have a short wave radio upstairs
trampy is already dialing on the cell
im calling them
theyd have a police scanner
into cell hello
yes were at the united on tv the newscaster continues his routine
it has been reported that the power outage a beast arm reaches in and tears off newscasters jaw
the bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays
the broadcast cuts out turning to static
trampy screams and drops the cell shattering on impact
oh fucking no
heroine tense quells the rising panic
keep it together
i came from the east
that studio is south of here
for all we know north and west are okay
an associate of mine was coming in from the north aint heard a word from him in hours
so that leaves the west
tuffy looks up from a booth clearing her throat
and red mountain
heroine looks over making eye contact
this is goddamn depressing
at the door heroine slides a thick metal pole through the double door handles and takes out the rust red shotgun
ive got some tools and extra planks in the kitchen if were on the same page here
the last board is hammered into place as the survivors back away from the now re enforced bar
well it aint pretty
but its got teeth
bam bam bam
junior beast bangs around in the ice cooler
i think its hungry again
we have to kill it
to boss man can you help
boss man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his
junior beast goes wild trying to get out
fire in the hole
bullets rip through the cooler
casings hit the ground
bozo leans in
i think we got rah
a tiny white arm fires out from the cooler grabbing bozos leg
moving quick tuffy grabs the judge from bartender and shoves the barrel into a hole
bozo falls back unscathed
he catches his breath and looks to tuffy
she is born again seething
she hands the shotgun back to bartender
jesus it took all that
all those bullets
how can we possibly fight off the others
aim for their orifices
eyes ears and mouth
from what ive seen its their only weakness
looking at the corpse looks like theyre soft on the inside like any other animal
trick is to get in there and do the damage
maybe we dont have to fight them
right lets just call em names
coach steps forward poised to make the sale
ladies and gentlemen if i may have your attention
the bar skeptically eyes the large sweaty greek man
we have to think outside the box here
we dont need to fight them we need to scare them
scare them right back
this is a species stand off
we just need to show them were not vulnerable
that were formidable
i need a stick
bartender opens the coolers lid and carefully pulls out junior beast with salad tongs
it falls to the floor with a splat
coach grabs a splintered broomstick
he buries the broomstick into juniors side and carries the limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall
lets get that board down
roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole
what are you doing
coach shoves juniors mangled body through to the outside
the scent of their dead may drive them away
the whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the beast family will react
they look through small holes barely able to see anything
i dont see them
is there a call or something
see that you monkey fucks
thats what you get when you mess with us
woman or man i dont give a fuck
shit dont make me gay because youll be sucking my dick
bozos insult hangs in the air
junior is swiped from the handmade pike
coach jerks back
the startled group tries to focus but its too dark outside
with the moon as the only light father beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child
silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach junior
papa beast is gentle and its almost endearing
i think its working
what i tell you
the whole group starts to ease
papa beast hollers
papa beast lets out a horrid wail
the group jumps back covering their ears
then something really odd happens
momma tosses junior in the air opens her wide jaws and adulterers eyes widen
papa beast moves behind momma beast and grabs hold of her
a steady thud thud thud rhythm vibrates the bar
grandpas drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats
the group maneuvers to get a better look
what are they doing now
yes momma beast and papa beast are having monster sex
dude theyre humpin
unlike humans papa beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts all of thirty seconds
momma beasts belly balloons up and she squats
a slimy object the size and shape of a vacuum cleaner drops from her
the slimy object splits in half
the two halves spring appendages and raise their heads
the twin sister beasts have been born
papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls
the beast girls look at the bar and hiss in unison
heroines eyes bulge
the two hissing beast girls strike the bar front
roadie shoves that board back over the hole
beer guy is holding back the still heaving trampys hair
any more ideas animal planet
i i i was just being proactive
to bozo hey you werent helpin
what the hell now
were stuck in here
bozo pops open a beer off the back of paras wheelchair
roadie nods to grandpapa beasts head on the end of the bar
if you dont mind me asking how did you run into these things
more importantly how did you run away from these things
well it all started about forty hours ago
the orange sun melts into the horizon
hero and his overweight friend tubbs hard living career farm hand laugh at a tv show while heroine paces on the telephone in the background
into phone so how is staying with grandma working out
ya know if you stare into her glasses you can see what cards she is holding
but i didnt tell you that
theres a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it
shrieking and flapping grows in the distance
heroine starts to peek out of the window
mommy will pick you up tomorrow night okay baby
the phone cuts out
heroine and hero look at each other with concern
hero looks out the window
holy mother of
heroine has the group mesmerized
we barricaded ourselves in the cellar
then it was just listening
we heard those things destroy an entire heard of livestock
they just kept coming
closer and closer consuming anything in the way
slashing feeding and licking the bones clean
just when we said our prayers the first ray of sun hit the house
a horses head falls as heroine and her companions peek out from the damaged cellar door
that first beam of sunlight drove em away
we called who we could and then decided to run for it
we didnt see a soul the whole drive out
when the tank went dry we came upon a gas station to refill
the sun is falling into the horizon
the travelers camaro pulls into a small gas station heroine goes up to the service window with tubbs and looks inside
there is a slight buzzing from inside
hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car
whats goin on
the pumps are off
theres nobody here she follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room
there is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a station attendants gutted torso
theyve been here
turn on the pump
glass shatters as heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps
we had no time
all we knew was the sun was dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at miles per hour
hero fills their camaro
suck it down you metal bitch
suck it down
heroine and tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks ignoring the cash register completely
the sun is setting
hero turns as a shrill hissing comes from the shadows
it happened fast
heroine and tubbs emerge from the gas station shop
heroine and tubbs hear the growing cries of the beasts
their loot hits the pavement as they run
get in the car baby
hero drops the spilling gas nozzle
tubbs slides into the back as heroine jumps into the drivers seat
hero runs over the top of the camaro and slides into the sunroof
he grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas pool
something rises in the gas station
thats when i saw three others
just for a second
three lean muscular shapes rise from the shadows
heroine fires up the car and tears out
hero shoots and the station becomes a fireball
close the roof
hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof as stripped cousin beast lands on top of the car
stripped cousin beast punches through the back window reaching for them
heroine jerks the wheel
the car s and the beast sails off of the car into darkness
the camaro tears down a tangent dirt road
we made it
hero reaches back to give a five to tubbs
tubbs doesnt respond
heroine is the first to see tubbs quivering headless body in the back seat
heroine stands near grandpa beasts head
it must have smelled the blood or something
we buried the body and got back on the main road when
grandpa beast lands on the front hood of the camaro
heroine and hero scream and rev the engine swerving madly as grandpa beast vomits on the windshield
heroine slams on the breaks
grandpa beast slides back holding onto the grill
grandpa beast tears into the engine through the grill as sparks and smoke shoot out
heroine jerks the steering wheel
and thats how i ended up here
and the head
the car crashes into a ditch decapitating grandpa beast
his head fires through the windshield landing on heroines lap
its snake like tongue lashes out at heroines crotch
i dont want to talk about that
so your husband ditched you
it was wild out there
no time to think
we just moved
he didnt leave me
he just ran
well justice is funny
para wheels over to a county map on the side wall
the three from the gas pump are over at the tv station
and you say theres four here huh
it appears so
theres five here now actually
yeah thanks for that
to heroine hey you lived on a farm right
do you think theyre gone
i havent heard anything for a while maybe theyre gone
well maybe they migrate
as long as its dark theyre around
they hide wait for you to drop your guard and then attack
how can you be so sure
you said yourself this started a day ago
we learned fast
we learned fast
you are all that is left of we
no offense pocohantas but i think someone else should play chief tonight
someone that knows the lay of the land
beat like me
para stares intently at the map
adulterer moves over to the window that has shutters over it peeking through a hole
maybe these things are like locusts or something and only come out for a few days to feed
this could just be a part of their life cycle
somebodys gotta know something about these things
this stuff just doesnt happen out of the blue
the room is silent
bozo looks around quickly moving towards grandpa and grandma
you gotta know somethin youre old
i dont know a thing
old people know stuff like this
legends tall tales shit like that
i dont know anything
to grandma how bout you
or do i have to get rough
if i throw a stick will you go away
thats just horse shit
relax they dont know anything
bozo saunters off
to heroine hey where was your farm
points to map east
did you ever slaughter
previous owners did i think
what are you talking about
slaughterhouse run off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains
para points along the map as he explains
earthquakes often cracked the piping and those flow lines were condemned but never drained
cheese n rice
i still dont get it
what i am saying is
theres a distinct possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream of blood and tissue that has been leaking into the caves
and a day ago
something broke out
the group is silent
the first order of business is gettin a big fuckin tampon in that cave
nope that wouldnt do it
from adulterers p
he peeks out the hole and sees nothing but the dark night
bartender eyes him
i wouldnt do that
theyre probably on to the next buffet by now
theres a retirement home up the road theyd be easy pickings
to adulterer careful
im telling you i dont see a thing boink
papa beasts claw pokes into his eye
adulterer jerks away holding his blood squirting eye socket
the eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to the floor holding his face
coach and trampy move to help adulterer
the eyeball fires into papas drooling mega mouth
a beast arm bursts through the side wall and snags coachs pants and boxers
he screams and lunges forward
he is bottomless
everyone stay in the middle of the room
off the walls
everyone obeys her command to get in the middle of the room
belle hands coach a little menu to cover himself with
now does everyone agree that they are still out there
the group nods
to bozo eh chief
trampy holds adulterers wounded head
hes out cold
i know some first aid if we have a kit
in the kitchen under the sink
no one goes anywhere alone
least of all unarmed
to coach theres some sweats in my bag behind the bar
coach heads to the bar
roadie moves to the map near para
youre a clever man
re bozo why do you take shit from him
yeah hes an ass but hes my brother
que sera sera
your brother huh
look man i read books
he reads bumper stickers
heroine jerks a bottle of booze from beer guy and tosses it out
alright we need to stay alert and for everyone to take a role
to boss man you gotta have some guns or weapons around here
boss man pale and morphine pumped sits at a table with his foot raised
i got my
thats six shots and two refills
downstairs i have locker with a sawed off and some gardening tools
maybe a few boxes of shells
i got shells too
box and a half tops
machete behind the bar
okay well thats something
so weve got guns kitchen knives pipes fire and sticks
beer guy scans the stocked bar wall
i might be able to do something with the bottles
youre gonna need a whole lot more than that to get outta here alive
the crowd turns to face grandpa and his wife
oh now you have something to say
grandpa holds on to grandmas hand as he speaks
you younguns worry about weapons im thinkin bout strategy
and whats that
sit still look less like a meal
thats for bears and sharks chunky chew
the group looks back to heroine
alright what else do we have
can we somehow contact the outside world
trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone
i cant get anybody
i dont even know if i have a signal anymore
i have a cb in my truck we could get some help out here
who the hell would you call
do you drive a short beer bus or something
you go out there you get eaten
you stay in here you get eaten
anyone comes to help they get eaten
dont you see a pattern here spuds makenzie
then i guess we should just give up
re trampy believe me id love to save the day and get some heroic snatch but its not in the cards partner
to boss man you said you had a short wave radio
go for it
its by the far wall
channel is the emergency frequency
im heading to the basement for supplies
to bozo and youre going upstairs
a little taken aback
lets not get carried away
step up chief

bartender hands him the judge
to bartender youre coming with portly
cause if im attacked i want a fat man close by
ill wait by the door
now who else is comin
no one budges
rising from his seat ill go with ya

bartender moves to the back of the bar grabbing his machete
at the same moment coach emerges from behind the bar in very snug feminine looking pink sweat pants
youre coming too
to heroine now gimme the keys
heroine tosses the keys to bartender
youre locked in
those two will be on the other side waiting for you
if you become food i dont want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things
dont get your hopes up
bozo moves to the staircase
theres blood at the bottom and it gets worse with each step
bartender and coach follow
heroine turns to the bar
any volunteers to head into the basement with me
tuffy stands sniffling
she wipes the tears from her eyes looking tough and resolute
thats not a good idea
with what happened upstairs shut up
shut your mouth
you have no idea what is running through me right now
to heroine im ready
count me in
heroine tuffy roadie and beer guy all move to the basement
the door creaks open slowly
the group descends
bozo slightly slips on the blood
he grips the railing and pulls himself up the staircase like an old man
alright you two i dont want to hear any of this oh i dropped the key wrong key aint no key here
when i want out i want out ok
displaying keys theyre right here
weve got your back bro
they unlock the door swinging it open
just keep em handy ladies
bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt ready to move
bozo hustles in
the door shuts and locks
wish me luck
bozo is on the ground
bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor
bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from codys attack
the tv illuminates the room
moving gingerly okay now
belle kneels next to the boss man
how are you holding up
he pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her
what is this
my magic potion
i need a few drops
she puts a few drops on his out stretched tongue
you should try a little itll calm your nerves
works like a charm
no other time than now right
wait before you do that help me move
theres a small room off the kitchen where i can lay down
but its much safer in there
the basement is dark dingy and scattered with crap
dried out animal carcasses hang from the ceiling on hooks
a window is open
roadie slams it shut eyeing the room staring into the dark corners
stay on your toes everybody
tuffy tightly grips her weapon ready to fire
heroine kneels next to a hatch door that emits a red glow
roadie jams a pipe into the little door bracing it shut
you dont need to know what that is
beer guy finds the dusty locker and opens it
theres a sawed off shotgun in here
bartender and coach have their ears pressed to the door
come on bro
behind them through a boarded window something crawls upward
bozo moves turtle slow
he moves to the boss mans private room
he puts his hand out to open it
trembling he touches the knob and
the door eases open
bozo steps inside the room
he moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain
a bat flies off the lamp shade screeching
bozo falls backwards
bartender and coach jump back
bozo gets off the floor again
he may have filled his pants
just a bat
just a bat
if he doesnt shut up
he is human kabob
the room is like a converted pantry
boss man lies on a cot kissing belle
a tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation
belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair
doesnt your foot hurt
i cant feel a thing hon
touching his crotch how bout now
youre a bad girl arent you
belle a bit high sways and starts to remove her clothes
the girls got rhythm
she takes off her blouse and tosses it at him
she then lifts up her skirt and bends over giggling
there it is
roadie emerges with two crates
he dumps them on the floor
this is all junk
beer guy holds a rusted machete
this could come in handy
lets get everything upstairs
heroine moves to the stairs but stops
she grabs tuffy by the arm and takes her aside
dont worry im fine
i admire your strength
trust me i plan on having a full breakdown when this is over but for now we all have to be strong right
heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an identical locket as tuffys
she opens it and displays a picture of a this is my daughter charlie
shes all im after
fighting back tears oh
and im gonna need your strength every bit of it
you have it
but still do me a favor
with a wink dont tell anyone i have a soft side
tiny smile deal
bozo turns and points the gun around the room
he sees the cb
it is like an intercom with a cable running outside
he drops the shotgun and fidgets with the cb knobs
we need help out here at the united nations tavern
send guns tanks and all that shit
all he gets is static
a faint growl is heard outside
outside the door bartender hears the growl his eyes grow wide
belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her tongue at boss man
you wanna see baby
how much you got
how much i got what
how much you got to see the show
you dont understand sweety
daddy doesnt pay
daddy sees the show for free
but you do get points for being horny on a night like this
she cringes and backs up a little
you cant expect a man to buy a car without a test drive first can you
um hmm now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on daddys face i wanna do some appraising
bozo barks into the cb
we need help
calling all cars
calling all cars
we need help at the united nations tav the cb is jerked from bozos hands and slams into the wall
bozo aims the gun at the wall
chewing sounds begin
he backs up to the door
okay im ready to come out now
bartender confidently turns the key
it breaks off in the lock
what is oh
what does oh mean
bozo knocks on the door hard
bartender looks to coach
a thunderous crash
boards fly off the wall
belle hearing the crash jerks back from boss man
what was that
sister beast and sister beast punch through the tiny wall fan and grab belle by the scalp
she is jerked against the wall
shes slammed against it repeatedly and then rip
belles skin is torn from her head and torso
boss man jumps back
belle falls into boss mans arms for a hideous kiss
boss man shoves the bloody belle back against the wall
sister beast pokes her head inside the room hissing
heroine and the others just returning from the basement hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen
coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock trying to use his fingernails to turn the metal stump
great god why do you damn me
bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the momma and papa beast chomping at the wall
the group is mesmerized
oh please no
boss man uses the cot to block the sister beasts from entering
they hiss and shred the cot fabric
theyre getting in
bozo kicks and punches the door
heroine charges up the staircase
roadie rips the sawed off weapon from beer guy and runs for the kitchen
the key broke off
to coach move it
heroine rips the earring from bartenders ear
she jams the backing into the lock
boss man crawls for the door
sister beast fires out a whip like tongue and snags boss mans damaged foot
he howls in pain
sister beast tongue lassos his other foot
heroines picking fingers are bleeding from her effort
boss man is pulled towards the sister beasts
roadie kicks open the door and fires at the sisters
they dive back out of the room screeching
right behind bozo the boards fly off the portal window
papa beast flies at bozo
bozo spins and aimlessly fires his shotgun hitting papa beast directly in the groin
the door flies open
bozo is yanked to safety just as papa strikes the closing door
the patrons track the wild crashing and high pitched shrieking sounds of papa beast
he finally breaks out of the upstairs
beer guy and roadie carry boss man into the room as coach bartender heroine and the shaken bozo creep down the stairs
bozo slowly takes a seat in his brothers lap
i thought that was it for a second there
i got papa in the stones
beat hes neutered
that back room is sealed shut
heroine glares at boss man
i told you to stay in the main room
coach eyes the group this is his time to shine
rising full of brawn if they cant reproduce anymore we are one step closer
a big step
now is the time to band together
we need to rise up against these monsters of the night
those creatures are no match for the human spirit
we can do it
we just need to believe in each other
in all of us
we need to make a stand
dude are you gay
coach sits down humbled
we know what not to do
we must stay focused and together
the beasts will find a breach
we gotta find a way out before they find a way in
lets run for the cars cause mass confusion
the lots too damn far thats surefire suicide
the room is silent
bartender motions to boss man but he is promptly shushed by boss man
to boss man what
you know what
i dont know shit
to roadie you
what was that door downstairs
wait wait wait
heroine glares at roadie
dont bullshit me
its a tunnel
roadie nods causing boss man to sigh
it runs about a hundred yards and spits out on the backside of that hill down the way
whats it for
they clam up
whats it for
i grow pot down there
does the tunnel spit out near a car
it spits out behind the parking lot
my truck is near but it aint nearly big enough to haul the whole lot
its a shot
is it gassed up
how many can it hold
its gonna fit thirteen
thirteen clowns wouldnt fit
with hand out keys
whatre you planning
three of us go
two to defend one to drive
we back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here
let me make this clear if we stay we die
boss man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string around his neck
give em to me im going
youre trusting that con
hell ditch us and never look back
fuck you too
get in line
im not trusting him either thats why im going with
coach stands forward
courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway
off blank stares the duke
i will go
this is it
they have this place surrounded but if we go under them we might just make it
this is a bottleneck waiting to happen
bozo slaps coachs ass
this ones great under pressure
i wish you luck
the rest of you prepare the weapons whatever you got left
cause when we crash through those walls were bringin death with us
heroine takes the judge from bartender and hands it to coach
no i dont believe in guns
this aint time for a political stance
coach takes the rusty machete from beer guy
this doesnt run out of ammo
heroine roadie and coach move to the basement
the three look to bozo who offers a parting nod
when you get to that truck
drive it like you stole it
at a booth trampy re bandages adulterers eye
how does it feel
you still have one left
yes the silver lining
it serves you right for cheating
i figure its karma
you wronged me and you wronged your wife so this is karma biting you on the ass or in your case
in the eye
bozo moves close surveying the bandage work
it could be worse you could be dead
then again the climax is upon us
re trampys hair ya know thats not a bad look on you
kinda but not bad
id hook it up
i wouldnt fuck you for practice
leave her alone
lets have a quiet contest
bozo turns his attention back to trampy
ya know in situations of duress i have found that women are attracted to my authority
heroine roadie and coach make their way through the basement
creeks and cracks with every step
to heroine you handle yourself pretty well
you a cop or a criminal
just a farmer
then how do you do it
i just think about my husband and daughter
and the rest is easy
the light casts a shadow of something behind the curtain
roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed off barrel
the curtain slides
its a dried animal hide on a hook
they all sigh
roadie unblocks the tiny door
heroine scans the room
this place is creepy in the daytime too
coachs hand shakes as he raises his weapon
of course not
i fight monsters all the time
gripping the door on three
roadie heroine raise their weapons
roadie whips open the door
bang gong gong
some pipes crash to the ground next to them
they jump but nothing is there
a little mouse emerges from the fallen heap
well look at that
coach leans down and puts out his hand
he smiles as heroine watches over his shoulder
hey little fella
he leaves the mouse and follows heroine to the tunnel
a pink tongue lassos the mouse
a red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel
they all drop in one by one entering the steamy confined space
looks like a brothel for plants
tuffy stands by a far wall looking through the planks for movement
at the bar beer guy makes molotov cocktails
bozo moves close slaps beer guys constructing hand
ah ah ah
youre doing that all wrong
what do you know
i know youre doing it wrong
bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles
move aside princess
the tunnel is thin and no more than six feet high
cherry red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh marijuana plants are along the ground soil
there are thick pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering system
there is about six inches of water on the floor
to roadie you and i are similar
we both have accents
we both travel a lot
we both dont really have homes
you should be quiet
i am sorry i ramble when im nervous
coach bites his lip dying to say something
its just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly
what did i say
im done now
bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles
you dont want the rag touching booze that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it
i thought the rag had to touch
bozo finishes the molotov cocktail and grabs a beer
what we should do though is put those peanut barrels to use
fill em with booze and line up some planks
if the walls come down
we hit em donkey kong style
para and beer guy eye the three large peanut barrels perfect for bomb making
you arent nearly as dumb as you look are you
next time look within
stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful
bozo looks to trampy putting an arm around her shoulder
excuse me for being forward but im curious about your dimensions
roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end
the tunnel slightly curves so he cant see the whole way down
you hear something
a scratching sound is heard from above
theyre trying to burrow through the tunnel walls
the scratching sound increases now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well
like moles these things
then sister beast drops into the tunnel from the far end
at the last second roadie spots her
roadie and coach duck into the water but heroine is unable to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards
sister beast lands and turns surveying her prey
roadie aims his water dripping gun but heroine rises and blocks his shot
from her knees heroine fires
blam blam blam
the three shots push sister beast backwards
heroine rises covered in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face
the bitch is mine
roadie and coach reluctantly turn leaving heroine to fend with the beast
hissing sister beast charges as well
heroine pumps and fires
sister beast spins avoiding the shot
now too close heroine jams the beast in the mouth with the gun knocking her back
sister beast responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm
heroine bats her away
sister beast moves to the others
roadie and coach sprint until sister beast bursts through the tunnel walls stopping roadie and coach in their tracks
roadie fires his weapon but it sparks and fizzles
the shells are wet
with the two beasts closing in
the men are trapped
coach looks around seeing a plan
grab onto ceiling and get out of water
grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling roadie pulls himself from the water
coach uses the machete to cut a power cord from above
he grabs the exposed sparking end
to heroine get out of water
heroine sees what hes doing sprints back the way they came
as the two beasts charge coach pulls himself out of the water by holding onto the above piping
hes forced to wait for heroine to get out of the water
the second she does he jams the cord into the water
the conductive water sizzles
sister beast and sister beast lock up and crash
sparks and smoke rises from their cooked bodies
roadie and coach look to each other victorious
they begin shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel
heroine looks back at the two men
she turns and reenters the basement
teen beast drops in front of her whacking her to the floor
heroine slides across the floor but jumps up quickly
teen beast cautiously moves in for the kill
heroine raises her weapon
you fuck with my family
aiming shotgun i fuck right back
click out of ammo
heroine throws the shotgun at him and pulls out the machete
she rolls left and swings
teen beast loses two fingers
she swings again but gets whacked to the floor
heroine rolls with the hit grabs her shotgun and dives into the keg elevator
she slams closed the door as teen beast regains its composure and lunges
it crashes against the door
roadie and coach crawl to the platform by the exit
they will write stories of your bravery
if theres anybody left
the two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above
at the top roadie pushes off the plywood covering
the two men peer into the night and spot the truck
heroine wedges the door closed
the beast continues to try to get in
heroine bangs the top of the small elevator
send it up
send it up
tuffy backs up and hears the screams from the keg elevator
shes in the shaft
beer guy hits the button
the gears grind and start to pull the elevator up to the main floor
heroine squirms as the elevator rises
as teen beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg elevator in the shaft heroine pounds and tears at the few planks above her in the keg
beer guy hits the button
ol crazy horse has seen it
the elevator shakes
heroine pounds a hole through the elevator top
she tries to squeeze through the small hole
teen beast bites through the floor board of the keg elevator
the elevator stops
heroine lurches and grabs the greasy cables to stop her fall
it fuckin stopped
heroine screams as the elevator shakes
teen beast is struggling to climb right under her
tuffy moves for the keg door
adulterer grabs the judge from bartender
what the fuck are you doing
they cant get in here
theyll get us
she can make it
i will not die because of her
dont be stupid drop the gun
heroine hacks at one of the two greasy cables
teen beast is in the elevator car and rising
theyll get in
well all die
heroine almost has the primary cable cut
teen beast rises up to bite
the cable breaks
heroine soars up the shaft
teen beast is pulled down to the bottom
the keg elevator door bursts open on impact
heroine slams into the ceiling kicking and yelling
tuffy knocks adulterers shotgun up takes the gun and rips open the keg door
heroine swings out
teen beast is right behind her with mouth open and ready to feed
tuffy points her shotgun
teen lurches back dropping back down the shaft
tuffy slams the keg door shut
heroine pants on the floor
adulterer is down winded
f f fuck you
what the hell happened
i think they made it
she turns to adulterer rigid
stop trying to get people killed
it is getting very old
adulterer nods ashamed
heroine looks around the bar
she notices the peanut barrels on top of the bar
two wooden planks serve as track leading straight for the side wall
to bartender i need some shells
i have two left
bartender expels a shell from the judge and hands it over
make it count
heroine cringes eyeing the lined up molotov cocktails
lets prepare ourselves they ought to be here with the truck any minute
boss man sips a bottle still hopped up on morphine
he lazily loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly
if you ask me im gonna just lay right here wait for sunrise then walk on out of here
thats your choice but this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets any better
boss man shrugs content with himself
if all of you run for it they wont care about lil ol me
they like the food that moves
teen beasts arm erupts through the boss mans belly
his pistol and bullets scatter across the floor
his head and legs slap together as the arm pulls him through a small hole in the floor
the group jumps back
blood rockets out
his body is pureed down the tiny hole
get on the tables
on the tables
everyone struggles to get on the tables
teen beasts arm reaches up and grabs paras wheelchair violently shaking it
para falls to the floor
teen beasts arm grabs paras leg
bozo jumps from a table and stomps on teen beasts arm
he picks up para and tosses him onto a table
bozo leaps back onto a table
the power cuts out
the room goes black
were gonna die
what the hell
and with that the shouting and pounding stops
the group nervously shuffles around the tables
then far is the distance beyond the walls a sound is heard
and its approaching
the survivors maneuver to peek out the front walls
tuffy sees what is coming
they didnt make it
being held by papa and momma beast roadie and coach are both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams
the first strike causes the men to howl
the survivors shake in sickened silence
from beyond the walls they can hear high pitched screams
with every strike a splattering of blood spits through the planks of wood
that walls coming down
commence plan b
the entire group goes into motion
whats plan b
just watch the floor and keep the others safe
with a final furious strike a few wood planks splinter
papa beast sticks in his head and hisses
from the bar beer guy tuffy and adulterer release the first peanut barrel
its ablaze and sails straight for papa beast
it explodes bursting open the wall and knocking back papa beast
the wooden walls go up in flame
para on a side table reaches out and grabs boss mans
from the floor
the second peanut barrel is released
it sails outside the breach but it doesnt explode
nevertheless the beasts stay far away
teen beast madly rips floor boards away moving towards paras table
teen beast bursts through the floor knocking para to the floor
para crawls to his fallen wheelchair
teen beast spots him moves in to feed
para points his seat back at the scattered
bullets and flips the armrest switch
the bullets jump to the power magnet
para yanks one free loads the pistol and turns just as teen beast strikes
the shot hits teen beast in the eye sending him back down the hole in the floor
heroine and bartender move in
when teen beast sticks his head out of the hole again they thrust both their shotguns into each ear
the two shots scatter head everywhere
the flames in the bar spread catching the entire wall and roof on fire
the second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the bar
suddenly the top is knocked off
trampy sticks her head out
seeing no trouble she emerges dizzy as hell and races for the nearby beer truck
papa and momma beast both charge the bar
the third peanut barrel is released
it sails for them but they dive out of the way
it takes out the rest of the wall
fire and smoke fills the place
adulterer douses momma beast with booze as beer guy nails her with a lit molotov cocktail
engulfed in flame she bolts from the bar shrieking
one down one to go
papa enters and is instantly cornered
he swings wildly
to bartender help me
heroine and bartender rip the deer head from the wall and charge papa pinning him against the wall with the antlers
bozo and beer guy dive into papas legs holding them down
tuffy picks up the judge
the shotgun butt knocks out papas front teeth
tuffy raises the weapon again staring down at the monster that killed her child but papa beast gets an arm free to knock away her fatal blow
bartender wrenches papa beasts arm with all his might
with her hair stuck in papa beasts claw tuffy is pulled face to face with the beast
she squirms as he chomps at her but with no front teeth he cant do immediate damage
i cant hold him
tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into papa beasts mouth jamming it down his throat
he instantly gags sucking for air
papa beast struggles to get free but the others hold tight
papa beasts body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen
his eyes widen face to face with tuffy
with one last lunge papa beast shakes his life drifting away
his eyes turn black as his body goes limp
tuffy pulls out her arm from his throat
i need to get your number
tuffy shakes her wet arm dry
as the group pulls away papa beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug into the wood
heroine turns to grandma and grandpa offering a hand
come on ill help you
no thank you were content
im not leaving anyone behind
maybe next time dear
heroine swallows and nods
honk honk honk
just outside the breached wall the beer truck pulls up
the beer truck screeches to a halt
trampys at the wheel waving the group over
with the bar burning a thick layer of smoke blankets the entire area
the people amass at the opening but heroine stops them from advancing
the group stares the dark night
shes still out here
heroine eyes the truck seeing something she likes
she creeps out alone
where are you
from the smoke a smoldering momma beast charges like a bull
at the truck heroine opens the back doors and dives in leaving the doors open
momma beast gives chase entering the back
heroine is deep into the truck as momma beast enters
she advances hissing
come and get me you blood chugging momma howls and charges
heroine slides out the side keg door locking it behind her
before momma can see the trap beer guy slam closed the rear doors
beer guy latches it
trampy comes around the truck
you got her
you got her
not for long we gotta burn it
heroine looks to the others at the breach
lets blow this thing
the others move into action
beer guy takes off his shirt and shoves it into the fuel tank
adulterer and bozo with para riding piggyback help
they use the molotov cocktails to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck
when this lights run like hell
about fifteen yards away from the truck
bozo throws his silver plated american eagle lighter to heroine
catching lighter here we go
then a noise eoch ock ock
eock ock ock
eock ock ock
a deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck
its momma beast
again and again
what is that
shes calling for help
heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel
it races for the truck
when feet away cousin beast lands stomping out the fire with his foot
the fan has officially been buried in the shit
instantly another beast aunt beast lands on the top of the truck
these beasts are like the others but stripped
the group gasps
trampy backs away
we have to run burst
trampys rib cage is ripped from her body
the culprit uncle beast stands behind her
her organs drop like a box of vegetables
cousin beast lets out a high pitched roar
from atop the truck the rear doors are ripped open
momma beast emerges
get to your cars
the beasts spring into action chasing the group
bozo with para on his back sprints for his car
aunt beast rips para from bozos back
give him back
bozo runs for his trans am
para falls to the ground still alive
bozo turns back and sees him
bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again runs
i thought we lost you para is ripped into the air again
tuffy and bartender jump into his pickup truck
to heroine get in
heroine hops in the back
beer guy and adulterer run to a car together
beer guy lags behind continually looking over his shoulder
run and quit looking back
as beer guy looks forward aunt beast and uncle beast hit him high and low cutting him in half
bozo makes it to his trans am
the car roars to life
he pushes in a tape
the miami vice theme song blares from the speakers
get me fuck birds
bozo peels out
aunt beast lands right in his path
no you dont
he smacks aunt beast head on sending the creatures disemboweled body sailing through the air
para drops from the sky still alive and panting
cars are moving everywhere
the burning jukebox plays a slow love song
dancing and holding each other grandpa smooches grandma on the forehead
we had a good run
para crawls along the ground being ignored by the beasts
bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood and guts
he spots para
para claws the ground
bartender jerks the wheel of his car
para sees bartenders approaching truck
para rolls right just missing tires
para yells for his brother
bozos eyes bulge
para is smeared by adulterers car
bozo floors it
overly endearing i meant to tell you so much
the remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road
grandpa and grandma hold each other tight
uncle beast enters moving to their table
it moves in for the kill
grandpa kisses his wife gently
close your eyes hon
the beast opens its massive jaws and
bozos car drives through the bar smearing the beast
bozo guns the engine crashing out the other end of the bar
bozos car veers flipping over a pile of rubble
bozo squirms in his flipped car upside down
he hears a beast approaching
he pulls out a butterfly knife from the open glove box and saws at his safety belt
cousin beast leans into the passenger side of the car and looks him right in the eye
bozo raises the knife
lord if i die bury me upside down so the world can kiss my ass
cousin beast leaps in
the remaining two cars race down the road
with the peddle to the floor bartender drives
i think were in the clear bam
momma beast lands on the roof
she reaches inside and yanks out bartenders throat
the car veers
tuffy rights it leaning over and stomping on the gas
momma yanks at the door pulling it open
tuffy pushes out bartenders corpse and jerks the wheel
momma beast falls back knocking down heroine
momma beast nearly falls out but manages to grab the rear gate with one claw
defenseless heroine backs away
momma beast holds on tightly pulling herself onto the bed of the truck
tuffy stares back through the glass unable to do anything
momma beast lunges towards heroine
momma beasts claw snags heroines locket jerking heroine right up to the creatures face
the locket catches mommas attention for split second
her remaining eye goes from the picture of charlie to heroine
mommas mouth opens wide
and then a beam of the rising sun catches the gold locket and burns into mommas eye
in one quick motion shes gone taking the locket with her
heroine lets out her breath reaching around her neck for what is no longer there
the truck skids to a halt
tuffy jumps out
are you okay
i dont know i think hey
they both jump as adulterer approaches
are you two all right
we made it
i think we made it
theyll be back
were safe until dark but we need to find other people
heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck
she finds a pack of cigs under the visor
pops in the lighter
you know where the iga grocery store is over in red mountain
um yeah ten miles west
they have a bomb shelter
the lighter springs out hot
heroine lights up and passes one to tuffy
well meet in three hours
i dont wanna go home alone
i dont wanna see what might have
dont worry about that
moment of silence as adulterer and tuffy look down the desolate road
im sorry about your son
i really am
tuffy nods affectionately touching his hand
where are you two going
were going to get my little girl
i wish you luck
the car peels off
adulterer watches the car tear down the road
he glances up at the rising sun
a sign reading red mountain swings lazily in the breeze
tuffy and heroine coast down a town road
there are random pools of red blood in the dirt
no one in sight
adulterer drives along a small town road
theres no sign of life here either
the car pulls up to the house
the only sound is the wind
heroine and tuffy look at each other and proceed with caution
he pulls up in front of his house
the front door is swinging open banging against the door frame
heroine enters the ransacked house
he enters his house
it too is a mess
they look down the stairs to the basement
they move up the stairs to the second floor
they spin to the noise
he moves up the stairs to the master bedroom
theres a noise at the end of the hall
they cautiously move to the last room in the hall
a scratched closed door without an outside handle
heroine kicks in the door and
theres a note on a teddy beer that says we went to the theyre alive
the shudders smack against the wall
adulterer holds a shattered picture of his wife and two kids
he sighs and puts it down
im so sorry
the sun shines bright in the cloudless sky
there is a stiff wind that stirs up the dust
bartenders car slowly lurches up the street
heroine and tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings
its right up there in the back of the store
the car pulls up in the back of the store and stops
they get out looking around
tuffy holds a machete
adulterer kneels against his car
where is everyone
i dont know i just got here
did you find your girl
shes supposed to already be here
adulterer shakes his head acknowledging their death
adulterer sheepishly nods
this place is a ghost town
the group makes their way to the store front peeking beyond the glass doors
in the distance in middle of a dusty parking lot charlie stands staring at them
heroine runs to her and the others follow
charlie fidgets awkwardly
she cries and blood stains her dress
as heroine nears adulterer grabs her arm
theres something wrong
the group eyes charlie noticing heroines locket around her ankle leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover
suddenly the sunlight starts to fade
they look up the sun
the moon moves in front of it a solar eclipse
beast hissing and fluttering is heard
heroine looks from left to right panic stricken
the sunlight is fading
the manhole cover shakes something is holding charlie in place
heroine lurches forward but adulterer holds her at bay
its a trap
at a standstill the group looks around for options
in the distance the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them
adulterer reacts grabbing tuffys machete and lunging for charlie
the strike cuts the chain at her ankle
the manhole cover pops off and a beast claw sinks into adulterer
the darkness covers the manhole
momma beast rises hoisting adulterers blood dripping body from the ground
gurgling blood run
heroine scoops up her child moving away from momma beast
tuffy grabs them both leading them back towards the store front
as adulterers blood flows momma beast drags him towards her main prey
a blanket of darkness leads momma beast overtaking the survivors
at the store front heroine pulls charlie close
a whisper i love you
a string of ten white vans come to a halt in the dusty parking lot
the man in tan buzz cut leathery skin cool steps from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town
a swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles all dressed alike in work boots gas masks and coveralls
they go into action honing in on rubble with sensors and counters
whats the damage radius
tech horn rimmed glasses all business eyes a laptop
red mountain surrounding farms local tv studio
how many picked up the broadcast
well have figures within the hour
the man in tan closes his eyes in thought
sir whats the spin
this is the california high desert
get what you need to sell it
sir we have movement
the man in tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of blood and guts
using the sensor equipment the company man follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store
the place is torn to hell
dust and soot hangs in the air
the men instinctively raise their high powered rifles letting the flashlights on the ends lead the way
they follow the trail of blood to a back freezer locker
its scratched bashed and thrashed
company man steps forward and uses a metal cutting chainsaw to cut through the hinges
the door falls with a thud
as the dust clears tuffy heroine and charlie stare back at the men huddled together in a defensive stance
the man in tan creaks his neck
gentlemen help them to safety
heroine holding charlie lurches back
youre not safe shes still alive shell be back
were the calvary
the man in tan steps forward guiding the group out
a bulky security truck pulls up
a driver holding a bloody rag to his nose gets out and moves to the back door
what happened to you
the driver nods to the back of the truck opening the door
bozo lurches out handcuffed and chained
get these cuffs off me
im a goddamn hero for christs sake
a shirtless irate bozo sits next to grandpa and grandma in the back
he settles at the sight of the others
thanks for waitin for me back there really fuckin appreciate it
heroine covers her daughters ears as the survivors are helped into the truck
tuffy sits looking to bozo
howd you survive
i found a new weak spot on em but it damn aint pretty getting to it
heroine last in the truck turns to the men
where are you taking us
a trauma center
we have doctors waiting
off heroines pause youre in good hands now
the door shuts on heroines concerned face
the man in tan locks eyes with the driver
do it quick and spread the mess
the driver nods back
sinister implication understood
the man in tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck drive off
the trucks logo reads farm aid
freeze on him
the man in tan exhales a gust of smoke
