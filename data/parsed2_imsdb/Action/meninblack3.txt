written by etan cohen lowell cunningham standard issue throughout the south to abusive racist prison guards
widen to reveal that indeed these glasses are on the sneering face of just such a man
we follow the guard paint peeling off the rusty bars
somewhere someone is playing harmonica
prisoners yell complaints as he passes
he meets them all with shut up convict
get yer hands off the bars
the guard passes through several levels of security doors deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison home of the scum of the scum
the lazy ass guards in charge of screening visitors read magazines watch tv
footsteps someones here
which pisses them off because that means they actually have to do their jobs
the unseen visitor buzzes for help
they take their time getting off their asses
when they finally look up their gaze becomes a leer
follow it to devil girl the visitor
too tall too muscled but hot if youre into that kind of thing an r
crumb drawing come to life
she holds a cake the cutest perfectly frosted pink cake right off the cover of the betty crocker cookbook
i guess even a turd gets flies to land on it
me i like a big girl
they smirk hoping for a reaction
devil girl emits a low sinister growl like an angry doberman
the guards look at each other and get down to business i
he reaches the end of the hallway
the biggest most absurdly reinforced double security door
he punches in a code
the giant door retracts its immense weight has it squeaking and groaning the whole way
whoevers behind this thing mustve done something real bad
going through the metal detectors waved over with security wands
the guards are being thorough
maybe more thorough than they need to be
they check everything even the cake
the digital readout tells them no metal detected
well not clean but you know
they laugh buzz her through
the giant door finally opens he continues to the end of the hallway
stops in front of a cell
yells in hey yaz
you got a visitor
lets go pretty boy
just a table and chairs in the middle poured concrete
nothing a convict could say smash into the face of a guard
the perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards looks like theyre not taking chances
at the lone table devil girl waits with her cake
she hears the door open her face lights up as in steps her yaz an evil hippie biker badass right out of easy rider
a huge mane of hair a big handlebar moustache that frames a grubby unshaven face
everything about him seems strangely independently alive every strand of hair every fringe on his dirty jacket the way elvis was in his prime
he wears a distinctive skull pinkie ring
a smirk plays on his mouth that says im smarter than you asshole
the guards escort yaz who can barely walk in his chains and manacles
they dump him into one of the chairs
devil girl jumps up they lock in a kiss it goes on too long
a guard pokes them with his billy club this aint a conjugal visit
quit yer conjugating
whens the last time you conjugated anything
i brought you a cake
hey could you cut this up for us
its our anniversary
im romantic like that
a guard picks up the cake
smirks and takes a dirty three fingered scoop of frosting
be good at somethin else
they all laugh
he goes back for another scoop
i wouldnt do that
whys that convict
where he scraped away the frosting reveal a horrible alien but in a flash the mouth springs out it belongs to a voracious alien another springs out behind it they
consume the guards entire face
the aliens jump into yazs hands like a matching pair of grotesque organic sidearms as vicious and bloodthirsty as their master snarling and hungry for blood
the guards draw their weapons but yaz is faster
he launches his aliens taking them all out
yaz holsters the aliens and
one guard badly wounded crawls to sound the alarm in the reflection of a pair of blood spattered aviator glasses devil girl puts the guard down with his own weapon
she uses one of the cake aliens like a saw to get yaz out of his chains
theres nothing sexier than a girl killing for me
she runs a hand over his bicep
you got so strong in prison
yaz notices the almost dead guard im not just a man of brute force you know
i prefer to be known for my rapier wit his tongue shoots out of his mouth like a rapier impaling the guard
the tongue retracts he and devil girl kiss
they collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw open the door
prisoners go nuts guards scramble smoke screaming chaos
yaz and devil girl armed with weapons they took off the dead guards blast their way out
hes a sociopathic badass
and shes no slouch either
along the way yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs an armload of weapons shotguns pistols and a rocket propelled grenade rpg
he uses and discards them as he goes
they head for the front gate and freedom
they turn the corner and find guards in full riot gear plexiglass shields helmets shotguns all aimed at yaz
all yaz has left is his rpg
give it up yaz
theres no way out
a beat of stand off yaz and devil girl facing off against the guards
no one blinking
whats gonna go down
you cant win
youve only got one shot in there
yaz lets the tension linger he seems to enjoy it
the guards swelter in their heavy riot gear
you look hot
mind if i open a window
the guards share a look huh
yaz grins turns his rpg towards the wall behind the guards
the guards faces go hey
what are you doing
dont do that
yaz blasts a hole in the wall the guards are immediately sucked out like from a hole blown in an airplane
yaz steps through the hole
as he and devil girl step through the hole take a deep satisfied breath of freedom
reveal we are on
the signage on the prison reads intergalactic department of yaz looks up at the blue marble of earth smiles
as yaz fixes his gaze on our planet his hair his fringes independently articulate yazs malevolent emotions
they also seem drawn here
like bees they express a collective intelligence
im coming for you
following yazs gaze to the earth we launch into
mib credits fly us through the galaxy
ending on a particularly inhospitable looking planet as it revolves we observe its strange craters and surface where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases
when you really think about it the universe is a pretty awful place
full of danger brutality and ten million kinds of scum
so the trick is to find one or two things that make life in this cesspool worth living
and reveal we are actually looking at
rotating on a spit
jay and kay watch this awful duck rotate
that nasty greasy thing makes your life worth living
theres people eating here younger than that duck
i was talking about the noodles
best noodles in town
and we are in tanks everywhere filled with strange fish
an eclectic ny crowd eats wall street guys hipsters a chinese family or two a couple of nyu professor types who love the authenticity of this place
kay flashes a badge to the owner chinese
good evening mr
heavily accented barely kay jay
so happy see you
wu get you regular table
not so fast wu
wed like to take a look in the tanks
yes you see very fresh
the tanks in the back wu
please no english you come back later
hey save the chop socky bullshit for the locals wu
we need to see the kitchen
why are you busting my balls jay
jay take a look at this
wu protests jay blows by him
so this is what youre passing off as tuna
reveal a giant tank holding a huge alien fish
wow i didnt think there was anything uglier than a catfish
jay taps on the glass the fish snarls making jay jump
ugly and a clear violation of health ordinance selling foodstuffs
thats an earth fish
very traditional from china
you arrest me thats hate crime
they turn their stares on him
i guess it would be
grabbing wus apron if you were chinese
reveal from the waist down wu has the body of a slug
cmon i got larvae to feed
and earth fish is so expensive
this is the only way i could stay afloat
you can serve it to your
out of town guests but locals get earth fish
real earth fish
the kind that doesnt jump out of their stomach and get everyone asking a lot of annoying questions
like why is my lunch eating daddy
you got it
back to the fish damn thats ugly
yeah yeah thanks guys
arent you forgetting something
wu walks them to a table seats them
for benefit of customers allow me most honorable benefit of get you noodles
be right back guys
wu walks off
jay clocks the other diners
something about this strike you as weird
yeah look clean fork
look at table two over there
they havent ordered a thing
whens the last time wu let someone sit at a table without ordering
and table five over there just drank his third cup of duck sauce
now kays radar is up come to think of it
why is wu getting our noodles
because its about to go down
wu at the door closes the blinds
he catches them looking
wu leaves quickly pulling the door behind him
the guys reach for their weapons
and it goes down its a set up and everyone in the restaurant is in on it the hipsters the families the wall street guys all draw various forms of
alien weapons and attack its like a close quarters mafia hit everyone pumping truckloads of ordnance at each other
close hand to hand combat
someone wants jay and kay dead and theyre not taking any chances
right ahead of the onslaught jay gives kay a hand signal he nods and they dive in opposite directions saving but not for long
an explosive lands between them kay gets blown out the front window rolls to a stop in the middle of the silhouetted at the top of the block a biker
on a motorcycle
as he pulls into the light yazi
kays eyes go wide with recognition
yaz grins a murderous grin
some things are worth waiting for
then come get it you worthless yaz guns the engine and bears down on kay
getting the worst of it
a messy battle through the kitchen
the giant fishs tank gets shot the fish is free
and he goes right after jay
you probably took that whole catfish thing the wrong way the fish snarls after him lunges and bites
i was jealous you know
because youre so pretty
jay battles the fish throwing pots and pans in its mouth squirting hot sauce working like a lion tamer to keep it kay
yaz getting closer
he pulls out a cannon of a gun fires into the air
this time you dont have your friends to tell you what happens next
oh i know what happens next
kay draws his equally badass looking weapon ive been waiting forty years for another shot at you scum
kay takes aim and
your weapon is empty
sorry youre having trouble
if you survive this encounter please call customer service at kay throws the gun at yaz
gets kay in his sights
all i wanted was justice kay
justice for my brothers
but you had to meddle didnt you
they deserved what they got
why dont you say that to their faces when you see them
puts the barrel in kays face and boom
yaz goes up in a giant explosion
reveal jay just fired the shot
jay looks like total hell beaten up covered with kinds of slime and alien guts
he stumbles over to kay who in contrast looks perfectly pressed
so i was thinking about making a chart for each time i save your ass
and when i do it ten times you buy me lunch
kay lets out a long weary sigh
will you settle for a drink
kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers
jay is on his phone
were gonna need a cleanup on the corner of canal and mott
and bring a net
biggest one youve got
follow jays gaze the giant fish flops its way down canal
jay and kay back in their booth jay grabs a couple noodles off another table and starts eating
through the scene various mib clean up crew people work the crime scene
why arent you eating
so what the hell was that guy
weighing his words yaz
put him away a long time ago
biggest mistake i ever made
was he the wrong guy
shouldve killed him
yeah well dont worry i think i took care of him
that was too easy
i make it look easy
thats the problem with being my partner
you get used to my game
its what dr
phil would call taking for granted
you dont get it hoss
this guy is different
worse than anyone
he tried to blow up the earth but i stopped him
he developed a dislike for me and for certain behaviors of mine such as being alive
cmon you know better than anyone
what does an mib agent call it when alien species try to kill him
jay laughs at his own joke
kay just stares
calling off to cleanup make sure you get all of him i mean it
hes an assembler
yes sir agent kay
seriously man those noodlesll kill you before he does
i got your back
i know you do
stares at his noodles a while like theres answers in there i used to play a game with my daddy
what would you want for your last meal
could do worse than this
i used to play a game with my dad too
id throw the ball and then itd hit the house cause he wasnt
do me a favor dont badmouth your old man
hard to badmouth someone you dont know
alright forget it
the past is the past
and right now we have something much more important to talk about
what you afraid im gonna take that mvp trophy away from you
see you later
kay takes a few tired steps and turns back and slick
a guy like yaz can come after you when you least expect it
jay watches kay walk away
looks like hes carrying a heavy load
turns his attention to the clean up crew what part of clean up everything dont you understand
theres a spleen on that car
on it sir
a glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of
she reaches down
we see a finger with the distinctive skull inching its way along the road
you okay baby
mommas got you
jay at his desk papers and folders everywhere searching we see what hes looking through kays old case files
where are you yaz
and he finds it
here we go
jay opens the yaz incident report pictures of yaz a type written report telling us yaz apprehended by agent farther down on the page a casualty report one ready to
bring the pain
reveal zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit
a sign says closed for league night we follow a couple normal looking bowlers into safely inside the bowlers remove their heads which become their bowling balls
its the league championship game aliens vs
mib agents mib agents and aliens say hi exchange trash talk
we see shots of games in progress an alien rolls a ball when it gets to the end of the lane it sticks out arms taking down all the pins
the aliens cheer slap tentacles clink beers and swallow them whole
a many armed alien re sets the pins
a giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul line
and gutter ball
he gets mad and shoots the pins with his laser eyes
we end up with jay and the mib team not bowling because zed paces wearing way too much bowling regalia
we either roll or forfeit and i didnt put this on to forfeit
alright bowling robot do what we built you for
reveal an incredibly high tech robot wearing one of those white trash t shirts that reads reasons why bowling is better than women
this is my time to shine
robot fires a ball directly down into the floor
an awkward beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors
then a car alarm
there goes my perfect game
ha ha ha
guess its on me
jay rolls perfect spin jay watches willing it towards the pins which scramble out of the way
but jays roll is too good it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin a jay and his teammates triumphant
the frame of a lifetime
jay looks around of course the one time kay isnt here
jay enters looks a little worse for wear like somebody who did some celebrating last night
we see why when he hoists his giant ridiculous mib check it out the trophy raises a triumphant fist we realize it is in fact an alien
were number one
in your face
look whos league mvp
big surprise you win every year
jay in a good mood flaunts his trophy to everyone in the office
the trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash talk
where are you kay
i think you want to see this
its the bowling mvp trophy with my name on it
jay works his way to his desk
kays already at his own adjacent desk bent over his work his back to jay
maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me
kay absorbed in work doesnt answer
back still to camera yeah

jay opens the yaz file and pulls out a picture of kay
but now splashed across kays photo the words
jay stares at the photo in it we notice kay is now killed
jay grabs the yaz file the one he looked through last night but now everything is different
we see the incident report stating one casualty agent jay cant believe it he keeps reading
snatches of the typewritten incident report the casualty report a photo of kay wearing a strange medallion
jay stares struck by this kays dead
the men in black computer big board sounds the alarm
inbound missiles entering solar system
inbound missiles entering solar system
zed enters chuckling at the warning well must be a tuesday

billion lives saved
shows earth saved without shield

i wanted to build one years ago but kay talked me out of it
kay talked you out of it
kay wouldnt do that
hes the most distrustful person in the galaxy
he personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe
i thought we didnt have any enemies anymore
a strangers just a friend you havent met
yeah thats working out great
look i dont know whats frying everyones brains but i remember the missile shield kay the real kay loved that thing
he wouldnt shut up about it

jay looks at the yaz file
he grabs a picture of yaz where the hell did he
get an iphone in
peeking out of yazs jacket an iphone
something clicks kay said yaz can get you anywhere anytime
so yaz killed kay in and now theres no missile shield
jay realizes something and runs off i love you jay
youre definitely not kay
he runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end nine minutes to impact
i always loved you microwave
on the microwave it beeps plaintively
jay runs off with purpose
july in the city
a perfect summer day
kids eat ice cream
old ladies head to matinees
the streets of new york team with humanity blissfully unaware that they are about to die
in other words a tuesday
jay runs through time square where guys sell stuff on blankets
desperately looking for someone
among the sellers a suspicious looking guy wearing a strange mixture of anachronistic clothing tri cornered hat
as soon as he sees jay his eyes go wide and he flees
jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him lays him out
where you going in such a hurry obadiah
what are you talking about
he throws his arms up revealing a pocket watch and a telescope
i know youve been time travelling

jay forces the guy to look up we see the missiles
those hit the sun in minutes
you want to live out those minutes
or you want me to take you out of your misery
jay picks up an ancient weapon crossbow blunderbuss off the blanket and puts it to the criminals head
okay okay but dont say i didnt warn you man

i just want a name
fine but its the last one youll ever hear
think michael cera at his most geeky
hi im trevor

well if you dont have an appointment youll have to come back tomorrow
yeah well the thing about tomorrow is well all be busy being dead

everyone thinks their computer problem is the world coming to an end
take a look at this
jay directs ceras sightline to the sky ahhh
what is that
that is were all dead in
seven unless what
you start sharing the illegal time travel tech youve been slinging
excuse me can you tell me which one of these batteries is better
the hour or the you only need seven minutes get the cheap one
he grabs trevor
where is it
okay okay ill show you
but this is incredibly powerful technology so it must remain absolutely secret
trevor leaves his post jay follows absolutely secret do you understand
yes but were running out of time hey
with you in a second maam
itll only take a minute
you see my nannys phone number got erased from my favorites and i have to ask her what my daughter wants for her birthday
jay takes the phone
oh i see the problem
he chucks the phone across the store where it smashes to pieces
she leaves in a huff
ive always wanted to do that
okay so heres what you do
trevor pulls jay in ready to lay this top secret information on him
okay so go to the clock app
and shake it
jay does it
on the phone time travel beta now you just type in the year you want to travel to
on the phone its augmented reality the image through the phone is the image of the targeted time period
this is highly crucial time travel is nothing to mess with
you cant change anything you cant use new technology or all of space time can just kablooey
yeah well is it ok if i change yeah
yeah thats cool
jay is about to enter time travel
wait hold on a second
if you go im just gonna stay
and be dead
dont worry ill fix it
youll only be dead for a little while
jay dissolves into a time travel effect
cera is left alone
the missiles get ever closer
trevor opens a voice recorder app trevors last words
should anyone find this let history remember that trevor was a man of noble bearing quiet dignity
and the world is vapor
jay comes to groggy like he has the worst hangover of all time brain bigger than his skull trying to make his eyes focus
trying to make sense of his strange blinding white environment is this the afterlife
the reverie disrupted by a toilet flush the white resolves into jay realizes hes in a mens room sitting in a urinal
the music transitions whatever hip hop featuring a s sample was playing in the apple store now continues as the s song itself played over a tinny portable radio
he hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of one of the stalls washes his hands
and flips jay a quarter
jay stares at it a beat confused
misreading his confusion the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter
what the heck youre doing a great job
the kid leaves
jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in
white guys on ibm selectric typewriters as far as the eye can see like the office in the apartment
jay stops in his tracks taking in the ness of it all
an officious guy annoyed runs up
did his girl not put in the order
the officious guy glares at the girl in her s
shoves a bill in jays run down to woolworths two hamburger sandwiches fries egg cream and a pack of luckies
if youre back in half an hour you can keep the change
jay looks at the single dollar bill
on the double ok
jays moves to the elevator waits for it
pockets the profits of the racist misunderstandings
elevator opens the elevator operator opens the door jay climbs in with a car full of older executives
jay shakes his head just taking this all in
youre all dead now
just as the elevators about to close a leggy blonde tosses him a set of keys
the big man wants his caddy
the doors close
jays got the keys
he looks at the parking tag walks down a row of beautiful classic cars looking for the right car stops and smiles
reveal jay cruising in the most gorgeous coupe deville convertible
fins chrome a thing of beauty
from the seat next to him a fedora
he puts it on completing the look
in the background we notice the leggy blond getting yelled at by the guy who must be the big man jay honks and waves thank you
jay finds some classic s music and enjoys himself for a minute a sweet ride through s new york
a great hit the temptations cant get next to you comes on the radio
jay is swept up in the music and soon is at a light he pulls even with an older brooklyn italian couple
they give him a disapproving look
the woman clutches her pearls just a little more protectively
he smiles and leans towards them
he laughs and drives off
pulls up at
the secret entrance to mib hq familiar from the first movie
jay strides up to the entrance and
cant open the door
bangs on the door nothing
shaking the knob calling to the guard
from behind him help you
look a little lost
yeah thanks listen
jay turns and is face to face with two grinning staten island cops
he instantly realizes whats about to go down
yeah guess i knew this wasnt gonna be just people handing me money and cadillacs
ill be on my way
thats an awful nice car
kind of work you do individual of your particular
to buy a car like that
wouldnt be anything illegal would it
you an athlete or something
yeah im the north american champion of kiss my ass
the cop loses his smile turns to his partner that sound like resisting arrest to you
they grab him start to frisk him well well
boy youre gonna have a little problem explaining this
the cop holds up jays high tech gun the noisy cricket and his neuralizer
a black crown vic screeches up between the cops and jay
out steps kay but years younger
flashes a badge ill take it from here
who the hell are you
agent kay division special
gives jay a look black ops
thank you for your cooperation if i could ask you to look here for a moment kay pulls out what looks like a neuralizer and swiftly beats each one over
the head its just a blackjack they crumple
kay is that you
oh man its good to see you buddy
jay hugs kay who remains stony faced
jay gets a little choked up to see his friend alive kay is a rock
look at you all
sort of young
thats got to be the first time an unregistered alien caught sneaking onto earth was happy to see me
jay pulls away realizing oh
you think aw thats funny
no its not like that

if i had a partner id know it
theres a simple explanation for that
im all ears
you see im your partner

a longdry stare
well thank you very much
hey no problem man

but im still gonna have to bring you in
yeah ok i know it sounds a little it sounds a lot thats why im going to prove it to you
because if i werent from the future would i know about your little top secret headquarters right here
he tries to force the door open
i said here

an abandoned building filled with spiders etc
not here yet
but it will be
gonna need to get rid of the raccoons and bats and stuff but
itll be real nice
game room over there for your pinball you love your pinball
lotta good times there im going for an extra ball jay
and id be there
long stare from kay
and word of advice i dont know what its like on your planet but around here a guy with your
complexion in a car like that is gonna get some attention he doesnt want
we hear the way too loud death rattle exhaust note of what sounds like ten harleys at once
reveal yaz the nightmare biker looking like dennis hopper meets satan riding a badass custom skull themed rig that might have dropped out of the brain of stanley mouse
his skull ring gleams on his pinkie
devil girl sits behind him hands on his shoulders
we ride with them a beat tearing down the highway
they stop at a light even with a brightly painted microbus full of hippies
one of the hippies leans out hey you guys like to party
care to make a trade for the mama
yaz pulls out his alien guns
the stoned hippie smiles serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths
makes a peace sign
make love not war
yaz fires the alien it launches into the microbus followed by its brother
the microbus rocks hippies scream the bus dents from the inside out
on a bumper sticker if this vans a rockin dont come a knockin
the guns finished return to yaz
yaz surveys the carnage picks up a medallion off one of the hippies
but looking at it more closely frowns and throws it away
the head back on their way
blood drips over the ass gas or grass bumper sticker
we dissolve from the blood to a deep red strawberry sundae
widen to reveal we are in
a great nyc automat
the kind of place you go when you like to be alone
loners and weirdos populate the tables minding their own business
immigrants read foreign papers
jay follows kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines offering pies
is this your favorite place
zero human interaction
kay ignores him
so how old are you
wow you got some city miles on you
kay ignores him stops in front of a machine offering specials
jay grabs a paper off a nearby table we see headlines about nixon vietnam the apollo launch
jay looks at the date july
then we have two days
kay really takes his time picking out the right sandwich
hey look i know your lunch is important but like i said we only have two days here
here we go
kay puts some money in the machine is about to make his selection
jay reacts to it gross
we see the most unappealing ham sandwich ever
the meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy
no one in their right mind would buy this sandwich
no way man
i am not letting you eat that
i didnt come all the way here to have you die before i can tell you kay reaches for the button
jay slaps his hand away
a beat of undignified hand slap fighting no way man
no way the world ends because you had to eat that thing kay succeeds in hitting the button and a secret door instantly spins them around and jay and kay
are a cloud of smoke
it clears and reveals mid century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe
its how isaac asimov and ray bradbury would have imagined the mib offices
the cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking
aliens run around with ashtrays cocktail shakers and cigarettes
the alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices
lib agents have the feel of ivy league privilege
very male and very white
women are there to be secretaries and eye candy
two many armed aliens stock the automat
kay tosses one the sandwich it goes right back into the automat
jay recognizes the aliens its the twins
long alien name and bob
dont worry you guys get a big promotion in like years
kay takes jay down an escalator
quick atmospheric establishing shots of mib a wall of black and white tvs monitoring the aliens of the times castro
a cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high tech camera
reveal theyre using it to watch a secretarys ass
she gets wise turns they raise their martinis and she giggles at them youre incorrigible
aliens work switchboards work in the steno pool
someone barks at an alien to grab a couple mooners and go clean something up
an mib barbershop quartet practices
the men in blaaaaaaack
jay cant help laughing what planet are they from
lets go somewhere we can talk
typical interrogation room table in the middle
kay pulls out a giant form it looks like tax returns stacked together
he fits sheets of carbon between the pages
oh were gonna do the forms now
listen kay i know youre gonna do what youre gonna do but were burning time here
when i got here you had hours
now youve got
name planet of origin and galactic my name is agent jay you gave it to me
purpose of visit
to save the earth
kay looks at the form theres a number of options to check create a new race
steal earth women
offer life of eternal youth
save the earth
he checks the box
save the earth
congratulations youre the third one today
maybe youll get a balloon
fine dont believe me
but just listen to what i have to say because its going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy
it hangs in the air
are you currently pregnant or preparing to spawn
theres a killer out there
goes by yaz
hes coming for you
you told me your one regret was not killing him when you had the chance
never heard of any yaz
heres what to look for
long hair leather looks kind of like a biker
youll know him from the skull ring on his pinky
hes trying to blow up the earth and you get in his way somehow so he kills you
so if you want to live do not go to florida
i hate florida
i hate everything south of virginia
if thats what you came to tell me youre wasting your time
man youre as stubborn as you always were
i mean always will be
look its not just about you
because he kills you you dont live long enough to build the defense shield
and without a defense shield the earth gets destroyed
you get it
he kills you the earth gets destroyed
i have to save you from him so we can save the planet
kay stops writing
this is finally starting to make sense
jay looks hopeful
because youre crazy
delusions of self importance
door bangs open in walks the boss man
and it sure isnt zed
agent ex flanked by junior agent underlings
ex is a well tanned waspy jackass with a room temperature iq who probably got this job from his daddys country club connections
hes good at tennis and not thrilled about this whole civil rights fad
heard you got a mooner in here
dont take all day
were not here to babysit them just figure out where hes from and send him back
actually still trying to sort it out
he says hes human
fortunately we have the technology here to test for that
ex steps up close to jay
looks him over
then swiftly gag reflex
got it chief
kay walks jay
so whats code
they pass through a set of double doors
tilt up to reveal
jay reacts to whatever hes looking at
this little baby here is called a neuralizer
reveal the neuralizer fills an entire room
and we its manned by s labcoat technicians with sliderules and punchcards
the neuralizer itself is a piece of s tech glory magnets tubes things that look like they belong in dr
whoa whoa what
youre gonna neuralize me
you cant neuralize me
havent you been listening
two alien orderlies grab jay
have a lay down stretch
the orderlies force jay on a sort of gurney in the neuralizer the patient is fed through the machine like for an mri
you erase whats in here you erase the whole world
when its over youll forget all about this yaz and florida and the end of the world
i think itll be good for you
calm you down
i dont need to calm down
dont worry its safe
we even tested it on one of our own men
kay indicates q who wanders around like hes been lobotomized
hey agent q
q waves back hey agent q
no youre forget it
back to jay were still
fine tuning it
okay strap him down
two big ass alien orderlies force jay down
a tech flips the machine on tubes power up with huge noise jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine
jay manages to slide his key fob out of hispocket uses the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps and hes how the hell kay smiles not bad
the orderlies rush him jay knocks them out
the scientists are fraidy cats they hide
its down to jay and kay
youd make a good agent
i am a good agent
kay takes a swing at jay jay dodges it easily
thats right you always lead with your left
kay pulls his weapon jay ducks behind the neuralizer now kay cant shoot
youre just making it worse for yourself
the following plays over a game of cat and mouse around the giant structure of the neuralizer like through the stacks in a library
theres nowhere to run slim
its just if were gonna do it easy or do it hard
jay runs into a dead end
kay and the orderlies are on him
the pissed off orderlies grab him roughly force him onto the gurney
jay keeps flailing
i know you kay i can prove it
you love to bowl
bowling is enjoyed by more than million people in more than countries
you gotta do better than that
youve got a scar on the back of your right hand
jay grabs kays hand
they lock eyes for a moment
kay lets jay flip his hand over big build up revealing
kay signals the neuralizer powers up
and jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine
this is all about to be over
jay thinks desperately for a way out then eureka
what about your girl on marthas vineyard
kay looks up
jay sees an opening you chose the job over her but you never stopped thinking about her
you cant forget her
kay grabs him
how the hell do you know that
ive never told anyone that
a long look at this guy who somehow knows things he shouldnt
and he hits the power off button
but this being tube technology we stay with jays terrifying pov as he slides through the claustrophobic neuralizer chamber the tubes powering down just in time inches away from him
jay crawls out of the neuralizer shaken
you see kay
its me but kay grabs him and puts a gun on him if youre gonna drag her into this youd better be able to back up your story
because if youre jerking me around ill make a window out of your head
yeah okay um according to the file he should have entered earth space in the last couple days
did you spot any unauthorized landings in the last hours
kay looks to a tech who looks at a clipboard we did have something a landing in new jersey
kay and jay look at each other
alright youre coming with me
jay grabs his key chain
can i ask how youre planning on getting me out of here
kay leads a lobotomized jay through hq
scuse me boys
just did a code on this one
hows it going fellas
look i put on my pants
he feels one of the agents faces
kay leads him to the exit
he talks to jay as if jay is a dim rd grader who speaks little english you are a tourist from kansas
a city slicker took your wallet at the bus station
kay leads jay to a set of doors marked exit to street two out
the agents nod to kay and wave him through the exit
which deposits them in
the peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square
a creepy pervert sits in a booth
puts money into the machine
the wall slides up and to his surprise instead of a peepshow
jay and kay climb out
off the creeps reaction aww
did i spoil the mood
on the new jersey state parkway youd better not be wasting my time yeah yeah
window out of my head
but hey if i dont save you im dead anyway
so do what you want to me just make sure you watch out for yourself
they pull up to
a squat shack on the edge of a dump home office to a legitimate local business
the windows are bloodied and broken from the inside
corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building all showing disturbing spore growth
v xukjbibbals for reference the corpses dematerialize and disappear
this doesnt look like a mob hit
thats a hell of an observation
what gave it away
jay points beyond the building
a sheer drop which is the edge of a huge smoking crater and how did this crater get here
in the center a giant rocket all chrome and flash gordon
it formed the crater on landing
were going in
kay draws his weapon
arent you gonna give me a
he pulls out a smith and wesson dumps the bullets and hands it over
try not to get in my way
you try not to get in my way
jay and kay move towards the building
someones firing at them they dive for cover
more gunshots jay gives kay the signal we saw in the chinese restaurant what the hell is that
stay behind me
you need to stay alive
the hell i will
jay tries to go in kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first
jay and kay bust in almost fall into the room because theyre squabbling over whos first then bam
someones hiding under a desk holding a gun over his head firing randomly
kay gets grazed they dive for cover
kays right hand is bleeding
so thats how you got the scar
jay tosses his empty gun into the corner the guy under the desk fires five times emptying his gun
jay sprints at him flips the table its a terrified quivering wiseguy
jay grabs him and disarms him
the guy is freaked out
whatd he look like
pull it together
jay slaps the guy
the guy who did this whatd he look like
looked like a biker
and he had a
he had a skull ring
jay and kay share a look
walking up to kays car
in the background mib puts up a facade around the rocket rocket waste disposal techs take samples
what about the witness
we dont have time to take him back to hq to weve got something new
with a rumbling and blasts of airhorns wheelers drive up housing the portable neuralizer
can you believe how small these things are getting
im making a decision to believe you
not because i do but because i have to you get me
he walks to the trunk pops it open
he flips a switch revealing a hidden arsenal
he grabs a cool gun and gives it to jay
jay admires the aw this means you like me doesnt it
lets go get this sunovabitch
they climb in but screech
a crown vic swerves to a stop in front of them

devil girl on the seat behind him
he pulls even with a patrol car

about justice and im looking for some people
maybe you can help me
okay get a shave and a haircut
yaz smiles sadly
have you ever lost someone close to you
ive lost everyone
everyone except them
can you help me find them
he gives the cops a picture they take it grudgingly we see it a half dozen hippies wearing medallions
the cops look at each other and raise eyebrows
only one part of town where people like that hang out
the historic village landmark
jay and kay approach
s freaks eyeball the squares
jay and kay ride to the sixth floor
theres gotta be something that connects you to yaz
what cases are you working on
well igot this whole dry ice thing
someone get killed over some dry ice
smuggling something in some dry ice
we just cant figure out what it is
wow youre pretty low on the totem pole arent you
the great kay looking for dry ice
dont push your luck
the doors open and were in
kays on the hunt for someone
they weave their way through the far out types hear snippets of high s party conversations
someone notices jays suit what are you a time traveller
that suit is so five years ago
kay sees who hes looking for grabs him we need to talk
reveal andy warhol and this is the factory and this is one of warhols famous parties
draped on warhol a bunch of strange hangers on his stars
yum pigs are getting cute
jay smiles she looks skeeved out
i meant the young one
warhol speaks with his strange yes almost alien affect
its not really a good time to talk
im creating a party
sighs totally put out but
maybe if he asks me
i would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth
jay is visibly uncomfortable
kay nudges jay do it
grumbles about what he has to do for his partner
then to warhol we need to talk
warhol and his stars ooh and ahh over jay
someone snaps a picture
amazing just amazing
alright you talked me into it
be back soon stars
from here a window looks out over the whole scene
warhol leads the guys in shuts the door and locks it
immediately his entire affect changes he rips off his wig lights a cigarette and talks like a hard nosed cop
damnit kay are you trying to blow my cover
take it easy agent w your cover is perfectly safe
are you out of your goddamned mind
its only a matter of time before they figure out im a total fraud

warhol slumps on a chair

a knock at the door warhol gets back into character

like we should take it serious
and we dont have much time
jay checks his watch
yeah yeah alright
okay talk to prell and vidal
on two beautiful women in very s fashion with incredibly giant hair one with a big afro one with big chignon hairdo
back in character vidal prell can you please talk to these nice men
the womens lips dont move they respond in incongruously whadaya want
they look like cops to me
were not rats
we swing around them to reveal that warhol kay jay are not talking to the womens faces theyre standing behind the women talking to their hair dos which we realize
are two complete hair aliens vidal and prell perched atop these women
start talking you two before you end up on a barbers floor
ah you dont scare me
kay reaches into a passing womans purse pulls out hairspray
grab some of prell and holds up the spray
he sprays the hair it starts to scream in pain
stop you bastard
im telling you we dont know anything
you wanna play tough
how about we take a ride to the barber college see how tough you are
kay keeps shaking them down but jay is distracted
something is making him think
we start to be able to make out the distinct bip
of pong jay follows the sound
to a group of people that incredible factory mix from slumming socialites to black panthers to the freakiest freaks
they surround a skanky guy and whatever theyre watching on tv is so mesmerizing its like theyre seeing the face of god
its too beautiful
someone takes a picture of the screen
jay walks around the tv reveal theyre watching classic early s pong
the skanky guy controls it via a big medallion hooked up to the tv antennae terminals
hes playing against a young clean cut square
jay grabs the wires and rips them out cutting off the game
everyone jeers him
on kay hearing the noise turns to see whats going on
what the hell man
just wondering where you got that
the crowd laughs
so my mother gave you a technology that hasnt been jay grabs him by the throat
someone takes pictures
someone claps in delight
now how about you tell me where you really got it
the skanky guy knows hes in trouble
okay no hassles man
i got it from that dude over there
with the beard
jay turns lets go just long enough for the guy to leap out jay takes off after him kay joins and the chase is on jay and kay chase the
guy through various s locations a commune an ashram a folk club a protest
everywhere they are mistaken for pigs people get in their way
to jays surprise young kay is a hell of a runner in incredible shape
it gets competitive between them
until jay cant keep up kay takes off
kay runs the skanky guy down jay huffs and puffs his way over grabs the medallion
alright one more time
whered you get this
it was a gift bullshit
kay puts a gun on him
this is my partner
hes about to get fired for excessive violence and he doesnt have much left to lose
i borrowed it
kay cocks the gun
i stole it okay
thats what i like
a nice honest thief
stole it from who
they dont even care man
they leave their money everywhere
i dont know who they are
then youre not worth much to us are you
the gun comes back out
i heard they were archanans
theyre pretty far out of their neighborhood
i didnt think wed ever had one on earth before
i can tell you where they live
southwest corner of rd and avenue c
jay rips the medallion off his neck
ill do a lot worse
get the hell out of here
the guy runs off
whats the deal with the necklace
you were wearing one just like it when you died
jay and kay pull up in front of the building
he pulls out a notebook
i was going to come by here tomorrow to check out a lead on the dry ice case
so you come here tomorrow get tangled up with these archanans
and yaz kills me
something like that
so do me and the people of earth a favor and be careful
aw put on your big girl panties and lets go
hey ive always got my big girl panties on
that didnt sound right
jay and kay ride up
that thing back at the party what was it
some kind of game
not just any game pong
game of kings
but it wasnt invented until
how do you know that
because i was the only kid on my block who didnt have one
aw whats the matter
daddy didnt buy you the toy you wanted
didnt have a daddy to not buy me toys
heres the only thing i ever got from him he holds up his key chain
it gets worse
youre the closest thing i have to a dad
jay and kay move carefully ready for trouble
they get to the door apartment
jay points to the door this is it
they see the door is smashed in punched off its hinges and punched into the door the impression of a skull ring thats from yazs ring
he was here
or is here
jay signals kay why do you keep doing that
they move into the room on high alert
but its empty
they realize the strangeness of the room alien technology including a tv hooked up to something strange with tons of wires hanging out and lots of money
lots of money
not just piles the actual furniture is made of stacks of money
theyve been using it for scrap paper for napkins
so yaz was never after you
he was after the archanans
you just got in the way
which must make them damn important
but what does he want with them
no sign of struggle
they mustve cleared out before he got here
like they knew he was coming
and hes probably on their trail now
but where the hell did they go
they look around puzzling over this place
jay picks up a bill off a table made out of stacks of money
think this might tell us something
on the bill a strange series of words and numbers
looks like some kind of code
well take it to hq run it through the computer
figure out where they went
jay and kay walk down the dark hallway yaz steps out of the shadows jay and kay head back to hq
kay drives jay stares at the bill squinting at it turning it over how about bible verses
so this is how you do it in the future huh
you just keep guessing until you figure it out
they stop at a light
someone frantically pounds on the trunk a frightened year old prostitute wearing what is basically jodi fosters taxi driver hooker costume hotpants mary janes halter top
theres something familiar about her face
for gods sake
help me would you
theres some maniac after me slow down whos after you
he was like nothing i ever saw crazy eyes and this freaky skull ring
jay and kay look at each other get in
thank you so much
this is a dangerous city for a girl
the light turns green were on the girls face
jay and kay looking straight ahead
so where can we take you
just make a left up here
kay does it
theres a rushing noise
in the back seat hot pants girl is inflating and becoming the car turns down a dark deserted alley
are you sure
not for me
reveal the girl has fully inflated into her natural form devil girl
the outfit is grotesque on her
set piece fight in the car
employing cool mib tech built into the car
devil girl subdued locked into the trunk in a containment sack like what youd use to stuff a raccoon into
the fights over the guys slump against the car
what the hell was that
i dont know but id bet you two to one yaz sent her
light bulb moment for jay say that again
i think yaz sent her
no the whole thing
id bet you two to one yaz sent her
on jay realizing he grabs the bill i know where they are
walking we hear sounds of crowds of cheering reveal we how are we going to find them
any idea what an archanan looks like
and then they see
a circle of what looks like tibetan monks colorful playful dressed in robes
they could only be the archanans
the group comprises one older archanan the lama and three younger attendants
i think i found them
they step into within the space around the archanans the chaos and noise of the crowd melts away
there are three archanans and one distinctive older one in the middle a giant pile of winnings
all is peaceful within this space
they greet jay and kay happily chant a strange mantra king lady big trouble classy
the faint sound of an announcer results for the sixth race king sweet sophie big trouble and red gent
superba pays to one
youre in danger youre in danger
youre in danger
jay thinks theyre playing the echo game like little kids very cute but
in eight seconds please do us the kindness of ducking
they turn to see yaz he levels a weapon at them fires
jay and kay duck the weapon just misses
lets get into trouble
jay and kay engage him as they run off the lama calls remember please to take the bridge
and we begin try to include motorcycle and horse elements
could also involve the actual aqueduct which is close by
at one point jay and kay seem stuck they remember
take the bridge
they take the bridge which gives them an advantage on yaz
at one point jay corners yaz yaz blasts him jay is knocked down
but he shakes it off reveal the pong medallion blocked the shot
culminating at a toxic waste dump in staten island with yaz compressed into
a six inch cube hauled away in the back of a garbage truck
the guys give chase they want him captured but no luck
the truck drives off
only a matter of time before he comes back
and this time he might be really mad
jay and kay return to an empty race track
its like a ghost town
no archanans to be found
damn we lost them
they come all the way across the universe and just when were about to figure out what all of this is about then faintly
a cheer hold that thought
they follow it out to which is empty
no spectators no horses
just the archanans
who stand near the track watching
and yet they cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race ever
jay and kay exchange a what the hell
look and approach them
everybody is everybody
guess i cant argue with that
so listen up yaz is down but he wont be for long so we need to start coming up with some answers
first of all the archanans cheer
jay shakes it off
the archanans cheer again
what are you cheering about
jay and kay keep approaching
puzzled the track is empty
jay and kay cross the threshold into their aura
and now the empty stands are filled with cheering spectators watching where are we
we are tomorrow
jay steps backwards out of the aura back to empty ghost town
steps back in tomorrows rabid fans cheering the race
from the archanans pov we see all versions all ages of the effect is they see all time at once
can see the future
it is what you call the future
ah the future
an illusion of the time bound borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another
yaz suffers from this greatly
and so he must have revenge on your planet
he mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were
just not now
okay someday youre gonna explain that to me but right now you need to stop the riddles because theres about two minutes until yaz crawls out of his hole and
gets back to trying to kill you
so help me out
i need to know in english why yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the earth
we know what he will know
you know what
he will know
figuring it out you know his plans
and youre going to stop him
he wants to kill you because you stop him
yes if he does not kill us first
dont you know if hes going to
sometimes he kills us sometimes he does not
there are many futures
okay which future is the one where you live and the earth doesnt blow up
the one where you take us home
jay and kay exchange a look alright lets get these freaks home and pronto
you must let go of your
attachment to time beginning with your concept of pronto
and on that thup thup thup blacked out helicopters
illegal aliens you are surrounded
do not attempt to flee
jay and kay yell into the backwash of the rotors no
we need to get them home
but its all drowned out in the wind and dust
mib squad cars pull up and surround them
jay and kay look for an escape route but mib cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere
mib agents descend on ropes round up the archanans agent kay
return to your vehicle
rendezvous at headquarters in minutes
we will escort you by air
and from the noise and chaos of the choppers
jay and kay watch through a glass wall
inside the conference room the archanans sit around a table
ex paces clearly talking about the archanans to the other agents
body language tells us the mib reach some kind of consensus
ex comes out jay and kay hop up
ex notices jay for the first time whats he doing here
didnt we just bust you
that was someone else
all these mooners look alike right
a beat and ex buys it completely
weve talked about it
and you are to be commended agent kay
you did a fine job bringing these illegals in
now its our job to get them out of the city for containment
somewhere where if someone decides to blow them off the map the collateral damage will be insignificant
but theyre in danger
one of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them looks to jay and if that happens were all going with them because theyre our only
hope of survival
christ if we listened to every mooner who showed up telling us how they were gonna save the world thats all wed do
do you know why earth is still standing
why were not a smoldering chunk of nothing
because we dont stick our nose into other peoples business
especially people in danger because they have enemies and those enemies destroy earth
are you going to execute my order or not
i thought we were supposed to be the good guys
careful agent kay
that sounds like insubordination
kay walks up to ex looks him dead in the eye it sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach because your head is so far up
your ass thats the only way you could possibly see
youre off this case
stick to dry ice
if i catch you near them or him again ill have your badge
to a bunch of other you four take the archanans to transpo
one of the agents looks up me
im just an accountant go
you just get out of here
the mib agents grab the archanans and hustle them out
kay leans in to them dont worry well
yes we know
kay looks up sees jay smiling at him
i knew agent kay wasnt just gonna lie down
so whats the plan
you heard the man
weve got dry ice to investigate
its the truck that compacted yaz
we follow it to the where the truck dumps its load
who gets processed and pressed into a cube
on the cube it begins to swell and force itself back into its natural shape
around the piles of garbage other yaz parts seek each other workers stop what theyre doing get out of the way of something disturbed
we see yaz and understand the reaction yaz might be back together but not at all right a leg stuck in the wrong place the head at a weird angle
he catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself
pops out an eye swaps an arm
he unfurls his tongue smells the air where did you go
a sleazy guy is suprised to see not just an agent
but four agents and four hare krishna looking guys come out of his peep show window
one of the archanan attendants smiles at him you will die alone
yeah i know
the agents lead the archanans through the worlds greatest emporium of sleaze
the hustle and bustle cabs picking up and dropping off we find a long line of unhappy kids making unhappy parents kids crying pulling on moms dress
we see its the line to an ice cream truck
and the line isnt moving because kay is questioning the dry ice smoke rises from the freezer just a few more questions about dry ice and ill be out of
a bird call makes kay turn
he sees jay waving him over pointing at something the mib agents lead the archanans into the station
i told you ten times i got no idea what dry ice is
thanks youve been very helpful
jay and kay peel off follow the mib agents leaving the vendor scratching his head
he turns back to the kids
jay and kay follow the mibers and archanans inside
the men in black blend in easily with the guys going home to greenwich but the archanans are easy to spot
jay and kay tail them and lose them for an instant
they spot a glimpse of robe run after them turn a corner and its just some hare krishnas
but jay spots the archanans
over there kay
as they run off perhaps youd like to join us for a vegetarian meal
jay and kay chase after the mib agents and archanans the mib agents approach a cordoned off area with signs warning wet paint
the agents look around then slip pass the ropes and through a narrow door marked wet paint or men working jay and kay follow
through the skinny half painted door
an equally skinny escalator descends s of feet
a problem its going the wrong way bringing incognito aliens and mib agents up into grand central
jay and kay muscle their way down lots of scuse me pardon me hey dont grab that
but once they power past the crowds jays jaw drops as we reveal
a much bigger station under grand central a secret hub for sending aliens back and forth all over the country
its basically a series of giant pneumatic tubes people sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere in banks offices etc
a mix of aliens and mib agents put on helmets and pads board the tubes and fwoop off
quick shots a shoeshine stand set up for many limbed aliens
a newsstand with strange papers
the beatles in line for liverpool with a blue meanie
kareem abdul jabbar
on your oclock
they spot the mibers and the archanans next to the tube to the mib agents put helmets and pads on the archanans
theyre about to load them into the tubes jay and kay approach hold up
youre off this case kay
yeah but i heard theres some dry ice in queens
magic show at a kids birthday party
better hustle you can get there before
they all laugh at kay
change in plans
we didnt hear about any change in plans
yeah ex just gave us the new orders check this out kay gestures them closer he reaches for something in his jacket pocket
the mibers lean in
and kay grabs them and shoves them backwards towards the the mib agents stumble surprised the archanans not surprised step deftly out of the way the mibers fwoop fwoop fwoop
into the tube
jay and kay exchange a smile and realize
one last very young agent is still standing there wide eyed dont hurt me
im just the accountant
he reaches for his radio
jay talks him down i know youre a little freaked out and you want to call for backup but listen when youve done this job for a while you realize
theres one rule things arent what they seem
these are innocent beings that need our protection
are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in toronto
the young agent thinks puts down the radio
whats your name
agent zed sir
youre gonna be okay kid
jay cant help laughing
hes gonna be better than ok
im not gonna give you so much shit anymore
the radio crackles zed whats your status
detainees are on the tube to toronto
no sign of kay
copy that good work zed
zed crosses off
be nice to him
jay kay and the archanans regroup
okay you all wanted to go home
well here we are
so how do you want to get off this rock
you guys have the spaceport on long island yet
kay just looks at him
that place is a dump anyway
best margaritas in the universe my ass
what about the one in ohio
the archanans smile
here is the way home
the lama removes a postcard sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants
the attendant bows and ritually passes it
it passes through all the attendants and then to jay
jay gives it a look
the only future that ends with life begins there
ill take that as a strong yes
jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal
kay catches up where are we going
jay looks at him a beat
and im gonna buy you the biggest t bone you ever saw when we get there
so you head over to the omaha tube and im gonna help these guys over here for a second
but ill meet you in a minute
by the omaha tube
they stare at each other sounds good
see you there
kay turns to head off then lightening fast spins and reaches into jays pocket snatches out the card omaha my ass
kay looks at the card greetings from sunny florida a tourist post card with palm trees oranges and beaches
no no no
thats what it says
dont you get it
yeah its hot and muggy
the old people drive slow
well stay somewhere air conditioned and only drive after three when theyre at dinner
this is why you were there
because of them
you were helping them and thats why
thats why you get killed
i saw the report myself
agent kay dead at the scene
killed by yaz
you know what an mib agent calls it when he faces death
besides i got you to watch my back right
they walk to the florida tube i just want you to know im doing this out of love man
he gets his answer jay decks him
you stay home and stay alive
but kay isnt down
i told them id help them im honor bound to do it
kay throws a dirty sucker punch to jays kidney
jay recovers and throws an uppercut to kays solar plexus
jay winces like he just hit something hard
damn you used to have some abs
they continue to pound each other
as they trade punches i cant let you go to florida
i make my own future
besides im younger and stronger than you
they both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time feet collide
bet youre sorry you taught me that
the fight continues
theyre wearing down circling each other
and then kay fakes a left you always lead with your but this time kay connects with his right knocking jay down hard
had enough yet
on jay gasping spent using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor
i cant let you go i love you
jay kicks kay savagely in the groin
kay lunges at jay
its a stalemate
aw hell look at that behind you im not falling for that
im not kidding kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so jay can see
the archanans very cheerfully benignly hopping into the jay and kay share a look and both run into the tube
jay kay and the archanans hurtle through the mib system of pneumatic tubes
the archanans fly through the tubes relaxed and happy moving gracefully like fish through water
kay is in perfect controlled tube position everything clenched hands by his sides looking like hes in an air luge
jay is screaming and ricocheting off the sides of the tube like a pinball
they shoot south passing landmarks of the eastern seaboard
intercut with jays face blown back like right stuff astronauts in a g force simulator
jay flails towards the archanans grabs onto the lamas robe yelling over the wind i have to know can i really prevent kays murder
thanks good to hear
but where there was death there will be death
what does that mean
the lama smiles and zips ahead through the current
jay gets clobbered by a bend in the tube
sugar cane workers pick crops next to a giant irrigation they look up as screams doppler through the pipe what the hell was that
we follow the scream
jay continues to scream all passengers prepare to de tube
please make sure all helmet and crash suit straps are securely fastened
on jay no helmet no crash suit
no one said anything about jay kay and the archanans are launched from the tube like human cannonballs
the archanans land gracefully floating down air currents like kung fu masters
kay hits with both feet and rolls
jay face plants into the water
jay looks up five manatees stare him down
the alpha manatee emits along lowing manatee song which resolves into sorry i have something in my throat
they went that way
surrounded by thick brush trees
jay staggers out of the water looking beat to hell
reveal everyone else looks clean and pressed
jay looks around nothing but brush and swamp
listen your uh
i dont think this here is the way back to your planet
the archanans smile and walk off
jay and kay follow hey wait we cant help you get home if you dont tell us how
he trails off as they emerge from the brush and stop dead
so thats how youre getting home
reveal a glorious shot of the apollo rocket and they head towards destiny
jay and kay take in the massive scene
the huge crowd the security the press
history in the t minus minutes
so weve got
minutes to get past security
get into mission control
reprogram the flight path pull the astronauts off the launch and get them in that rocket
better get started
i feel like ive been here
okay ive got a plan to get through security
we just need to be invisible
hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike kicking up a he gets stuck behind an wheeler
yaz revs and speeds down the causeway the rocket in the distance
heavily guarded by air force security people with a lot of guns and very little sense of humor
and up steps jay leading kay and the archanans
i need to get inside
ive got the big mans cadillac
all washed and ready to before the words are out of jays mouth hes down on the ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck
move and its the last thing you do
the security is on kay and the archanans forcing them down
kay gives jay a look good work
its like were not even here
sir this is unit bravo we have an attempted perimeter breach into mission control subhallway charlie
one caucasian one negroid four
well hold them here sir
youve got it wrong let me explain
anything you have to say you can say to my superior officer
and boy does he hate your kind
someone is approaching
someone who walks like they mean business
here are the intruders sir
jay cranes to see the colonel hes african american
jay grins relieved finally someone i can talk to but the colonel is on him before you can blink an equal opportunity hardass to the extreme the only thing were
gonna talk about is what specific breed of dumbass you have to be to try to penetrate my launch site
he begins patting jay down
eyes widen weapon
you are going away for a long time
to his men get them into holding
well interrogate them after the launch
and jay goes for it sir before you do that my name is agent jay
i appreciate your position but im from a top secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now on behalf of
the people of earth i
need to commandeer your rocket so points to archanans can board it
can we count on your help
the colonel stares at him for a beat
so you want us to stop the most massive endeavor in american history an event being watched by the entire world the moment that will be the culmination of a
challenge put to us by president john f
so a bunch of hare krishnas can take a joy ride
would it help if i told you im from the future
get them out of here
he motions to the other mps who move to roust the group
but the lama takes the colonel by the arm hey
and pulls him into his aura
on the colonels face
he sees something powerful the lama releases him
the officer is stunned for a moment
blinks back into focus and turns to the other guards you men are no longer needed here
report to delta gate
the colonel turns to jay kay and the archanans the rest of you come with me
the colonel heads into the building
things change when you can see the future right
they sure do
this is definitely about some next level shit
the pa crackles t minus seven minutes to launch
mission control is an underground hub with hallway spokes
jay kay and the archanans follow the colonel down the hallway towards the main mission control center
a hive of activity leading up to the launch
miles and miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button down shirts
thick glasses slide rules pocket protectors a sea of ibm men
everyone smoking rushing around last minute chaos
hunkered over computer monitors
reel to reel data tapes spinning
less computing power than an iphone but we put a man on the moon
t minus six minutes
weve got a change in plans
everyones consumed with the launch and wearing headsets they ignore him he keeps trying hey
attention over here
i need to talk to the man who can re program this rocket
still nothing can anyone hear me
you in the glasses
people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn
they see the colonel with an engineer at a workstation
this is your man
the guys approach the engineer you see this card
the rockets flight path is all on cards just like this one
right here he indicates a long metal rack like a mail sorting machine that holds many s of cards and feeds them into a processor
an archanan approaches and blows on the cards it hits the cards like a mini whirlwind
the cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave chads fly off theyre magically re programmed
and fly back into the rack
the engineers are stunned
and then panic the trajectory has been altered
a big low tech graphic appears on the big low res monitor abort launch
slow down there
everyone be cool
coolness is an inappropriate response
the engineer flips the safety off a red button marked abort aborting in
do not abort
the engineer raises his aborting hand about to slam it down in the button
this might help
kay reaches into his jacket takes out what appears to be a whats that
you been holding out on me
little something ive been working on
glasses if youve got em
jay and kay put on their glasses
jay and kay in sunglasses for a moment its the iconic look of the posters
ha ha just like old times
oh and you might want to get under a desk
get under a
the engineers hand comes down
but before he can hit the kay hits the trigger but instead of a flash a million pellets explode out of the neuralizer bouncing everywhere knocking out the engineers
the pellets keep whizzing everywhere through the following jay and kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting kod
what the hell was that
its a high velocity non lethal pellet gun
the boys in the lab call it the hiv nol pog
the archanans deftly step out of the way or the pellets swerve around them
ex runs in flanked by security and or mib agents
there he is
take him down
shoot him if you have to
ex catches a pellet to the groin crumples
the pellets settle
the engineers start coming to dazed wondering what the hell just happened kay and jay give them a neuralizer cover what the hell is wrong with you people
raquel welch comes by for a personal tour of mission control and you faint like a bunch of schoolgirls
what a waste
raquel welch was here
five minutes to get to the rocket
and keep your eyes open for yaz
they head out
with only a few minutes to go service trucks clear the tarmac dozens of fuel trucks etc
driving to get a safe distance away from the blast
the all swerve out of the way as one car cuts through them going the opposite way parting the waters its a military jeep the colonel at the wheel jay
kay and the rest barely hanging on
the apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the rocket
the only car
looking up at that rocket
on neil armstrong practicing thats one little step that i did one big step for the rest of you
wait thats not it
did that sound weird to you guys
the driver slams on the brakes what in sam hill is going on
reveal the jeep pulled in front of the astronauts cutting them off
no disrespect meant major
im a big fan
especially of the haircut
but weve got some bigger fish to fry
hand over the flight suits
they start pulling the astronauts off the truck
the astronauts protest
lets go people
why dont you take one giant leap out of there
they look at jay and kay
at the colonel
thats right gentlemen
you need to listen to them
were going to protocol twelve
the astronauts acquiesce
i didnt want to get in that death trap anyways
im still getting my parade right
the same guards who stopped jay and kay are back on duty
they hear something they draw weapons and its yaz
still looking like evil incarnate
the guards take in this unholy picture
i want in
the guards look at each other should we radio the colonel
you wanna get yelled at again
they wave him by
kay loads the archanans into the capsule
technicians in clean suits assist
jay works like a secret service agent scanning for all possible threats
jay checks his stop watch four minutes to go
kay workswith the archanans we good yet kay
i dont like being out here in the open too many ways for yaz to get to you
im almost there
kays got them inside but having problems with the hatch
hey tech guys get back here and help me with the door
its called a hatch
whatever just get over here
oh come on whats going on
this door is complicated
its an apollo rocket not a plymouth valiant ok
jay goes over to help kay with the door
they both fuss and fight over the door
you have to lift it
no i am lifting it
you have to hold the lever
no if i hold the lever the rubber thingie wont
go in the thing where the thingie goes
kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass
why do you think a highly trained nasa technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped
they exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the chinese restaurant
because its about to go down
they turn around draw weapons on the tech its yaz
welcome to the good stuff from here we launch into a giant set piece that will take us up and around the apollo rocket
as jay and kay battle yaz and devil girl in a super high stakes confrontation to protect the archanans
we will pay off that yaz isavirus bentondestroyingthe earth to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers smallpoxand bubonic plague
the launch clock ticks down the action moves around pipes breathing fire the gigantic scaffolding liquid oxygen spewing from the rocket
all on top of a rocket taller than a story skyscraper
with t minus seconds to go jay and kay corner yaz against the lunar capsule
yaz laughs at jay and kay
you cant stop me
nothing on earth can stop me
yaz raises an eyebrow
jay draws his noisy cricket the gun he brought from the future
little something i brought with me
jay points the gun at yaz but yaz just laughs as the clock ticks down to t minus
you wouldnt dare
one false shot and youll rip space and time
thats a chance ill have to take
jay blasts yaz yaz stumbles back into the capsule
the hatch slams him in
just as the rocket begins liftoff uh oh but the archanans surround them with their aura where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them
and then its over
as they watch the rocket carry yaz off
we did it partner
i hope you remember this when you recruit me you wont give me such a hard time
you know i will
i guess well have to build a prison on the moon or something
jay realizes grabs kay do a better job this time ok
that needs to be one hell of a prison
you dont want that guy coming back or im coming back
look once was enough ok
jay turns to the colonel thank you for your help sir
hope we dont get you fired
not too worried about that
can i ask you what did the lama show you in there that made you help us
was it the earth being destroyed
no it was my son
all grown up
as a matter of fact im late to see him i promised id watch the launch with him
hes a lucky kid
im a lucky dad
jay offers him a handshake
the officer takes it and pulls jay into a hug
the colonel leaves
jay and kay congratulate each other smile over a job well done
but then they see the archanans
were sorry we didnt get you home guys
it was the only way to get rid of yaz
but well make sure youre safe here
and the next rocket out
all is well
you have done well
no we didnt
you wanted to go home
there is what we desire and what must be
and now our gift to you
but we didnt get you home
there is the action and there is the intention
it is the intention we reward
you did the right thing
and if humans are capable of such sacrifice such friendship
perhaps we are already home
so then whats the gift
you already have it
jay looks at pong
the pan galactic ordnance negation grid
agent kay will use this technology
to make the missile defense system
you use this to save the world
dont drop it
they take the pong and drape it around kays neck the archanans leave chanting
and its just jay and kay
jay looks at kay wearing the pong
just like in the case file picture
my watch stopped
we see a minute to go
jay looks at the watch
something about it bothers him
lets go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere
yeah ill catch up with you in a second
jay hangs back approaches the archanans walks them down the scaffolding
so you guys understand all this time stuff right
so is everything going to be okay now
i mean if i saved everything and yaz is really gone why am i even here
shouldnt i not have come in the first place
and why do i still have time left on my watch
the scaffolding leads jay and the archanans into the maze of underground hallways
jay walks looking at his watch thinking
he sees a wall clock
but kay didnt get killed until
and then the awful realization he didnt come yet
kay he didnt come yet
jay races to find kay
unaware that his appointment with death is near
racing down a hallway
where is kay
all converging on destiny
more frantic now
and then he sees him
kay at the end of the hallway
backlit by the door to the outside
and then jay sees yazl already there
jay goes for his weapon but he doesnt have the shot
yaz pulls his guns
kay turns to see yaz theres no time to react only to know hes about to die
but the colonel is somehow there instead
he catches the bullet for kay his body dematerializes
and it gives jay the split second he needs to fire on yaz and kill him blowing him outside where he is incinerated by liquid oxygen leftover from the launch
they look at each other its over
i knew you had my back
jay hears footsteps
looks up and sees the shadow of a tall as the footsteps approach the shadow grows smaller shrinking to kid size
its a boy
whats going on
the kid steps into the light backlit but from the shape of his head and jays reaction this kid could only be young where there is death there will always
he saved your life
he swapped his for yours
he saved the world
kay puts a firm hand on jay ill take it from here
kay steps away
but turns back
in a replay of the moment from the first movie jay tosses kay a modern neuralizer
leave me some memories this time sure partner
ill see you around
yes you will
kay turns back to the boy takes his hand
jay watches them from a distance kay takes something off the ground where the colonels body was hands it to the son
hey look your dad wanted you to have this
kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative apollo key chain
jay looks in his pocket the same key chain scratched and worn
where is he
your daddy had to go hes part of the space program now
hes okay he just had to take a trip up to the stars but youll be just fine
ill keep an eye on you
they are silhouetted by the bright light of the apollo launch
jay takes out his iphone and all goes white
and it resolves into
jay comes to in the apple store looks to the sky and noo
a giant pong paddle rises over the horizon and
jay is walking on air thrilled to see the deadpan security guard
its good to see you man
he gives him a hug gets a what the hell
jay is thrilled to be back hugging everyone he can
no one else knows what hes talking about from their pov he never left
it all seems the same except for quick shots of ex the bitter janitor aged devil girl pushing the coffee cart
jay bounces through the mib hq its just a regular day to everyone else but its home sweet home to jay
he even gives the worm guys a big gushy hug
a crowd of people gathers around kay congratulating him on winning the bowling trophy
kay looks up smiles big when he sees jay
alright everyone give me and my partner here a minute
they leave the guys alone
a beat and jay just wraps him in the biggest hug ever
its good to see you man
do you remember
i mean do you know what ive been through
kay just stares at him
you mean do i remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world
not bad slick
youd do the same for me
i just have one question
when you disappeared
why didnt i forget you when everyone else did
well i dont know exactly
because i was dead
but in a quantum reality objects can exist in contradictory states
so multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist and the one youre closest to oh youre talking about our closeness
youre talking about our love
youre saying our love will go on
kay swats him away but the love couldnt be more clear
jay feels something in his pocket the keychain
takes it out
he was a good man
yes he was
im glad i know that
so you travelled back in time huh
and you didnt change anything
because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions
i was very careful
good man good man
well lets get you a uniform
we pull back revealing present day mib in all its kickass grandeur
eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the earth and all its inhabitants
and every one of those agents wearing blue suits with shorts
even i cant make that look good
