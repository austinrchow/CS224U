b if window
href b b gone in seconds scott rosenberg by scott rosenberg i wonder toad said to himself presently i wonder if this sort of car starts easily
next moment hardly knowing how it came about he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it
as the familiar sound broke forth the old passion seized on toad and completely mastered him body and soul
he increased his pace and as the car devoured the street he was only conscious that he was toad once more toad at his best and highest
and he sped he knew not whither fulfilling his instincts living his hour reckless of what might come to him
kenneth grahame the wind in the willows all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
bruce springsteen thunder road the streets are empty
low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky
its slightly fuzzy slightly surreal
the vast port of los angeles is visible in the b
no cars parked here
no cars except silver with deep grill its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops
all cock and balls it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn
an old school totem to speed and style
and then someone approaches
through the mists of morning
in leather coat and jack boots
hes early s with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade
this is randall raines whom they call memphis though know ones quite sure why
but they do know hes the auto boost in southern california
memphis approaches the mustang with a gathering awe
like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis
he walks around it
but then a firebird pulls up alongside him
its driver atley jackson early s handsome jocular leans out for you gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray
memphis looks at him still enthralled
atley jackson contd i know i know
just take her slick
and atley drives off slowly memphis looks this way and that
no one about
he removes a slim jim from a deep pocket in his coat
he slims the door panel
pops the button
opens the door
watch him work
quick as shit
a screwdriver appears another pocket
he pops the butterfly to the ignition a ratchet appears
he strips the mechanism
now a gizmo a small socket like device is pressed into the ignition
a twist of the wrist
and the bhp v rumbles like a jackhammer
the whole thing took seconds
he takes a cassette tape from another pocket
slaps it into the deck
bruce springsteens ramrod wails from the coaxials
and memphis floors it
and off they tear
the look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction
a grand re awakening of long dormant pleasure centers
a speed jones fixed and fumy
he slots in behind atley jacksons firebird
and slotting in behind memphis in a z is donny astricky mid s
on they go
the fore and aft car providing escort
except that from seemingly out of nowhere appears behind them
and donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic
he races through a stop sign
and the cruisers bubbles flash on
and donny is pulled over
atley and memphis drive on in their respective vehicles
the uniform cop gets out of his car goes to donny
youre under arrest
for running a stop sign
for grand theft auto and off of donnys look we go to memphis in the shelby
as four cruisers comes speeding toward him sirens wailing
quick shots of memphis racing the shelby through the early morning harbor town streets
memphis turns up the music pins the gas
the chase is on
memphis maneuvers the mustang with a dazzling aplomb
memphis gutterballing the car skating the shoulder the cops in heavy pursuit
and now hes picked up another cruiser
he passes atley jackson heading in the opposite direction
atley has picked up a pair of cruisers himself
memphis on a straightaway now speeds up feels the boost
but up ahead a roadblock has formed
howd they get that deployed so fast
and behind him the unmarks blaze
guns his bitch
straight at the roadblock
three cruisers and a portable wooden barricade
memphis pins her
dead on to the roadblock
and at the last moment as the cops dive out of the way memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral yanks the parking brake and the mustang spins on the
straight screeching spin
and memphis takes the hard left
and hes managed to outrun them
finding himself above lower grand
he can see the secondary pursuit down below
atley being chased
in the distance atley is launched from the shoulder the firebird rolling down a drainage culvert
landing with a sickening thud on its back
memphis is horrified
rescue team presence
atley being hauled out of the wreck
his leg is a torn mess
hes barely conscious
a cuffed donny astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser
a police car pulls up
and out steps of g
the governors regional auto theft bureau
castlebeck is mid s black saturnine
but dont let the tacit nobility fool you the mans a street viper
castlebeck goes to another cop hawkings
no sign of raines
well then its all for naught aint it hawkings
castlebeck looks out over the mess
and then looks up
because further down lower grand a car is parked
it is the shelby
with memphis leaning against its hood
castlebeck looks around him but no ones noticed
so he walks toward it hand on hip
i know you you know my back you want to come along quiet
legs all banged up
he made a stupid play
hell limp around the yard up at folsom
but astricky will be there to take care of him
with their priors theyre looking at a serious bounce let them go hows that
let them go
and ill leave
you dont have anything on me
a misdee auto theft
i got no record
ill be out in three days and back at it
or you let them go and i give you my word
and without the ringleader
your tee times have just grown exponentially
i dont golf
and they stare at each other as castlebeck considers
detective castlebeck contd i do this
and i see you again
ill come after you with everything i got
you wont be able to steal a glance at a blind man without me by your side
you have my word
get out of here then
and memphis makes to get into the shelby
leave the car randall
takes one last look at the shelby
sorry to leave it behind
and he runs off into the mists of lower grand
castlebeck walks back toward the crime scene tumult
arright let lim go
cite him for rolling the stop
and cite old atley for driving to endanger
what are you talking about rollie
were springing em
just like that
just like that
quit your bellyaching hawkings
and lets wrap this up
and off of donnys surprised look as springsteen wails to crescendo and we some miles north of los angeles independence is a one horse town and the horse has died
single stop light single engine firehouse single everything
norman rockwell would find this burg a snooze
we settle on a small garage
the peeling sign reads owned and operated by memphis raines
in blue coveralls memphis has a plymouth duster up on the lift
with him is a kid tom
lightnin hopkins automobile blues plays through you know what you got here
not really theres excessive resistance in the cranking circuit
you know what you gotta do
not really you have any other answers besides not really
you want to test the voltage drop
use the voltmeter
remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her
see what you got
tom starts to say not really
instead he nods
memphis takes a root beer from an old style machine
he goes out
to where an old denver pyle coot budgy sits on a bench smoking an unfiltered lucky
memphis sits beside him pets the year old dog that lounges nearby
just cant find good help these days re cigarette those thingsll kill ya budgy they wont have a chance
the bourbon and baconll get me first
memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet
budgy points at a passing car
budgy contd that one mercury cougar
cubic inch v
based on the ford thunderbird bodyshell they modified the chassis but didnt improve its performance
budgy points at another car
and we get the sense they play this game every day
memphis contd the plymouth road runner
proof positive of a single all powerful deity
the first bargain priced muscle car ever
they even tuned the horn to resemble the beep beep sound of the cartoon road runner
and budgy looks impressed
damn youre good memphis nods
sips his root beer
budgy contd you got to bingo last night
memphis looks at him
cant believe it himself
that i did budgy
that i did and from inside the garage theres the most horrific grind of metal on metal as tom has started the plymouth uh
excuse me memphis goes back into the garage budgy cackles
a ford escort driving through the upscale streets of palos verdes
three kids inside
the driver is freb a little dim in the back is mirror man black always wears those mirrored shades
in the passenger seat is kip memphis younger brother
the car pulls to a stop
fancy stores all of them closed line this affluent business district
freb consults a piece of paper
the corner of hawthorne and granvia
tumbler messed up
he said the lotus would be at the corner of hawthorne and granvia he didnt mess up
there it is
and he points
to a corner building exotic motors ltd
twenty foot high glass windows surround a showroom of exotic dream cars porsches and ferraris lamborghinis and bertones
and there it is a lotus esprit v gleaming in the all night showroom lights
freb and mirror man are startled that
youre shittin right
he grins at them
he aint shittin
how are we supposed to pop the trunk
i need my tool
pops the trunk
kip gets out
goes to the back
freb and mirror man share a spook what tool
kip reaches into the trunk
comes around to them
hes carrying a brick mirror man contd oh no and kip walks toward exotic motors
calm and cool
ten feet from it
he winds up
and hurls the brick at the window which explodes on impact a shower of glass raining down
as kip walks into the showroom glass crunching underfoot
freb and mirror man cant believe it kip goes to the lotus
with nary a glance around hes got her open
the lotus alarm adds its song to the choir
kip unmindful gets behind the wheel
screwdriver to the mechanism
the alarm raging in here
in moments the v s massive bhp is bellowing
and mirror man climbs in beside him
and off they go
laying several inches of english rubber
over the broken glass and out of the showroom
the lotus races through these streets
at high speeds
newsflash kip youre driving a stolen car kip smiles over the ascending speedometer yeah
aint it great
and he pins her
being bounced against the wall
a dozen purloined autos are parked here
and a number of shipping containers
a thuggish man reads the paper
the tennis ball bouncer is tumbler
and hes sitting on a tilted back chair and wall bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of whom we remember from the drop car at our opening
atley walks with a limp now
can you stop that for chrissake
whats your problem bro
where are they
theyll be here
you nervous bro
back in the day they say you had anti freeze in them veins
and atley intercepts the tennis ball
and hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse
tumbler merely grins
tumbler contd relax and enjoy heading for long beach
stopped at a light
a camaro pulls up next to them
a kid behind the wheel a blonde beside him
kip eyeballs them
engines are revved
challenges are implied
mirror man panics
stolen car kip
stolen car stolen car stolen car
stolen fast car
and the light turns green
and he pops the clutch
and they are off
its a good old fashioned drag race
kip smiles at the blonde
mirror man is freaking out
kips eyes are on fire
he clocks the speedometer
kip contd its calibrated for
lets see if these british boys are full of shit or not no way man yes way
kip floors it
they bury the camaro in its wake
the gauge rising
mirror man is having an embolism
they warp speed by a police cruiser
both kids totally unaware of the police chopper up on high
with them in its sights
and they drive
at last ending up at the waterfront a dark latticework of docks and wharves warehouses and shipping crates
the freighters are somehow graceful against the moonlit water
tumbler studies his watch
now hes a little concerned
he looks up
atley is glaring at him
something wrong tumbler
im missing springer and then the lotus pulls into the warehouse
tumbler flashes atley a told you so smile
kip and mirror man get out of the car
kip walks over to a clipboard with a magic marker tethered to it it is a list of cars
he draws a black line through lotus esprit v
the others are clocking the car
shell go to in
seconds i can vouch for that
tumbler passes out oz
the vibe is celebratory
thirty seven to go
no problem bottles are clinked
beer is sipped
only a hot white spotlight bores through the skylight
and the whup whup of the choppers rotors
and now the sounds of sirens
and the thuggish man gets to his feet
lets get outta here
and they do
heading out the back
its tough for atley with his limp
on the way out now you gone and done it raines and they flee
a half dozen police cars
the chopper does the usual spotlight trailing
its turned into a total pig circus
a car pulls to a stop
and out steps detective roland castlebeck whom we remember from our opening
castlebeck surmises the take
his partner detective drycoff a sneering irish boy with zero patience comes out from the back
looks at the cars
memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office
when a brand new purple mercedes slk windows tinted pulls in out front
it looks oddly anachronistic here in independence
memphis senses danger
he goes out
budgy and his dog are here
budgy looks spooked
whats going on
and standing there by the mercedes like a wraith is atley jackson in long leather coat smoking a cigarette
as out of place here as a maggot on a muffin
well well well
and he begins to sing
atley jackson contd andy griffith theme da doo doo doo da doo doo doo etc
laughs are you kidding me man
atley jackson re sign l
i get it
memphis studies him
hows the leg
only hurts when i breathe
where are barney fife and aunt bea hanging out
wheres opie at
he laughs some more
chain lights his cig
what are you doing here
is there someplace we can talk
memphis looks at him
about your brother
and the deeeep shit hes in a barmaid sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs
there you go thanks donna she leaves
atley is staring at him
its been a long time memphis six years
time flies dont it
six years ago we were fartin through armani and pissin cristal
now look at us
tell me about kip atley takes a sip of his beer
he took a job
and he fumbled it
now hes jammed up
jammed up bad
what kind of job
a big boost
whats kip doing on a boost
looks at him
youre shittin right
clearly memphis is not
atley jackson contd kips become quite the little crewrunner since you left
hes been working a low rent ring for two years now
you dont talk to your ma
it seems she neglected to mention it maybe she dont know
although i dont see how that could be
maybe she didnt want to upset you dont feel the need to explore my family dynamics atley
the point is kips been living the life
only hes a wild child
makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time
but he fungold this one so bad folks around l
are already speakin about him in the past tense
memphis takes a beat
sips at his brew
then who was the job for
who do you think
in no mood for guessing games
atley jackson contd calitri man
raymond the carpenter calitri
your favorite and mine
which means nothing to us
though the look on memphis face speaks volumes
atley jackson contd i just thought you should know man
i kind of had a feeling you didnt
but i should tell you im working for him now the carpenter so if you see him you wont mention me coming to get you
like i said i just thought i owed you
and that it was the right thing to do
his face clenched in despair
we fade to black as a super on screen reads part stolen moments we pre lap j
geils bands hard drivin man and cut to placed on the service deck by a short order cook
a hour diner in the heart of long beach
the three plates are picked up with an impressive dexterity by early s clear eyed
in pink rubys uniform and chunky shoes
black currant hair striated with wisps of gray
helen delivers the plates to a booth of college kids
can i get some more coffee
and she goes to the coffee station
when whos a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint
and she turns around to see memphis standing there
her expression displays many things
most of them joy
memphis contd hello ma and she goes to memphis
wraps her arms around him
helen raines contd oh randall
she takes his head in her hands
kisses his cheek
then the other
unmindful of the customers
the cook smiles from behind the order wheel
whats the word memphis
how ya doing ruby
come come come
and she leads him over to a booth
barking to the cook ruby on the way
helen raines contd tuna melt on pumpernickel
provolone extra tomato dijon
and a chocolate milk
lots of syrup
to memphis right
and they settle in
across the booth from each other
she takes his hands
you look good

what are you doing back
and helen flushes a bit ashamed maybe
have you seen him
atley jackson came to see me
how is that one
hows the leg
he looks at her

i didnt want you to worry
i thought held sort himself out
i hardly see him

and i dont know what to do

hes on the phone in the kitchen
one eye on memphis and helen detective castlebeck
you aint never gonna guess who just come in to visit his ma helen raines contd you havent spoken to him in a while i guess
he doesnt return my calls
or my letters
kipling was sixteen when you left baby
i dont know what you remember of him
but you should brace yourself and on her sad smile we pre lap sammy hagars i cant drive and slam cut to a dozen tables
smells of blue chalk and whiskey
the juke box cranked
we take it to the back of the joint
where kip and tumbler and mirror man are knocking a rack
freb sits nearby with a few badly made up girls
its my new move
its called the stranger
what i do is i sit on my hand for minutes
till it falls asleep
till its good and numb
and then i jerk off
thats disgusting whats the point man
cos its like youre bein done by a stranger it rocks
its the power move of the new millennium
he sinks another ball
a kid toby comes up to them

kip contd look we managed to get in a week

kip looks at him
off of frebs look of fright dont sweat it freb
angle the front door
for memphis has entered
he clocks the room
sees them at the rear
walks back it can be done man
we just gotta step it up
its a challenge
the challenge is not to get our nuts cut off and shoved down our throats
can i help you pal
and kip looks up
to see memphis there
hello memphis memphis

memphis continues to stare at kip its good to see ya man

the others are excited

memphis eyeballs him

whos got next game
and he makes to rack em up
then i get it
you aint gotta be a genius memphis come back to save our bacon
shut up mirror man izzat true

long and hard
give lim back the money
give im back the money
if only we didnt drink the money
and smoke the money
and buy nikes with the money
and sony play stations with the money
and dirty girls with the money
and kip sinks a ball
memphis looks at the others
the moneys gone
but dont worry man
things are all sweetness and light here
things are all leafy and suburban
the hell they are sure they are
although we do appreciate the gesture memphis
but we do got it handled
and it was nice to see you memphis nods
looks at all of them
and then reaches out grabbing kip by the collar yanking him to his feet and in close nose to nose
you listen to me baby brother
you fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum well woop tee doo little puppy with a poundcake
but i remember the days when you used to steal my colorforms and eat em
so you cant stop me from saving your dangling ass if thats what i feel like doing
and with that he shoves kip back down into his seat toppling the table bottles and glasses crashing
and barrels away from them the crowd parting like a wound
kips crew left stunned flustered and maybe a bit impressed
homeboys on the dazzle
and off of kips furious look we cut to a chill in the air
memphis walks toward a range of lowslung buildings
a virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses piled up high for as far as the eye can see
a huge fork lift scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the crusher
watch as the car is flattened for easy shelving
midnight auto nonpareil
to one side of the yard is a garage watch as a honda accord with a bloody windshield enters the garage
a young mexican kid driving
a car is chopped
fenders doors panels interiors air bags
memphis knocks on the door
a dog faced man opens it
randall raines to see mr
memphis follows dog face to the back of this building
follows him into another room
which is an enormous woodworking shop fully tricked out with state of the art table saws and drill presses jointers and power planes
an antique treadle lathe stands in one corner
a stock layout of expensive woods oak birch maple cherry mahogany is stacked against the rear wall
jars and bottles and cakes of glues resins stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit
theres a man here at a band saw
this is he wears an apron protective glasses and a lopsided sneer
a richard widmark motherfucker with the diamond hard look of a cobra
the liegelord of downtown
and now he works the a hand saw making critical cross cuts on a wide panel of maple
atley jackson is here as well
as noisy as it is out in the yard in here once the door is closed its as silent as a tomb
a bank of monitors on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard
memphis is led into the room
calitri nods and dog face leaves the room
examines his fresh cut
its been a long time
looks at his clothes frowns though i do i recall you as a man with style
you remember your old friend atley
how ya doing
good to see you memphis so
what do we owe the honor
its about my brother
he says the name like other men say cancer
the phone on his desk blinks
calitri picks it up
looks at one of the monitors
where the mexican man is talking to several calitri employees
calitri hangs up
excuse me one moment randall
and he picks up a mortise chisel on his way out
as raymond calitri marches toward him glancing at the bloodied windshield
you bring this to me in this condition
blood and guts all over it
you make me complicit
on my property
who taught you how to think
and worst of all werent there supposed to be two hondas
and calitri rapid fire punctures the mans belly and chest and legs with the chisel old school prison shiv style
until the man is on the floor howling
memphis can see this from one of the monitors
he looks at atley
neglected to clean up after himself
the business has changed
calitri is back wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag
where were we
i dont want him hurt
calitri looks at him then waves a hand around the shop
im proud of this work
the bird feeder
the wagon wheel planter
the drop leaf movable server
he gestures to each item exquisitely rendered woodwork
then gestures to the yard
calitri contd metal
wood is warm
provided by nature
to see a piece of furniture take shape
its like watching a child grow
memphis glances to atley
im sure youre working your way to the point
ill wait right here
i require the best
i insist on the best
i only engage the best
they came to me
they wanted my paper
he was your brother
you were the best
theyve brought so much goddamn heat down i may not be able to fill this order
which would be very bad for me
which in turn is very bad for them
i could kill you
that occurred to me
when i first heard about this
that i would kill you
you dont kill people like me
people like me die in their sleep at
do you know why
because if you did kill me and everyone knew it was you for the next ten years theyd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california
memphis nods notes a pistol resting on a shelf nearby
calitri contd no no
you dont kill me because you cant
you dont take your brother and run because wed find him
you dont go to the police because we have friends there too
you do nothing except deal with me
memphis eyes him
i can come up with the front money
pay you back
were it only that easy
i have obligations
the order needs to be filled
calitri takes a manila envelope from his desk
hands it to memphis who takes out the single sheet of paper inside
calitri contd on that list youll find fifty cars
they range in age from the ford thunderbird to the toyota camry and in expense from the volkswagen jetta to the lamborghini countach
memphis scans the list
looks up at calitri
calitri contd there is a container ship in long beach harbor
ready to be loaded with car per shipping containers false walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated
the ship leaves in four days for south america and the men whove tendered me this contract
they gave you only four days
they gave me two weeks
i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost but also alerted the heat as to our
endeavor making this even more difficult to achieve
memphis scans the list
calitri contd four days
im paying thousand dollars
now memphis looks up
im not interested i knew youd say that
im just here about my brother
i knew youd say that too calitri smiles
memphis looks at him
at atley realizing the trap
sound it out for me
your brother has four days
for that he gets large
and if he doesnt make it
calitri goes to one corner of the shop
takes a tarp off of a full couch mahogany casket
i made this too
my first one
brass extension handles not plated
the coverings are silk not rayon
and lined with spray green lorraine crepe
memphis waits knowing where this is going calitri contd yes yes
i made it for young kip
in case he fails
at friday morning if that ship sets off without my fifty
kip will take up permanent residence in this box
calitri wall switch and the a corrugated steel sliding door is raised revealing a loading dock facing the back of the yard
two men are working out there
digger and butz scuzzy dudes mid s and dressed in dirty coveralls
calitri contd come here for a second boys and they come over evenin mr
digger butz let me introduce you to randall raines
used to head up the dandiest ring in southern cal
left us for parts unknown
randall this is digger
and thats butz hi randall memphis says nothing
nods to digger an butz who go back to work
digger and butz will be in charge of burial
theyre good boys
memphis look is cold and furious
plaintive i dont want them hurt
any of em
dont want the dodgers to lose or the summer to end
but we dont get to choose these things
atley hits the wall switch and the steel door slides shut
calitri turns to memphis
calitri contd nothing thats forced can ever be right
old woodworking expression
i really dont care how the get onto my ship
i just care that they do
with that he puts his protective glasses back on and fires up an abrasive disc finishing machine adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the outside curve of an
a small new england style shingle and clapboard up on a hill overlooking the port
a small guest house behind it
helen clears away the dinner dishes
the tv is on
we see a crime scene
the car jacking which left ramona sullivan the year old mother of three dead occurred last night at
memphis glances to the tv
he looks out the window at the sedan parked below
memphis comes out
moves to the sedan parked across the street it is detectives castlebeck and drycoff
i know you
you know my back
they get out of the car
the view of san pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights
whend you get to town raines
the other day
no particular reason
catch a laker game
i heard we got shaquille
where you been anyway
just out there
building up my collection of refrigerator magnets
you seem a little hinked up
not at all
he and castlebeck lock eyes
castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket
sets to polishing it
i remember us having made some kind of deal randall
i dont remember this deal having some kind of time limit
i look at you here in my town and im confused
a little family emergency i hope its not your dear sweet mother
or your baby brother
what was his name
short for kipling
named for the english writer of stories about india
he bites into his pear
memphis says nothing waits
detective castlebeck contd i got a rash of thefts
a new crew is making noise
we recovered a big take last week
and this has what to do with me
i dont know
but you shouldnt be here
take care of your business
ill give you hours
and then i dont want to see your face
make a fool of me once thats my bad
make a fool of me twice
thats really my bad and ill kick your ass from here to india
castlebeck gives him a long look
as they walk back to the car
cos you know how it plays
six years ago i let you go free
but the next time
the next time sends you away fora long long while
by the time you get out asshole there wont even be cars
well all be cruisin around in space ships
and they drive off
memphis watching them go
once theyre gone
kip comes out of the club
you goin home
you want a ride
sure howd you get here
your moms give you ride
i boosted a vette
you boosted a vette
then where is it
it was right here
someone musta boosted it back
damn crooks is everywhere they smile
and go to kips trans am
toby contd memphis seemed weird huh
whats with them clothes
he a farmer now or something
and this seems funny to kip
except the only thing hes growing is old
and they are fronted by two goons
who toss them up against the wall
kip contd what do you want
one of the goons socks toby in the gut
toby doubles over
kip strains to intervene but his goon holds him back dont you do that
you leave him alone
shaddup raines hes got nothing to do with this and the goon punches him in the face
and kip goes down
get him in the car kip comes to
in his car
hot white lights blind him
the trans am is in the crusher
figures above him
hello kip kip tries to get out
the doors are pinned by the forklift
lemme out of this were it only that easy we can still do it calitri nods
and the crusher presses
the roof caves a bit kip is close to scrunch
no you cant
flies on sherbert is what you remind me of
because just being attracted to something doesnt mean you belong
atley is here watching calitri and kip
one of the monitors
but there is nothing he can do
kip continues to struggle free
listen calitri call me ray
better yet call me asshole
cos thats how youve treated me i get out of this im gonna fuck you up calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid
another crusher press
kip contd calitri
kip peers through the slit that the side window has become
only they are gone
and there is another awful noise
kip strains to discern its origin
only he cant get the angle
its a huge crane tipped with a gripping claw
it is maneuvered over the trans am
and lifts it into the air
kip terrified inside
and as the crane dangles the trans am toward the black waters of the harbor we cut to memphis is at the kitchen table
the list of cars before him
hes making notations
he gets to his feet
he goes to check on his mother
shes asleep in her room
he closes the door
and goes back to the kitchen
he goes to a framed photograph of he and kip
when there is an enormous thud
memphis goes to a window
sees a ramp truck unloading a gnarled blob of metal
memphis runs outside
just as the ramp truck drives off
memphis goes to the mangled trans am
and theres kip
seriously smooshed in the flattened car
you all right
i think so
theres things i cant feel right now
like my feet
you think you can get me outta this memphis
id appreciate it just hold on there memphis goes to the garage
finds a crowbar an acetylene torch tin snips
he goes back to the wrecked car
and sets to work
he looks at kip
shakes his head
memphis contd so you want to run that part by me again about things being all sweetness and light
this has nothing to do with any of that oh
you maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car crusher
all my enemies own car crushers
its like a pre requisite
take it easy
were almost there
memphis has freed him
kip crawls from the wreckage his clothes in tatters
blood seeps from a variety of contusions
memphis helps him to the guest house small cluttered
posters of kurt cobain a skying kobe bryant pamela anderson two nude girls draped over a glittering lamborghini espada etc
theres a fish tank
and a big screen tv on which the lakers are currently defending a high speed boston celtic fast break
memphis sits on a ratty couch before the tv
kip comes out of the bedroom
hes changed clothes
he wears clunky fur lined moon boots leopard skin speedos and a tshirt
he looks slightly ridiculous
throughout the scene memphis should be studying kip as if hes seeing him for the very first time
and waiting for the inevitable crack
you want a beer man
sure and kip limps toward the refrigerator
he comes back with two beers
hands one to memphis
glances at the tv you like kobes game
you think hes heir apparent to mj
he speaks fluent italian you know
so hes got that going for him and a cut on kips forehead starts to bleed
kip grabs a towel presses it to his head you sure youre okay
where is your beer
memphis holds it up
there are a pile of ignitions on the table
kip picks one up absently begins trying to strip it
so youre living up north
yeah i heard you were pumping gas something like that youre kind of cultivating a new look
they watch the game
kip replaces the soaked towel with another
memphis contd maybe you need a stitch nah
its a scratch
hey you want something to eat
what do you got
and kip hoists himself painfully to his feet
limps over to the fridge
memphis watches him a slight grin at kips attempt at cool
kip peers into the fridge
i got olives
you like olives
kalamata olives rule i think
ma likes the calabrese
its more mellow and he brings over a bowl of olives
theres certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive yeah yeah
thats what im thinking and they nibble on them
kip bites into one
and the juice stings his cracked lip
but he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod
and for a moment they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray
then so what are you gonna do
no worries man
ill call him
hes a reasonable dude
i can see that and memphis glances out the window
to the crushed car
kip catches the glance glances himself chooses to ignore it
memphis contd you have everything
he just wants to know im still on it
he needs reassurance
all these big swinging dicks do
i wont let him get into our kool aid
picks up another olive
remembers the pain of the last one
drops it back in the bowl
memphis is staring at him disgusted
kip feels it
kip contd what
what happened to you
and now memphis gets to his feet
paces the place
you just got crushed in a car
youre bleeding all over your self
and you sit there eating olives and talking basketball as if at this very moment people werent plotting your demise
chuckles overreaction over you know i can maybe understand since i been gone you taking up this dumb ass life of crime and for that i can partly blame myself
but what is baffling to me is how since i been gone youve become a complete and total moron hey now hes gonna kill you
i can handle it you can handle it
i can handle it you can handle it
i can handle it you
hold the look
kip shifts in his chair
even this hurts
he tries to hide the wince
memphis goes to the window looks out at the harbor below
then kip contd why
you think you can help me
and he turns back to kip
kip contd what can you do
you havent done anything in six years but pump gas and go overall shopping
and the cars theyve changed
theres new shit
computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and i dont think an old guy could much bypass em
you dont think so huh
but you know
maybe im wrong
and the brothers look at each other
in the pale glow of the tv
for a long beat
and then well cut to a rack of eel and octopus hung out to dry in the salty sun
memphis walks with atley jackson past the bustling commercial fishing hubbub portuguese fishermen unloading albacore and bluefin from their ships hold greek fishermen emptying mackerel and halibut from their nylon
trawl nets their women gut clean and fillet
as they walk atley is selecting fish from the various mariners who wrap it up for him
he places it in a leather satchel everyone seems to know him
nicolo hows the yellowtail today
an old fisherman who speaks broken english wraps up several steaks
very nice atley
you cant get it any fresher than this memphis
from the sea to my skillet
nothing in between
whats with the fish thing
we can learn something from our asian friends
they smoke a thousand cigarettes a day theyre completely stressed and overworked they drink like well
and they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world
you know why
all they eat is seafood
also never underestimate the restorative powers of karaoke
i do a poaching number
six ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine
in minutes i could cater a goddamn wedding
plain but flavorful
and its a good way to show off my hollandaise sauce
you have a hollandaise sauce
laughs christ what happened to us
speak for yourself boss i dont have a hollandaise sauce no but you dress like an asshole
i think about that night a lot
every time i walk
how they were just there
waiting on us
the fix was definitely in
nothing from atley
memphis looks at him
memphis contd yeah you know i just
i just never really thanked you
i meant to
i just want you to know
atley shrugs and selects some halibut filets
memphis contd tell him its on
atley looks at him
yeah tell him to lay off kip and them tell him its on atley nods
any idea how youre gonna go at it
memphis looks at him
shakes his head
fade to black
as a super on screen reads part ii back to wrong the hustle and bustle of a full service auto restoration operation
dig the chevy as an orange diamond tuck and roll with orange fur interior is installed
dig the corvette as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils and airshocks
dig the merc as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed
all under the watchful eye of
a feisty grease soaked curmudgeon who begs the question how the hell did they manage to rock together yoda and the ghost of walter huston
but he remains the zen master of cars and all that cars are were and can be
his mixed breed mutt hemi licks his balls in one corner otto is currently airbrushing a candy colored variegated design on the deck lid of a camaro
it is painstaking work
but he is an artist
his woman junie a tall blonde early s body of a thousand dances wipes his brow like a scrub nurse
memphis wanders in
otto sees memphis
drops his brush
he walks over to memphis takes him in his arms
hugs him close
actually waltzes him a few steps
memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through
am i dying
are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell
holds him at arms length and have my angels completely lost their fashion sense
you remember junie
hi junie hello memphis what happened here
whatever do you mean
the chop shop
where are the stripped cars
the rolled back odometers
the part bins
old age happened
i tired of killing them
i woke up one morning and thought i am no longer a destroyer
i am a means of resurrection
there are so few things in this life we can prevent from decay
most must die
these dont have to
he calls over to the mexican man working on the pick up
otto contd its coats of primer coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames
and fill the cab top with mylar flakes
theyll sparkle like stars
turns to memphis randall randall randall
you look splendid
you too otto and otto goes back to the camaro
to finish his work
i heard rumors you were back
hes gotten involved otto looks up frustrated
to junie i cant concentrate
play something my sweetness my reason to rise
and junie hits play on a cassette deck
and instantly engine sounds rip from the shops stereo speakers
otto listens as if it were a mahler symphony
otto contd the ferrari gtb daytona
at le mans
the quad cam v
hear how they got the engine up
hear those exhaust notes
thats a very wide rev range
here it peaks at rpm
these eccentricities are old hat
otto contd raymond calitri
hes amplified much sorrow on these streets
you think it can be done
are you considering a comeback tour
it can be done
take two days to shop one to prep
ill offer up my bible for a small fee
you also have to hope kips jerk circus didnt undo castlebecks linkage so much so that hes setting up surveillance teams on every city block
and then get yourself a crew
the hard part
a people is a detour of nature to get or great men yes and then to get around them
nietzsche said that
is he still working here
the old crew
go find them
i cant help you with that
since ive cleaned up the act a bit they no longer come around
a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular i just dont know how happy theyll be to see me otto has finished the camaro
he looks at memphis i remember i had a buick opal
worst car ever built
everything broke and i fixed it
a coma car built to german specs
plastic gas line
on a quiet night you could hear it rusting in the garage
but when that car was gone i missed it
if it came driving back in here right now thered be tears and laughter
and the moral of that story is
go to them
theyll be happy to see you
and he closes his eyes
to listen to the ferrari tape
we pre lap simon and garfunkels baby driver and cut to atop a moving dodge aries k
which is nearly side swiped by an oncoming pick up
a man howls in terror
a timid chinese girl jenny negotiates the vehicle at
riding shotgun her howling instructor is donny astricky whom we remember from six years ago
now hes paunchy with ernie borgnine tough guy warmth
at one time he kicked out the jams
now he teaches drivers ed
pull her the hell over
jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch
donny astricky contd put it in park
remember how to do that
its the big pff
she parks it
he stabs at the side view mirror
donny astricky contd objects may appear closer than they seem
can you say that for me
you aint sorry
youre a horrible driver
you cant strap into your seat belt without almost getting creamed by a bus
she starts to cry
donny astricky contd aw cmon
its no big deal
you cant drive
time to acknowledge it and move on
i cant swim
i know i cant
so you know what i do
i stay the fuck outta the pool
memphis waits outside
the aries k comes crawling toward him
donny gets out of the car
how you doing man
all i get are the orientals
they can build em but they cant drive em so
what are you doing here
whats with the outfit
you know where the others are
looks close at memphis
then most of em are gone
the dyar boys are doing a nickel at chino henry santoro and frankie fish are moving weight in florida bill doolin was killed in denver
atley jacksons on the gimp and runnin errands for calitri the sphinx is still around i guess
then of course theres
his pause is meaningful
figure it forgotten
whats this about anyways
in a wood panelled back room around a conference table memphis and donny sit
with the list before them
most of em are late model
well have to start beating the bushes find out where they live
some crew you got
if we put out the word
that were crewing up for a one time only job
what do you think thatll yield
a bunch of strung out hypes and stick up men
this aint like the old days memphis
the profession has lost its
well the three of us dontexactly inspire confidence
donny examines the list
they got eleanor here
the door opens
one of ottos workers is there
otto theres someone here to but they walk past kip tumbler mirror man toby freb lookit kip
all grown up
hey donny what are you doing here
otto called memphis looks to otto
you need him
no we dont i appreciate your dilemma memphis
but how are two washed up thieves and an old man supposed to boost cars in three days
his criminal career has officially come to a close
the conundrum still applies of course
the purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and or a life of crime
this cannot be successfully carried out without baby brothers considerable resources shabby though they may be
he has little choice
we do this
youre clean i like how you wallop back in here after four years and can still get all clifford huxtable on my shit
you hear me
i hear ya
get me outta this
ill move to the country
open a fruit stand
memphis looks at him
shakes his head
you guys have any skills at all
mirror man here is our electronics expert
hes got some gadgets you old farts maybe never heard of tumbler can drive anything with wheels and some things without tobys a hacker can do things with a computer
that are pretty amazing
how old are you now toby
but my birthdays in seven months
memphis shakes his head
re freb what about him
freb can order pizzas like nobodys business freb starts to protest
people gotta eat
memphis looks at all of them
in order to succeed youre going to have to go old school
one night boost
put all your nuts in one basket
are you nuts
you got maybe a better plan
tumbler looks to kip
you spread it out
you move around
sos they cant touch you
sos they dont know
shadow games and shit shadow games
you spread it out by the nd night the heat are onto you
know somethings up
with a one night boost by the time all the cars are reported stolen your ships set sail
kip and the others nod
memphis contd go on otto were on a truncated time table
take a day to shop it a day to prep it
and were still going to need to expand the crew
theres no one left
weve got several italian cars on the list
always tricky always timeconsuming
so were gonna need a specialist
memphis looks at him
because thats what he was afraid of
to otto you know of one
hes knows of one all right
so well pre lap the beach boys and cut to a shot glass slammed down on a bar by a surly drunk
in a mariner saloon
drunken sailors and fisherman and navy types
sawdust on the floor
broken beer mirrors
a rough joint
one more girl the bartender comes over
she is a dark haired heavily tattooed girl with the faded blue world weariness of roy orbison song
her name is sara wayland
and she goes by sway
she collects the drunks empty glass
i think youve had enough billy
i havent even started girl
gimme another if you leave now billy you can get a head start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit
listen you little cooze and the drunk reaches out across the bar to grab a bottle and sway grabs his hand twists it
the drunk groans in agony
and sway still clutching his hand hops over the bar
and drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front
cries of attagirl sway
pepper the air
sway tosses him
the drunk hitting the pavement
come back when youve learned how to drink billy and she freezes
because standing there is memphis
she looks at him
shocked is a good place to start
see youre still stealing the sailors from the sea what are you doing here
and she heads back inside
and he follows her
they head toward the bar
re his clothes whats with the look
the hip cool sexy thing was getting old
you look like you lost your sheep
and she hops back behind the bar
you still wrenching at bacchiochis
im not getting rich in here
buy you a drink
i got a coffee
and a boyfriend
she waves to a year old cat drinking with his buddies
he waves back
sway contd mitch
so i was replaced by mitch
you were replaced by alex
who was replaced by kevin
who was replaced by vince
who was replaced by mitch
she smiles sourly at him
and to think all i accomplished these past six years was the lord of the rings trilogy
she stares at him
shakes her head
busies herself with her glassware
memphis contd you look great yeah well you always were a sucker for flawed existences
watching them talk
sway contd you should leave on account of mitch
on account of me
he studies her
then ive taken the spear for a lot of people sway
cant we improvise a little here
no can do
life goes on pointfive
you left me remember
i left town
i didnt leave you
a distinction worth noting
and here i am
but i got a feeling its not on account of any longing for my touch on your part kips in trouble and now she looks concerned what kind of trouble
kip took a job
fifty ladies in two weeks
only the two weeks have turned into four days
and not a single lady has been snared
and you got some italians
six or seven
im not doing it anymore
havent for a while
ive carved out something for myself
its pathetic but its mine
i understand and the cat mitch comes over with two empty pitchers another round sara sure mitch and she goes to the tap
leaving memphis and mitch
how you doing pal
they sit there
mitch contd shes hot right
id go so far as to say lovely
and mitch leans over to him conspiratorially
you should her face when shes having sex and memphis turns to him
whats it look like
and memphis reaches out and grabs mitchs nipple pinching
mitchs face curls
memphis contd is it a squinty grimacing contorted face
agonized and writhing and ugly
oh now i see it yes yes
and memphis releases him
and mitch goes down hard
and sway comes over
what the hell are you doing
if you change your mind
were at ottos
its ladies in hours
for the carpenter
k and kips life on the felt
so long now
and hes out of there before mitchs pals can get to him
who was that guy sara
she looks at the door
memphis kip donny mirror man and otto sit around the garage
going through the list
tumbler calls from the next room frebs here
open the gate
to otto we sent him out on a solo boost
see what he could do
freb pulls in an cadillac coupe de ville
how do i look in this one
like a goofy white boy in a cadillac
howd it go
keys were in it
well that defies the point dont it
you should ask him how he got the name freb
get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up freb pulls in
pops the trunk
the gate is closed
this is loaded with crap get a duffel
he pulls out a set of golf clubs
freb brings over a duffel
mirror man plucks something from the trunk
mirror man contd holy shit
its a plasticine bag full of a white powder
lemme see that he pierces the skin
donny astricky contd heroin
and they pull back the trunk tarp
and there are perhaps two dozen similar smack filled bags
theres gotta be a million bucks worth here were rich
goddamn were rich
whered you pick her up
in front of one of them poker parlors in chinatown
well take it back take it back
what do you mean take it back
are you crazy man
take it back freb hey now memphis
cmon man donny makes to grab the bag from mirror man
but mirror man holds on
they tug back and forth
the bag drops
splitting on the ground behind the car
mirror man contd now see what you but a bang
on the front gate gives them all pause
who is it
the whole damn things loaded
and the others scatter into the back office with their tools and devices and lists
leaving only memphis and otto
memphis picks up the broken bag
sticks it in the trunk
puts the golf clubs in on top of it
slams the trunk
only theres still a neat mountain of smack on the floor by the rear of the caddy
but theres no time
for the gate is opened
detective castlebeck ambles in
i know you
you know my back
what are you still doing here randall
stopped by to see otto
castlebeck looks at otto
castlebeck walks around the garage
taking it all in
castlebeck notes the caddy
angle the mound of heroin on the floor
whats wrong with it
castlebeck takes out a walkie
barks into it
run me down a tag hro
he clicks off
otto and memphis share one
a glance to the smack
castlebeck is a mere inches from it
no faith in our new found goodness detective
but sometimes we got to create some numbers
the task force is run by statistics you know
before they can respond the radio crackles
theres no want on the license at this time
castlebeck looks disappointed
castlebeck stares at the caddy still unconvinced
youre thinking okay theres no want
but they probably stripped its guts and crated em up right
something like that memphis opens the drivers side door
gestures castlebeck in castlebeck gets behind the wheel
let her rip
and castlebeck starts the car
all of the heroin on the flo is blown away by the exhaust
memphis winks to otto
castlebeck seems satisfied
ill catch you later randall
double meaning intended right
castlebeck stops at the gate
turns back to them
theres probably been five more cars stolen in the time ive been here
i dont think so detective
and castlebeck is gone
memphis and otto exhale big time
the others come out from the back
to find memphis and otto dumping the heroin into the sink running the tap
memphis contd take her back to where you found her freb kip is in front of the tv playing a video game
helen raines is at the kitchen table going through a photo album
memphis comes home
hangs up his coat
hey he kisses her head
memphis contd kip kip nods
memphis contd what do you got there
the photo album
i get nostalgic around this time of year
what time of year
sits down next to her
they go through the photos childhood shots of memphis and kip a younger helen memphis at in his ikes garage coveralls year old memphis an infant kip and their father
robert raines a man with bright eyes and a quiet smile standing before an old cutlass robert raines
outside a car dealership
we can almost feel his strong sure presence
memphis looks at his mother
as she looks at the picture
you ever wonder what thingsd be like if he hadnt died
i wonder about that every day
kip and id probably be working at the dealership
to kip imagine us selling cars
nothing from kip
eyes glued to the tv
memphis glances to his mother
memphis contd imagine that
salesman voice and just in case you lose your keys good sir i can toss in a complimentary slim jim free of charge
look at the album
at robert raines
memphis contd i remember every day hed come home in a different car
that was the greatest thing
and wed climb all over it
examine every inch of every different car
supper getting cold cos you two are out there heads under hoods
you remember that kip
i was six
memphis and helen look at him
then after he died
i think thats what i missed most of all
that there was no different cars every night
when i started hanging around ottos
and he started showing me the things
it was a way to kill two birds
put food on the table for you and kip
ride in different cars every night
just like when dad was here
tears stand in helens eyes
kip gets to his feet
ancient historys two things
and he walks out of the house door slamming behind him
memphis turns to his mother
memphis contd were gonna have to do this thing ma
we do it
hell get clear once and for all and she nods
angle a photo
smiling beside an olds
the garage door opens as a resident drives out
and memphis and donny and kip and toby enter the garage
they walk along the rows of parked cars
car jacking is the lazy mans boost
can only take the car if the key is in it
thats not thieving
with the decency of dirt
theyre just cars man
to prevent donny from biting the kids head off memphis chimes in with this eleanors been living at the international towers for years now
the mustang shelby mustang gt
why do you call it eleanor
all the vehicles get code names
you say eleanor lives at such and such
and no one listening on the waves is the wiser
eleanor is memphis unicorn
and there she is indeed slotted nearby is a shelby mustang gt silver with black top
memphis contd hello eleanor and he looks at her
an old friend he hasnt seen in years
it looks just like a regular mustang dont go there toby shes not
carroll shelby tweaked the mustangs high performance engine and got it legally rated for the street at horsepower
but its actual output is closer to
so she flies she soars grade a unicorn
whats a unicorn
you know the horse with the horn
impossible to capture
toby looks blank
donny astricky contd we all got one
the single car that no matter how many times you try to boost something happens
cops show up car doesnt start owner comes back
you guys and the car thing man they head off
memphis turns back to the shelby see you in a few days eleanor to queens im in love with my car
the crew is at work a mazda and a caddy are parked here for practice tumbler is modifying a series of slim jims based on the type of cars theyll
be after donny and freb are in the caddy freb behind the wheel tumbler puts together briefcases containing the requisite tools slim jim gizmo screwdriver ratchet dent puller a mini battery with pointy leads
mirror man is showing off one of his gadgets beepersized device to otto
they stand before a locked mazda
and you just stick it in the lock
hit this little button
the door unlocks
the cars alarm gives a weak chirp and dies
otto looks at donny
were dinosaurs donny
pull up a tar pit
to mirror man can i try
knock yourself out kip and memphis are with toby who has his laptop out
i logged outside the g
then i monitored their incoming outside data requests right
then i got these isdn numbers right
then i tracked them back right
then i took the one i could jack up the easiest right
then i called back see they think im an insurance company thats where it looks like im coming from and theyre sharing stats with this insurance company right
so now theyre sharing it with me right

i can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half hour between friends and seinfeld
good work toby donny and freb are inside the caddy
frebs attempts to start it fail
it just aint happening youll get the hang of it kid
you just need to remember one thing whats that
on boost night
always take along a good mix tape
donny astricky contd you bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking the song you put on depends on the woman the type of lovemaking you intend to
you got a school teacher or nancy from accounting you dont put on sly stone or james brown
you put on ravel
but if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track you wouldnt put on cat stevens or james taylor
youd put on prince
or isaac hayes
or if you really wanted to get after it miles
its the same way with cars
you cant steal a maserati listening to sinatra
you gotta get urgent
you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv on that shit
but never never ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car
could lead to disaster
absolutely hasnt got it got it
and then sway enters
donny gets out of the caddy
donny astricky contd whoa whoa whoa
memphis went out and got some big game
i was just telling the lads about mix tapes to freb janis joplin
otto is before her
bowing from the waist
ive missed you sara wayland good to see ya otto they embrace
memphis and kip enter from the other room
how ya doing sway
she looks at memphis
what do you think about all this
stick it in the drawer marked fools errand right
thats my girl thats mirror man
and thats freb
fellas this is sara wayland
they call her sway
hey but the kids look high near thunderstruck
the others laugh
go back to their work
memphis and sway sway contd no questions
i need the dough
she studies him
just so we understand
and then she sees something at the entrance
sway contd oh shit
you didnt he follows her gaze
to where a man early s has walked in
tall gaunt ice eyed
this man never speaks
and his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue
which is why they call him and the others really dont dig his scene
well well well
the original crash test dummy
the sphinx nods to all
smiles warmly but it comes out creepy
freb whispers to otto
thats the sphinx
he never says a word
and hes got a messed up nose
hes boo koo koo koo
but he steals like time
to the sphinx hello sphinxy old rum
and otto embraces the taller man
and the others stand around offering uneasy glances to the sphinx
were all here
d day is friday night
that gives us two days to prep
were going to find the ladies on our list find out where they live when theyre home that theyre properly insured
lets get into the vans where we going
were going shopping
we pre lap gary numans new wave rave classic cars
a montage of the hard core old school preparations
three mini vans drive off from ottos auto mirror man at the wheel of one of them the sphinx and donny with him
freb drives the nd van memphis sway and kip with him
tumbler drives the rd van otto and toby with him
they carry pens and notebooks
and as they drive around theyre searching out cars
when they see an auto that corresponds to the list they take down its license plate
memphis dials the cell
mirror man answers on the speaker in his van
tumbler in his
well cross cut the scene as necessary from van to van
hows it going
they drive on
till donny astricky contd check it out firebird
know who drove one of those
yes i do in fact
john wayne in mco
thats being obscurest
as the scenes in the vans play out we should be intercutting with shots of cars on the street
as license s are written down
how you know that
remember who my brother is
sway has drawn an intricate chart on a vinyl drawing board each car is annotated ie ford t bird lamborghini countach etc
she begins ascribing names to them female names
with magic marker
easy to erase
donny enters with a sheaf of papers
he waits in line
mirror man has hired on as a valet
diners pull up in their cars
mirror man offers the driver of a porsche boxster a ticket
and climbs in to park the car
sway writes porsche boxster and next to it patricia as they drive around
still searching and quizzing

three words get a life
memphis and otto go through ottos bible an overstuffed ledger with the addresses otto has collected over the years of some cars
they look for any that correspond to calitris
donny offers the registry woman a list of several cars from the shopping spree
id like the names and addresses of the owners of these cars please

he smiles kindly at her
and takes a seat
its that easy
sway at the board
a grouping of three mercedes benz s are designated as jennifer jennifer jennifer
otto shows freb how to disarm an alarm system by groundingout a tail light with a wire to a mini battery
this dead shorts the lights shorts out the alarm system which chirps for a sustained second and then kills itself
the door locks pop open
mirror man in the boxster
he takes the key from the ignition
and then takes from under his jacket a key cutter
and he sets to cutting a copy of the key
shop and talk part iii

sway calls a corvette carol
a random chop shop
the sphinx is buying chopped ignitions that go with the cars on the list
has cut a key jocks the cutter and before he gets out of the boxster opens the glove box and grabs the registration
he takes a mini tape recorder from his pocket
reads the owner address into the dock
returns the registration to the glove box
leaves the car
tumbler and kip park the car carrier behind a matterhorn of decimated automobiles
out of view
the sphinx brings the ignitions to the locksmith
who makes keys for them
mirror man taking names and kicking ass
a bmw m roadster
sway writes nancy next to bmw m roadster
the registry woman gives donny the list he needed
its two dollars per car

the significance of robin on magnums license plate
robin was robin masters

i dont know that stumped
thank god sway you aint all freaky deaky too but sway grins how about a corvette in magician a ford pick up truck in incredizle hulk and
heres where it gets tricky
he walked in the courtship of kip high fives her
freb looks disappointed
walked like a bastard
skippin stones and shit
thats a good one donny
i think so too and they drive
all pleased with themselves
and after a beat
yall really need to get the fuck out of the house more
sway has finished the chart
their corresponding distaff names
freb is at his stereo
cds scattered around him
making a mix tape
a garage dealing exclusively in imports
sway slides out from beneath a testarosa
in her greasy coveralls hair tied back a motorheads dream girl
whats wrong with her
the right side of the engine is running richer than the left
and the scope isnt showing shit
and she goes to the sink
sway contd you know annies trouble annie
you havent been studying she gestures to where the list of is on the counter
sway contd roadster
lives at locklin in rancho palos verdes
one of a kind
i was looking forward to that boost myself she was the only annie you could find
they only made a handful
were lucky theres even one living in the area
she lives with district court judge seymour croft
as she speaks we cut to a massive house of glass and steel in a fancy neighborhood
we move for the house
over the fine trimmed lawn
and he keeps annie in his living room
like a work of art
massive framed lichtenstein and haring pieces on the wall surround the yellow roadster which sits up on a platform
check out judge croft a nasty fat man in his late s
he sits in the nearly empty room
a complex system of directional lighting illuminates the roadster shes got miles on her o dom
which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in when he bought her
he drove her home never drove her again
the judge gazes at the car admiring its jet pod taillamps
a maid comes in with a tray of tea service the maid crosses the judges line of sight
watch as he curses her out his face going beet red with fury
the mans a freak
sway looks at memphis
shes trouble i put the boys on it
theyre clever that way
i go with you that what you want
thats what i want
she hits the lava soap and starts washing the grease from her hands
memphis contd i missed you you know you mentioned that in your letters i always thought youd follow me up
she shuts off the taps
towels her hands
we were good when you bailed werent we
cos there were those dark days when i figured my god how easy it was for him to just give it up to make the deal take the rot for
the whole crew
and give me up in the process
and he holds out a hand to her
and she puts her greasesmeared towel into it
dont go getting all warm and fuzzy on me randall
im the jane that was left and youre the jim that did the leaving
so save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes
the only reason i ride with you is cause i dont want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps
memphis walks out
going over to the parked car across the street
im on the move your girl works in there
not my girl anymore yet your still here
i gave you hours hours ago
what do you want from me
i want to once every few months get into my car
pack a lunch
and drive on up to chino
on visiting day
bring you some magazines
maybe some almond clusters
and see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit
thats what i want
and with that he starts his car
memphis gazing after him
kip beside him
they drive in silence
at last coming to a huge trucking company warehouse
kip gets out
bolt cuts the chain fence out front
and memphis drives on in passing the long rows of gargantuan car carriers here
he picks one
he slim jims the door
but the alarm goes off
a wild whooping alarm
try as he might he cant get it off
he pops the trunk
looks for wires
then at once it goes off
kip is there
he holds a little device
memphis contd whats that thing
reads the infrared
then kills it
little something the r d department came up with
how long were you gonna let me try and stop it
after a while it became a little pathetic
figured id put you out of your misery
he gets behind the wheel
pops the ignition
the trucks flipping stack belches
memphis climbs in next to him
aint we good timing here
the family that steals together deals together
dadd be proud maybe not
but dad was from another era
what era was that
the era when crime didnt pay as opposed to now kid car crusher
price of doing business
what about just getting a job to five days a week that whole mystery achievement
its for assholes
the legal buck blows memphis
you know that
doing this we make mad bank my boys are down the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze
yeah sure youre gonna get jacked up every now and then but aint that a small price to pay for never never ever having to say paper or plastic
and he grins and puts the truck into gear
and off they go the replacements chime in with someone take the wheel
memphis and the crew
all but sway are present
tumbler and mirror man follow memphis to one side of the shop
to a window
he gestures outside to where we see and unmarked car and the orange glow of two cigarettes
staking them out
weve got to shake them tomorrow night
im making that your problem
thats called delegation of duties
you like it
mirror man and tumbler regard the cops
sure man and they follow him back into the garage
tomorrow night its on
each team has been assigned their ladies
the teams are me and sway
donny and freb
kip and tumbler
mirror man you and the sphinx
mirror man looks horrified
aw cmon man
the sphinx grins at him
what about me
youll be at the docks
keeping otto abreast of our progress
because you should be home with nintendo listening to the spice girls little man
kip talk to the guy theres no talkin to him and otto and junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some paper cups
cup raised to a safe and successful session of bumping fenders and trading paint
donny goes to the tape deck
and little deuce coupe by the beach boys blasts
little deuce coupe you dont know what i got
and all of our guys dance to it
otto dances with junie tumbler with toby even the sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto parts
well im not braggin babe so dont put me down but i got the fastest set of wheels in town etc
yes its the requisite rock to an oldie bit
but god its fun
as they exorcise some pre boost jitters
only kip stands aside from the frolic
we watch them dance and laugh and sing for a bit
and then atley jackson is there
and behind him another calitri goon
and finally calitri himself stands there
someone kills the music
they all look at him
donny and the sphinx nod to atley
this is how youre spending my time
having a sock hop
everyone know ray calitri
pillar of the community
look at this
a multi generational gathering of scumbags
so saith the god of scumbags hello otto
my boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered
and theres only one more night
getting nervous ray
what happens to you i wonder if delivery isnt made
calitri ignores him
looks at kip
with all the free time ive had not counting cars as theyre loaded onto my ship ive managed to sand the cedar inside your box kip
this will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria that normally thrives in an airless environment
thus prolonging decay
and kip actually makes a run for him
only to be held back by tumbler and donny
get out of here ray one more night get out i hope you know what youre doing
god help you if you dont
and with that he leaves his goons following
leaving our crew to stare after him
and then we fade to black
as a super on screen reads part iii switchin to glide as memphis goes through some old boxes
at last he finds what hes looking for
he takes out its contents
his tools which we remember from the opening
drycoff and hawkings wait in their unmarked
oh this is a good time he lights another cigarette
the ashtray is overflowing
how much can one man smoke
its a crime aint it
cos castlebecks got a bug up his ass over this guy i gotta get lung cancer
mirror man and tumbler are at the window memphis brought them to last night
mirror man has a radio transmitter in his hand
donny comes by
what are you doing
watch and learn old timer as mirror man points the antennae out the window
a toy car a hemi cuda replica
radio operated the car speeds along the curb outside using parked cars as cover
she really cooks
the hell are you doing
y k style
angle the cuda
as it cruises along
is stopped by a discarded oz
but mirror man maneuvers and its back on track
at last parking jammed up to the front right tire of drycoff and the hemi has landed big deal
what we call fun and shit
and he hits a button on his radio control
angle the model cuda
wedged in front of the tire
as a quartet of thin steel razor tipped spikes thrust out from the shaker hood
a fraction away from the tires skin
mirror man and tumbler appear satisfied
we can go now the one with the roadster in the living room
the phone rings
the answering machine picks up
yes this is a message for mr
seymour croft of locklin

toby contd goodbye to you too assface
they all wait anxious
dressed for their night
and then memphis enters
hoots and hollers
hes dressed in the old duds
long black leather duster
way too cool for school
memphis raines returns
i miss orville redenbacher already okay okay
the important thing to remember is to think slow
take your time
it may not seem like it but the night is long
just think slow and think smart
as the crew get into the van
and drive off
drycoff starts her up
lets see what these bastards are up to and he puts her in gear
and ka pow
the front tire explodes shredded to rim
drycoff contd what the fu he gets out of the car goes to the front
in time to see the little cuda race off down the street after the crew
drycoff contd those little pricks
angle mirror man
in the back of the van with his transmitter
giggling wildly as the cuda zooms after him
the massive seaport a series of wharves
commercial scows and tugs beast the black water
we should note the enormous ton foot container ship swaying in the harbor
and the giant shoreside gantry crane alongside it
an expansive warehouse surrounded by chain link fence
enormous shipping containers are here in which the stolen cars will be stored
and cartons and cartons of motor oil
a massive front end loader will transport each container to the gantry crane which will lower it onto the cells in the container ships hold
each team is ready
each has a briefcase containing the tools of the trade
memphis talks into a two way radio
how we doing o
otto stands before the big board with all the ladies names on it
on the two way
ready to start erasing
good luck kiddies memphis clicks off
they climb into ford escorts
all our ladies should be home now tucked in bed
lets keep chilly
you sure i cant go with ya
memphis ice water glance is answer enough
only use the phones when absolutely necessary
ottos default hq
lets go get em
of the four cars as each team slaps a tape in their deck kip and tumbler
the tape is tupac
they bang fists
donny astricky and freb
donnys playing miles davis
memphis and sway
mirror man and the sphinx
the sphinx puts on glasses with attached fake nose to cover his gnarled one
you should consider always wearing that boy
and he slides his tape into the deck
and as the gap bands burn rubber on me cranks on the track our team goes out
into the night
toby watching after them
because theyre off
tumbler and kip park the massive car carrier here
kip is behind him in the escort
tumbler gets into the escort and kip drives off
memphis and sway in the van
he pulls to a stop for a mazda rx is parked on this quiet residential
sway gets out
no whistles but a club you bring a hack
opens the back of the van
sway pulls the mazda window
ignition gizmos her
the motor now running
memphis gets in next to her
he has a steering wheel with him
what the hells that
a little trick i picked up at the car thief retirement home
he uses his screwdriver to remove four rivets on the mazdas clubbed steering column
in seconds the clubbed steering wheel is removed club still on it
memphis pops in the steering wheel he brought jerry bangs the rivets
memphis contd lets cruise and they do
sway rolls down her window
tosses something as they drive off angle the old steering wheel
club firmly affixed to it
on the ground in the mazdas old parking place
as they systematize the cars theyre responsible for
tumbler drops kip off by a porsche
we recognize it as one of the cars mirror man cut a key for in the valet scam
kip selects the key from a series of them hooked into his briefcase
he gets out
keys the car
tumbler meanwhile has driven to a volvo c
he too has the key
kip drives the porsche onto it tumbler enters the lot in the volvo
quick dissolves as they fill it up
two honda accords another volvo a toyota runner etc
all is silent
chainlink fence topped with swirls of lethal looking barbed wire
mirror man and the sphinx are here
mirror man goes to the main entry fence doors
he boltcuts the chain
the doors slide open
a porsche cabriolet is parked
donny and freb look at it
think you can get in without waking her up
thats an after market alarm
cant just cut her wires
he pops his briefcase
takes out some gear
moves for diane
helen raines is rooting through a crowded closet
at last she finds what shes looking for
a small black boxy device
she goes to the living room
plugs in the box
it is a police scanner
and it immediately starts to pop and caw helen sits down
her face clenched with worry
mirror man works the thick steel door
hes got a sledge and center punch
he knocks the knob off with the sledge and then goes to work with an electric drill
this is some state of the art shit kid
the drill breaks the sockets which force back the spindle and release the lock
only it doesnt seem to be working
and the sphinx is getting impatient
tumbler and kip pull in with their car carrier
they start to unload it
as otto swipes names from the board
memphis and sway
they ride in silence
she busies herself by looking through the consul
comes up with a tube of lipstick
uses the visor mirror to apply it
mascara blush floral print dresses
and she looks at him
shes really laid the lipstick on thick
but its oddly effective
bozo the very sexy clown beat
she looks out the window throws the following away
so you seeing anybody
i had a girl
she was great
the problem is great girls come along once every ten years
so i gotta wait another three years before i can even bother to look
she was so great whyd you leave her
her parole officer strongly recommended it
she looks at him
but hes stopped the car
for kip and tumbler are waiting at the side of the street
they get in
freb dead shorts the alarm system grounding it out on the cars own metal surface just like they taught him
hes in the porsche
its just that he cant figure out how to get her started
the passenger door opens
whats the matter
its all microchips and shit
he holds up a screwdriver
jams it in the steering column
donny astricky contd i dont care what kind of car it is
how fancy how expensive how new
you pop the collar its all over again
he pops the collar exposing an ordinary ignition system
sway kip tumbler with him
so we loaded all of the keyed cars up and dropped em
it was cake
cars ba da bing
memphis looks at him in the rear view
having fun kip
its a beautiful business
realizes his gaffe i mean no man its hard its scary it sucks
memphis looks at sway shakes his head
kills the lights
and they pull in to where mirror man is still struggling with the lock his drills and punches scattered about
just give me another only the sphinx shoves him aside
pulls the gun from his holster and blang
blasts open the lock
mirror man stares at the opened door
oh i get it old school
and memphis and the others drive up
hows it going
its going fine
the quiet riot and me are swapping trade secrets
and in they go dark as pitch
flashlights come on
to reveal old and new models
daytonas and boxers and dinos and testarossas
there must be at least fifty of them here
flashlight beams dance over car after car
its a treasure chest of automotive jewels
all of our heroes are in awe
and then a soft whimpering
to see sway overcome with emotion
and it is kip that puts an arm around her
she sobs into his chest
never taking her eyes from the array of italian grace indeed they are all in something of trance
memphis is the first one out cmon gang
sway can you prep em
i think so
but lets prep em
we could stay here all night
that wouldnt be good the others are still gazing
memphis contd lets go people and they set to work
donny astricky and freb have accessed a jag
watch as donny takes out screws in the jags ignition and removes the whole thing
tell me how come they call you freb anyways
were partners here freb considers
then reluctantly my names fred
you know frederick
one drunk night i decided to give myself a tattoo
hot needle it
i used a mirror to guide me
and he pulls up his sleeve to show the blue freb tattooed there
freb contd the mirror messed me up with the b and the d
everythings reversed you know
now im freb
donny chooses from a selection of ignitions hes brought along
finds the right one
tightens the screws
starts the car with his own key
glad to know you freberick
lets roll and off they go
sway sets to prepping the cars
the others wait nearby
memphis walks over to where kip sits
memphis looks at his watch
kip contd we gonna make it
too early to tell
but not you
whatever will be will be
thats a good attitude kip
for everything but stealing cars
before kip can respond the signature throaty roar of ferrari fills the room as sways got one started memphis contd showtime as sway gets the ferraris started her skill readily
and each man kip tumbler mirror man the sphinx climb behind the wheel and roar off
toby watches as the ferraris are driven in
he radios otto
as the four corresponding names are erased
glowing silver cool wedge shape degree angled windscreen the definition of sleek
memphis and sway in the van roll up to the maserati
except that a man comes out of the house
mid s silk shirt long leather prada coat
memphis contd shit
the man climbs into the maserati
lots of high end cars
mirror man and the sphinx search the rows at last coming to gina
the lamborghini countach
they move for it
mirror man contd check it he gettures to the license plate
it reads snake
mirror man contd oooh
homeboy wants you to call him snaake
they crack up
mirror man contd no whistles
they slim jim her beetle wing articulated door
the sphinx starts her up
mirror ma gets in beside him
the seats are sooo low
mirror man contd this shits on point
he gestures to the speedometer
calibrated to mph
mirror man contd halfway there we switch
the sphinx shrugs
and they head out
say goodbye to your ride snake
memphis and sway have followed the maserati to another building
smokey robinsons cruisin croons
whats this guy up to
after a beat a woman comes out
she gets into the car
its on a tuesday
is that any time to pick a girl up for a date
the maseratis lights go off
sway contd what are they gonna mack
the couple start kissing
memphis checks his watch sway contd maybe shes got a roommate
they watch the couple in the maserati for a beat
junie ottos gal on the telephone
theyll be in the lobby of the riviera building
and we go to and see a lincoln limousine pull up outside this posh apartment building
the driver gets out
heads to the lobby
we see kip and tumbler step out from the shadows across the street
climb into the limo
the sphinx drives
mirror man pops in his tape
albert kings drivin wheel
thats what im talkin about
he boogies down
the sphinx is bewitched awed by the cars magnificent power
but then mirror man screams
with pure terror
for at his feet wrapped around his legs is a boa constrictor some feet long
a mass of heavilykeeled scales shimmering on coiled muscle
mirror man screams on and on
the sphinx swerves wildly
racing through a red light
barely missing an on coming bus
passing a pair of cops coming out of a
they hop into their unit
the persian man and his date
behind them memphis and sway wait in the mazda
memphis is on the cell okay check with you soon
he hangs up
memphis contd otto says ladies have reported for work
the maseratis windows are fully steamed
memphis contd man theyre going at it theyre in love
he looks at her
what about you
she looks at him
you remember my gramma
i was thinking
if she were alive
and she asked me
if she came down right now
what do you do sara
whats your life
i think it would break her heart if i said i was a thief
i steal cars gramma
and even though hey i learned it all from her son
my uncle eddie
who taught me the basics
which you refined
you remember randall gramma
you thought he was neat
well he refined the basics
i dont think thats what she hoped for me
she looks at him
sway contd but
car thieves are my weakness
its all so terribly loretta lynn or something i know
i dont wanna be a thief anymore
i dont wanna love a thief anymore
i want to wear a dress maybe once in a while
maybe have a kid
watch a lot of audrey hepburn movies
and think about my gramma without also thinking shame on me
shame on me
shame on me
she looks at him
he leans into her
tentative at first
phones ringing like mad
drycoff walks into castlebecks office
its an epidemic rollie
im getting reports every five minutes
as little red corvette by prince warbles on the track
memphis and sway still kissing
she breaks it for arright
i cant have you bellying up to my heart again man f you cant help falling off the stool
but he puts his mouth to her ears
car thieves are your weakness
memphis contd i approach you
i look this way

and yes this is patently absurd
but its also oddly sexy

what about the club
let me worry about the club
ive got you floored
take the curb
man can you corner
know not to get on it
dont get on those brakes too hard
get her up on her tires
up on her toes
a small moan escapes her
and sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to here
she flops back down
looks at him
youre still quite the boost randall raines
he shrugs except now ive been chopped and my parts are in a honda prelude being driven to church in south america by some bolivian consulates wife
and tracys on the move
indeed the girl has gotten out of the maserati
and the car has rocketed off
memphis punches the gas sending sway to the floor
wham bam thank you maam point five
pre lap alice coopers under my wheels and slam cut to close up of the snake license plate as its ass end fishtails like a bastard
the sphinx is outrunning what is now a half dozen cruisers
is freaking out
the snake wrapped all around him
what do i do
what do i do
hes gonna swallow my shit whole lets go to a hospital or something
but the sphinx shakes his head
mirror man contd cmon you creepy no nosed motherfucker
take me to a hospital
the sphinx drives on
into yet another this one even cooler than the last
and once theyve eluded all of the police the sphinx pulls over to the side of a darkened what are you doing
im gonna die
the sphinx leans over
and pinches the snake behind the back of mirror man contd you tryin to make him more mad
but miraculously the snake relaxes its grip on mirror man
and slithers off
to the back of the car
where it immediately goes back to sleep
mirror man stares at sphinx who smiles genially
then mirror man contd i never thought itd be possible but your ass just got spookier
freb and donny astricky have gotten laura a bentley started
you ever feel bad about any of this
of course not
im robin hood
i take from the rich and give to the needy

and donny puts her in gear when a gun is jammed against donnys temple

donny looks at the jacker
it is a kid
no more than

im stealing this car
so back off

and he slams open the door
catching the kid in the balls
and the kid doubles over
dropping the gun
donny gets out of the car
donny astricky contd lazy disrespectinif half assed bully
any asshole can pull a gun
and he starts to kick at the kid
beat at him
donny astricky contd you dont know how to steal a car do ya
so you gotta take them when theres already a key in them
and a person in them
little freakin bully
lets go man lazy
i ask you freb whats the matter with kids today
but then blam
bullets rip into donny astricky in terrifying slow motion
to see another kid
at the edge of the road
gat held high
and donny drops to the pavement
and the first jacker gets to his feet
freb goes to donny
to his splayed out body
sirens split the night
the jackers run off down the street
donny astricky contd get outta here
i cant leave you here man freb doesnt know what to do

you take me to the hospital they bust the both of us
the copsll take me
and freb makes to run off down the street
but donny astricky contd freb
freb turns back donny astricky contd take laura with you you stupid shit
he climbs into the bentley drives off
as the cruisers pull up around him
and the uniforms getout guns drawn approaching warily to find donny astricky
splayed out on the pavement
laughing at the moon
and as jimi hendrix crosstown traffic blasts on track we cut to of the final series of boosts
the maserati parked and empty
sway breaches it
they drive off
kip and tumbler
clocking a viper
they circle it
its loaded with bells and whistles and clubs and a metallic voice that warns warning you are too close the vehicle
over and over
kip shakes his head
ushers tumbler back
mirror man and the sphinx deliver an aston martin to the docks watch as it is driven into a container
the container loaded by gantry crane onto the ship lashed to the deck by overworked helen raines
looking out the window
listening to the scanner for word of her boys
the big board
female names disappearing like dust
castlebeck and drycoff
cruising the streets
kip and tumbler return to the viper
this time in a ramp truck
they raise the ramp
tie down the viper
a drive off with it to be disarmed at a later safer venue as it continues its robotic exhortation of warning
you are too close to the vehicle
over and over again
all our teams
speeding toward us
in different cars
as the music fades and we end montage where annie the roadster lives as an objet dart
figures in the thicket surrounding the property
memphis sway kip tumbler mirror man the sphinx
mirror man has the mansions electrical box opened
he going through the wires
cutting alarm phone etc
memphis is on the cell phone
he hangs up
donny got shot
how is he
they got him to the hospital
as they all reflect on this
memphis contd on a brighter note ladies have checked in for their south american sea cruise this cheers them slightly
until from the electrical box got it
and the few remaining lights of flicker and fade
they regard the house for a beat
no ones quite sure
they look at the house
at all that glass
then kip walks to their car
pop the trunk tumbler
i gotta get my tool and tumbler and mirror man look at each other
no way homes
the trunk is popped
kip reaches in
comes up with yes another brick
and kip walks toward the house
toward the vast windows
mirror man contd to memphis ya gotta stop him man but kip forges on indomitable
only he passes the huge glass windows
walking instead up to the front door
and he smashes the brick down onto the doorknob
knocking it clean off
looks back at the others with a wink
and enters the house
tumbler runs after him
kip walks through the dark house
at last coming to the living room
he gets behind the wheel
her ignition is quick work
hes got her started loud in the quiet house
she coughs a bit its been a long time
tumbler is there
now we go and he drives her off the platform
tumbler directs him
her nose bumps a zillion dollar vase which topples and shatters
tumbler contd that way
and tumbler climbs in beside him
kip drives her around the huge living room
and kip punches the gas
and they drive the roadster down the hall
and right through the open door
driving down onto the lawn
up to their cohorts
see ya back at the ranch kids
and off they go
vanishing down the street
the others watch after him
mirror man to memphis gotta tell ya man since you been back
youve had a real calming influence on ol kip
drycoff comes into castlebecks office
they just brought in donny astricky
shot by a jacker
how is he
but it means your boys behind it
astricky was holding a list
they just faxed it to us
he hands castlebeck the list
castlebeck notes the last entry

kip contd later toby but tobys not around
kip contd toby

a neighborhood security patrol car glides by them

toby is there
having stowed away

kip looks at tumbler
at last pulling up to one house where the benz carol lives
kip parks a half block down
they get out
head for the house
and there she is
in the garage
the garage is open
and three kids two boys and a girl
they are standing around carol
listening to the new beck album on the cars cd player
the folks clearly out of town
well scrubbed white suburban children of plenty
the only crew theyve ever run in is j
from the hedge kip tumbler and toby watch the kids
with equal parts fascination loathing envy
and then the kids go inside
leaving carol exposed
i got this one
and before the others can respond he moves for her
and shes open
butterfly popped gizmo in
the others start to get in when one of the kids comes out from the house
he stares at toby who freezes mid boost
kip contd whispered hiss get her started man
and toby does
and slams her in reverse
and theyre off the group memphis sway freb mirror man and the sphinx has returned
the final cars loaded onto the ship
memphis looks out into the night cmon kip toby drives them out kip shotgun tumbler in the back
but the suburbs are confusing
they cant find their way out
which ways out man
shit all looks the same here they drive
only up ahead blocking the street lights blinding
are two security patrol cars security cops on the strong
toby looks to kip
what am i supposed to do
toby pins the gas
straight at the block
the security cops dive out of the way
except for one standing tall and firing into the windshield
the car swerves
going off the road
into a bank of mailboxes
the security guards run for her
kip forehead bloodied switches places with toby getting behind the wheel
punches the gas
getting them out of there
kip drives like a wild man
toby is bleeding something fierce
shot in the chest
im shot man
just hold on
what are we gonna do
we cant do that dude kip looks at tumbler
they both look at toby
as the vette comes screaming into the warehouse
kip exploding out of it
getting into the back
memphis goes to the car sees toby
front of his shirt covered in blood
the others gather around
memphis climbs into the car
kip is holding toby
i didnt know

the brothers stare at the boy
kip wipes his sweatstreaked face
toby contd whats gonna happen

tears running down his eyes
kip looks to his brother for help
call call em here
and mirror man scurries for the phone
tobys breathing comes out in short staccato bursts
it doesnt feel
it doesnt feel
it doesnt feel
good he looks up at kip
all of the light goes out of his eyes
and toby is dead
kip holds him for a beat
then passes him to a surprisingly emotional tumbler
kip gets out of the car runs for the opposite end of the warehouse
the others are stunned
mirror man hangs up the phone
memphis gets out of the car
he goes after kip
finds him in one of the containers
grabs him by the collars
what did i tell you
what did i tell you
i dont know
and kip looks at him
tears fall from the younger boys eyes
and kip looks so lost
so like a little kid
come here what
come here what
come here and kip does
he walks to memphis
and memphis puts his arms around him
and thats it
the floodgates open
kip begins to sob
deep painful racking sobs
and then ive missed you man
ive missed you too and they hold each other
and they stay in the embrace
and then memphis unwraps kips arms from around him
stay here a while
ill be back
kip nods sniffles
memphis walks out of the container
he strides up to the others
glances at tobys clipboard with all the cars crossed out
he goes to sway
memphis contd give me a ride
kips not clear yet
we got one more to go and she nods
and climbs into one of the escorts
and off they go
the others standing around the vette and tobys body
angle the clipboard
one car left
as a super on screen reads part iv dreams of you the sun just starting to take all the purple from the night
detectives castlebeck and drycoff are parked across from the towers in their unmarked
sway pulls up a few blocks away
memphis has put on a fake moustache wig necktie
he looks at her
memphis contd you should know walking away from my mother my brother this town
walking away from you
nearly killed me
and she smiles sadly
she takes his hand
sway contd good luck
memphis now in gray flannel suit wig and moustache steps out
as he heads for the tower garage
drycoff is on the radio
binoculars up on the escorts license plate ckg
into radio one baker
california charles king george
sway drives off
charles king george
not on file
memphis walks along the cars
at last he finds her eleanor
castlebeck and drycoff
check it out he points
the mustang appears at the top of the garage ramp
waiting for the light
raises the binocs
tough to tell
memphis drifts into the stream of traffic
detective drycoff contd what do you think
lets see what hes about drycoff hits the lights and sirens
memphis sees the car behind him
and kicks it into gear
he pins it
and the race is on
in the biggest way possible
this is the grand daddy of chase scenes here so we wont take the easy way out
well actually script it
memphis races out onto the busy street drycoff on his ass
drycoff pulls up alongside him
so they can see him
but the wig and moustache prevent them from recognizing memphis
other cars suffer from the pursuit
they go careening into parked cars storefronts harvard square
memphis side swipes drycoffs car
memphis drives down the memorial drive off ramp against traffic baker in pursuit following collision with suspect
suspect is male white six feet pounds gray hair gray moustache dark suit
s have occurred
memphis races her down an alleyway
and we hear as we will throughout the voice of the switch to open channel
all units stand by
police dispatch contd baker in pursuit of a ford mustang license in the th column hso
repeat harry sam ocean
westbound on memorial drive against traffic
eleanor races past the queen mary
crossing the bridge into long beach
she flies down the street
memphis removing his wig and moustache as he goes
another police car has joined drycoff and castlebeck
the jocular drive time jock matty in the morning is broadcasting in his studio
were getting reports that a big police chase has started right near our humble studios
well keep you posted
has the radio on
he serpentines his way through the tangle of alleys
stand by to copy
mustang is silver in color
california license henry sam ocean
reason for pursuit is unknown
drycoff does his best to follow
another cruiser has joined up
memphis is driving like richard petty
two dozen cops sit in the muster room listening to the dispatch
suspect is headed southbound on mount vernon at cambridge street the cops look at each other
and race for the exit
vernon and cambridge is the address of where there are literally police cars parked out front
and memphis has just arrived
watch the mad scramble as cops dive into their units
and try to get out of each others way
memphis bootlegs going reverse down the wrong way
left on cambridge
left onto city hall plaza is acres of brick in the heart of downtown
and now its like a demolition derby
as drycoff castlebeck and some squad cars are chasing memphis around the plaza
a police chopper has arrived on the scene
memphis takes one more spin around the plaza then sees a shallow flight of stairs by the back entrance to city
and he takes them
clump kump ka dump dump dump and now hes on some of the narrowest streets in long beach
he flies through them
a mad mouse in a maze
kiss watches the chase on tv via copter cam
man is this boy driving
you go boss barracuda memphis races along hes got squad cars on him attention all units
pursuit is now southbound on the from the construction area on kneeland street all units in the area assist
he takes the kneeland street exit
and hes run out of road at where vehicle traffic ends
foot traffic only
here com the cops
memphis spins the wheel
and he drives onto public park
across the grounds
past the dew drenched flora and the paddle boats lolling on the lagoon
only there are squad cars coming from this side too
and hes pinned
police on the perimeters he slows to a stop
cops jump out of their cars guns drawn
memphis in the center
pursuit has terminated at the garden park
repeat and castlebeck is on the bullhorn amplified you in the car
the area is surrounded
i want you out to step from the vehicle
hands on your head
memphis considers his options
he sees the foot bridge over the lagoon
hears the radio
is our boy done
has the boss barracuda been grounded
memphis takes out his cell phone
the coordinating producer comes into the booth
some guys on the phone for you matty
claims to be the boss barracuda
matty scrambles for the phone hello
memphis in the middle of the gauntlet
on the phone
is this the boss barracuda
how you doing man
the truth is my car here doesnt have a tape deck
you mind hooking me with up with some driving tunes
you got it brother
memphis hangs up
hears this one is going out to the boss barracuda
catch him if you can and he plays chuck berrys no particular place to go and memphis smiles
attaboy and punches the gas
going right at castlebeck and the others smashing through the squad cars
and across the foot bridge over the swan boats
the pursuit is going again is it ever
memphis drives out of the park
and gets onto ten lanes of gnarly superhighway
he opens her up
the chopper above him
the gang is watching on the tv
he slips out of the place
no ones noticed him go
eleanor crashes the gate going to borrow a phrase
but he s driving too close to the shoulder and he smashes into a light pole
the car does a
landing with a horrible thud
and here come the cops
memphis is wobbly
looks like hes almost through
thirty cop cars idle behind him
attention suspect has t
d with light pole at the carson street offramp
pursuit has terminated
and chuck berry has come to an and matty obliges with golden earrings radar love
and this seems to rouse our boy
because he gets her started again
thanks brother spins her around
and goes that is negative
pursuit has not terminated
repeat not terminated
climb back into their car
who is this friggin guy
close on castlebeck
because hes got a sick feeling who
takes an exit
and speeds on through the with everyone in pursuit
attention all units
road block being set up at the eastern terminus of the long beach harbor tunnel
its quite a road block
a dozen squad cars
a wooden barricade the whole shebang
coming to the tunnels mouth
to the road block
memphis pins her
dead on to the roadblock and at the last moment as the cops dive out of the way memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral and yanks the parking brake
and the mustang spins on the straight and yes this is exactly like our opening screeching spin
it stops inches from the road block
thirty squad cars stop behind him
pursuit has been terminated
repeat pursuit has been terminated at harbor tunnel eastern terminus sure it has
memphis foot slams on eleanors pedal
smashing through the roadblock
cars and cops flying
and the dispatch guy is getting pissed
check that all units
you guessed it
pursuit has not been terminated
jesus christ will you catch this guy
a huge suspension bridge spanning the harbor
except that on the long beach side therehas been a terrible accident
an eleven car pile up
this is rescue
were at a scene of an car collision with multiple injuries responded to ladder truck code
well need back up and the jaws of life
ramp trucks hauling away wrecked cars
takes it on through the vast construction underway here
and heres our money shot eleanor
coming at us
followed by literally police cars
could be just about the coolest fucking thing weve ever seen
but before we have time to gloat all units
suspect vehicle has left the harbor tunnel roadblock
state police advises they have a multiple t
on the long beach bridge
accident is unrelated to long beach p
repeat unrelated to long beach p
the area is closed except to emergency vehicles
suspect is headed in that direction
use caution in that area
repeat use caution in that area
southbound traffic on the bridge into long beach is at a stand still because of the accident
the northbound side of the bridge is empty
northbound traffic stopped at the accident
memphis comes to a stop feet before the accident
there is no way past it onto the bridge
all the cops behind him come to a screeching halt
he is truly trapped
gotcha now dickhead but castlebecks not so sure
he sees a possible play
so does heavy sigh
he shuts off the radio
and theres a strange silence
as everyone waits
matty in the morning the gang at ottos the carpenter in his wood shop helen raines in front of her tv the chopper cops paramedics cops injured motorists fire men
castlebeck and drycoff
back to another few beats of silence
he punches the gas
ripping down to the accident site
heading straight for it
and we fear he aims to smash the site maybe further injure the accident victims not our memphis
hes heading straight for parked ass end toward long beach
memphis rockets eleanor at the ramp trucks ramp
and the ramp launches eleanor in glorious super sexy bloodpumping slo mo over the accident site some thirty feet in the air
you gotta be fucking kidding me where she lands in a crippling thud
onto the empty side of the long beach bridge
cheers from the gang at ottos
the gang at kiss
memphis pulls her to a stop
looks back at the scene
trying to see if its his boy
memphis switches the radio back on
matty has obliged
wilson picketts mustang sallyo
and memphis drives over the bridge the only car going northbound
memphis rides daddy rides
a half dozen calitri soldiers are here answering phones playing cards
the sliding door is open
the casket for kip rests to the side
calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a plywood gossip bench
he senses something and turns to has driven up in the smashed to shit eleanor
he climbs up entering the workshop
calitri glances to the wallclock well well
youve caused quite a ruckus
this is number
we did it
its over wheres the money
right there he gestures to a haliburton case
memphis opens it
theres a lot of cash inside
calitri contd k
just like we said
you should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved
but i had to
it was the only way to get to you memphis looks at him
well now hes clear
and youll stay away from him
i dont know about that randall
he did such a good job on this paper
and another one just came in
calitri goes to the fax machine
tears off the sheet
calitri contd its an easier take
most of them suvs
going to russia
think kipll be interested
you dont want to even sniff at that calitri grins
but then his smile goes south as he sees for the first time eleanor parked out on the loading dock
and she is smashed to shit
well that certainly wont do
what do you mean
look at it
i cant very well make delivery of that thing
you got no choice
fifty cars by am friday
or kip goes in that box
that was the deal
that was the deal
memphis is by a table saw
he flicks it on
the electric motor rumbles so as to obfuscate any noise in here
calitri contd what are you doing
tell you what im not doing im not gonna let you get into my kool aid
and memphis is on him
they go rolling about in grunts and groans eddies of sawdust swirling the noise of the table saw drowning out the sounds of combat
calitri is on top grabbing an awl from the floor bringing the lethal point down to memphis face
memphis holds calitris wrist straining the point inches from his eye angle floor socket right above memphis head
with a last gasp memphis misdirects the awl so it stabs the floor socket a small clap of voltage shaking through their bodies as they sprawl akimbo
both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them
calitri is up and hes found the gun
he crawls over to memphis climbing on him sitting down hard on the younger mans chest
but then memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses calitri off him
memphis pounds calitris head into the floor
calitri is out
memphis gets to his feet nose bloody
he catches his breath
only the door opens
and atley is there
whatd you do
my version of take this job and shove it
are you crazy
you throw down with the carpenter
you got a grudge against your life
but before memphis can respond there are approaching engine sounds from up the alleyway as a panel van arrives
memphis and atley look at the wall clock
a glance to the unconscious calitri
atley jackson contd now you done it
and with you gone wholl save kip the next time
this is all about there not being a next time atley and the two men hold the look
and the van doors slam as digger and butz calitris grave diggers get out
atley goes to the unconscious calitri
and he picks him up straining under the dead weight
dragging the don over to the open casket one final burst of strength and atley drops calitri into the casket
slamming the swell top lid of the coffin
he turns to look at the shocked memphis as digger and butz are there hello boys
did they make it they did not
he said to take it away
atley gestures to the coffin
and they pick it up move it to the van
thatll do ya
we was by
and they are gone
and atley turns to memphis ding dong the witch is dead right
and he holds out his hand
and they shake
get outta here memphis and memphis does
nods to atley
memphis walks out to the loading dock
atley watches him go
memphis walks to the battered eleanor
as pearl jams rearviewmirror crunches and a car comes motoring up to him
its another shelby
another eleanor a for sale sign pasted on the back window
its being driven by kip
what are you doing here
i saw her get smashed up on the tv
knew there was no way he was gonna accept her
whered you find this one
ya gotta keep tabs on your eleanors memphis
cos you never know when youre gonna need one you boost her
shes not my unicorn
memphis gets behind the wheel
kip beside him
i keep thinking about him
but then flashing lights behind them
an unmarked with code capabilities lights sirens
memphis considers he could make another run
but the looks at kip
enough is enough
he pulls over
kip contd what are you doing
you can outrun him
the dumb shit is over
the unmarked pulls up behind him
the cop comes over
it is of course detective castlebeck
i know you
you know my back
castlebeck opens his coat
showing stuffed holster
its finished randall
get out of the car
you too kid
memphis starts to get out
when castlebacks radio crackles
we have suspect vehicle matching description at the woodburn scrap and metal
repeat the suspect vehicle has just been apprehended at the woodburn scrap and metal street and campanza
castlebeck frowns goes to his radio
memphis looks at kip
i reported it
memphis is impressed
not bad angle castlebeck at his car on the radio
dispatch whats the license on the suspect vehicle
license is california hso
henry sam ocean
and castlebeck looks at the license on this eleanor
a vanity plate that says my
and he goes back over to memphis
detective castlebeck contd looks like we live to fight another round
youre free to go
memphis can barely believe it
castlebeck leans down to kip detective castlebeck contd your brothers a clever man and a talented thief kipling
but as role models go you should observe the man not the thief
dont look so glum detective
its a beautiful day the birds are singing and theres a container ship on pier thats guaranteed to bring you glee
i want you gone randall
settle your affairs
make it right with those you love
hell take em with you
but i want you out of here
out of here for good this time
consider me gone detective ill catch you later randall double meaning intended you betcha and memphis races off
otto the sphinx tumbler freb and mirror man are sipping coffee and eating donuts
they are exhausted
memphis and kip pull up in eleanor
he hands otto the briefcase
otto opens it
all that cash
split it up
any word on donny
hes gonna be okay
could do a bit
what happened to sway
the boys are huddled together
poor toby man
a few beats of silence as they remember then shockingly if his premature demise has in some way enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the
glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired you to change your ways then his death carries with it an inherent nobility
and a supreme glory
we should all be so fortunate
you can say poor toby
i say poor us
they all stare at him stunned
you spoke the sphinx shrugs
say something else man but the sphinx lapses back into his silence
nibbles a donut sips coffee
he takes a stack of bills from the briefcase
to kip you remember where you got this eleanor
sure man shes for sale
theyre asking forty thousand
give em sixty
and he hands kip the cash
you want me to buy her
were clear now
ive never actually paid for a car
i want to see what it feels like kip nods
memphis looks at a grinning otto
all of us
the ice age is now
ill see you soon where you off to
thought id go for a ride he smiles
the others do too
memphis heads for eleanor
memphis turns back
kip contd ill see you right
youll see me
and we pre lap sammy johns chevy van and cut to sway underneath a daytona
we only see her from the waist down hands on her waist
pulls her gently out
he brings her to her feet
what are you doing
seeing if you wanted to go for a ride
and he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from her cheek
i got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and i havent slept and stops short sees the new eleanor outside where to
i know a place
she looks at him
long and hard
this time its for real
for real point five
and memphis opens the passenger door for her
and she gets in
and she smiles
and memphis climbs behind the wheel
he neutral drops eleanor chirping off
as two tugs guide the giant freighter away from the docks
all those containers
filled with cars
but here comes a coast guard cutter
churning for the ship
detectives castlebeck and drycoff on the deck
stopping this one cold
a vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth
deserted except for the panel van parked dead center
digger and butz slide the casket from the van parked before an already dug grave
as they move the casket a knocking from inside
and muffled cries
digger and butz exchange a horrified glance
they stare at the casket spooked
do you believe this
what should we do
we gotta do what we gotta do shit
i hate the screamers man
why cant he finish the freakin job
forget about it
occupational hazard digger
and just as we think theyre sure to open it they drop the and begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it its unseen occupant thumping and pounding and yelling
and soon the casket is covered in dirt
and we pre lap the turtles pop gem eleanor you got a thing about you i just cant live without you i really want you eleanor near me
cut to memphis driving
sway riding shotgun
long beach at their backs memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel
he loves driving this car
sway watches him
he feels it what
just that if i was less secure i might think you were more into eleanor than you are me
she does have one thing you dont
and he grins
pats the seat beside him
and sway slides close
he throws his arm around her
and off they go
as the turtles eleanor gee i think youre swell and you really do me well youre my pride and joy etc
and we hear you like bingo
and eleanor drives away from us
into the searing horizon line becoming just another single yellow dot in the pointillist pattern that is the american road
