highlander iv world without end draft b
b if window
href b b through clinging highland mists that shroud a land still in its infancy
cathedral spires of granite
a solitary vastness
voice contd ancient castles dot the landscape whisper of battles long forgotton
voice contd two figures clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory
voice contd match move to the top of an ultra modern skyscraper
swordsmen continue to battle
voice contd loser falls to the others sword as the heavens cleave in a titanic rupture of sight and sound
like the birth of a brand new universe
yawning concrete spires
blare of traffic
engraved into a brass plaque a face reflects in the window glass
its rachel ellenstein early s now a graying maternal beauty
she moves to the front door reaches out to unlock i
it falls open at her touch
even though the hanging placard is still flipped to were closed rachel hesitates
draws a shallow breath and steps inside
all those sublime european antiquities now drip with menace
she moves deeper into the shadowed recesses flicks on a lamp
her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things
an open wooden case empty
just the felt impression of a missing broadsword
icy dread connor
she crosses to the foot of the staircase
spools a faint tinny madrigal
she climbs the stairs padding softly upward
the music grinds ever louder in its maddening repetitions
every so often its punctuated by a childs giggle
rachel edges around the corner
her breath catches in her throat
before her stands a locked wooden cabinet
its been cleaved nearly in half by the broadsword that still juts hilt first from the base of the splintered front panel
photo albums and leather bound diaries have been shredded and scattered across the floor except for several selected photographs skewered onto the sword tip like a medieval message spike
rachel struggles to breathe
like shes taken that sword in her own gut
inside the cabinet a television flickers with videotape of grainy home movies
a little girl rachel is entranced by a porcelain music box held out by an ageless connor macleod
let me see connor
let me see
rachel stands frozen watching her life with connor flash by in ragged film clips
connor teaching rachel to ride a horse
connor with rachel outside an english boarding school
in a train station
at her college graduation
connor and rachel in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper
in each new clip rachel has aged further
connor has not
rachel steps up to the broadsword wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet
the skewered photographs flutterd to the floor like dead leaves and a new image burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity
staring back at herself terror stricken
she hadnt even noticed it before now
the tiny camcorder on the shelf above the tv with the glowing red light
move in on the tv as rachel slowly backs away
keep moving in on the tv until the pixels swim
the phone rings shattering the stillness
the old rotary phone on the little louis xiv stand
its not just beckoning her
its taunting her
gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast rachel slowly approaches the phone
any second now youd expect it to stop ringing nobody home
but whoevers on the other end knows better
it keeps right on ringing
trembling fingers reach out for the receiver
slowly lift it off the hook
a tiny electric click is the last thing rachel hears before a blistering explosion blows out the entire second floor
rachel ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history
linger on the flames as we they crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them
it takes a moment to realize theyre livestock oxen pigs goats sheep piled like burning refuse
a crude woven straw human effigy stands astride the pile engulfed in flame
beyond the fire connor macleod and his young wife heather watch from the steps of their simple isolated home
connor betrays no emotion
heather looks on in horror
my god what are they
dead of the plague
why do they torment us with their dead cattle
no response connor
they think ive brought this upon them
its a warning
a deeper fear now grips heather
they drove you from your home
they cut you off from your own people
what else could they want
connor turns away from the flaming heap
someone to blame
connor swinging astride his horse
dread dont go back there
thunder rumbles in the distance
i have no choice
please they cant hurt me
and they know it
but they can still hurt the ones i care about
heather looks off
connor leans forward takes her face in his hands
i love you heather
more than anything in this world
she grips his hands
connor contd do you believe me
then you neednt be afraid
kisses her nothing can ever keep us apart
connor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog shrouded valleys
he gazes down at the tiny hamlet of glenfinnan nestled between castle and shimmering loch
breathes deep the forgotten smell of home
caiolin macleod ravaged by neglect and despair strokes her sons face as if confirming his reality
i thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch
smiles maybe i am mother
touches his hair then come let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go
connor lifts her from the tattered bed spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair
not before we put some meat on those bones
he rummages through her shelves looking for food
finds painfully little
connor contd no one comes to look after you
theyre all afraid of me
they think i bedevil their children because ive lost my own
im so sorry
tiny minds and sour dispositions
i dont need them connor
any of them
connor crouches at her feet
then its settled
youre coming with me
theres somebody i want you to meet
shes nearly as beautiful as you
caiolin blinks back her disbelief
connor contd we leave tonight
lets start packing
lifts up her shoes im already packed
a young man stands in the doorway
hes strong and severe dressed in clergymans black
but thats not what draws the eye
even though its cold enough to fog his breath hes sweatinq
connor looks up guarded
jacob you shouldna come back connor
connor feels the tension in kases voice
surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once
for old times sake
you knew what would happen if you came back
i am not to blame for this
beat what have you done
god help you
father alasdair rainey the local priest and inquisitor steps inside bent over a silver cane
hes gross corpulent and perpetually short of breath
a nasty nose boil figures prominently in his overall appearance
villagers of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them
in the name of the holy see and the rule of law you are hereby charged connor macleod with heresy and the practice of black magic
turns to the villagers take him
the townsmen jostle in place each trying to squeeze backward behind the other
father rainey contd squints heresy is not contagious
two of the bolder men move forward gripping connor by the elbows
once its clear they havent sucked up any demons the others swarm him
caiolin screams as connors dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs
connor stirs awake in a centuries old dungeon a dark hole crumbling and damp
voices seem to drip through the porous mortar
taunting vengeful expectant
he crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow ground level view of the town commons where a well attended execution is now underway
connor squints craning to make out the identity of the condemned
townspeople mingle and mill in front of him obstructing his line of sight
even as a familiar voice rises above the surrounding chatter
the curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next
the ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed if in fact your blood is that of your son
several villagers step aside to reveal connors mother bound to an upright stake atop a mound of shorn timber
connor siezes with the impossible horror of recognition
jacob kase makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of execution
he stands atop a primeval celtic monolith worn down to the form of a pedestal
father rainey wobbles behind him sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina
through the infinite compassion of our lord god you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy to declare connor macleod not of your loins and help
put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land
how say you caiolin macleod
caiolin lifts her head pale and beatific
if your god should persecute me into the next world then i shall simply have to find myself another
shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd
kase steps up and rips away caiolins cherished silver crucifix with its distinctive wooden christ figure
holding up caiolins crucifix you wont need this where youre going
connor grabs at the iron window bars
shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings
the ruddy faced executioner solemnly approaches caiolin
unseen by the bloodlusting crowd he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring
he tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest
softly black powder
it will make short work of your suffering
he steps down off the pyre
reaches for a burning torch
connor strains against the bars like a madman
mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually rips away completely
the executioner touches torch to kindling
connor tries to squeeze through the window gap
so he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury
iron strikes unyielding stone sparking and chipping
the pyre beneath caiolin engulfs in flame
heat ripples her face distorts her body
connor hammers harder quicker louder
bits of stone fly everywhere
but the bulk of it remains spitefully intact
still its enough to convince all four guards to intervene
they throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon connor with swords and axes
wielding the iron bar like a battle mace connor splits the first guards head catches his sword mid air and slices into the next
third guards axe catches on a ceiling beam
connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack
the fourth guard drops his sword and bolts
the pyre is now fully ablaze
caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame
and smiles weakly
my water horse
as connor splits the crowd like a battering ram
he reaches the pyre hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands
initially stunned the townsfolk shrink back watching connor desperately scatter the fire
caiolin buries her face in her shoulder biting back the agony as
sword in hand connor stretches upward hacking away the ropes that bind her oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs
freed of the ropes caiolin begins to slump forward
connor grabs for her arm as the black powder explodes in a concussion of fire that renders any further hope of rescue futile
connor stands atop the burning pyre wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings
he throws back his head and howls to the heavens
fire dances across connors skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd
pandemonium breaks out
this isnt just a common witch
this is one of hells very own
those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand
the rest scatter in mindless panic
father rainey blocks connors path
lifts his cross
as hes cut down by the blind slash of connors sword
connor steps over raineys body and keeps coming driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings
kase crouches blustering over rainey
father please tries to staunch the bleeding father
raineys eyes open slightly
who are you
its your son jacob
rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted
and what he now sees terrifies him to death
eyes widen who are you
im your he stops
raineys eyes are frozen
connor returns to the flaming pyre refueling his rage with the sight of his mothers blackened corpse
kase scoops up a discarded sword leaps to his feet and charges connor bellowing like a madman
connor whirls around with his sword making kase impale himself on the blade
kase stares wide eyed and gagging at connors smoldering visage the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes
its the last thing jacob kase will ever see
connor opens his fingers and lets him drop the sword hilt still jutting from kases chest
gathering up several chunks of flaming timber connor heaves them onto the straw covered rooftops setting them instantly ablaze
in short order the village is transformed into a giant swirling inferno
silhouetted against the crimson sky connor lifts caiolins body and turns his back on glenfinnan for the last time
standing outside the massive door is a monk clad in dark hooded monastic garb
nothing in the panorama would suggest weve just jumped four centuries into an uncertain future
until a pack of motorcyclists chew their way up the rubbled slope
fishtail to a stop
the leader a tall eclectically dressed jamaican dismounts and approaches the hooded monk
you people are extremely hard to find
monk unshoulders a pump action shotgun
we like it that way
pumps shotgun now go
the other six intruders surround the monk
his eyes flick from one to the next a buffet of different nationalities all big
take your pick
before you squeeze the trigger a second time youll be dead
monk levels his gun and blows the jamaican right off his feet
and sure enough he gags before his next trigger pull
a very nasty serrated blade retracts into a wooden hilt
monk drops in a heap as his assailant a wiry asian turns for the door joined by the others
in the very next instant the heavy oak and iron door swings open with a barrage of automatic gunfire the intruders are cut down where they stand
three more hooded monks appear in the doorway wielding assault rifles
they grimly regard the bodies
take the heads
just in case
saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while guard l keeps his gun trained on the corpses
a figure stands in shadow his face unseen
we catch only a brief glimpse of a priests collar
guard l whips his rifle toward the stranger
stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword
bullets go nowhere
one slash and the guard is gone
two more slashes and his comrades fall
stranger kicks the body of the dead jamaican as he steps through the open doorway
dont be long
follow the stranger through a maze of chambers and down into serpentine catacombs
he kicks through a door into an inner room cavernous and dripping where even the air seems septic
a few dim candles illuminate a dozen men bound to complicated almost giger esque chairs
arms legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal bolted into flesh and wood
from the wild overgrowth of hair and beard and the impossibly long curled fingernails its a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years
except for a pale custodian standing in a corner trembling silently
stranger stands at the threshold his face obscured by flickering shadows
he scans the living corpses
so its true
he moves slowly among them
stranger contd what sacrifices they made of you all
warehoused like rotting pieces of meat
he pauses to lift up a downcast head
gazes into the shackled face
the eyes are covered by strips of rusted iron the face by tangled beard
stranger contd tell me is this the better way
im sure youve had some time to reflect on it
one by one the recently dead intruders filter into the room led by the jamaican
blood stipples their clothes streaks their faces
but they are in every other sense fully restored
stranger straightens swivels around to the terrified custodian
custodian backpeddles into the wall
which one is connor macleod
i i dont know
they never told me names
low seething dont
i dont know
stranger grabs him under the chin lifts him to his toes
you need to understand one thing my gimpy friend
i dont care about the game
i dont care about the rules
i dont even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the prize
the custodian stares back uncomprehending
stranger contd squeezes his throat i want connor macleod
give me macleod and ill leave
and you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters
the custodian lifts a shaking finger
rack focus to the prisoner in the last chair even with an iron slat across his eyes he is unmistakably connor macleod
stranger lets go of the custodian turns
connor strains to lift his head
his voice comes weak and drug heavy
who are you
youll know soon enough
an unearthly light pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar
tendrils of raw energy vein the ancient building growing brighter until the windows explode outward with a keening animal like howl
above the sky responds with screaming wind and torrents of rain
wind howls over the city of lights slicing up the seine to
docked at the quay
push in on duncan macleod cross legged in meditation atop the deck
he jolts from a series of sudden violent images
a face bolted immobile wrenched in agony
a swordblade slashing into flesh
fingernails clawing wood
blood flecking tile
duncan snaps up the receiver sweat drenched
tiny electric click
then the hiss of an overseas line
filtered hes dead
in a driving rain
a womans hand holds the receiver to her face obscuring her features
he was killed last night
duncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions
who is this
the unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle
shadows crawl across the parisian skyline as an engine revs to rpm
we punch through the arc de triomphe and up the champs elysee with a throaty ferarri howl
on a wicked downshift we squeal hard right onto the pont neuf stopping on a franc at duncan hops out of his ferrari spyder pauses before the massive gothic edifice
then disappears inside
perched atop the highest balustrade
move sideways to reveal a second crouching figure this one human
to many hell be instantly familiar
hes methos oldest of all immortals gazing down in quiet contemplation
methos keeps staring at the ground below sipping bordeaux from a paper cup even as duncan joins him at the edge
so what brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods
i need your help
im out of the help business
no future in it
i was told connor macleod was killed last night
another one lost
duncan contd i just want to know who did it
sighs in our world does it really matter
it does to me
methos looks down at the clotted life below
did i ever tell you i once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity
glorious the wine
looks up when did you see him last
almost ten years ago
what did you talk about
connor and duncan hunch over the bar pounding scotch
we mostly just sat around downing shots staring at the beer lights above the bar
when he finally got up to go he looked at me like it was the last time id ever see him again
just got up and left
duncan blinks back the memory
duncan contd nobodys seen him since
describe the look
what do you mean
it was like
duncan contd like every death hed ever caused had come back to haunt him
methos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine
for an immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed theres a solution a way to be removed from the game forever
the price is unimaginably high but you are for all practical purposes protected from the violence within yourself
its called the sanctuary
i dont understand
think of those buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their
they placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody
a sanctuary of sorts
beat what im talking about is something similar
but one that doesnt allow for a change of heart
he opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below
wine splatters like blood on white marble
methos contd apparently it was wiped out last night
i dont know
a cruises at feet
he left no witnesses
duncan stares out the passenger window as the flight attendant sets a drink down
he lifts the little plastic cocktail sword from the glass
yanks it out of the olive
a broadsword being jerked from a fallen warrior
follow the sword swinging above a pair of hide booted feet that tramp across uneven ground littered with corpses
feet stop at a blood caked body swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army
on a swift kick to the ribcage duncan macleod jerks upright flailing in spastic fits
he blinks thickly as if routed from a deep disorienting slumber
gapes up at that eclipses the rising sun
youve better things to do than lie there collecting flies
duncan puts a hand to his chest touches the worst of his several lethal wounds
utter confusion stitches his face
silhouette contd i suppose youre wondering how a knock kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day
the figure extends a hand to duncan
duncan hesitantly reaches up
squints are you an angel
ive been called that
duncans hand recoils silhouette contd rest assured im neither
he hoists duncan to his feet
duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of who smiles back with the gift of untold secrets
im connor macleod of the clan macleod
and like you i have a hard time dying
duncans now sitting upright in his seat as the flight attendants voice brings him back to the here and now
well be making our final descent into new york
smack down onto the runway at jfk
pull back and see its his passport held by a us customs officer
he lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case duncans brought with him from the plane
would you open the case please
duncan hands the officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it
inside is an old meticulously cared for japanese katana sword
customs officer studies duncans paperwork smiles
customs officer contd get much use for this
youd be surprised
duncan shuts the case and continues on
next man in line watches duncan exit as he hands over his passport
hang on the photo
well remember those steel gray eyes
duncan watches the passing scenery
music and landmarks familiar from the first highlander sweep past
cab wipes frame leaving duncan standing before the charred husk of connors antique store
windows boarded shreds of flapping police tape the investigators have long since come and gone
door splinters open
duncan steps inside
in the aftermath of the firebombing nothing has been spared
rachel and connors richly cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape
one can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack
duncan climbs the back stairs to the second floor loft which is even worse
ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of connors home
pausing at the far wall duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry revealing deliberately hidden from view
he dips down retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily reinforced door
entering he finds himself in a large circular room surrounded by a staggering display of artifacts drawn from centuries of personal history
were looking at the sum total of connor macleods existance stacked floor to ceiling
duncan moves among the mementos smiles as he lifts them an old scottish coin pocket flask
a faded photo of himself in a world war i uniform
he pauses at a painting of connors wife heather radiant in simple peasant garb smiling serenely across the ages
finally a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity
duncans lunge misses connor by a mile
he stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by sunlight from floor to ceiling windows
duncan and connor face off with duelling swords sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times
several other elegant fencing pairs spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport a far cry from the corpse littered battlefield seen earlier
a little mustachioed puffer darts between the duellists with lint brush pail and towel as connor and duncan re engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries
youve improved greatly
you really think so
connor executes a simple combination that sendsduncans sword flying one way his body the other
im just being gracious
duncan recovers sets his feet
puffer skitters over brushes the dust off duncans coat dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair
duncan swats him away
they take en garde position
connor points his blade
connor contd remember youre only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders
duncan lunges again
misses and hits the deck
connor contd which in your case might not be long at all
he puts his blade to duncans neck
connor contd what we give up to our adversary in defeat duncan
duncan stares up at him uncomprehending
connor contd we call it the quickening our strength our knowledge our life essence it all flows into the victor feeds him makes him stronger in ways you cant possibly
its what drives other immortals to kill us
and what forces us to be better smarter than the rest
he takes duncan by the arm jerks him to his feet
connor contd survival
duncan goes on the attack
what he lacks in technique he makes up for in determination
connor sidesteps duncans next lunge swats his blade flat across duncans ass and sends him plowing face first into the floor
duncan re engages connor in fighting stance
puffer races up behind duncan again meticulously dusts his backside
reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger
whirls around you mind
connor clucks his tongue
connor contd allow me
he squares duncans shoulders and steps back
connor contd unh uh
he steps up and swivels duncan around until hes facing the opposite way
connor contd if you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade
just keep this in mind
he proceeds to take duncan through a move thats dazzling in its inherent simplicity a move that winds up with duncans blade whisking perilously close across connors throat
connor contd its a coup de fin
he catches duncans sword fist in his own holds it immobile
connor contd properly executed even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark
properly executed well never have this talk again
duncan and connors eyes lock
duncan suddenly siezes up with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as the buzz
its the sense of another immortal
he swings around reaches for his katana and steps back through the door swinging it closed as appears at the top of the stairs
she saunters toward him glancing around
she takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to duncan
the ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti beauty
like a post nuclear barbi doll
duncan regards her intrigued and wary
who are you
those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the phone
young woman contd or lover
take your pick
memory jogs with a sudden lurch
cept im faith now
part of the makeover
she runs a playful finger across his chest
funny how the time slips by huh
you wake up one day and ohmigod airplanes
whyre you here
remember our wedding day duncan
she takes him by the hands and leads him into an impromptu dance
faith contd we danced the highland fling
she spins under his arm circles back into his embrace
faith contd i felt like we were flying
her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his
faith contd and that wed never come down
she spins out of his arms again and spin kicks him across the face
blood spatters from his nose and mouth
faith contd of course we did come down
kicks him again crashinq
duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion
they stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide
spitting blood why are you here
isnt it obvious
i wanted to see you again
duncan tenses at his eyes track the sound
its directly below him
three motorcycles hop the curb slice through the open door to the antique store
and spiral up the back stairs
duncans eyes flick upward to a new sound directly above him as vaults the narrow gap between buildings and lands
knobby tires slam onto the rooftop squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop
a jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop
biker suddenly backwheels around blasts through the and disappears inside
follow suit slamming down onto the roof like alien invaders
but its not just the full throttle howl of approaching bikes
its the buzz of approaching immortals
now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft same group we saw outside the monastery
tricked out in everything from keds to chainmail they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands sword baseball bat mace dao and chain whip
the tips make a scraping noise across the floor thats deliberately unsettling
they surround duncan cutting off any avenue of escape
nobody moves or speaks
just the low staccato growl of idling two stroke engines
duncan takes a step backward
looks to faith
pan the faces
carlos from bed stuy bug from kyoto winston from jamaica sarge from shreveport and cracker bob from nowhere in particular
and then theres calvin
a swaggering immortal from the hes traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice
a digital video camera
make it pretty now
its the bottom of the ninth
bikers dismount and converge on duncan swinging their weapons to limber up
duncan backs away
this is unheard of immortals packing like jackals
what its a team sport now
zooming in whole new ballgame
three immortals attack
about three times better
jockeys his camcorder goes in tight on duncan
sup with the new blood huh
whos gonna lay him out
take his secret sauce
swivels around you winston
the tall jamaican stands off to one side watching the lone holdout
calvin contd nope
image lurches and jostles as calvin mixes it up with the combatants
how bout you carlos
you good for it
carlos hurtles through frame
ill catch you later
sparking off chainmail
slamming into walls
and calvin catching it all up close and personal
calvin contd sarge is down
cracker bobs down
but carlos got some kick
still got some kick
carlos crawls to his feet oozing blood and spite
calvin contd like the man says you gotta play with the small hurts
carlos lunges duncan lays him out flat again then swivels around to face who straightens up to his full five foot frame
calvin contd say hello to my man bug and his ugly stick
bug brandishes a simple metal rod with a woven grip
nothing much to speak of
until he squeezes the grip and six blades eject simultaneously
the two on each end are sword blades one for piercing one for slashing
jutting perpendicular to the shaft like an insane swiss army knife are twin sets of daggers two for stabbing and two sawtoothed swordbreakers
and then theres the shaft itself if youre in need of a good old fashioned battering ram
calvin contd like it
came from a tamaric swordsmith
grins who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff
bug opens up a multi pronged barrage on duncan
duncan adapts to the first assault only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves
calvin contd uhp say welcome back to carlos
carlos cuts in yet again swinging for the stands
he fans several times before duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor
duncan spins back to bug as the wiry asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins
but this time as he squeezes the release mechanism duncan kicks it shoving it flush against bugs chest
two pivoting daggers slice into the dumbstruck immortal
he falls backward wailing like a stuck pig
a booming voice freezes everyone in their tracks
all eyes converge on who stands at a distance cloaked in murky halflight
im sorry duncan
when it comes to discipline the first hundred years are the hardest
duncan lowers his katana turns to the stranger as painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly bulldozes duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows
duncans launched airborne in a plume of shattered glass still clutching his katana
carlos hooks an arm around the empty window frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body spikes onto an upright iron rod jutting from the construction site below
what was that
squinting full gainer with a quarter twist
degree of difficulty not very
i thought i told you to stop
stranger contd are you challenging my authority
carlos does his best to ignore him
stranger contd because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me
turns away hey hey take it easy man
stranger contd is that clear
in the split second it takes carlos to turn back from the window the stranger is right there in his face
stranger takes carlos sword and yanks it uo to his own neck
stranger contd heres your chance
carlos stares wide eyed
pride wont let him back down
fear wont let him proceed
stranger contd take it
you wont have another
we can feel the sudden hammering of carlos heart
youre crazy man
then go ahead
rubs his neck across the blade stop the madness
hey or walk away
in perpetual fear of your own shadow
beat tell me carlos
can you live with that
can you live with the fear
can you live with the weakness
stranger contd weakness carlos
isnt that why youre here with me
isnt that why youre all here with me
face it youre nothing but
blood pounds in carlos eyes
he yanks back the sword cries out and slashes for the strangers neck
as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to carlos own throat wedging it up tight under his chin
stranger contd god loves you
in one vicious up slice stranger cuts through bone and sinew stopping just short of a clean sever
carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest
stranger contd whispers they say the worst part carlos is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body
he sends carlos head tumbling to the floor
stranger contd of course its pure speculation since nobody ever lives to tell about it
staring in pure unknowable horror at his own body twitching several yards away
a tiny arc of electrical essence crackles from the neck
bear mute witness to the glowing tendrils of energy that stutter across the walls and ceiling
duncan lies impaled on a jutting shaft of re bar as an unmarked panel van screeches into frame
his eyes stare sightless upward as explode with unearthly howls of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete
shockwaves strafe the walls blowing out mortar and brick
power lines snap and lash against the building spitting fiery plumes of sparks
seen from behind the stranger absorbs the quickening in a series of wild electro shock convulsions
several darkly clad men jump from the panel van and race up to duncan
with pit crew efficiency one takes a mondo set of bolt cutters to the metal stake while the others grab duncan by the arms and ankles
a fourth throws open the cargo door
they toss duncan in the back of the van
arms outstretched and rigid head thrown back in silent rapture the stranger rises slowly off the floor suspended christ like in the air
blinding haloes of pure radiant essence engulf him a lifeforce beyond human understanding
theyve seen it all before but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them
which becomes a harsh blast of light
flutter open squint at the glare
hes strapped to the same giger like chair immobilized
standing around him are hooded members of that same monk like order in what is essentially a dungeon
one of them matthew steps forward
his steel gray eyes are familiar
hes the one who followed duncan through customs
as he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel he reveals a distinctive tattoo across his inner forearm
one that duncan instantly recognizes
matthew simply nods
they dont interfere
and we were more than happy to perform our traditional function
believe me its a whole lot easier charting the history of immortals than it is running a day care center for them
unfortunately our role has changed somewhat
because the rules have been broken
not by me
youre not the one were worried about
matthew moves to the other side of the chair
pegs the arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings
matthew contd one of your kind has gone renegade
in doing so hes gained himself a sizeable advantage
one that will be impossible to overcome
hes surrounded himself with immortals loyal only to him
he uses holy ground as a safe haven
and every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone each quickening hundreds upon hundreds taken by just one man
he is unbeatable
matthew pours a scotch
holds it to duncans lips like the final offering to a condemned man
matthew contd worse still far worse is that hes become a perversion to the game
and if he prevails that perversion will resonate through everything we know
in ways we cant possibly comprehend
duncan tugs at his bonds
knows whats in store for him
matthew contd there must always be two of your kind
as long as there are two and theyre kept from fighting the prize is safe
the sanctuary must continue
get yourself another volunteer
we had a number of volunteers
sadly thats no longer the case
another watcher steps up and forces an iron face shackle down over duncans head
matthew contd youll be warehoused
so the prize can remain safe
duncan struggles frantically against his bonds
for the world duncan
we do this for the world
the watcher takes two large bolts and begins to screw the mask directly into duncans skull
blackness accompanied by bright searing flashes of matthews voice contd dont worry
the drugs should kick in momentarily
all external sound is slowly drowned out by the pounding in his own brain
a pounding interspersed with jarring synaptic flashes of battle
the recycling nightmare finally recedes back into then a new sound
grind of metal on bone
bolts being unscrewed
iron plate lifts from his eyes flood of light
once again duncan squints up at a face
this time the blurred swimming features of a familiar irish american mug
joe dawson familiar to many as duncans one friend inside the watchers smiles back
you look like shit
week maybe longer
we cant talk here
unstraps duncan we gotta go
dawson reacts to the sound of approaching footsteps
dawson contd urgently now
can you walk
he takes one step and pitches forward onto his face
duncan contd potent whiskey
he clambers to his feet and follows dawson out of the chamber
dawson and duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory an overgrown cold war relic recently co opted by the watchers
they duck some scurrying guards plow through thick underbrush to and climb inside
you knew about the sanctuary
just because im a watcher doesnt mean im always in the loop
i dont buy that
dawson averts his gaze
i really struggled with it yknow the idea of keeping guys on ice like that
but i couldnt argue with the logic
least not til they went after you
squeals hard onto the main drag guess that put it a little too close to home
i owe you
dawson slides duncans katana out from under the seat
hands it over
do me a favor buddy
live to pay me back
what happened to the bodies
dawson winces slightly
duncan contd cmon joe
listen i got you outta one jam
dont push your luck
i need to see them
was one of them connor macleod
let me see the bodies
the heads are gone
you really dont wanna go there
i have to joe
i have to know
dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop
alright if i tell you thats it im outta here
youre on your own
i cant be a part of this ok
dawson stares at duncan
a beat then fuck
im a part of it
he throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road
of a forlorn and forgotten cemetery
nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire
it was a christian burial
they said all the right words
i cant begin to tell you how reassuring that is
dawson pulls over
he and duncan get out of the car
needless to say with a dozen unexplainable corpses they had to go a bit off the beaten track
from here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble
duncan and dawson tramp up the shallow incline
dawson contd what do you think youre gonna find when you get up there
i dont know
im not digging
get that through your skull right now
not these hands
twelve freshly mounded graves come into view gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds each set off by a simple wooden cross
duncan stops when he reaches the first grave
duncan remains frozen staring seemingly at nothing
dawson contd my dog used to do that with locked closets
i hate that
nothing but the soft moan of wind
duncan contd hes here
tell me im not here for a seance
feels the buzz
slight but unmistakable
a row of stunted oaks thick and gnarled againt the setting sun
standing against the trunk silhouette on silhouette is the ghostly form of a man
barely discernible his features are hidden in shadow
duncan slowly approaches the figure
dawson hangs back nervous and slightly twitchy
the figure steps up to greet duncan
sunlight brightens the face of who smiles as he embraces duncan in the traditional bear crush of scottish clansmen
sorry i missed your funeral
all told it was a bit underwhelming
so it would seem
the brief joy suddenly drains from connors face his eyes speak of diffuse faraway suffering
why are you here
ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab
connors expression hardens
you need to know something
he steps up to duncan locks eyes
connor contd every life i touch ends
and for no reason
its a curse thats followed me for centuries
i cant outrun it and i cant outlive it
beat youre my last friend in this world duncan
i left for your own good
it was better that you didnt know where
but you escaped
no i didnt escape
flash back to the sanctuary as the stranger moves toward a shackled connor macleod
i was freed
as before the immobilized connor stirs in a drug addled haze
who are you
youll know soon enough
all connor can see is the strangers hand as it reaches down and pulls the pin from one of connors arm shackles
the cuff falls open
stranger turns away
a beat later come the unmistakable sounds of slaughter that fill the room to a deafening crescendo
i couldnt see the slaughter
i only heard it
we can still see the agony playing out in connors eyes
he turns away sees still standing on the ridge swatting at the occasional deerfly
the reason i didnt become your replacement
dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down
whats he doing now
sand in the shoe would be my guess
connor suddenly gazes beyond dawson to and the faint sound of approaching motorcycles
you were followed
one by one a half dozen motorcyclists crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop
i was meaning to tell you about those guys
dawson fumbles to put his leg back on
hops a full as he watches the intruders surround them
approach on foot following the same path duncan and dawson took
one is faith
the other the stranger
except hes no stranger to connor macleod
far from it
connor goes rigid
his nightmares finally taken human form
move in for our first clear look at striding forward bigger than death
his is a face hewn by gods sharpest blade every angle cold remorseless puritannical
as before hes clad in basic black accented by the stark white of a priests collar
ice jacob kase
connor edges back his coat
hand seeks out the grip of his sword
duncan grabs his arm
walk away duncan
kase and faith continue toward them
connors rage seems to ratchet up with every step
youre on holy ground
remember the rules
pure radiating hate seethes in connors eyes
the rules be damned
kase stops inches from connors face
cooly regards the sword
look at you
youd think after half a millenium youd learn to keep that youd learn to keep that temper of yours in check
gone is any trace of brogue
hes a fully assimilated new yorker now
connors fingers tighten around the swordgrip
just tell me where kase
if all i wanted was to kill you youd have been dead a very long time ago connor
something roils under kases controlled exterior
a rage every bit as consuming as connors
kase contd but your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered
flash to several of glenfinnans villagers being mowed down by connors mindless fury
kase contd it couldnt even begin to appease mine
flash to kase as he drops to his knees gagging blood run through by connors blade
kase contd worst of all you murdered a man of god
who raised me as his son
flash to a father rainey as connor brings his sword cleaving down on him
kase contd and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that
scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons leading up to the corpse of jacob kase
kase contd what you never could have expected was that youd leave behind this one humble servant
kases body lies there as cold as the highland dawn
kase contd who would trade eternity itself to make you pay
and were once again transported back to kase steps closer revelling in this moment
look back over the endless travesties of your life and youll see me
always there waiting in the shadows
beat when friends and lovers are wiped from your sight im there
kase contd when those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason im there
kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave and when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell
shrugs guess who
he walks a full circle around connor
all the while kase addresses connor faith never takes her eyes off duncan
kase contd but if you think it ends here my ancient friend youre wrong
kase turns back to faith
pulls his sword and without warning slices it across her throat
faith reflexively gasps stumbles backward leaving dangling on kases swordtip
as he swings it around and offers it up to connor
thought you might be wanting this
i kept it for you
flash to connors mother bound to the stake as kase rips the crucifix from her neck
connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm
kase contd for old times sake
kase puts an arm around faith
kase contd want to find me again connor
just put your hands together
kase contd winks and pray
he gives faith a little shove and they both start downhill
gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust
connor makes no move to follow
strangely silent and impassive hes like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword
duncan puts a hand on his shoulder
whatever it is
connor swipes away duncans hand starts walking
duncan contd i can help you connor
connor stops swivels back
nobody can help me
he walks off alone a ghost against a sea of gravestones duncan watches his friend depart helpless
turning back he sees stopped halfway down the hill
they seem to be arguing
kase turns abruptly and strides off
she stands there a moment sullenly rubbing her throat
duncans voice spins her back around
i get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me
dry goes a long way back
their eyes fix on one another
buzzes with electricity
just one question
after all these years
re kase why him
faith glances down at kase who stands waiting at the base of the hill
because ive never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate
beat except me
on that she brushes past duncan and rejoins kase
duncan and connor ride side by side on horseback
they reach a where a young woman and her elderly consort are detained at a crude wooden toll gate
eight or nine disreputable looking highwaymen surround their carriage
connor rides up to what would appear to be the leader
he has the most teeth
whats going on
the lady here refuses to pay her toll
toll for what
passage over the bridge
connor cranes his eyes upriver and down
i see no bridge
what do you think pays for the bridge
connor considers then turns back to the lady with a shrug
the man has a point
despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty we now recognize the young woman as faith from an earlier era
her original name is catherine mary devaney
these men are liars and scoundrels
theyve preyed upon us three years running
a good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment sir
exactly what may i ask have you accomplished so far
proudly the tollgate
duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside connor
he leans over to the highwayman
excuse me but by whose authority do you act
holds up scroll by deed of the king
might i see that
highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll
the nearly illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate
duncan contd does the king always sign his name with an x
highwaymans cronies reach for their swords
he was in a hurry
all eyes hover on duncans reaction
two of the highwaymen edge around behind catherine and her elderly consort ready to gut them both at a moments notice
duncan tracks them with his eyes
nods busy man the king
to catherine i suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way
his deed is a fake
thats a matter of opinion
you sir are no better than they
thats also a matter of opinion
to connor shall we
connor sizes up his young protege
gives a dubious nod
you cant just leave
he tosses a handful of gold coins to the highwayman
duncan contd good luck with the bridge
he kicks his horse into a brisk trot
connor reluctantly follows suit
they cross the river through ankle deep water
i cant believe you gave those bastards your money
it wasnt my money
duncan pulls a cinched canvas bag overstuffed with coins from his overcoat
duncan contd it was theirs
rack focus to the duped highwaymen scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit
they hit the river at a gallop kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water
duncan contd by the time they reach us the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harms way
the pursuers close the gap in seconds
connor grins approvingly
draws his sword and glances over at duncan
duncan flicks his own sword lets the hilt auto rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical
he nods back at connor
together they whirl around to face the onrushing horde
in the middle of the shallow river
nine maniacal thieves against two sporting immortals
the spray of water the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo
duncans improved since ravenna
he easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood crazed leader
this time its connor who finds himself in trouble
he tumbles from his horse and goes down losing his sword in the river
suddenly winds back and flings his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger
whistles past the dumbstruck highwaymans head
which was not the intended target
as we discover when we follow its end over end flight
straight into connors outstretched hand
connor parries his attackers drives them backward onto their asses then swivels around and tosses the sword back to who catches it ducks the highwaymans next swing and swiftly sends
recovers his own sword which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full on stumbling retreat
they both stand watching as jostles safely across the river
as she looks back at duncan
she gives duncan a knowing smile thats as innocent as it is seductive
watching duncan you know that stirring in your gut
its not just simple lust my friend
ah but do you really
as she and kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible
joe dawson walks up to duncan
i feel like i stepped in on the wrong party
duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise
quietly lets go
we recognize this place
its where connor and duncan shared a last drink together
duncan and joe dawson now hunch over that same bar staring into their drinks
i swear the mans a walking ghost
feet pound pavement
whatever it is hes carrying around inside him its like hes dead already
glare of streetlights rake across connors face his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight
connor bumps shoulders with a passing pedestrian
eyy man watch it
he continues on oblivious
duncan turns to dawson
there are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity
they cant be changed
and they cant be undone
you carry these things to the grave joe in the hopes that maybe just maybe youll find some peace there
some relief even if its oblivion
hollow smile but immortals dont die
we just go on reliving our sins
over and over again
lifts his eyes to the light
stands before him in a bed of crawling mist
it seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it
duncan downs the last of his drink shoves off from the bar
dawson glances warily up at him
there were two places i figured connor was likely to go
one of em was here
and the other
youre the watcher
you tell me
connor climbs the steps presses through the heavy wooden doors
and prowls slowly through the dimly lit interior
icon shadows loom large and menacing
he moves along the stations of the cross
hes stalking through the nave
barging into the sacristy
dawsons car screams past with a doppler howl
its an old abandoned church just off canal
dawsons behind the wheel gunning through narrow back streets
perfect safe haven for a so called priest huh
our lady of sorrows
dry kinda has a nice ring to it
he fishtails around the next corner
dawson contd ill tell ya this if hes going after kase hes in for a rude awakening
the mans untouchable
so they tell me
connor stops before the darkened altar senses buzzing
arms lift in the darkness
jacob kase steps down off the cross lingers in shadow
i would grant you absolution
if i were a better man
he turns and disappears out the back
right past scattered throughout the pews who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow
the tall jamaican leans over to faith
you know were next dont you
faith lowers the book shes reading the holy bible
our days are numbered
you can see it in kases eyes
do you believe in a hereafter winston
all i know is i wont be hereafter jacob kase gets through with me
and thats all i care about right now
faith leans back against the hardback pew closes her eyes
kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds then turns back to connor
connor draws his sword moves on kase
the ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger
it defiled their sense of purpose
draws his own sword of course theyre also somewhat extinct
he steps fearlessly up to connor places his neck against connors swordblade
just like he did with a certain late immortal named carlos
he opens his fingers and lets the sword drop
it clatters useless to the ground
would you slaughter an unarmed man of god again connor
would that finally put your soul to rest
low taunting then go ahead
send me home
blood pounds with the rage pulsing through connors veins
kase contd whats stopping you
the nagging sense that maybe you more than i deserve to die
dawsons car pulls up in the background
duncan jumps out
kase contd or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve
connors sword digs into kases neck
approaching dont do it connor
gritted keep back
to duncan you heard him
no immortal can interfere with anothers duel
hes playing you
step back onto holy ground before its too late kase faces back to connor
go ahead what better chance than now
take your shot
dont listen to him
for your sweet mother
caiolin burns at the stake
suddenly startled kase contd your huguenot bitch in navarre
rears back throws suddenly startled the horse bearing a french duchess her to the ground breaking her neck
kase contd brenda wyatt
brenda wyatt highlander is seen walking in central park
a hit and run driver mows her down from behind
kase contd rachel ellenstein
rachel is blown apart in the antique store she shared with connor
kase contd tell me do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village
blade trembles in connors hands
kase presses his neck even harder against connors blade
blood trickles down his neck
kase contd so close
duncan stands by helpless to intervene
kase contd look at you
even now youre afraid youll lose
thats your true fear isnt it
whispers low seductive oh its not the dying my friend
i know that
that would be a blessing
its the thought of giving up your essence to me
making me even stronger by it
one look in connors eyes and you know hes right
kase contd whats wrong
almost a purr dont you want to be inside me
connor slowly lowers his sword
and flicks kases discarded sword back up into his hands
kase simply smiles and takes position
duncan can only look on helplessly as kase takes the first offensive driving connor backward with dazzling almost casual swordplay
ive taken more heads than you can possibly imagine
his sword whistles across connors face opens a three inch gash over his eye
kase contd do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings
connor stumbles backward again blinded by his own dripping blood
knows beyond a shadow of a doubt hes doomed
duncan knows it too
and its killing him to watch
still connor wont go down easy
he manages a brief offensive walking kase backward on his toes
kase puts one hand behind his back fencing style and goes to work on connors torso crosshatching him in blood
connor lunges wildly
kase parries effortlessly
kase now opens up a blinding barrage on connor
its like duelling against lightning so quick and unpredictable are kases strikes
constantly off balance connor still manages to nick kase in the cheek
kase contd touches scratch id almost forgotten what that felt like
he now turns it on full
drives connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip
his eyes go impossibly cold
i want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead
and know that every time you close your eyes from now to eternity ill be there
beat ripping apart the ones you care about most
he removes his sword and steps back
kase contd its not over connor macleod
it will never never be over
he turns and walks back toward the church
duncan does not step aside to let him pass their shoulders bump
kase contd you on the other hand are on borrowed time
he continues on past the other immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle
one by one they turn and file back into the church behind kase
connor stares into duncans eyes as if wanting to say something
instead he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot
feeling the presence of another immortal duncan slowly looks over at who stands at a distance
as their eyes meet she too turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness
crashes down onto a wooden table
he takes the table cloth with him as he tumbles head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage
miraculously unless youre an irishman he spills not one drop of precious guinness which he hoists in a cheery salute to who sit laughing in the eye of an irish
duncan macleod and catherine mary kate devaney aka faith are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness
things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing
lets have at it
they kiss to a chorus of boos
so this time they really kiss
crowd goes wild
revelers dance and fight with equal abandon making it almost impossible to tell the difference
but they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial
spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter
happy is the bride that sees the sun
sorry the corpse that sees the rain
framed in a perfect beam of sunlight streaming through an open window
kate who smiles back with her own inner radiance
bedecked in flowers her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin
she leans over raucous cheers and kisses duncan provoking a new riot of and upraised glasses
resplendent in their celtic kilts launch into the highland fling
kate is instantly yanked up onto her feet and into a rousing jig
before duncan can protest hes hoisted from his seat and flung onto the dance floor
duncan and kate link arms goaded on by a circle of shouting stumbling clappers
with each new upshift in tempo they spin faster and faster until theyre hanging on for dear life
gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo
but for duncan its not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion
its the buzz of another immortal
he spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on who enters the room on a wave of silence
duncan breaks away from kate crosses over to connor and wraps him in a bear hug
i was beginning to wonder
i was on a junk in the south china sea when i got your notice
kate spins by on the arm of a new partner
youre next connor macleod
that better be no idle threat
duncan watches kate with a rapturous smile
well i finally did it
so it would appear
what do you think of her
you know thats not an easy answer
the edge in his voice is not lost on duncan
connor contd outside
connor stands with duncan at the railing staring out into the encroaching night
you know shes like us
i sensed it the day we met her
so you know that like us her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death
duncan looks off as if purging the thought from his head
connor contd its what makes warriors of us all duncan
good or bad there seems a purpose to it
and without such a death shell simply grow old and die like any other
is that what you dragged me out here to tell me
connor removes a uniquely braided golden rope from his vest pocket
it catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips
many years after i was married i came home to find heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen with a knife in one hand
and her hair in the other
heather early forties her hair shorn to the scalp
she looks up at connor with red rimmed eyes and a bitter smile
connor contd at first i was scared
scared that shed gone mad
and then angry as if shed somehow meant to hurt me by it
connor contd when i asked her why shed done such a thing to herself her answer cut me to the quick
she said it was the one part of her that would not age
it would forever remain the same as when i first fell in love with her
connor burying heather in a simple grave overlooking their home
tears streak his face
he sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish
connor contd and thats how she wanted me to remember her
connor closes his fingers around the braid
connor contd its all i have now
i love kate
ill hold on to her as long as i can
thats all i can do
kate can be seen through the window behind them exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon
if thats your intent so be it
duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch
takes to the ground in long angry strides
conner walks double time to catch up with him
why are you telling me this
because i once loved a woman more than life itself
and i watched her die
unlike you i had no other choice
and i have a choice
what would you have me tell her
id tell her nothing
she wouldnt believe you
they never do when it involves themselves
then i can do nothing
shes in the flower of her youth
enjoy the moment and let it pass
if you think you can
duncan suddenly grabs connors shoulder spins him around
youd have me kill her
is that it
is that what you came all this way to tell me on my wedding night
id have you do what your heart and our conscience demand
searches his eyes
and if it were you in my place
then shakes his head
i thank god i never had the choice
he listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising wind
connor contd tell catherine im sorry i couldnt stay longer
he clasps duncan by the forearm
then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party
duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau stark hotel room somewhere in the bowels of manhattan
a half empty bottle of glenmorangie is there for company
the door creaks open casting a single ribbon of light across the room
it widens to reveal the silhouette of a woman
duncan closes his eyes
she pads silently inside
pulls the door closed
duncan remains still breathing heavily
the woman steals slowly up to the bedside
pauses as if quietly studying duncan then swings her leg up and straddles him
even in the murky halflight he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair
she says nothing her expression lost under a veil of darkness
only her rapid breathing betrays her tension
instead she suddenly leans forward and kisses him
duncan responds in kind
as if powerless to do anything else
lightning stitches the sky outside as they embrace
bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the storm raging outside
angry sheets of rain rake the countryside as duncan slogs imlessly through calf deep mud
still in his wedding arb hes thoroughly drenched as if hes been wandering this way for hours
the last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale
only kate remains upright her face etched with sober dread as appears in the doorway rivulets of water pouring off his shoulders and brow
for a while they just stare at one another each lost to his own sense of foreboding
kate is the first to speak
despite her stoic veneer her voice comes out small and terrified
if this is wrong duncan tell me now
saying nothing duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own
candles flicker in the storm fed drafts that whistle through closed windows
kate lays duncans rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns regarding him naked for the very first time
duncan reaches out to touch her
gently as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise
then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh cut wildflowers
clasp fingers dig into skin
whatever refinements kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned
she arches up under duncan puts her lips to his ear
ill love you forever
on an ominous thunderclap were back in the present
little has changed but the sheets
and the fury of their lovemaking
each new thundercrack highlights a different aspect of their hunger their wet glistening bodies strobing faster and faster until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or
stutter inside the lightning coursing over cream colored breasts and a simple pewter cross
similar in shape and color that shift from painted to plain
that toggle between neo goth black and natural pink
throws back her head biting back the shudders of release
and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh
a shadow darkens kate as she sleeps
it lingers there deadly still
stands over her gripped by indecision
the fateful choice tears at him even as he holds a dagger over her gently rising chest
his hand trembles
softly forgive me
snap open as the dagger plunges into her heart
for an instant their eves meet
and in that single shattering moment duncan knows he chose wrong
its not just terror that passes through kates eyes
its the incomprehensible pain of betrayal
kate gasps once jerks and settles
lies there dead blood pooling across her nightgown
duncan stares down at her body numb
on that look we transition back to the pain imprints on duncan as if hes still clutching the knife
whatever passion stirred faith moments before is gone without a trace
her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead kate
you had no right
i was doing it for you
kate convulses back to life eyes wild insane
duncan reaches out to her which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium
she swats at him punching flailing
now youre an immortal
it was the only way
words fall on deaf ears
she wrenches out of his grip
stumbles for the door drenched in her own blood
leaves duncan standing mindblown in her wake
kate flees through wet empty streets barefoot nightgown ripped and bloody face contorted like a madwoman
breath comes in ragged whimpering gasps
she trips falls
comes up running
faith climbs off the bed throws on duncans shirt whirls back tears streaking her face like warpaint
you wanted this
i never asked for eternity
you forced it on me
screams would you have really understood
the part about never having children
or the endless numbing sameness of it all
bitter laugh or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize youre nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by
so fast they dont even count anymore
she wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons
duncan remains silent taking it all in
faith contd heres the kicker duncan
i came here for one reason and one reason only
to see if i could feel again
she walks out leaving the door hanging wide in her wake
faith reaches for the stairwell door as duncans arm lances out holding it shut
leaning in im watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago
and theres nothing i can do to stop it
because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back
faith struggles to open the door
duncan holds firm
duncan contd but im lucky
you know why
im lucky because my crime can still be forgiven
as long as youre still alive theres at least the chance
it could take years
it may never happen
faith is now pushing furiously on the door
duncan contd but at least i can still carry the hope inside me
thats one blessing of immortality
theres always tomorrow
he lets go of the door and steps back
duncan contd even for you
faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell
connor macleod stands on a rooftop sword in hand face upturned to the bitter heavens
stinging wind and rain slash at his face
he doesnt even blink
seen through a camcorder viewfinder our roving pov wends its way past a couple fixing junkies up to a where winston hunkers over his bike making repairs
kases church looms in the background like a veiled threat
shut that thing off
screen blacks out as winston slams his hand over the lens ending camcorder pov
calvin sets it down
you dont g z out
you saw what he did to carlos
hes genghis the fucking hun man
you live his way or you die your way
be grateful you got the choice
winston looks off
we could take him
say how much you value your life
forty three guineas
saw the bill of sale myself
kingston jamaica august th
sorry there cinque but i got a bigger price goin on this unit
i watched connor macleod stand up to kase tonight
got me thinking
that maybe my soul wasnt part of the deal after all
calvin considers his point
you really think we can take him
the man cant stop a bullet
i know that much
but i need your help
yeah and who takes his head huh
gets that bucket fulla lucky charms
you mr cool
beat whos gonna be master then
and that little glowing record light
as he reaches the crest of the cemetery ridge
he sags against a solitary windswept oak slides down until hes sitting cross legged at the base of the tree
eyes wide unblinking
stand those twelve dead immortals from the sanctuary directly over their burial plots
their heads are missing
looks on impassively
even as now stipple the barren landscape
all headless in period dress spanning untold centuries
the forgotten casualties of an endless impossible war
connor nods solemnly
the specters are gone
day becomes night becomes day
and still he sits there unmoved as if ready to embrace the rest of eternity from this one desolate spot
connor remains sitting against the tree as slices over him
he slowly tilts his gaze upward
theres supposed to be an end to all this right
a final answer
duncan slides down next to him
gazes out at the trackless ocean
isnt that the prize were all butchering each other to win
i already know the answer
the prize the real prize is just to close your eyes and see nothing
i dont believe that
you think the game is still about good against evil
a better world
who among us really deserves to win
not jacob kase
and whos going to stop him
there has to be a way
connor looks off
oh theres a way kinsman
theres a way
but i dont believe you have the guts to take it
connor stands up
offers a hand to duncan
hauls him upright
duncan barely catches connors blade with his own
whatre you doing
dont you know
the better of us will take the others gift
pray itll be enough
duncan lowers his blade
i wont do it
then youll die
again connor strikes
again duncan barely escapes with his head
and settles into a fighting stance
it cant end like this
it already has
he swings for duncans neck
steel rings against steel
clansman against clansman
faith sits in a center pew head bowed deep in thought
hard to tell with somebody like faith
kase sits down beside her
you were with him
he curls his nose as if he can still smell the sin
kase contd woman is a temple built upon a sewer
glad i can help you feel a bit better about yourself there jacob
remember what you were when i first found you
a liberated woman
kase runs a delicate finger across her neck
be grateful i dont this minute remove your pretty little heafod
looks up cold holy ground lover
its a bitch aint it
two figures dot the faraway ridge as the savage music of their swordplay peals out across the barren countryside
we watch these timeless warriors exchange strikes that would drive lesser men into the ground
each gifted in his own way neither gaining full advantage over the other
they both gradually succumb to exhaustion
connor and duncan finally lower their swords panting and spent
hollow rasp enough
barely audible enough
and thats as much as either can say as they suck back great gulping lungfulls of air
a little color finally returns to duncans cheeks
he mops his face with his sleeve
next time i wont hold back
dragging his sword like a half ton barbell duncan turns and makes his way back toward the resting tree
closes his eyes and hoists his sword
connor whispered remember well old friend
feels more than sees the oncoming blade
he turns into the arc of connors swing he reacts on pure instinct sword lifting body pivoting with the driving force of connors thrust
as it grazes duncans side
swings up with the same vicious thrust catches connor under the chin
connor doesnt flinch
time suspends the instant before blade meets flesh
the game is not about survival duncan
its about living
in the end its all that matters
duncan cries out as he follows through blood staining his blade with the crushing reality of what he has just committed
he sinks to his knees
and screams to the heavens
the heavens answer back with thunder lightning and gale force winds that seem to come from everywhere at once
howls out of connors body
it surges upward into endless sheets of lightning
duncan convulses at the epicenter of a growing clash between earth and sky
shockwaves pound through his skull triggering walking with heather across an open field
he turns and looks back at duncan
shine with a look of ultimate peace and transcendence
he seems to be gazing straight into duncans soul
and smiling at what he sees as rips through duncans brain
duncan stands alone on the rooftop stripped to the waist moving slowly through an elaborate kata
the precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him
he windmills the katana over his head faster and faster until he suddenly releases it pinwheels through the night sky arcing out across the open space between buildings
duncan watches its long lofting trajectory
then takes off running
he reaches the edge of the rooftop and leaps
legs cycling through empty air he traces a matching arc directly under the far flung sword
like a long jumper stretching for that last inch of sand duncan hyper extends for the next rooftop
hits the edge digs in pivots and sets
thrusts upward as the sword grip slaps into his open palm
fingers wrap around the ivory hilt slowly lowering it down to eye level
and see a new duncan macleod
a man cooly aware of his own destiny
dawsons car pulls up to the generic cinderblock building that now stands unguarded and abandoned
dawson enters squints into the darkness
the interior looks as if its stood fallow for the last three decades
no giger chair no gothic restraints
no evidence the watchers ever took up temporary residence here
except for matthew who emerges from the stale halflight to confront dawson
im a bit surprised to see you again
all things considered
dawson just stands there hands plunged inside his coat pockets
matthew contd as you can see we had to move on
find a new sanctuary
what youre doing
ah but theyre not human really
gimme a reason matthew
its for the good of us all
you know that
gimme a reason
matthew cocks his head like the rca dog
because we must
its that simple
and if you get in our way again there will be very serious consequences
gimme a good reason
matthew pulls a gun
aims it at dawsons heart
im sorry to have to do this joe
he pulls the trigger
as two slugs pound into his chest
matthew topples backward dead
dawson palms the gun still concealed in his coat pocket
kase is roaring through narrow streets in a low slung convertible faith at his side
with utter disregard for speed or care he guns it madly in shrieking turns
faith grips the dashboard two handed
adrenalins good for the sex drive
im not amused jacob
she reaches over and slaps on her shoulder harness
thought maybe you needed a little more excitement
you know spice up our relationship a bit
he oversteers caroms off several parked cars recovers
kase contd i mean isnt that why you went back to duncan macleod
i dont know what youre trying to prove
kase puts an arm around her shoulder
why do i have to prove anything to you
as his foot flattens the accelerator
kase contd i can have anything i want already
and that bugs the shit out of you doesnt it
its clear hell never make it hes going too fast
kase only smiles
releasing the wheel he stands in his seat lifts his arms above his head and shouts in exultation as the car explodes into the wall
its all over in a breath
accordioned metal drooling radiator and faith slumped over the dash
kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement thrown some distance from the wreckage
hes clearly taken the worst of the impact
stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic
she reaches back and pulls kases sword free of the wreckage
with single minded determination she limps over to kases body face up in his own pooling blood
a disbelieving pedestrian pauses in shock
faith gives her a twisted smile
dont mind us
pedestrian scurries off as faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it whistling down across kases neck
with inhuman reflexes kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat
does this mean its over
kase steps up to the back entrance alone
the door hangs slightly ajar which clearly disturbs him
kase enters the main room to find calvin and sarge asleep on their pews
he kicks the first pew awakens both with a start
who left the back door open
kase looks to sarge
wheres cracker bob
he was supposed to be watching the back
calvin and sarge both shrug
kase contd sotto infants
he whirls stalks out
kase enters his dark cluttered office slamming the door behind him
and stops cold
juts from a small wooden table
right through cracker bob who lies skewered to the tabletop
is caiolin macleods unique silver and wood crucifix
the message is not lost on kase
suddenly flutter open
first thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest
ah ahhh ahhhhhhh
he reaches forward and jerks the sword out of bob and with it impaled on the blade
it bears just one word scrawled in bobs plentiful blood
bob sits up on the table wild eyed as kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers
glitter lights and milling tourists
row upon row of gimmicky italian restaurants
jacob kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux roman ruins babbling fountains and plastic holly
it all imparts a whiff of last supper pomp to the proceeding
which is not lost on the other immortals who glance around warily while eating as suspicious of each other as they are of kase
nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room
he stares into his pasta beading sweat
his fingers curl around the cold steel of a
special wedged between his knees
he inches the gun upward toward the table rim as
kase suddenly stands up in the center
all heads turn
gun freezes in winstons lap just hidden from view
kase contd i see tonight as a celebration of the spirit
raises his glass heres to all of you who continue to stand by me
smiles at winston even those who might waver at times
winston stiffens fears that kase is on to him
and when calvin averts his gaze he knows
still he raises his glass
as do the others
kase contd you are my flock
you nourish my soul
its now or never for winston
his moment of truth
kases eyes slowly drift over to meet his
kase tips back his glass and drinks eyes locked on winston
winston responds in kind gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket
he shoves off from the table
where you going
im not through with my toast yet
he angles for the door
im almost finished
winston reaches for the doorknob
he swivels back
sees death in jacob kases eyes
kase contd itll all be over in a few more seconds
a cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them
as kase continues
kase contd youve all been a part of a great quest
a four hundred year quest for justice
he lifts up an exquisitely crafted sword
kase contd and here my friends is the instrument of that justice
its called the colichmarde
finest sword known to man
the blade whistles upright
kase contd blessed by popes and baptized in blood
i only break it out for special occasions
he kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons
kase contd it sings like an angel
winston jerks for his gun
in a sudden blur of steel and blood kase beheads winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency
tongues of liquid energy coil up and around kases body
but he keeps right on coming
the others scatter like roaches
essence pulses off walls and ceiling shattering statuary hurling furniture
before merging with the walking inferno that is now jacob kase
his sword blazes through the remaining victims trailing streaks of blue fire
one after another they drop headless to the concrete triggering slams into kase front on
his knees buckle
hits him broadside buffeting him one way as pounds him from the opposite side rocking him back center and immobilizing him inside an omni directional crush of light and sound
that whites out the frame
a thick clinging fog enshrouds the rocky highlands
somewhere along the invisible coastline below a foghorn moans
the skeletal remains of an ancient gaelic castle loom spectral gray above who stands before an ancient celtic monolith familiar from glenfinnans town square revelling in the changeless land of
calling out where else could stir the blood of a scotsman too long of this earth and too far from home
kase picks his way across the uneven ground unable to see beyond the reach of his own arm
kase contd filling his lungs i can nae get enough of it
he draws his sword extends it outward until the tip disappears from sight
a low scraping of metal on stone taunts him from somewhere out there in the slow drifting whiteness kases sword twitches toward the sound
just the faintest outline of a figure coalesces briefly inside the fog
ah whats this
the figure melts back into silent nothingness
kase contd im afraid even the cloak of fog wont help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage
spins him around to see looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping
kase masks a slight tinge of concern
kase contd its always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause
but i hope you havent sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush
once again the figure steps backward into the enveloping fog
slightly unnerved kase jerks around
no sign of anyone
just that infernal mist
a soft scraping of sword against rock swivels him back around to his original position
his nerves are starting to shred
he turns several full rotations craning for a glimpse of his tormentors
and then he sees it
kase lunges for it
and this time it doesnt retreat
swords clang in thunderous overture as battle for position on tenuous footing
kase drives his adversary backward into a blunted stone wall leaving him no avenue of escape
their swords lock up and kase suddenly finds himself face to face with you can sense kases bitter disappointment
not at all who id hoped for
as they flick to a point iust behind kases head
as he realizes hes been had
he swings fully around to face connor and sees that nobodys there
too late he swings back to duncan and impales himself on duncans sword
through clenched teeth im afraid connor couldnt be here
but dont worry hes with us in spirit
still gripping his sword two fisted duncan seems to surge with newfound strength
he gave himself for this moment
and i shant let him down
duncan shoves off from kase and goes to work on him with a vengeance
a frightening hallucinitory vision of a dual adversary one that changes back and forth in the flux of swirling mist
as duncans blade blurs past kase sees connor
with the very next swing he sees duncan again
kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand
shakes it off
duncan buffets kase backward with several dazzling combinations then goes inside tough and ugly
kase seems suddenly overwhelmed physically and mentally as hes driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive
duncan slashes down for the killing blow which kase barely deflects
he slashes again
each time kase barely escapes with his head intact
duncan keeps up this relentless barrage hacking down in every conceivable direction looking for an opening finding none
with each increasingly leaden downstroke duncan is losing strength
and kase is regaining his
kase battles back to his feet deftly siezes the advantage
savage smile this is not a game won on points im afraid
he drives duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability
in a single massive thrust kase strips duncans sword and sends him flying
duncan lands on his back weaponless
kase steps up to the katana scoops his toe under it and flicks it back to duncan
then waves him back to his feet
a cat playing with his prey
both combatants square off
thats the beauty of eternity
the fun never stops
he thrusts spiking duncan clear through the shoulder
duncan hangs up on the blade unable to move
grimaces in pain
setting boot to chest kase kicks duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward
duncan reaches out to break his fall but theres no ground beneath him
he plummets off a slanted cliff
bounces at fifty feet then tumbles clear to the bottom
kase steps up to the edge scowls
has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology
earth moving equipment several stories tall lines the inner basin
what have they done to my mountain
he gazes down at duncans body sprawled at the base of the cliff
then starts down after him
duncan crawls over to his sword
as kase picks his way down the steep incline
duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright
one look at his battered body and you know this fight is over
he just stands there hunched over his sword grimly waiting for kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow
it doesnt take long
kase stops regards him with contempt
dont make it easy
i hate that
youre breaking my heart
duncan shakes his blood streaked head
its always been too easy for you kase
no reason this time should be any different
he plucks his sword out of the ground
and turns his back to kase
duncan contd take your best shot
he hobbles off sword hanging limp at his side
kase starts trembling with rage
duncan ignores him keeps walking
about now we should have a pretty good idea what duncan has in mind
but kase doesnt have a clue
for a fleeting moment connor stands before duncan more mist than flesh
he opens his arms wide
remember weil old friend
he dissolves away as kase hoists sword over shoulder
kase contd and charges
which is exactly what duncan expected
duncan pivots with the thrust catching kase completely off guard and off balance
this time no force of man or nature can keep duncans sword from hitting home
he slices upward with a roar of defiance
and follows through
he stands there head miraculously still intact a look of bewildered relief
duncan simply pops his sword butt into kases face
the head comes easily away from the neck and falls
kases pov spins end over end through the air bounces twice and comes to a rest sideways
and thats how we first see his headless body sprawled across the ground
blinks with sudden recognition
and now he knows
this is the worst part of losing your head those last few seconds of cold lucidity
opens his arms to the ultimate ouickening as the earth explode like a circle of volcanoes venting into the center
duncan claws upward on a groundswell of raw energy as dirt rock ash and smoke obliterate the basin
the seismic convulsions gradually subside
the dust settles
and the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly silence blind to its own buried secrets
hold on the trailing wisps of smoke as and duncans katana breaks the surface
it plunges upward one two three more times pulverizing dirt and stone
hands follow clawing their up way through the loosely mounded earth until duncans head and shoulders appear
as if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of immortal
he rolls out onto the ground gasping triumphant
one inch at a time he slowly rises to his feet
as we keep on rising up into a fiery highland sunset
duncan stands over a freshly dug grave
onto the simple stone hes chisled and beneath it duncans eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss
and a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity
yours is the greater prize my friend
linger on duncan as we dissolve slowly to
faith stands sentinel like atop a bluff overlooking the hudson river and the insignificant island of manhattan beyond
her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin
what remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity
her faraway eyes blink with a sudden frightening clarity
the buzz sets her reflexes snapping as she spins around and catches the colichmarde handle first
follows strolling toward her with hands loose at his side
faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade
what am i supposed to do next kiss you or take your head
duncan steps up to her smiling enigmatically
the choice is yours
