href b b by craig bolotin warren lewis november various voices big six
thats six the hard way
seven or eleven
one of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the garbage seems gift wrapped
the voices continue over as we move in on a particular building where a doorman is holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle
the voices continue hit me
let it ride
anymore for the come out
in contrast to the outside of this sedate quiet brownstone we go inside to find
a miniature las vegas complete with music drinks tuxedoed dealers and croupiers roulette craps black jack
wall to wall people
the fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in new york doesnt stop these connecticut slummers hollow cheek nightlifers and junior wiseguys from having a good time
nick conklin holding a dollar cigar is trying to pull a winning hand
in his late thirties nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate
his moe ginsburg rent a tux is too tight his ruffled shirt out of date nick could care less
two other players are still in the game
one of them is a lithe debutante surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men
the pot is huge
nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot
one and one on top
hesitates im out
disgusted he throws down his cards
its down to nick and the debutante
the cocky deb gives nick a long look confident she can win
her eyes still on nick i see the deuce and one to chase them home
she throws her chips on the pot
nick hesitates then decides to match it
showing her hand ladies aces wired
nick turns over his cards jacks and tens not good enough to win
elated the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends
nick walks over to her
very nice barbie
pointing toward her boyfriend now id take ken over there and go home
the lady wants to play
someone should teach you to be a better loser loser
listen ken my name is not ken im offering you the benefit of my experience
looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this
it was nice of them to relax the dress code for you
that draws a laugh from her friends
the entourage heads for the bar
charlie skloaris twenty three steps in front of the debutante blocking her path
she steps to the side
charlie steps with her
charlies pushing it hes always pushing it
shes not amused
finally charlie lets her pass
he comes up to nick
typical new york woman big attitude small apartment no tits
only two things count to charlie his job and his women but not necessarily in that order
i think she got to you pappy
checking his watch you want a popsicle go to good humor
and dont call me pappy
glancing at the door still you gotta wonder how shed look in handcuffs
nick wary eyes this kid
charlie shrugs spreads his arms defensively
the sound of pounding on the front door
the bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers the first members of the raiding party rush in
people rush for the exit any exit
nick and charlie hold up their glasses
calmly alley oop
they down their drinks then set them down
charlie pulls out the binaca offering nick a spritz but nick is already pulling out his police badge and hanging it around his neck
charlie quickly follows suit
line the patrons up against the wall
patty zachara climbs onto the crap table
a petite nervous woman patty has dressed in a channel suit for the occasion
not a prayer
that quiets them
my name is conklin
lets do this fast so i can go home
zachara annoyed looks at nick
softer its all yours
reads under section of the new york state penal code i serve notice that this premise and its occupants
catches the debutantes eye across the room
she smiles at him he was right
he shrugs spreads his hands
a well groomed middle aged man who well come to know as cavello suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against the wall
charlie spins around to stop him whoa where do you think youre going hotdog
cavello butts him with his head sending charlie to the floor
then crosses his arms in front of his face and plunges through the window
nick not missing a beat gives a small sigh as he follows
he takes off after him
nick short of breath chases cavello down the residential street past the dog walkers past the doormen past the fur coated women climbing out of taxies
unfortunately cavello has a good half block on him
from nowhere charlie blasts past leaving nick a half block behind silently cursing his age
a limo jerks to a halt and cavello jumps in
the limo streaks away
turns to see nick hands on knees gasping for air
now in their street clothes charlie and nick stand in front of the mirrors
charlie is working his brush and hair dryer as if his life depended on it
nick in contrast shoves his hair back with his fingers and glowers at himself in the mirror
over the dryer its not like you were slow or anything
i think you did just fine
i think you did great
nick turns to leave
hey hey where you goin
nick strides out the door
charlie hurries after him
you know the guy who did the weismuller through the window cavello
charlie trails nick to his motorcycle a harley hog complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks
the bike is held together with tape and baling wire
you know him
nick tries to kick start this behemoth but its not easy
he works for frank abolofia
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust
charlie puts his foot up on nicks fender to tie his shoe
nick spotting an ankle holster peeking from charlies sock grabs charlies foot
nick pulls out a beretta
get rid of it
its not regulation
and the only way youre gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him and while hes laughing you can shove it down his throat
looking at nicks bike ill get rid of it when you get rid of the egg beater
the harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke
nick puts on his paint flecked helmet slides down some ski goggles
nick lets go hunting
nick pops the bike into gear
you still got shaving cream on your ear
nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke
we find nick a lonely solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows
the sound of wind whips through his helmet cold air stings his cheeks
the tail lights of nicks bike disappear into the night
civil service heaven
nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development
a basketball net in every driveway a buick or chrysler in every garage
one house sticks out
the lawn is brown paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway
nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house
its as inviting as an open grave
he shoots away
a hanger sized roadhouse wall to wall red velvet
nicks the sole figure at the counter coffee and the daily news in front of him
a nurse walks in and sits down a half dozen seats away
nick look up
i came to save you
if youre hopeless ill pull the plug
nick and connie are in bed
theyre both looking up at the ceiling
theyve just made love
its getting too cold even for me nick
all right hows the new partner
high spirits desire commitment
youll take care of that
give me a break would you
if you give me one
nick kisses her
the first suggestion of real affection
the sound of someone knocking on the door
reluctantly they stop
connie gets up and puts on her robe
are you expecting anyone
i wasnt expecting you
she disappears down the hallway
we hear the door open then telling someone to wait
poking her head in the room imagine a small greasy boy scout
nick wearing only his pants is doing a slow burn
charlie is holding his hands up defensively
i found the goombah
hes i should tear your head off
whoa i knew you were going to say that
i absolutely anticipated that nick
but i said to myself charlie charlie we can move up on this so go find nicklaus
hell be pissed for a moment but then itll dawn on him hey i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up
charlie looks away momentarily letting it slide
he knows hes on sensitive ground
they told me at the greeks you were here
im sorry i never imagined
buddy buddy i like her
lowering his voice for her age
the bedroom door opens
connie enters dumps nicks clothes on the couch tosses his gun on top of the pile
without a word she goes back inside and slams the door behind her
nick pissed slowly turns to face charlie
nicks got nothing better to do than go
the lime house is a little piece of italy in the heart of chinatown and tonight its packed
any selection on the jukebox that isnt frank sinatra is jerry vale
behind the bar are two fat brothers
one pours drinks the other dishes out scungilli
its three a
its always three a
at the lime house
our man cavello is unloading steaming scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking japanese man
the japanese man in his mid fifties wears a gray suit and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place
a japanese translator doing his best to translate cavellos heavily accented english sits between them
charlie is looking straight ahead afraid cavello might peg him
nick is at ease
what are they doing now
eating scungilli just like the last time you asked
who do you think the jap is
maybe cavellos buying a subaru
how would i know
i dont blame you for being sore
itll pass when we bag him
charlie trying to relax gestures toward his foot
eighty five bucks
lowering his voice girls go for shoes
second place they look
off nicks reaction hey i read it in a magazine
nicks attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door
dead serious charlie dont do anything
what they see two bodyguards are making a quick sweep of the bar
frank abolofia s stocky man with silver grey hair sweeps in behind them
abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure
a heavyweight mafioso
abolofia walks to cavellos table
all rise and shake hands
the two hitters take seats at the bar
the two brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests
in a whisper some party
maybe we should do something
charlie take your gum stick it under your ass and keep it warm
nick turns away resumes his drink
nicks pov in the mirror behind the bar two new japanese men step in the door
early twenties spiky hair dark versace suits
wears tortoise shell shades
he coolly checks out the room then nods to who pulls a spas automatic shotgun from under his coat and spits out three rounds
a window shatters
everyone hits the floor
slowly walks toward cavellos table
covers the floor
abolofias bodyguards show their empty hands
on the floor
they dont have the artillery for this guy either
our japanese businessman knows these people
he eyes them contemptuously
abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it
he stops chewing
a tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action
in japanese give it to me
the japanese businessman looking straight ahead
a long silent pause
then still not facing him in japanese go to hell
number one slips his fingers beneath his shades massaging his eyes
in a flash he pulls a shuto from under his coat
the inch blade gleams like a neon tube
he presses the tip of the blade against the businessmans throat
his hand close around the grip of the beretta
he unsnaps the ankle holster
the snap can be heard across the room
nicks hand closes around charlies and squeezes till the knuckles turn white
in a whisper what are you doing
saving your life
levels the scattergun at nick and charlie
calmly holds the blade at the mans throat as he reaches into the mans jacket and removes a small rectangular plastic wrapped parcel
he feels its weight then flips it to number two
abolofia realizing that whatever is going on doesnt affect him or his resumes eating
you people are wild
number one backs the blade off
the man raises his napkin to the small wound
a droplet of blood has stained his shirt collar
number one turns around as if to leave
what happens next could be a whim an after thought
number one spins around and thrusts the blade deep into the mans chest
he withdraws it with a half twist and in the same motion fatally slashes the translators throat before the old mans body hits the floor
blood pours from the businessmans mouth onto his scungilli spreading across the white cloth and onto the floor
reaches for a gun under his coat
but number two pumps two rounds into his face
at this range theres not much left
the killers slowly back out the door covering the room with the scattergun
the minute the door shuts nick leaps up pulling his shield and revolver
shouting police officers
everybody stay put
to charlie get back up
abolofias eyebrows rise at this development
nick bolts out the door leaving charlie in charge
hes never been in charge before
nervously showing shield police
a lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up
nick flies out the lime house door and hits the ground
number two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the trigger
the front windows of the lime house shatter
the limo driver jerks to a halt
number two tosses the package to him
nick empties his revolver
number two goes down
the driver floors the accelerator leaving number one to take off on foot
nick follows reloading as he runs
everyones frozen on the floor
tell them an officer needs assistance
say ten thirteen
nothing from the owner who looks at abolofia
charlie grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the phone
do it you dumb bastard
suddenly charlie feels something wet at his feet
he looks down to see that hes standing in a pool of blood from the massacre
so much for his new shoes
he wheels around then quickly backs out the door
the wail of police sirens in the distance
charlie has his gun out
hes drenched in sweat
where is his partner
nick gun drawn slowly rounds the corner to the alley its the ad hoc drugstore for the night
drugs going up and down in pails two dozen junkies buying shooting slumped on the ground
everyone scatters the ones that can
swings slowly back and forth from three stories up
nick cautiously moves down the alley holding the gun in both hands
a junkie steps out of a doorway nick swings his gun and nearly blows him away
we see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at the back of the alley
from now on well call him kobo
his sunglasses are on his forehead his hands dropped casually at his side
a very cool character
kobo slowly raises his hand and making a gun with his finger slowly points and shoots at nick
he lowers his hand
on the ground man
kobo cups his hands around his ear
he doesnt understand english
nick keeping his gun fixed comes up to him and kicks out his legs
kobo falls flat on his chest
nick pulls out his cuffs
but kobo lunges for nicks ankle and yanks it toward him
nick stumbles backward kobos on his feet
before nick can stand kobo lands a brutal kick to the side of nicks head
nick gets up barrels into him
kobo knees nick in the solar plexus then lands two more well placed kicks in nicks back
its not that nicks a bad fighter its that this kid is so damn fast
nick slowly gets to his feet
kobo lands two more brutal shots to the side of nicks head
hes a bloody mess
stop at the end of the alley
four officers climb out
joins the cops as they run down the alley to find nick getting pummeled
charlie shoots at kobo
kobo turns to see the five cops guns drawn
nick on one knee spits out blood and a few teeth
kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and drops it next to nick
the blade gleams in the light
that was next
nick got lucky
kobo towers imperiously above nick
their eyes lock
we hold then
there isnt a stick of furniture but thats not the half of it
in the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a centerstand
a drop cloth is spread around it tools neatly aligned
its a harley but this one is in perfect condition
a phone rings insistently from off screen then stops
sure sure ill be down
nick walks in naked
every muscle aches
one side of his face is completely swollen
he has a band aid over his right eye some blood caked on his earlobe
he stops to twist a spark plug in with a ratchet but it snaps
oliver early forties walks between charlie and nick as they head toward the medical examiners room
oliver doesnt face nick as he speaks no love lost between these two
how big a package we talking about
holding up his hands this by this
not in that company
the old man was a japanese paper manufacturer
hotel room and rental car were full of it
full of what
annoyed art and stationary paper
cavello had five hundred thousand in his attache case
nick rubs the back of his neck in obvious pain
one guy do all the damage
thought you knew your way around dark alleys detective
oliver goes through the swinging doors into the examiners room
charlie shoots nick a look
nick lets it slide
a techie is showing the nights harvest to charlie nick and oliver
theyre standing over the body of the middle aged japanese man
the old mans suit was japanese
the hitters was saville row
were doing a peel now
another techie is carefully removing the skin from number twos fingertips
charlie shuts his eyes and turns away trying not to throw up
theres something you got to see
he whips back the sheet the body is nude
a towel covers the genitals
except for the feet hands neck and face the body is covered with elaborate tattoos flowers and blood dragons and snakes
whats wrong with this picture
nervously i got a tattoo
birdie on the ball
we all got them when we finished basic at camp lejune
i thought you guys were trained observers
they look up surprised
the techie picks up a hand
the third and forth fingers have been neatly amputated
ironically hey it was a trick question
abolofia is seated in chair next to his lawyer
nick oliver and a third detective are grilling him
he was with a friend sure
i shake hands with the guy and a minute later hes bleeding all over my socks
will that do officers
my client has had a terrible shock
yeah hes not used to seeing other people do the killing
i wont tolerate harassment
what about the package
we know nothing about it
abolofia looks at nick then at oliver
hard to believe a trained police officer could let this kind of thing happen right in front of his face
i did make a mistake
i let the wrong guy get hit
abolofia doesnt blink an eye goes for the jugular
cheer up nick
im sure its easier to pick a dead mans pocket
nick springs from his feet
oliver grabs nick before he can get close to abolofia
thats it were through
the japanese killer who smashed in nicks face last night
hes sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a detective and a japanese translator
he wont talk
nick and oliver watching through the glass
doesnt speak a word of english
and he wont speak japanese either
the japanese embassy is very interested
hes wanted in japan
they want him first
then we can have him
thats the way it is
he turns and looks at nick
he cant possibly see him through the one way glass but he knows nicks there
looking at him
making a cutting mark across his forehead right where nicks bandage is
nick is sitting in front of olivers desk
the sunlight makes him wince wincing makes his face hurt
japanese embassy talks to state department
state talks to police plaza
they to me and me to you
shit rolls down hill
oliver drops a file folder on the desk
nick opens it petty cash vouchers and plane tickets
you and charlie are taking the jap home tonight
what if i say no
check your gun before you leave
theyre not allowed in japan
its a nice safe country
they said send a detective if i could spare one
then i can always spare you
nick bridles at the insult
olivers had a hard on for nick for years and nicks tired of it
soft you got something to say to me captain
oliver doesnt want to get into it
have a wonderful flight
on the tail of a japan airlines
a driving rain storm
the plane taxies down the runway and disappears into the black rain
kobo handcuffed and shackled is in the center seat
nick and charlie sit on either side
charlie is holding bachelors japan in one hand
nicks in a sour mood
nick youre the one thats always saying you never go anywhere
i was thinking the poconos charlie
what are you missing
riding your motorcycle to the nurses house
that shit is sadder than ethiopia
beats forty hours on a plane
they say we got to turn around and come right back
thats what they say
i got a plan
the last thing nick wants to hear too late
i call right
i say i got the dreaded thirty six hour asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days
you and i become a driving force on the local geisha scene
not a prayer
grinning hey come on big guy like you cop from new york
youre gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla
nick cant help but smile at this kid
charlie looks down at the guide book
says here its very impolite to touch someone while youre talking to them
nudges kobo guess that means you cant talk and screw at the same time huh hotdog
whats the matter no speaky the language
understand this you will never ever fuck with my partner again
nothing from kobo who is looking straight ahead
he doesnt understand
shut up charlie
a beat then charlie reads a japanese phrase from the book
a slight facial response from kobo
charlie tries it again
this time kobo laughs openly
whatd you say
where is the subway station please
kobo keeps laughing its obviously not what charlie said
get a new book
the cabin is now darkened
kobo and nick are asleep
not charlie hes still at his book and listening to u on his walkman
nick rolls over and opens his eyes to see charlie watching him
he shuts them hoping to avoid talk
charlie removes his headphones
nick have i been a good partner
number five with a bullet
nick shuts his eyes
i just want you to know
i mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me
go to sleep charlie
you didnt take did you
you hear things
nick opens his eyes
i worked the three nine in queens charlie
surprised i didnt know
the lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad
i was new didnt know shit
when the feathers flew i got called in front of the special prosecutor
its on the top of my personnel file
they think im dirty or i cut a deal
doesnt leave you with a lot of friends either way
nick shuts his eyes
i might as well have done something
ive been paying for it every goddamn day since i got transferred
hold on nick then
nick and charlie with kobo between them are a strange sight in a sea of japanese faces
kobos hands are cuffed behind his back
nick also has kobo cuffed to his wrist
the cops are rumpled exhausted showing two days of stubble
kobo looks sharp and wide awake
a pair of attractive teenage girls walks past them
nick were in paradise
of white gloved hands belonging to a tokyo police officer holds up a small hand letter sign that says conklin skloaris
the man holding the sign is nagashima
two other police officers in spotless tan uniforms stand at his side
nick holding kobo by his arm steps up to the police and show his i
officers conklin and and
he cant say charlies name gentlemen welcome
i am assistant inspector nagashima
they show their i
you going to take this crap off our hands
oh the prisoner
he barks some orders to the officers who immediately take kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him
nick unfastens his cuff when theyre through
in contrast to nagashimas gentility the cops are rough with the prisoner
extends his hand charlie
kon ich iwa
nagashima shakes his hand
charlie bows back
nick wouldnt bow if his life depended on it
nagashima hands nick an official looking document
if you will please give this to the customs inspector he will expidate expedite you
we have a car and a driver outside
nick grabs charlie by the arm and starts for the customs line
givin you a book is like givin a baby a gun
hey when in rome in rome ill bow
nick and charlie make their way through the crowd toward the head of a long line
they dump their bags on the counter
the inspector furious that they have taken cuts in line barks at them in japanese
inspector nagashima told me to give you this
he hands the inspector the official looking document
the inspector scans the paper
hands it back to them
broken english you must get in line behind the rest
pol ice men
the inspector signals a nearby policeman
the inspector says something in japanese
hands the policeman the document
the policeman shakes his head amused points to the end of the line
fellas get serious
from off screen someone calls out nick
nick and charlie turn to see kobo their prisoner standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider
the handcuffs are off
the three alleged policemen are heading out the door behind him
it was a set up nick and charlie have been had
perfect english thanks for the ride detective
he slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the time in the world finally disappearing in the crowd
trying to shove past the customs inspectors who are wrestling them aside
hes our prisoner
two more policemen arrive
nick and charlie are thrown up against the wall
out come the cuffs
whats going on
were the good guys
fifty identical desks
fifty identical phones
fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working under the fluorescent lights of this large open room
we glide past the rows of desk to find inspector ohashi mid forties sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk
ohashi prides himself on order
nick and charlie are standing in front of him
get me something like an identi kit and ill give you a description
ohashi remains poker faced
he continues to arrange papers and apply his hanko personal seal to the bottom of a stack of official papers
there must be some witnesses from the airport
still nothing from the good inspector
what is it tea time
still nothing from ohashi
finally quiet rage you lost a man we wanted for some time
it was very incompetent on your part officer
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms carrying official documents
ohashi bows slightly were not sure why
i want a gun
it is not allowed
were police officers
work with me
i want your best detective
ohashi returns to his papers
nick cant believe it
hey inspector i dont intend to take the rap for this
not looking up do you know what this is
ohashi holds up the document that was handed to nick at the airport
its a laundry list
go home detective
nick studies him for a beat then turns away
to charlie lets go
nick we cant just i said lets go charlie
reluctantly they head towards the door passing long rows of bureaucrats telephones ringing off the hook
nick stops at the door spots a fuse box nearby
he glances back to make sure no one is looking
nick pulls out his handcuffs
charlie cant figure out what the hell hes doing
nick attaches one cuff to the main lever then yanks it down
the lights go out
the fans stop so do the typewriters so does the air conditioning
nick attaches the other cuff to a pipe snaps it shut
now its impossible to left the main lever
from the far end of the room what are you doing
nick drops the key down the water fountain drain
your best detective ohashi
nick and charlie cross the street
charlies trying to read the name from the piece of paper ohashi has given them
detective ich iro matsu moto
hey were getting mr
moto on our side
lets grab some food
first decent idea youve had
charlie pulls out his footloose in tokyo book flips through the pages
food here we go
tokyo offers a wide variety of food
its best to sample the local specialties including sashaimi soba and world renown kobe beef
nick goes into a restaurant
charlie drops the book disgusted with nicks choice
charlie reluctantly follows him in
reveal its a shakeys pizza restaurant
rows of post modern buildings of odd shaped windows and brightly painted concrete walls
nick and charlie are searching for the japanese cops building
they cant speak the language they cant read the signs and half the buildings dont have numbers
its a nightmare
this should be it
you said that in the last two places
charlie holds out the paper to a passing man
the man gestures toward the building charlie was pointing to
okay you were right
charlie grins satisfied
the boys are knocking on a door
nick turns the handle
a four tatami room
an unholy mess food packages beer bottles stacks of papers and file folders
framed pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall
this the right place
i hope not
a woman now appears at the door
middle aged wizened face in a full traditional kimono
the woman babbles bird like in rapid japanese
theyre in the right place
the jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a motorcycle down
its a bad neighborhood one of the poorest in tokyo
we spot the small kimono clad woman clip clopping on wooden geta leading nick and charlie through this labyrinth
looking around getting very weird
id feel better if we had some heat
maybe we should bail
seeing theyve stopped the woman gestures for them to hurry up then disappears around the corner
looking at the maze of streets think we could find our way back
a poor mans idea of a bar
the woman points inside chirps away in japanese bows then hurries off leaving nick and charlie on their own
nick and charlie disappear into darkness as the woven flaps shut behind them
a vintage wurlitzer juke box glows across the room
an enka plays
haunting japanese blues
big shots from new york
i like your style
ichiro matsumoto steps into a pool of light just inches from them
he is a short overweight man looking every minute of his fifty five years
his white short sleeve shirt is too tight his narrow tie spotted in the middle his collar soaked in sweat
hes not drunk yet but hes been at it a while
call him ich
bowing detective ichiro matsumoto
im the man youre looking for
this is ohashis best man
well at least he speaks english
the man you are looking for kobo was a member of the samaguchi gummi
ich nods offers them whats left of his sapphoro beer
they shake their heads
ich finishes it
where do we start looking for this guy
where would you look for the mafia
the back room at lombardis after the columbus day parade
under the bed
in the mayors office
ich heads for the door without saying a word
wherere you going ichiro
stops faces them the mayors office under the bed the back room at lombardis
tucking in his shirt tail and call me ich
imagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall except there arent any stores
the only product sold here is pleasure bars hostess clubs turkish baths
a post modern red light district with music piped in and automated doormen
hip younger japanese are wedged together at the long chrome bar
the guys sport leather jackets and raybans
the girls are decked out in fifties american party dresses and short cropped hair
jerry lee lewis wails in the background
nick ich and charlie are at one end of the long bar
ich is drinking them both under the table
singing goodness gracious great balls of fire
raising glass for toast to the killer
jerry lee lewis
checking his watch jerry lee lewis elvis dinky doo and the donts
lets book charlie
if he starts on motown well be here all night
no this is the place for the young yakuza
thats what you said in the last three piss pots
ich sets down his drink pours more sake for nick and charlie then for himself
hes having a great time
i love you people
the music the clothes the movies
japanese respect only what is japanese
nick glances at charlie
hit him or something
i dont think hed feel it
beginning to slur his words americans change everything
when i was young the city was wood and paper
i was ten when the bombers came
i lived underground for three days
when i came up the city was gone
a ball of fire
nick gets to his feet
ich grabs him by the arm stopping him
it began to rain nick
you know what color the rain was
ich doesnt give him a chance to answer
it was black from the ash
you americans you could make black rain
ich polishes off his drink
an awkward silence
charlie wanting to lighten the mood leaning close say ich between friends where can i grab some squish around here
nick sighs digs in his pocket for some yen for the bill
pussy ass soft personnel
ich looks up to see a picturesque blood haired american women in a tight silk blouse and skirt
she works here and has obviously heard charlie
in japanese how are you tonight
in japanese hello ich
joyces japanese is impeccable
shes a part time bartender translator model
one of japans western wanderers
shes sliding past thirty but only her weary eyes give it away
she is about to pour ich another drink
dont give him any more
he gets as much as he wants
charlie extends his hand to joyce
she ignores it
hello hello charlie skloaris
new york city
she refills ichs glass
my partner and i are cops
lowering his voice were on a very big assignment here
nothing from joyce when do you get off
right when youre being tucked into bed
you should be nicer to my american friends joyce
they wouldnt appreciate it ich
she says something in japanese to ich as she eyes the cops
then she walks off
joyce can be nice
brightening whatd she say
big smile that i should let you pay for the drinks
raising his glass kampai
charlie and nick are trying to help a besotted ich find a taxi but no one will take him
ich is shouting half english half japanese phrases
we got to keep looking
track him down
great balls of fire
frustrated to a cabbie whats the problem here
the cabbie ignores them
you dont speak the language
ill drop him off
they turn to see joyce standing behind them
the rest is slurred japanese
joyce speaks to a cabbie in japanese
the rear door swings open
she helps ich in
joyce climbs in
out the window see you tomorrow
the taxi pulls away
nick and charlie watch it go
not a prayer
an early morning wind jostles the red paper lantern and plucks at the tails of dragon like banners hanging outside the shops
nick and charlie are walking down this narrow sidestreet on the way back to their hotel
hes a sorry old guy but i like him
he couldnt find his ass with both hands
a brand new kawasaki motorcycle with windshield and full farings gleams under a street light
now thats the kind of motorcycle i want to see you on
muttering sure a rice burning crotch rocket
nick how we gonna bag this guy without any help
maybe i should work on that girl joyce she speaks the language
nick glances over at his partner smiles
but before he can respond the dull roar of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance breaks the pre dawn stillness
on their multi cylinder high tech street bombers creep around the corner and slowly ride toward nick and charlie
we get a better look at them turbo punk elvis samurai hybrids some wearing a slipper under their headbands courtesy of their girlfriends some in leopard skin pants
they head straight for nick and charlie then at the last moment split and float away in slow motion as if the cops didnt exist
suddenly the street is empty again
silent except for the sound of the wind beating against paper lanterns rustling the wind chimes
hold on nick and charlie standing in the middle of the street realizing just how far away from home they are
a rocket shaped building a mixture of dutch gable and japanese minka roof
the mid day sun beats down on a particular room
nick and charlie are sacked out
they never bothered to pull the curtains
the sound of knocking at the door
give us a break
leave the rice cake outside and go home
but ich persists
as nick opens up
hes now clean shaven and has put on a clean shirt
theres been a murder
you should come
the murder scene
a body from the waist down in the claws of six foot working robotic
the tattooed covered legs swing back and forth like a pendulum
the torso is wedged in between two enormous printing rollers
the head is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt
its been drenched in black printers ink which has begun to congeal
we slowly track past ich charlie and nick watching
charlie has the dry heaves
real sound as we reveal the full crime scene
instead of the usual cigar smoke camera flashes and radio chatter there is order and quiet
a slow underwater dance
quietly gives an order
someone turns off the robotic
the severed legs stop swinging
nick charlie and ich walk over to ohashi
ich bows deeply
ohashi doesnt acknowledge any of them talks to a man holding a tape measurer
could you fill me in
why dont you ask your chief detective
ich looks down at the floor
because i want you to tell me
the young are eating the old something that usually doesnt happen here
can we skip the poetry inspector
ich looks at nick as if to warn him he cant speak to ohashi that way
theres a war detective between two rival groups
the man who escaped kobo leads the younger group
they did this
kobos a wild boy
he was a lieutenant in the sammaguchi gummi
in japanese excellent officer matsumoto
how is your investigation going
in japanese well sir
thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with these distinguished gentlemen
looking for clues in the bottom of a sake bottle matsumoto
laughter all around
hes an officer of great distinction
another sarcastic dig
ich stoically stands and takes it
hey ich has been helpful
ignoring him to nick have you changed your mind and decided to go home detective
not until one of us bags kobo
looking at the corpse and it doesnt look like youre doing so hot
ohashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we ich nick and charlie are threading their way through the crowd toward the subway entrance
two bikers their hair slicked back watch the trio from the top of two different subway entrances
as soon as ich nick and charlie go down the steps they climb off their bikes and follow
nick ich and charlie are riding the people mover that stretches the length of this endless tunnel
theyre sandwiched between the legions of salarymen white collar workers who all wear identical blue suits and white shirts
nick looks over at ich who is still suffering in silence from the recent humiliation
you know inspector you take shit once you take shit forever
beat i dont deserve ohashis respect
why the hell not
i dont thats all
ich looks away obviously uncomfortable
you cool ich
you all right
what does ichiro mean anyway
smiling what does charlie mean
hey all right
charlie slaps ich on the back
nick smiles at charlies remark
he cant help but like this wide eyed goofy kid
something makes nicks smile fade
kobo their escaped prisoner hurrying in the opposite direction
his kamali suit looks like it just came from the cleaners
charlie spots him
in a flash the two men jump the railing and charge after him leaving ich in their wake
ich cant possibly make it over the side
he furiously shoves his way through the salarymen trying to get to the end of the walkway
nick barreling through the mass of faceless salarymen
kobo hurrying ahead occasionally glancing back
charlie catching up to nick
theyve lost him
they spin around
a half dozen tunnels spin out in all directions
nick and charlie spotting kobo
hes waiting for them near the turnstile
nick suddenly realizes its a set up
before he can say anything charlie sprints ahead recklessly shoving people out of the way
calling after him its a set up
charlie hasnt heard him
kobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears onto the platform
charlie doesnt have a ticket
the guard points to the automatic ticket machine
charlie leaps over the turnstile
the guard blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway police
charlie pushes through the crowd a wall of blank faces
kobo is gone
shoving through the crowd
he spots charlie
shouts at him to wait
charlie cant hear his partner
an immaculately uniformed conductor blows his whistle and waves his white gloved hands to keep the crowd back
a leather jacketed boy shoves charlie from behind he stumbles forward toward the track
someone catches him at the last moment
charlie turns around to see its kobo
kobo smiles its all a big joke
what follows happens in a flash charlie
nick is close enough to see too far to do anything
hes blocked by two more leather boys
he tries to shove past but they grab him
holding charlie by his coat lapels
an express train tears into the station
kobo casually glances at trying to struggle free
his eyes still on nick drops charlie in front of the speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry
a woman screams
the train barrels through the station
kobo starts toward nick
a pair of subway policemen burst through the crowd searching for charlie because he vaulted the turnstile
manages to break free of the leatherboys holding him
they flee into the crowd as the police close in
slips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a train by white gloved men
its their job to shove commuters into the already packed cars
nick goes for kobo but the crowd closes in front of him
he cant get through
the train pulls out leaving nick standing on the empty platform
streaks past him
kobo stands in the rear window getting smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the tracks
ich out of breath is standing on the platform
nick looks at him with disgust where the hell was he
stay on nick his head bowed being surrounded by the sea of blue suited commuters
nicks face against a white wall
thats all we see
ohashis voice off screen
you ignored me
i dont care about what you want
get on a plane detective conklin
we hear a door open and slam shut off screen
hold on nick frozen in place then again the fifty desks fifty faceless men working
typewriters clacking phones ringing
we move down the rows to find nick sitting behind one of the desks
hes on the phone to new york
its not your job
he was my partner
theyre blaming it on you
christ conklin you didnt even tell me you lost the prisoner
i planned on catching him captain
you dont know the place
you dont know the language
get on the plane
he killed a police officer
your planes at nine a
be on it
oliver hangs up
a moment of long distance hum cross talk
nick doesnt move
pull back through the rows of cops busily working
charlie parkers alto sax fade up as we the music continues
the sax screams as the melody is abandoned
nick is drunk
roaring angry drunk
he doesnt know where he is
he doesnt care
he plows down the street occasionally grabbing a passerby then letting them go
nick begins to laugh
a couple is staring at him nick yells at them but we dont hear him
he stumbles on
drop back to find
following in his wake
he bows and apologizes to the offended
nick is thrown onto the street
he tries to reenter and is thrown out again
we spot joyce inside watching she turns back to her customers
nick is hassling a news vendor who pointedly ignores him and continues selling his papers
ich appears and apologizes to the news vendor
nicks sitting on the curb his head in his hands
people step around him
across the street out of nicks sight ich is watching his partner feeling every barb of nicks shame
charlie parker continues over the slow
asleep the futon tangled around him
he opens his eyes
a woman is making tea in the kitchenette
this is the kimonoed woman who led nick and charlie to ich the other night
a radio is on softly in the background
the charlie parker tune weve been listening to over the previous cuts ends and the announcer comes on that was the bird from the blue note years
hours and degrees in central osaka
this is specialist doug dale tapestries in jazz on the far east network armed forces radio
nick slowly sits up to see seated at a low table looking at him from across the room
nick spots his clothes and luggage stacked in the corner
nick now realizes hes in ichs apartment
everything is now in its proper place
they made you leave your hotel
looks away you caused a disturbance
nicks eyes fall on charlies things his sports clothes his tour book his shoes which ich has stacked on the table
it may be too soon to talk about it
when someone we care for dies we
beat keep something of theirs
a tie a pen
why werent you at the platform
i couldnt keep up
my shame is complete
nick slowly shuts his eyes his head pounding
the neighborhood bathhouse
thick with steam and neighborhood kids
nick walks toward the huge pool of water
ich is beside him
nicks about to climb in when ich stops him hands him a pail and a washcloth and points to the faucets along the wall where a dozen men squat on
small stools as they wash themselves
as he pours a pail of water over his head it runs down his face in slow motion
nick soaking on one side
ich is soaking nearby
you must leave
ill get him for you nick
nick looks at this thick bellied alcoholic cop
not a very reassuring thought
two men carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub
young muscular yakuza their bodies covered with exquisite tattoos
they stare openly at nick
one makes a joke
both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot tub
nick eyes them for a long beat then climbs out of the tub
nick tossing two bags into a taxi in front of ichs apartment building
ich watching nick through the window from inside his apartment
he glances back and sees charlies members only coat hanging on a hook
when he turns back nicks taxi has disappeared
the brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly of the cargo plane
nick watches it from the edge of the tarmac
nick hands the clerk his ticket
aisle or window
nick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the counter
he cant read it of course but theres a picture of the subway platform where charlie was killed swarming with police
nick continues to stare at the paper
aisle or window sir
looks up i want to cash it in
nick steps in drops the two suitcases
the woman steps out of the kitchen babbles something in japanese
nick doesnt have a clue
only a handful of patrons
joyce is straightening bottles behind the bar
she looks up surprised to see nick standing in front of her
ich said you left
there was a change in plans
im sorry about your friend
nicks surprised at how fast she heard
dead gaiijins are big news
an outside person
beat more you
i could use some help
show me around
ill pay you for your time
i dont give tours
you can count on the truth from people who dont like you
you have a helluva way of asking for help
you have a helluva way of answering
look you need ich
ive been here five years and i still cant read all the street signs
maybe im a quicker learner
i dont think so
from off screen nicklaus san
nick turns to see ich leaning against the door frame
hes already had a few drinks too many
hes delighted to see nick
ive continued working on the case
i can see that
ich ambles into the room slips down into a chair
he spills the contents of the large manila envelope hes been carrying onto the table a wallet a set of keys playing cards etc
signaling to joyce joyce
a drink please
to nick kobo has disappeared
my superiors dont trust me
nick walks over to the table and looks at the items
taken off him when he was arrested in new york
nick sits down
joyce gives ich his scotch
i knew youd come back
you feel you have a debt you can never pay
but you will even if it costs you your life
nick picks up various items off the table
howd you get this
i stole them
ich drapes his arm over nicks shoulder
partners nicklaus san
ich reaches for his drink
nick gets there first
he holds it up as if he were proposing a toast then purposefully spills his drink out
ich has just had his last drink on duty
all the contents of the envelope are spread out on the table credit cards matchbooks from new york city choice clipping from screw magazine sugarless gum cuff links
nicks holding up a series of photos
of a naked women and kobo screwing on a tatami mat
each photo is more pornographic than the next
joyce picks them up as nick sets them down
nick holds out several of the same girl in various poses
shaking his head we can ask someone i used to work with
someone i pay money to
the largest in tokyo
endless rows of men sitting in front of the machines horizontal pinball games furiously punching the flippers
the noise from the metal balls is deafening
in a hawaiian shirt his arms covered with tattoos is starting a new game
ich moves up to the vacant machine beside him puts in his change
ich doesnt face the man as they speak in japanese
the man in the hawaiian shirt walks off
as the man in the hawaiian shirt walks past him
this is the snitch
nick glances back at ich
ich nods theyre in business
we hear the clattering of the machines outside
the man in the hawaiian shirt mid fifties and badly in need of a shower is sitting on the floor studying the photos
ich and nick tower above him
the man says something to nick in japanese then continues to study the photos
whats he saying
looking up he says theyre very nice
he wants to know if you have anymore
ill ask him again
ich asks in japanese
the man shrugs
he grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him against the wall
the photos spill to the floor
who is she
he bangs the mans head back against the wall
the man starts babbling in japanese
ich horrified tries to pull nick off him
nick bangs the snitches head against the wall again
ich gets nick away
the man is terrified
this man must be treated with respect
ich bows to the man apologizes in japanese
aw for christs sake
they continue speaking in japanese
they bow to one another again
ich gives the man a glass of water then motions for him to sit down
nick impatient starts for the guy again
ich stops him
the snitch holds up one of the photos and starts babbling
to ich now were making progress
close on a salesgirl behind the cosmetic counter
she is wearing the store uniform blue and white dress and white gloves
we shouldnt recognize her at first
then one of kobos porno pics
its the same face
holding the photo standing in the crowded store
ich is beside him
thats kobos girl
ich glances back at the man in the hawaiian shirt standing by the door
the man nods
they watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner
nick no ones seen kobo in three days
he might not even be in tokyo
only one way to find out
get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night
is struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles
a loud slurping sound
the sound stops then starts again
nick cant eat
he sets his bowl down and looks over at slurping his noodles
it is considered polite to slurp soba noodles as loud as possible
looks at nick then resumes his slurping
think you could keep it to a dull roar
theyre sitting by the window across from the seibu department store watching the entrance
its good manners
picks up his bowl
again the loud slurping off screen
nick starts to eat the noodles
he cant continue with ich slurping
he sets the bowl down
ich grins resumes slurping and we the salesgirls are lined up at the door bowing and thanking the last customers for shopping in their store
the girl whom nick and ich have been watching comes out wearing her uniform and heads down the street
waiting in the restaurant get up to follow
stepping out of the laundry carrying her wash
she walks past a doorway where
nick is standing
ich now walks past his partner picking up the tail
no acknowledgement between them
there are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out
the girl is on one of them
ich has lost her
nick and ich hurry from car to car
you said you could keep up with her
no problem nick san
cutting ich off no
dont say anything
dont do anything and for christs sake dont apologize
nick hurries toward another car to check it out
whatd i tell you
there she is
they spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the street cars about to turn onto the main street
the two cops race for the car
nick leaps on
ich is a few steps behind
nick sticks out his hand pulls ich up
they stand looking at one another both breathing hard both out of shape
narrow streets with exploding neon ideograph signs as far as the eye can see
we spot our girl hurrying down the street
nick a half block behind is bumping into people trying not to lose her
she crosses the street and ich picks her up
nick drops off
around the corner the girl disappears into a three story apartment building above an electronics store
were watching our girl inside her apartment
she flips off the tv and climbs into bed
weve been watching the girl from a window across the street
its a storeroom full of shipping crates not much else
ich is sitting on the floor legs crossed back erect watching nick
nick glances over
ich continues to watch him
nick returns to the window
you dislike me
nick keeps looking out the window
did i say that
you toler yes tolerate me
are we getting married
im a joke
they sent you to me to make a fool of you
nick looks over at ich
ich is looking away
nick looks out the window then back at his partner
youre doing fine ich
now drop it okay
the girl switches off her light across the street
ich is sleeping on his back looking like a grounded whale
nick exhausted is sitting by the window his head resting against the sill
as the girl dressed in her store uniform comes out of the apartment and heads for work
nudges the sleeping ich with his foot
ich opens his eyes
ich is groggy nonplused
ich tucking in his shirt comes down the hall to see nick on his knees examining the lock on the girls apartment door
he slides his nypd card into the jam and lightly raps the knob plate
you cant do this
nick uses his sleeve to wipe prints off the knob and jam
call a cop
the door swings open
nick walks in
a cheesebox with a few vintage pieces of american deco furniture
ich very uptight stands at the door while nick goes over the place
nick opens the closet
its packed with expensive dresses pants sweaters
facing him if youre gonna give me a hard time wait outside
nick goes through her chest of drawers on the top a lot of high quality lingerie
insert photo the girl and kobo posing in a vintage corvette
nick replaces the picture and carefully rearranges the drawer so it appears untouched
he pulls open another drawer
under the jeans and mickey mouse t shirts he finds in hundreds
the bottom of the drawer is lined with stacks
nick holds them up for ich to see
not too shabby for a perfume pusher
ich shocked tries to play it cool
too bad its not in yen
nick shoves the drawer shut
the girl buys fruit from a stand as nick watches from one end of the block ich listening to his transistor radio waits at the other
suddenly turns and finds herself facing a few yards away
nick smiles then walks into the store hoping he hasnt been made
rain pours down
nick leaning against the wall watches the girls apartment across the street
the girl walks in turns on her light then disappears into the bathroom
ich walks in exhausted soaked to the skin
he tosses his cap in the corner
struck out again
work lunch groceries laundry
looking back out the window four goddamn days
this is going nowhere
a knock at the door
ich opens the door
joyce dressed for work is carrying two odons box dinners
joyce and ich exchange greetings in japanese
whats the latest
well get him joyce
joyce peeks out the window
the girl is getting undressed
she ever pull down her shades
right back at her sure but then i just pull out the photos
ich opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge in front of nick
enthusiastically chikuwa hampen kobu konnayaku ganmodoki ichiro realizing broiled fish paste cake kelp roll soybean curd devils tongue smells like bayonne at low tide
joyce hands ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil
nick grabs the flask
dumps it out the window
dont be an ass
hes on duty
i paid for that
nick tosses a few thousand yen on the table
then spotting something out the window
nick grabs his coat and goes out the door
joyce slips ich another flask of sake
its our girl standing alone on the corner of the street but you wouldnt know it at first
shes wearing tight leather pants red leather jacket earrings bright red lipstick and shes dumped the pony tail allowing her hair to fall to her waist
watching in a doorway down the block
nicks shivering his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket
ich doesnt mind the cold
hes had his sake
riding their bikes come around the corner drive past her then circle back
one of the riders stops to talk to her then drives off
she hurries off in the opposite direction
the girl waits until the last minute then after glancing back steps in the car
the train pulls out
the cars race past until we see nick and ich standing inside of the last car
it disappears into the tunnel
the girl on the move pushing through the crowd
drop back to find ich twenty yards behind
she crosses the street
nick pretending to be looking in a store window picks her up
nick has lost her
its a cul de sac with a dozen buildings
hes standing in the middle of the street
ich catches up to him
you were too far behind
nick does a double take
recalling nicks words dont say anything more
dont do anything
and for christs sake dont apologize
dropping another cigarette butt to the ground
theres a small pile at his feet
hes leaning against the wall watching one end of the block
track over to reveal ich his back to nicks watching the other end
ich glances back at nick
nick ignores him
ich turns back
nick turns to see the girl walk out of a bath house
shes wearing her ponytail again with a black dress
she climbs into a taxi
the girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside
nick and ich are watching from across the street
packed with salarymen from the nearby brewery and hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at expensive prices
everything seems normal
the bouncer in a white tux stops them
this is not a place frequented by gaiijin
ich beseeches the bouncer to let his good friend in promising that his friend will spend lots of money
nick thinking hes in takes a step forward
the bouncer shoves him back
hey no hands huh
he bats his hands away
ich grabs nick by the shoulders preventing a fight
you cant come in
they dont want gaiijin
ill check it out
nick unsure turns to go but before he does if i smell one drop of scotch on your breath my friend you can trust me
nick hesitates hes not so sure then shoves the door open
nick waiting under the pink neon sign
ich is sitting at the crowded bar
a hostess has her arm around his neck
he checks out the room searching for the girl
he notices two thugs standing outside a sliding door
ich finishes his drink
in japanese let me up
shoving him down sit sweetie
to bartender another seagrams
then spotting something across the room what he sees a rice paper door slides open momentarily revealing a dozen men with close cropped hair sitting on tatami mats playing poker
some have their coats off revealing arms covered with tattoos
a hostess serving drinks steps but leaving the door partially open
the hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room but ich cannot see inside
she slides it shut
ichs hostess wants him to buy another drink but ich shakes his head gets to his feet and pretending to be drunk stumbles toward the sliding doors
ich bumps into a table slaps a stranger on the shoulder then starts singing along with frank sinatra on the stereo
hes a little too loud a little off key
the bodyguards eye ich suspiciously
he stumbles past them then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open
a low table
kobo is at one end
an older distinguished sliver haired man in his seventies whom we will come to know as sugai is at the other
ich cant believe his eyes sugai is the head of the largest yakuza syndicate in japan
a half dozen lieutenants sit on either side of the table
half are older dressed in conservative suits the other half are younger wearing issy miyake jackets
are having a heated discussion
the girl ich and nick have been following walks over to kobo and sits beside him
this makes sugai even more irate
hes on his feet red faced and screaming
seeing ich pull out their berettas
two more grab him and fling him head first against the wall
drunken in japanese i have to piss gentlemen
im so sorry but i have to the bodyguards hurry him towards the door
nick checks his watch its been an hour where the hell is ich
ich comes stumbling up the steps still affecting his drunken pigeon toed walk
nick of course thinks ich has gotten drunk again
two of the bodyguards are watching from inside
i dont believe it
grabs him son of a bitch ich knowing theyre being watched grabs nick by the sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk
under his breath im not drunk
i mean it
this is the end of the line matsumoto
nick shut up
no longer fearing hes being watched ich abruptly stops his affected walk and sounding very sober you shut up
then kobo is inside
hes with sugai the head of the summaguchi clan
ich is dialing on the police call box as he fills nick in on sugai
his man was killed at the printing plant
i want to yank kobo
not without a small army nicklaus san
ich quickly speaks on the police phone then hangs up pleased with himself
ich my name is nick
not nicklaus not nicklaus san not nick san
san is an honorable title
ich realizes its better to drop it
drunken salarymen spill out the door
are standing across the street waiting for the cops to arrive
theyve been following steps out and lights a cigarette
she looks up and spots the two men through the traffic
nick turns away afraid hes been made
when he looks back shes gone back inside
nick races across the street toward the club
horns doesnt understand nick
nick reaches the curb just as the front doors to the club burst open
hes too late
three bodyguards burst out checking the street
a red and white debonnaire pulls up
sugai surrounded by a half dozen additional bodyguards comes out and slips into the car
it tears off down the street
from either end of the street peel around the corner
its a madhouse
the remaining lieutenants and bodyguards fan out trying to elude arrest
nick hurries down the steps
the patrons are still in place but the two side rooms are empty
nick spots kobo going out the rear entrance
he starts after him but is confronted by the bouncer who stopped him earlier
nick connects to the guys jaw before his adversary can raise his hands
the bouncer staggers back
nick flies out the rear door
several lieutenants and bodyguards toss their guns possession is a felony in japan as the police close in
ich hurries in but nicks long gone
the narrow streets are deserted
nick slowly makes his way down the street
the sound of a gunshot
nick ducks for cover its a car backfiring
he continues on
nicks pov of a woman giving a man a blow job in a narrow alley
the mans face is hidden by the shadow
nick continues on
people like charlie are a dime a dozen
nick turns back to see kobo as he steps into the light
kobo tosses a handful of change at nick
keep the change
im taking you back
the girl takes off down the block
here i am
from across the street a dozen bodyguards appear from various doorways and alleys
charlie was a rookie
kobo traces his finger across the spot where he cut nick in new york
but you can take care of yourself
youre the biggest thing to hit this town since godzilla
nick glances at the guards then back at kobo
he is unarmed
to make a move would be suicide
more police sirens in the b
whats the matter
im right in front of you nick
takes a step closer but i was right in front of you when you let charlie die
kobo takes a step forward
his face is inches from nicks
walk away again
maybe youll get used to it
nick doesnt budge
a long beat then
nick turns and slowly walk off
after a dozen yards nick looks back
the street is empty except for a street sweeper pushing his wet broom down the block
a half dozen bodyguards are being frisked then shoved into police cars
ohashi is talking to the enraged nightclub owner
nick steps up to him
ich hurries over
to ohashi a few minutes faster we mightve nailed him
ohashi doesnt say a word hands nick a document
your visa has expired
be on a plane in twenty four hours or you will be deported
while you were hanging out at the visa office we found the son of a bitch
ohashi directs nicks attention across the street where a surveillance van is parked
the rear doors are open revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops
you ruined an on going investigation that could have gotten us more than one runner
to ich in japanese i want a full report in the morning officer
ich bows as ohashi walks off
maybe if youd work with us ohashi ignores him continues walking toward his waiting car
ohashi keeps walking his back toward nick twenty four hours detective
ohashi slips into his car
nick storms up to the car and slams his fist on the window
ohashi faces straight ahead ignoring nick
nick takes the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna
ich grabs nick by his arm pulling him back from the car
the car pulls away
nick whirls and before he realizes what hes doing punches ich below his left eye
ich stumbles back over the curb and lands on his ass
damnit ichiro im tired of people telling me what i can and cant do
no one ever solved anything sitting on their ass
nick beside himself with frustration watches ohashis car disappear down the block
looking up at who walks off without looking back at his partner
nick standing beside the tub dumps a pail of hot water over his head rinsing himself off
he grabs a towel and walks out of the room
ich holding an ice pack to his face is lying on a tatami mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling
an open bottle of seagrams beside him
nick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side of the room and looks up at the ceiling too
the ice help
nothing from ich
where does this sugai live
cold a resort city beppu
i want to go talk to him
because he knows how to get to our man
hell never speak to a gaiijin
ill be a nice gaiijin
nick gets up and goes to the closet
he slides open the door
all of his and charlies clothes have been neatly hung up
he shoves charlies jacket aside
somethings wrong with the way it hangs
he pulls the jacket out runs his hand over the coat feeling something heavy in the lining
nick rips the lining open
beretta and a spare clip tumble out
the little bastard
god bless him
ich takes a drink from his bottle
its very small
its illegal nick
its a new deal
putting it in his waist band coming with me tomorrow
sugais not going to be impressed with your gun nick
i wont put myself in danger for you anymore
nick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the floor
he tosses it to ich
ich reaches for it but misses
youve got better things to do
nick walks out shutting the door behind him
stay on ich watching the door then the last customers find their way to the street some with a little encouragement from a bouncer
joyce steps out
nick comes up to her
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night
somebody must be suffering somewhere youre being so nice
joyce takes off down the street
nick watches her for a beat
i need your help joyce
on the stage a young professional looking man is singing along to summertime blasting from the stereo
the japanese way of letting it all hang out
we find joyce and nick at a corner table having a drink
ive heard of sugai
ive also heard of the emperor
theyre both national treasures
ones a hood
i need someone to translate for me
my japanese isnt that hot
besides youll never get in
its my last shot
i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night
and im supposed to care
you could fake it
joyce finishes her drink sets it down
the neon flickers on the rain slicked pavement
nick and joyce walk down the deserted street
shes carrying an umbrella
youre wrong to sell ich short
hes got a reason
nick shrugs everyones got a reason
his son hooked up with some bikers
a cop shot him running from a robbery
nick looks over for the first time
a father doesnt out live that kind of thing here much less a police officer
wheres the wife
you met her
nick looks surprised
the woman in the apartment
she wont speak to him
but she wont leave either
before nick can respond something catches his eye what he sees partially shadowed standing in the alley
nick grabs his gun
the man steps out zipping up his trousers
its a drunken salaryman
nick lowers his gun
the salaryman staggers down the street singing to himself
not wound too tight
a three story modern building on a quiet street
shes searching for her keys
id invite you up but i know youd hate the incense
as if to explain i chant
what do you chant
nam oyo ranged kyo
you think its dumb of course
not if it works
holding the door open for her ill meet you at the train
i dont remember saying yes
i dont remember you saying no
joyce smiles heads inside
ich is sleeping
nick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket
he drops charlies gun into his pocket
he glances down at ich seeing if hes awake
nick walks out
ich opens his eyes
hes been awake the whole time
ich wearing a blue suit is pouring water over a simple stone with a wooden dipper
next he places incense in a holder and folds his hands in prayer
the photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school uniform
its bulls eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice paddies west of tokyo
women in straw hats stand in the knee deep water pruning the rice by hand
old japan rubbing shoulders with the new
close on nick looking out the window as the countryside shoots past at mph
several children chanting harrow harrow
nick looks over to see three uniformed school children thrusting their notebooks and pens at him
is sitting across from nick
they want your autograph
who am i supposed to be
this little guy thinks youre robert redford
the other one thinks youre charles bronson
tell them im not
she does but the kids insist
theyll never go away
nick reluctantly signs
joyce takes one of the kids notebooks before passing it back
joyce smiles surprised at his choice
then she looks up shocked to see carrying a gift wrapped package under his arm
hes wearing his hat blue suit and tie
ich sits across the aisle from nick and joyce
he doesnt say a word
faces straight ahead
nick looks at joyce then back at ich
im sorry ichiro
i lost it last night
i shouldnt have hit you
still nothing from ich
whats in the box
still not facing him for sugai
caviar french cheese ham
if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting sugai may feel obligated to see you
so i bring some cheese
gifts are expected here
nick nods looks back out the window
hell never understand this country
he looks back to see joyce looking annoyed at him
nick gets the message
im glad youre here
i mean it
ich still wont acknowledge nick
the bullet train disappearing into the foothills
plumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street corner
if you didnt know it was steam youd think the city was on fire
beppu is a resort famous for its geothermal baths
the only traditional house well see in our story
its surrounded by a pool of blood red steaming water from the hot springs
close on a yen bill as it is dropped on the ground
a pair of dice rolls over it
a handful of guards wearing suits and ties are playing craps
ich is sitting on the ground leaning against the wall sound asleep
nick is standing nearby
he checks his watch
tired of waiting he walks over to reading the manichi daily
impatiently they took the gift an hour ago
the phone rings inside the gate
a guard picks it up
certain its bad news alls not lost
theres a famous temple here
we could chant
the guard hangs up calls out to joyce
joyce responds in japanese
the guard opens the gate
a vast austere traditional room with sliding rice paper doors and tatami mats on the floor
ich and joyce drinking tea are sitting with their feet beneath them in the traditional manor
nick smoking is in a semi sprawl using his tea cup as an ashtray
a lieutenant enters
he says something and beckons
they all rise
he says something else
to nick just you
nick enters ducking his head in the low doorway
the shoji slides shut behind him
the furnishings are minimal but elegant
theres a butsudan a tokonoma and a low long table in the middle of the room
nick sits on the floor
a door slides open at the far end of the room
sugai wearing a kimono over western style suit walks in
nick stands up to shake his hand
sugai ignores it and sits in the traditional position feet tucked beneath him
ill spare you the ritual
he tosses him a palm sized bundle
nick catches it
inside are brand new greenbacks hundreds
this supposed to impress me
he sets it down
pick it up
look at it
nick hesitates then picks it up again
he runs his fingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper
seven years work by the finest engraver
mass produced sequentially numbered
the best there has ever been mr
but lets use the short form
im looking for kobo
he killed two of my partners
one in new york one at the printing plant
sugai fills a cup of tea for nick and hands it to him
i dont drink tea
sugai hands it to him anyway
i took kobo from the street
i gave him a home a future
but my ways were too slow for him
i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man
kobo wouldnt serve seven minutes for his oyabun
sipping his tea he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired
i want him
hell be dealt with
sugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before nick
nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in new york
close up nicks fingers tear at the plastic
a block of black iridescent polymer
the negative image of a
a printing plate
our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us
the families who control the casinos
unlike our syndicates your criminals dont understand the words honor and duty
we cant afford not to deal with them
sugai takes the plate back
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar
the feds would be onto you in a month
not with these bills
and even if it only took them six months do you know what our profit margin would be
nick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in sugais garden
why tell me this
the other plate is currently in new york in the hands of kobos man
find it for me
you trust me
ill pay you
nick laughs at sugais audaciousness
indicating the counterfeit bills with these
swiss bank deposit
whatever you want
you know the city and the police
if i say no
youre smarter than kobo
you know the price of deceit
think about it
i dont have to
without a word he gets to his feet and starts toward the door
i have ten hours to grab my man
still walking with his back to nick
you wont get hurt
sugai turns to see nick across the room pointing the beretta at his head
the room where ich and joyce are waiting
their surprise turns to shock when they see nick behind him holding a gun to the old mans head
nick you cant do this
to joyce you dont have to come
she hasnt moved a muscle
sugai watches calmly as nick ich and joyce put their shoes on
nick keeps the gun on him
nick steps out of the house
he now has one end of a wire coat hanger loosely wrapped around sugais neck the other end around his wrist
his gun is pressed just beneath sugais ear
if nick gets shot so does sugai
a handful of guards stand in the courtyard one is polishing sugais debonnaire car
they spot nick and sugai coming and immediately pull their guns
explain to them
they shoot me they kill you
sugai hesitates sugai explains to his lieutenants
they stand helpless as nick walks sugai toward the car
grab the keys ich and get inside
not now man okay not now
work with me
ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car
he gets inside
joyce hurries in bedside him
you dont know what youre doing
nick slides sugai in the back seat carefully reaches over and shuts the door
terrified i cant
joyce furious at nick starts the car gets behind the wheel
ich gets in on the other side
she spins the car around
the gate opens
they tear off
the car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot springs beneath the street
it tears down the narrow block dodging traffic
joyce is concentrating hard on the road
to ich wheres somewhere safe
nothing from ich
hes still apoplectic
angrily you came up with the first part
a four story concrete hotel strictly for making love
love hotels exist all over japan
each have various themes western fifties drive in star wars etc
each complete with music and lighting effects
plastic five foot cacti in front of the western vista on the walls
a hitching post at the head of the bed
cowboy hats and boots at the other end
sugai hangs up the phone and turns to nick and joyce who are sitting nearby
ich hangs up the extension
kobo will meet me here tomorrow
ich nods confirming that what sugai says is true
hell find out you took me
hell kill us
all of us
you dont stand a chance
ich knowing sugai is right looks at nick
nick flips ich the gun
not if were careful
ich checks to make sure the gun is loaded then watches as nick escorts joyce out of the room
the front end of a pink chevy curves around the bed
a drive in movie screen along one wall
nick is dropping change into the vintage wurlitzer
joyce steps in leaving the door open
youre out of your mind
nick doesnt respond
youll get ich killed
no ones keeping him here
and dont tell me this is all just about charlie
why would you care
that pushes her over the line
she moves toward him enraged
nick grabs her arm
youre out of your mind
he grips her tighter
nick and joyce only partially undressed are making love on the floor
the drifters singing under the boardwalk can be heard on the wurlitzer
the fifties decor the music its all pretty incongruous
nick is putting joyce in a taxi
he shuts the door
i still think youre a bastard
what if i chant
beat watch out for ich
the cab drives off
nick watches her taxi until it is out of sight around a corner then heads inside
walking into sugais room
sugais asleep on the bed
ich is vigilantly sitting awake in the corner the gun resting on the table in front of him
better wake him up
the wind twirls a discarded newspaper in the parking lot
a young giggling couple step out of a door arm in arm and disappear down the hall
star wars music from one room
hawaiian music from another
the camera finds the closed elevator door
it opens kobo steps out followed by a half dozen more men all carrying sig saur assault rifles very heavy artillery
wearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch his back to us facing out the window
drop down to a couple are making love in the hawaiian theme room
the door burst open
two men cradling sig saur rifles in their arms step in
they aim at the ceiling blasting into sugais room above
the men ignore her and continue to pump bullets into the ceiling
stop in front of every door long enough to blast into the room
they make their way down the hall
a naked man steps into the hallway and is matter of factly gunned down
kobo and his men stop in front of sugais room
sugai wearing his hat is slumped down on the couch which has been splintered by the bullets from below
kobo signals the men
all six open up through the door
the door whats left of it is kicked open
the six men step in shooting in all directions into the bathroom door into the closet
windows shatter mirrors fall total destruction
kobo walks up to sugai who is slumped on the couch
he lifts up his hat
its a cowboy mannequin wearing sugais clothes
a dozen of sugais men carrying machine pistols come out
nick and ich lie on their bellies guns out
kobos men turn
sugais men open up
three of kobos hitters go down
the others try to flee into the adjoining room
kobo goes for the balcony
as kobo steps out
he steps right into who slams the side of kobos head with the butt of his gun
nick and ich drag kobo in by his jacket collar
sugai very much alive walks in from the hallway
nothing is said
sugai looks at kobo for a long beat then walks out
standing alone in the middle of a tatami room
his face is badly beaten
his hands are bound
two guards stand near the wall
nick and ich stand across the room
wearing a western suit is asking kobo questions in japanese
sugai barks at him again
kobo refuses to answer
sugai pulls up a shuto an inch knife from its scabbard
in japanese contact your associate in new york and tell him to hand my plate over to abolofia
nothing from kobo
you have betrayed the syndicate and personally dishonored me
i would rather the deal fell through than
the guards walk over and turn kobo around
his back is to sugai
sugai runs the sword across the nape of kobos neck drawing blood
the guards tighten their grip on kobos arms
cant believe sugais going to kill him
nick starts to get up ich stops him
kobo realizes sugai isnt just threatening him
ill arrange it
kobo is led back into the room by two guards
the guards shove him down to the floor
his hands are still bound
nick walks over and stands above him
he doesnt say a word
just stands above him
then nick pulls spare change from his pocket and slowly drops the coins one by one in front of kobos face like kobo did to him
he walks away
sugai steps in
abolofias person has received the plate
a door opens at the far end of the room
its kobos girlfriend the one nick and ich had been following
she starts toward kobo a lieutenant intercepts her
in japanese i wanted you to see him like this
in japanese let him go father
realizing shes sugais daughter
in japanese youre too old
in japanese thats enough
sugai turns away and picks up the sword
the guards clutch kobo
sugais going to kill kobo after all
the girl screams at him to stop
that wasnt our deal
you want him dead too
after a court convicts him
he belongs to me
theres a long pause
then something unusual happens
sugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten kobos wrist
when he does sugai hands kobo the sword and demands that he cut off his finger
this is yubitsume the ritual act within the yakuza of slicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a mistake
kobo not believing in this ancient tradition refuses
sugai nods to a guard who places kobos finger on the table
stares defiantly at sugai
he doesnt even wince as the blade slices off his finger
the guard hands sugai the finger in a handkerchief
looking at nick if anything happens to abolofia or my plate detective
hold on nick then as it bursts out of a tunnel on its way to tokyo
kobo is sitting by the window his hands cuffed in front of him
another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest
nick pours a drink from an airline sized bottle of scotch
he holds it out to
its his first drink in a week
just one compadre
they clink glasses
ich drinks it down
it took years to make it you could take five minutes to drink it
ich slows down
you did great ichiro
i called ohashi hell be waiting
smiling i like him waiting
ich gets up
he heads for the bar car leaving kobo and nick alone
kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice paddies then back down the aisle at the salarymen in their identical suits then at the women separated from
a couple of thousand years theyve been bound by these little rules
ugly little lives
save it i already took the tour
you are a lucky man
where you come from a man can stand out
here a man is made to look a fool for standing out
nick isnt paying much attention
i like your friend joyce
guess im on a roll
shes such a long way home for you
time ive got plenty of
a raucous salaryman comes down the aisle singing an enka swaying with the train bumping into seats
a common enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers
the salaryman stumbles and falls across nicks lap
helping him up hey hey come on blow
the salaryman bows deep
nick ignores it
the man moves on
kobo looks out the window the train begins to slow as it approaches the next station
matter of factly this is my stop
nick looks up to see kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond hair tied with black ribbon
i have her
nick looks down the car
the drunk salaryman who stumbled over nick is quite sober
he made the hand off to kobo
kobo holds out his wrists
matter of factly ill kill her
nick reluctantly unlocks both sets of cuffs
the train pulls into the station
i want the plate from your pal sugai
when you get it you get her
kobo gets up starts down the aisle
sugai wont give it to me you know that
then take it from him
kobo gets off the train
follows him to the door
kobo get into a waiting jaguar
four guards nearby
nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the jaguar in sight as the train pulls out
the car is gone
bursts into the packed bar car
everyone turns around
it slows into the station
nick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule ignoring a conductors angry shouts
the train stops
nick flies out and starts running dodging the crowd
three uniformed policemen including ohashis assistant hurry toward him theyre dismayed to find that kobo is gone
instead of offering him help the policemen grab him and slap a pair of handcuffs on nicks wrists
what the hell are you doing
nick waiting alone in the cell
its been hours
a door at the end of the hall opens
ohashi stops in front of his cell
your plane leaves at six
two officers will escort you
for gods sake ohashi i need your help
let me out of here
you had my help detective
if anything happens to her while im here do you know where she is detective
do you know how to find her
even where to start
we will find them
i have to get to sugai
ohashi keeps walking
the loud clank of metal on metal
yelling at the top of his lungs hold on nick his fingers squeezing the bars in rage then flood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side of the
we pan over to kobo at a phone kiosk outside a gas station
in japanese yes
kobos girl sugais daughter hangs up the phone
shes been on the other end of the line
the door swings open
sugai is sitting on the floor
the girl is carrying a tray of tea
beneath the tray we spot something else the butt of a short bladed tanto
a police car rolls through the service gate
we see nick inside the car along with two police guards
a white room
jet engines can be heard through the walls
nick is sitting on the floor defeated
he doesnt look up when he hears someone enter
ill tell you one thing
you cant solve a thing sitting on your ass
nick looks up
ich is in uniform
a revolver and batton hang from his white web gear
his undershirt bulges through his khaki shirt
he looks ridiculous
nick has never seen a more beautiful sight
ich is driving
nick is seated behind a cage in the back seat
his hands are cuffed
ich is driving through the freight area towards a perimeter guard
i was ready to have your ass for taking off on me
i followed them
an hour from the train station
how many men
i couldnt tell
i dont know
we need the plate to negotiate with
the car slows
ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing him his papers
the guard takes a good hard look at nick
time stands still
he waves them through
nick can breath again
you know ichiro you just burned your bridges
ich is silent for a moment
he hands nicks beretta back through the partition
so it goes
nick looks for ichs eyes in the rearview mirror
the little cop keeps driving his eyes on the road
nick and ich are standing outside their car
the police radio crackles from inside
a large crowd gathered outside of sugais estate
police have cordoned off the area
an empty ambulance is parked out front with various other cars debonnaires cadillacs
a boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball against the compound wall
whatever happened is long over
ich flips off the radio
someone attacked him
now weve got nothing to negotiate with
the police car streaks across endless fields
nick is at the wheel
he rubs the sleep from his eyes
ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road
ich pulls out a cigarette
nick lights it for him
joyce told me about your family
ich looks up surprised
beat you have one
ich glances over at nick then back at the road
nicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the accelerator
a small contemporary house perched on a dry piece of land
a paved road lined with dense foliage runs on a berm between the flooded rice paddies
sitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff
theres no easy way in
ich hands charlie his shuto an inch long knife
whats that for
nick tucks the shuto inside his jacket
nick opens up his door and climbs out
you know nick we cant lose
stopping whys that
because were the biggest things to hit this town since godzilla
leading to the house lined with foliage
the rice paddies on either side
making their way through the waist high water
with their hoes make their way into the water
they dont see our cops
making their way along the edge of the road
the sound of a motorcycle coming
slows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and onto the dirt berm toward the house
hes one of kobos bosozoku a long way from the streets of tokyo
the rider comes around the bend to see standing in a uniform
for a moment he doesnt know what to do
then he draws a pistol from his belt and accelerates toward ich
stands his ground as the bike closes in
the biker takes aim
ich drops off to the side as rises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he passes catching the man across the face
the rider drops like a swatted fly
the bikers momentum carries it a few yards before it falls and skids to a halt
nick hurries to the bike
ich drags the biker off the road then catches up to his partner
raise the heavy bike
he takes the riders helmet and goggles from ich and puts them on
what are you going to do
nick doesnt know exactly
he taps the bike into gear it torques like a mule
theres a lot more juice here than hes used to
nick fishtails for a minute then gets the hang of it
ich heads off taking another route
are putting the last of their belongings into a suitcase
she hands him the plate sugais plate
kobo kisses her as he slips it into his breast pocket
the sound of a motorcycle approaching from outside
kobo steps out and not recognizing nick raises his hand to greet what he thinks is one of his men
bearing down on kobo
as nick keeps coming
he is unable to see clearly until nick is almost on top of him
dumps the bike at the foot of the stairs and leaps on kobo
nick and kobo roll off the narrow porch
nick breaks free
he isnt fighting fair this time
he slams his foot into kobos face and ribs
kobo tries to get up but nick knees him in the chin
a woman cries out in japanese
nick turns to see standing at the top of the steps
a biker is pressing the muzzle of a sig saur assault rifle on her
kobos girl is beside them holding a small pistol
gets to his feet
the biker tosses kobo the rifle
kobo works the charging lever and holds the weapon at his side
he has all the time in the world
kobo whirls and kicks nick in the groin
nick falls to his knees in agony
kobo towers above nick as he did in the alley in new york
still on your knees nick
kobo walks off his back to nick
theres nothing you can do for me anymore
i have the plate
no there is something
he walks up to the steps to joyce
you can tell me who i should shoot first
nick struggles to get to his feet
kobo turns and faces nick at the foot of the steps
appears behind kobo and takes him down with an amazing display of baton work that shows a lifetime of training
he grabs the gun
a biker bursts out of the door
ich fires hitting him in the thigh
he drops his gun
grabs the gun
tackles her and wrestles the gun away
she grabs for it
nick slugs her
ich is hit in the back of his shoulder falls onto the porch
the shooter is holding a pistol a glock automatic
he fires at who scramble for cover
continues firing as he climbs onto a motorcycle
he pops the clutch and flies off down the road
nick fires after him but kobos gone
to ich you all right
to joyce call for help
nick mounts the other bike and puts the turbo charged rocket into gear
rain pours down as kobo turns onto the main road
he opens up the throttle and in less than a second hes a screaming dot in the distance
comes around the same corner
his bike fishtails and slides out from under him
kobo tears past a police car
the police car takes off after him
a series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep densely forested hills
kobos bike flies up the road
the police car cant keep up begins losing ground
going flat out falling further and further behind
kobos going to escape
nick bent low shoots past the cop car
his left arm is scraped and bloody
glancing back to see nick gaining on him
he gives it more gas
pulling eight five
the rain stings his face
its hard to keep his eye open
kobo leaning into one of the steep turns climbing higher and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the peak
is gaining on him
he hears something coming up behind him
the one ich shot in the leg is closing fast on his tail
as the biker draws even
pulls out his long knife and slashes at nicks shoulder
nick drops back causing him to miss
the biker drops back
nick tries to speed up but the biker sticks with him
hes a good rider this boy
very very good
the biker moves in again blade drawn
something the biker doesnt
coming around the corner
swerves to avoid it at the last moment
the biker reacts too late and runs radiator of the two ton truck and disappears beneath its wheels
around the bend glancing back
he eases up on the throttle a free man
he circles back only to see burst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred and twenty miles per hour in the driving rain
waits and waits
nick draws closer
then kobo tears off back down the mountain shooting past nick
he slows down and starts to turn but the wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid heading right for the edge of the road
flying over the edge of the road and down the cliff
nick lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff his arm is probably broken
he tries to get up with a one arm push up
his head falls into a puddle of water
the whine of an approaching motorcycle
kobo has come back for him
nick in excruciating pain struggles for his gun
bearing down on nick
struggling to get his gun
finally he does
but its caked in mud
if the barrel is stuffed it will explode
nick has to take the chance
closer and closer
aims as best he can and fires
the mud caked gun explodes in his hand
nick screams in agony
pulls his bike up inches in front of nicks head
nick seems to be bleeding everywhere his hand his nose his mouth the side of his head
kobos face and neck is caked in blood from when nick beat him
the rain pours down
he picks up the gun
points it at nick squeezes the trigger
he tosses the gun in front of nicks face
the sound of approaching police sirens
kobo swings the bike around goes a hundred yards down the road then swings back
kobo guns the engine
he gain speed
thirty thirty five
struggles to get up
opening the throttle
crawling a few inches thats it
twenty yards away
reaches into his coat and pulls ichs inch shuto out
he rolls away at the last moment slashing kobos ankle as he races past
screams in pain
he tries to stop too suddenly
the bike flips over
kobo flies into the air then hits the pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road
he stops on his back
its lucky hes alive
the sound of fast approaching police sirens
has fallen out of kobos jacket
it rests in the road halfway between the two men
crawls toward it on his belly
mustering all his strength struggles across the road on all fours
crawling snake like
still moving his arms and legs feel like lead
as they reach for the plate
grabs kobos wrist forcing him to drop the plate
nick picks up a rock
it looks as if hes going to smash kobos head
instead he brings it down on the plate shattering it in a half dozen pieces
nick tosses the pieces in front of kobos face
keep the change
nick exhausted slowly falls onto his back
he looks over at kobo their faces are inches apart
nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows
the same gesture kobo made to nick through the two way mirror in new york
nick passes out
his eyes shut
the sound of three police cars screeching to a halt
the sounds of the police sirens winding down
the sirens get softer mixing with the sound of ringing phones clacking typewriters voices
fifty identical desks
fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights
is at his desk studying a report
suddenly the lights go out
the fans stop so do the electric typewriters
ohashi looks up to see walking toward him down the long aisle his left arm is bandaged his right hand handcuffed to kobo on crutches
ich silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to ohashis desk
stops in front of the desk and snaps to attention
constable ichiro matsumoto presents captured prisoner kobo chief inspector ohashi
inspector ohashi will take charge of the prisoner
ich uncuffs kobo and steps aside to reveal standing at the far end of the room by the fuse box
hes also bandaged and on crutches
nick looks at ohashi without saying a word then flips the main switch up
the lights and fans start working
he turns and walks out the door
a small decoration ceremony
getting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress uniform
in the far corner ichiros wife dressed in a formal kimono watch the ceremony
joyce and nick are sitting alone at a table
nicks left arm in in a sling
cant make you change your mind
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head
might be different in new york
if i come visit we can find out
id like that
ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles
you can do it
nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand
he begins to slurp the noodles
louder pal louder
joyce give the assistant chief inspector a drink would you
as joyce refills all their cups we
a sun shower
oliver is standing by the window watching the rain pour down
remember counterfeiting is the feds
theyll be all over abolofias place
the other plate he does real time
reveal nick sitting in front of olivers desk his one arm is still in a sling
nick gets to his feet
still not facing him you know nick if youd held on to that plate you couldve been a very rich man
oliver turns to face nick
nick just looks at him then never crossed my mind
oliver nods he believes him
be careful on the run
in contrast to the japanese police station its chaos
cops are in every imaginable kind of dress trash cans over flow a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone who will listen
a dozen men in all are donning flak jackets and windbreakers with police and treasury stenciled on the back
walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his shoulder
he squeezes past the raiding party to find sitting at a desk thumbing through a frommers guide to new york city
nick drops one of the vests on the desk
it lands like a ton of bricks
ich continues to read
a sergeant walks in
hard team in the first unit
conklin your rmp awaits
the cops and treasury men grabbing their gear head for the door
nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm
sure you want to come
probably better than the greyline tour
ich stands up shoves the guidebook in his back pocket
he helps nick fasten the strap in back
you wouldnt make it without me
nick smiles takes the frommers out of ichs pocket and tosses it into the trash
nick hands him a shotgun takes another one off the rack for himself
we watch from behind as the two men head down the long hallway toward the exit
think well get him nick
we cant lose
how can you be so sure
nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway
they step out into the sunlit rain
cause youre the biggest thing to hit this town since
before nick can finish his line the door slams shut behind them
