by skip woods january final production draft we hear over
you know the problem with hollywood
they make shit
unbelievable unremarkable shit
im not some grungy filmmaker wannabee searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke
its easy to pick apart bad acting short sighted directing or the purely moronic stringing together of words many of the studios term as prose
no im talking the lack of realism
not a pervasive element in the modern american cinematic vision
three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking
two of the men sit on one side of the table stanley is in his early thirties agent roberts early forties
both wear suits the youngers is fairly expensive and well cut the others is polyester enough said
the man across however is quite different
he is what they used to call a cool cat
take dog day afternoon for example
arguably pacinos greatest performance excepting the godfather part i and scarface of course
a masterpiece of directing easily lumets best
the acting the script cinematography all top notch
but they didnt push the envelope
what if in dog day sonny really wanted to get away with it
what if and heres where it gets tricky
what if theyd started killing hostages
no mercy no quarter meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head bam splatter
still no bus
how many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations
and this was
fast forward to the present same situation
can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media
in hours it would be the top story from boston to budapest
all caught in millimeter zoom computer enhanced and color corrected
you would practically taste the brain matter
six hostages die
one after another
all over a bus a plane and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured
he sits letting the pictures sink in then just a thought
i mean its not really within the realm of conventional cinema but what if
you know this movie of yours i dont think it would have worked
shrugs audiences love happy endings
with the money
boyfriend gets the sex change operation
they live happily ever after
stanley shakes his head
stanley shakes his head
bad guy cant win
its a morality tale
one way or the other hes gotta go down
life does tend to be stranger than fiction
looking at watch well guys gotta jet
this place is kinda dead
camera pans around the coffee shop
not a soul in the place
we continue to pan around degrees to the front door which is open
outside the open doorway are crouched a squad of heavily body armored swat members packed together and aiming automatic weapons inside
thanks for the coffee
he gets up
in his left hand which has been hidden by the table until now he is holding a strange looking spring loaded grip
gabriel is looking back at them
rene descartes is sitting in some bar in paris
bartender says hey you want another drink
descartes says i think not
he smiles at his own joke then turns and walks over to the front door
no one even twitches
i wont ask again
he lifts up the device in his left hand
who nods his head
the swat team moves back letting gabriel out of the coffee shop
gabriel looks back at stan sitting in the booth
stan slides from the booth as gabriel exits the coffee shop silence no sounds on the soundtrack
gabriel and stanley stop just outside the doorway
gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades then continues across the sidewalk and into the street
he nonchalantly looks up
suddenly the thump of helicopters and the wail of sirens dominates the soundtrack
helicopters rip the sky l
county pd and a bunch of news vultures
squad cars block off both ends of the street while swat trucks news vans and looky loos are packed together into the distance
sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are positioned on every open rooftop
hundreds of weapons are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as if hes on his way to sunday service without a care in the world
slowly stanley follows gabriel into the street
gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk a huge armored bus blocks most of the windows
he walks beside the bus under a huge world banc sign and through the glass front door which shuts in our face
he turns away from the window and we follow him
the interior of the bank looks like new orleans on fat tuesday
three hummers sit in the middle of the floor surrounded by broken glass
between them rests a bright red ferrari f gabriels
all but one of the front windows of the bank the one with the door in it has been welded over with inch plate steel
over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor arms cable tied behind their backs
something has been duct taped around their chests and each is wearing what appears to be a dog collar
the other occupants of the room are nine men
all of whom would look as if they were attending the fashion event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons each one carries
how we doin
one of the armed men finishes putting a collar on a young normally good looking but now covered in mascara whimpering blonde girl
take her out
the front door opens and one of the suited men drags out the pretty blonde from earlier
she is sobbing and is in such grief she cant even walk
on the sidewalk the suited man his automatic weapon slung holds her up for everyone to see
gabriel grabs his cell and dials
roberts sits in the starbucks which has been transformed into a high tech command center reading a newspaper
we cannot see the headlines
federal and state officers scramble around handling problems
the phone rings
assistant director bill joy a
joy an older looking guy who looks more like an accountant than an assistant director of the fbi is handed the phone
is everyone in position
looks up from paper what are you doing
we pan around
to swat leader get her at your first opportunity
into mike high ground one and two
you have a green light
ive seen what this man is capable of the f
does not negotiate with terrorists
i assumed youd be aware of that
answering phone joy
roberts picks up an extension
dont talk listen
when i made my dog day afternoon analogy i was not speaking metaphorically
we have hostages
each has been wrapped with pounds of c four explosives
swat guys making their way to the roof of the bank
on top of that we have taped pounds of stainless steel ball bearings making them the worlds largest walking claymore mines
aiming down at gabriels merc
the merc is holding up the weeping girl so everyone can see what gabriel is talking about
unbeknownst to him red laser aiming dots appear on gabs mercs chest
stanley is being held by two of the well dressed men
around her neck is a radio frequency electronic dog collar roberts stops short as he hears this
he and joy both look at each other
dog walks out of his yard he gets the shit shocked out of him
hearing this roberts stands back up
stop them in slow motion a
joy jumps for his radio
same thing their yard is this bank
so dont fuck with me
swat members move into position along the peripheral
the merc turns toward them
the momentum swings his shouldered weapon upward in slow motion
into mike hold your the swat snipers take this weapon movement as an aggressive act and fire into the merc the bullets ripping into him
a swat armored vehicle rushes in one of the team jumps out in an attempt to rescue the woman
hysterical the hostage runs back toward the bank confusing the swat guy trying to rescue her
he reaches for her but she fights him
finally he grabs her around the waist and carries her on his shoulder into the street as she screams toward the bank for help
as he steps off the sidewalk
she is screaming nooooo
as it continues its stride
around her neck
the green light blinks to red
ball bearings ricochet against the plate steel of the bank
the ball bearings bounce across the street and tap against the coffee shop
everyone in the coffee shop looks at each other like what just happened
as ball bearings roll back into the street
axl torvalds enters customs
a thirty something european who could easily pass for a season regular on sprockets
we pull back
torvalds is watching anxiously as his bags are torn into like christmas day at the griswalds
the two customs agents eye his three laptops suspiciously
heavy finnish accent please be careful one of the agents cuts off his plea with a glance
to himself almost inaudibly that equipment is quite expensive
torvalds is wary of time
after several moments his bags are being repacked when another passport is found
the customs official holds up two passports
another customs official takes them and walks over to torvalds
could you step over here please
torvalds glances at his watch
how long am i going to be delayed
itll be just a moment
torvalds stands to the side while two customs officials compare his passports
they step over to a computer terminal and punch in some data
torvalds notices a customs department employee wheeling a cart of confiscated items out of a nearby service elevator
he pushes the cart out of the oversized elevator
torvalds shoots a glance back to the two officials discussing his situation
torvalds casually picks up his computer case and coolly walks over to the elevator
torvalds walks in just as the doors close
the customs officials conferring look around
torvalds is gone
one of them looks up and sees the numbers changing above the elevator
the customs officials race up to the escalator to the torvalds exits the elevator and coolly makes his way to the pedestrian walkway
hes halfway across it when multiple security teams appear and converge on him from both ends
hes finally wrestled to the ground
flipping a badge in torvalds face axl torvalds
you are under arrest
senator james reisman r
georgia strides confidently into a small windowless boardroom
this better be important you pulled me out of session
darwin kaplan the presidents aide and one of the four men in the room definitely the most intense smiles thinly
senator i wouldnt have asked you to come here if it wasnt
the senator starts to sit down
kaplan turns toward the senator
senator we just received a communication that axl torvalds was intercepted entering the continental u
within the last two hours
according to our source inside the f
he was nabbed coming through customs at l
do they know who they are dealing with
it is unlikely sir
it was a routine check and torvalds freaked out
they just got lucky
this aint good boys
the vortex has used torvalds before
what do the feds know
nothing as of yet
hes refusing to speak english and the finnish consulate has already contacted the state department
so we havent been compromised
were not sure
were working on that right now
you better get sure real quick son cause someones cocks liable to end up on the block on this one
and i promise you it wont be mine
senator i think well be okay here i dont fucking pay you to think kaplan
i pay you to keep me informed
i know the vortex
thats why i voted against using him on american soil
its like using the ebola virus to cure a cancer patient
son what do you thinks going to happen if he starts tying up loose ends
they look at each other
we are indeed in the middle of nowhere no nothing as far as you can see
we continue to crane up a ferrari modena flies down the road in a cloud of suspended gravel toward stanleys dilapidated piece o crap trailer
stan stands on the roof of his trailer which was a dilapidated shack in the s and now is a lot worse
a chained but scruffy looking rottweiler runs around in front of the trailer
stan looks completely different than he did in the opening sequence
he hasnt taken very good care of himself
his hair is long and right now standing on end
he is wearing nothing but a dirty towel and is slicing golf balls off the roof
as the ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at it but he just isnt very good
nevertheless after a dozen bad hits a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum hood
stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel driveway and turns back to his work
as we hear the door shut and someone comes up the aluminum extension ladder
a few moments later in slow motion ginger appears at the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailers roof
stan turns around
she is what the hack writers of the thirties would call a vision
thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice
in the low rent light of stanleys white trash haven she is by definition a goddess
who are you supposed to be
she lights a cigarette inhales deeply then exhales
she knows his name
is that right
for someone the n
has listed as the most dangerous hacker in america you sure dont look like much
dont look so surprised
i know everything there is to know about you stan
from your moms maiden name to how big your
she glances downward then back up
bank account is
howd you get past my dog
cute boys like me
what are you selling again
did i say i was selling something
im here to help you stan
look at you youre a mess
my employer wants to meet you
youre not very good at this are you
youre fucking up my chi
can i see that
begrudgingly he hands her the club
she tees up a ball pulls up her skirt far enough to reveal thong and whack hits a ball that tiger woods would envy
she smiles hands him the club back and pulls down her skirt
you need to straighten your left arm
youre bending it
he looks at her
he does and the ball goes flying yards perfect whacking a fridge with yards painted on it
stan looks at the club then tosses it to the ground climbing back down an aluminum extension ladder that leads up through a makeshift hatch on the roof
she follows but stan ignores her and walks into his bedroom
she walks over opens and reaches into the fridge this is not a nice place you have here stanley
and pulls out a beer ive only been here a few minutes and im already starting to feel sorry for myself
she walks into stan walks back in looking for semi clean clothes
youre wasting your time
i even touch a computer i go straight to leavenworth do not pass go do not collect dollars
whatever i was
stanley pulling on his pants lets the sentence hang unfinished
hes putting on his shoes
she squats down in front of him resting her hand on his leg
stanley think about it they still teach your techniques at she smiles up at him then takes a long drink of her beer
stan stares at her a moment then
im not here to suck your dick stanley you can sit around doing the martyr thing as long as you like
hell pay you just to meet you
smiles i gotta go to work
oh thats right and fine work it is too
beat have you spoken to holly lately
she just dropped a megaton thermonuclear warhead into stanleys universe
stanley practically pitches her down the steps of his trailer and slams the door
a telephone rings in a multi zillion dollar malibu beach house
a woman late twenties grabs the receiver
her voice is of perfect timbre and accentless
beat holly home
new york starts to invade her accentless accent stanley
why are you calling here
he stands in front of his now closed fridge
it is covered with pictures of his daughter holly
i want to talk with holly
intercut between the two
melissas accent continues to travel eastward from midwest flat to full tilt long island
looks at her watch its twelve thirty stanley
shes in school
you know its illegal for you to talk to her
dont do this mel
its not good for holly how the hell would you know what is or isnt good for my daughter
youve spent the last two years in prison
mel stop calling me that stanley
i just want to see my baby
well she doesnt want to see you stanley and i swear to fucking god if you contact her ill have larrys attorney throw you into a hole so deep and
dark itll make leavenworth seem like two weeks in vegas during which ill personally pay two ball busting skin heads to wow mel you can take the girl out of the trailer park but you cant take the trailer park out of the girl
she regains control
her voice is accentless once again
exhaling i will not let myself be manipulated by you stanley
larrys her father now
larrys the porn king larrys a film financier a good husband and an astute businessman
what films hes involved in are a function of profitability and none of your business
she is now downright icy
get help stanley get into a program get a therapist get a dog but whatever you do stay away from my child
shes our child
she will never be your child
youll never have the kind of money to match larrys lawyers in court
the phone goes dead
stanley freaks beats the receiver against the fridge again and again
then he calmly hangs up the phone
stanley walks down the steps of his trailer
ginger sits on the hood of her car in all her estrogenic glory smoking and petting stans dog
what are you doing here
stanleys dog leans against her happy
to dog like traitor judas
she smiles at him
he smiles back about ready to stick her in the trunk of her car
look im beginning to lose my sense of humor about lets cut through the bullshit stan
if you ever want to have a chance in hell of getting your daughter back youll shut up and listen
unless of course you want to stay here in your pathetic loser life while she learns what its like to be a fluffer in one of her new daddys videos
do me the courtesy of not confusing your own childhood with my daughters
look at your situation stanley
for twenty months youve been in court six times each time your custody case has been thrown out
your situation doesnt look good sweetheart
she blows smoke at him thinking then whips out her trump card
how much would it cost to retain the best family lawyer in the country and regain custody of your daughter
all the way through the jury trial
she pulls out a large manila envelope
opens it and dumps the rubber banded stacks of hundreds onto the ground
this should get you started
stanley just stares at the money
he looks up at ginger
whattaya have to lose
just meet him
you dont like the setup walk away
and you keep the money
she smokes letting it all sink in
she puts out her cigarette
they just stare at each other
torvalds sits at a table in a room with a two way mirror
to his left a three piece suited euroweasel obviously his lawyer nurses a steaming cup of coffee while providing air cover from the two interrogating fbi agents
the table is covered with empty coffee cups and cigarette carcasses
roberts eases quietly into the room in mid interrogation
torvalds says something in finnish to his lawyer
what did he say
torvalds again speaks to his lawyer in finnish
your client is wanted on counts of electronic crimes in seven different countries finland does not recognize these allegations as crimes
your laws do you see a finnish flag hanging on the wall ikea boy
torvalds speaks to his lawyer
what did he say
he said ikea is swedish
he understands english
the fbi agents head is now close to imploding
guys why dont you give me a few minutes here
they turn to see roberts smiling
just a couple of minutes
youve fucked up now hamlet
never taking his eyes off torvalds and michaels
hamlet was a dane
roberts sits down in a chair facing torvalds
he stares at him a moment just smiling then
why would the number one cracker in the world risk life imprisonment to enter the continental u
my client has repeatedly reserved his right not answer any questions at this time
torvalds looks at roberts badge and says something in finnish the only recognizable word being roberts
the attorney and torvalds both laugh
roberts looks at the attorney
he told me to tell mister roberts that he is quite fond of the x files
again they smile
roberts looks at the lawyers cup of steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into the lawyers lap
you need another cup of coffee jumping up in great pain goddammit
roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the wall then pushes him out the door with a kick in the ass
he grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him and locks the door
he turns on torvalds smacking him across the face
he pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of him
until a year ago i was head of the largest task force on cyber criminals in the entire world
but i burned out
i shot a suspect in the fucking hand
do you know how hard it is to work a keyboard with one hand
whatever you can do to me he can do worse
im already dead
the only place i stand a chance is back in my country
i have friends there
i tell you what you tell me what i want to know and i guarantee youll be on the next flight to finland
courtesy of the u
torvalds thinks quietly
two fbi agents bad agents watch the interrogation through a two way mirror
one of the agents looks surprisingly like gabriels merc that carried the young blonde girl killed outside the bank earlier
over speaker ill tell you what i know
the agents look at each other
bad agent dials his cell phone
into his cell yes this is assistant director joy would you find agent roberts
its important that i speak with him as soon as possible
who is he
a yellow lamborghini diablo drives up
in slow motion gabriel steps out of the car wind whipping his full length black gucci overcoat
he exists in a world beyond your world
what we only fantasize he does
he lives a life where nothing is beyond him
but it is all an act
gabriel walks through the crowd as if a celebrity
for all his charisma and charm
for all his wealth and expensive toys
exchanging kisses and the lingering of hands as he slides through parting seas of beautiful people
beneath it all he is a driven unflinching calculating machine who takes what he wants when he wants then disappears it works like this
i fly to where i am to meet him
he sends one of his people to meet me
a boeing screams overhead
we tilt down
stanley and ginger walk out of lax
a white limo idles directly in front of them
stanley is wearing a black t shirt which proclaims in large white letters across his chest in true scarlet letter fashion loser
he tells me what he needs
i do my job im paid
upstairs on a lavish balcony gabriel looks at the crowd
and i leave
thats a real nice story
but you havent given me shit
torvalds knows this and smiles at roberts arrogantly
the door opens an fbi agent sticks his head in
excuse me sir
you have a call
so take a message
its assistant director joy he said its important
at least its not my wife
to torvalds you need to think about what else you know
then to agent watch him
roberts walks out of the room
the fbi agent positions himself outside the door
roberts walks out of the room
torvalds attorney is there
you will be hearing from my gover shut up
roberts walks down the hall
the attorney pissed walks back into the interrogation room
one of the two agents watches the door the other bad agent steps over to the two way mirror
torvalds talks to his attorney in finnish
apparently his attorney is trying to convince him of something
torvalds unfazed walks over to the one way mirror
pull back from torvalds to reveal bad agent calmly screwing a silencer on to his
torvalds leans closer to the glass
bad agent sticks the silenced barrel of the gun up against the glass right between the eyes of torvalds
bad agent moves the barrel up and down between torvalds face and neck
torvalds looks smugly into the glass
he lifts his hand holding up his middle finger
bad agent moves his aim to torvalds tonsils
he depresses the trigger slightly
torvalds middle finger in the air smiles
unbeknownst to him however a tiny red aiming laser has zipped through the glass and is now positioned as a dot on torvalds throat
satisfied with the placement he pulls the trigger
roberts walks down the hall and turns right into roberts picks up the phone
this is roberts i have a call from a
you needed me
what do you mean
you didnt call me
you just called me
realization slowly hits him he drops the phone and runs from the room
roberts runs down the hall and into roberts finds torvalds and his attorney dead
roberts looks into the mirror
six clean bullet holes perforate his reflection
a huge lavish converted theater in downtown los angeles
a st century version of on equal overdoses of steroids and acid
stanley and ginger walk into a large area with individual private booths in small rooms around the perimeter
the rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge thick velvet drapes
i wish youd let me buy you a suit
im happy with what im wearing
you have no self esteem stanley
dryly i know
they walk into one of the booths in the back
sitting around a large oval table is our antihero gabriel shear surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle of beautiful model types
ginger kisses gabriel and with a healthy exchange of fluids then
gabriel smiles then looks back at stanley
gabriel just stares
very familiar big stan
you know they say its the clothes that make the man
you buy it
then buy you a drink
i flew fifteen hundred miles for this meeting how bout we get to the point
actually you flew miles for grand
but thats not the point
stanley sits down
gabriel pours stan a glass of crown
i heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the f
s carnivore program that was actively reading every subscribers e mail and scrambled the systems
he did what the federal judges wouldnt do and kept the government out of our privacy
i think i heard that
story is he went to jail and the federal carnivore program is back in full swing
it was a real tragedy
what can i do for you
changing the subject
stanley meet helga
the beautiful woman to stanleys right slides closer
heavily accented hi stanley
stanley looks at her shes a knockout artificially perfect
he looks back at gabriel
look i dont have a lot of patience for this stanley we have a problem maybe you can help us out
stan looks around everyone is smiling
helga moves closer to him
take a look at this
he is handed an open laptop it glows
he sets it on the table and spins it around in front of stanley
like an alcoholic faced with a fifth of tequila you know i cant touch that
helga pours a shot of tequila
you like tequila stanley
helga shoots the tequila then turns to stanley places her lips against his
the gold liquid drips from their lips as she spits it into stanleys mouth
he pushes her away breaking the liplock and swallowing the tequila
she licks it from his face
no need for modesty were all friends here stanley
this is bullshit
i came you want something from me amigo i want something from you
dbase bit r
stanleys having a little trouble concentrating on gabriel
helga begins sucking on stanleys fingers
he pulls them away
so it can be done
maybe slide in a trojan horse hiding a worm
something like that
is this an interview
marco lets give him some incentive
the drapes close
two of gabriels crew step out
marco yanks out a
caliber glock and quickly screws a well used silencer onto the end
marco walks around behind stanley
now totally confused what are you doing
helga smiles then drops her head into stanleys lap
we hear his pants unzip
he has to go with it
ive been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes
unfortunately i need someone who can do it in sixty seconds
stan realizes now no one is smiling
he grabs the blonde by the hair but cant pull her up
forty five seconds
time is a wasting big guy
the silencer is pressed into the back of his head
stanley tries to focus on the screen
stanley sucks air through his teeth trying to focus
you have thirty seconds stanley
stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands start flying over the keyboard
we intercut the action with a closeup of stanleys hands working the keyboard and a closeup of gabriel and a closeup of the lcd screen which reads in flashing red
letters shes very good isnt she stanley
tension builds as stanley continues to work the keyboard
faster and faster
he grabs her head
she doesnt come up
the screen flashes too bad stanley
ya gotta die
marco puts the silencer to his eye
the gun is empty
stanley tries to catch his breath
helga lifts up her head
gabriel walks around the table
i was just fucking with you stan
stanley is pissed
helga smiling kisses him on the cheek
stanley tries to calm down
he gets up shoots someones half drank drink zips his pants then so was i
stanley hits the enter key and spins the computer around
access granted appears and the department of defense logo scrolls across the screen
stanley gives them all a fuck you smile then stomps out through the curtain
stanley pushes into the bathroom
he kicks the wastebasket across the room
he pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink
he turns on the water and washes his face
slowly he leans his forehead against the mirror
ginger appears behind him
what are you looking at
you can do this
get away from me
i want to help you
help what squeegee my brain off the ceiling
it was just a test stan you passed
ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her plastic overcoat
i dont know why i let you talk me into this
i cant believe how desperate i am
she exhales toward stanley
i thought you were here saving your daughter stanley
he turns around
id do anything to get holly back
but if i end up in a box or back in jail then i really cant help her can i
what i should do is take my money and go back to court
back to court
back to melissas gladiators
you throw a hundred grand at her shell throw five back at you
its not about holly its about beating you
you know that
what im thinking about is that youre willing to put a gun to my head to see if i can hack suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom
ginger interrupts him by slamming stan between the urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the kind of wet aggressive action that takes a movie from pg to
when the kids realize that the urinals are occupied they leave
slowly ginger takes her tongue out of stans mouth
they look at each other
she smiles at him
a beat for a moment there exists something between them then bam shes all business again
so let me sum it up for you stanley
you live in a trailer
beat youre a felon working a dead end job
you want to get holly back gabriels your only shot
as he realizes shes right hes got nothing to lose
he smacks the mirror with his fist then walks out of the rest room
ginger slowly lifts the cigarette
she exhales then slowly smiles
shes got him
next to the valet stand gabriel leans over the hood of an evil looking bright yellow lamborghini diablo roadster a gameboy chirping in his hands
stanley walks into the frame
without missing a beat gabriel looks up big stan
i was afraid we lost you
gabriel stands up and walks toward stan
tell me what the deal is
lets go up to the house
im having a little get together
ill explain it to you there
three geeky computer types sit in front of a huge array of crts
they look up when roberts stalks into the room
he yanks off his jacket crumbles it and throws it across the room
they just look at each other
tell me you have some good news for me
actually we have a small ray of hope in the vast darkness that is your life sir
check this out
on one of the inch screens we see a terminal at lax with hundreds of people streaming by at x speed
torvalds is being apprehended
he freezes it
see these two guys
he points at two men watching this action from the sideline
he pulls another monitor forward
now watch this
he fast forwards through the crowd until the two guys show up again
he freezes it
recognize those two same guys next day
question is he slowly moves the action forward whos that
the footage stops and zooms in on one of two travelers who the two men are meeting
it is stanley
the computer guys look at each other
one hands roberts an open copy of wired magazine
wireds man of the year
pretty much a burnout but he was the hacker zeitgeist of his day
i know who jobson is
i busted him
to stans image why are you in l
roberts looks at it
then at the screen
a pop up screen shows stanleys history
his ex wife lives in malibu
the new husband owns backdoor films a shady porn production house in chatsworth
decent production value but they only shoot on video
his wife actually starred in a couple of his videos
apparently shes an actress
roberts moves the mouse to see ginger
whos the chick
we dont know yet sir
serious piece of talent
way outta his league
you know he also has a ten year old daughter who hes not supposed to see
maybe thats why hes here
roberts looks at him like hes an idiot
or maybe not
i want to know who that girl is
and stake out his daughter
the house is at the very top of the hills and the pool hangs off the side of the cliff way below the house
the outer edge appears nonexistent like the water hangs frozen in air
a very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress
more ibiza than hollywood hills
stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half dozen beautiful un clad model types
gabriel is mingling through the crowd
stanley stares off into the glittering lights of l
smiles so stan tell me
howd you do it
break the code
at the club
you broke the entire encryption a silencer against your eye and your cock in someones mouth all in less than sixty seconds
i used a logic bomb dropped it through the trap door no you didnt
you didnt have time
cmon you can do better than that
howd you do it
i used a password sniffer
gabriel glances at ginger who shakes her head
yes i did cmon stanley
howd you do it
i dont know exactly
i see the numbers
in my head
all my life
i dont answer equations i just see the answers
same with code
i cant explain ginger eases over to where stan is sitting
she runs her hands across his shoulders as she moves around him dancing to the music
mozart always said he didnt write music he just wrote down what he heard in his head
so did faulkner just with words
drinking wine you definitely have a gift stan
the most powerful people on the planet are like you
with a laptop and a phone line you can make god look like a thirteen year old with a stack of playboys and a lack of imagination
beat cmere stan let me show you something
stanley and gabriel stand in gabriels primo designed pad staring at an array of supercomputers
stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels linked together in complete awe
pretty impressive huh
heres the deal
i need a worm stanley
a hydra actually
a multi headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network
what kind of cypher
a vernams impossible
its key code is destroyed upon implementation
not to mention being a true bit encryption
actually were talking bit
tell ya what ill pay you ten million dollars
that should be enough to get your daughter back
beat unless of course its impossible
stan thinks about it
they shake hands and gabriel heads toward the back of the house
walking up the stairs toward his room
stan looks over to see ginger staring at him
ginger pulls herself up on the desk spreading her legs on either side of the keyboard
lets get to work
she turns on the computers
he backs away
it wont bite you i promise
i dont know
its gonna be pretty hard without a gun to my head
she reaches out and pulls him to her
well lets put a gun to your head
she kisses him and slowly he responds
tell me about your worm stanley
you surprised that a girl with real breasts and an i
over can give you a hard on
stan shakes his head
i thought you were gabriels
she looks at him a moment
she smiles at him and slowly bends forward to whisper in his ear
at stanleys ear
very slowly i am not what you think i am
as she leans back
she stares at him a moment then slides off the desk
youre a smart guy stanley
you figure me out
she hands him the bottle of expensive wine shes been drinking and then grabbing stan by the belt buckle pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house
lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine ginger topless wearing nothing more than tiny oblong green tinted shades a skimpy t back and a little silver ring
through her left nipple
shes reading steven hawkings a brief history of time
a shadow falls over her
the shadow moves
ginger glances nonchalantly up then sitting up grinning dont you have that just fucked the neighbors cat look this morning
she reaches over lights a cigarette and inhales deeply
he smiles looking her up and down
i thought we went over all that last night
beat then like stupid the book ginger
holding it out look no pictures
get out of my light
they stare at each sharing a moment of god only knows what then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh graders at the local skating rink
stanley nervously clears his throat
shes got him
can i borrow your car
theres something i need to do
she reaches down beside the chair grabs her keys and tosses them to him
then if youre going to see your daughter you might want to reevaluate the way you look
goes back to her book just a thought
he looks at her with open mouth amazement
in just hours she already knows what makes him tick
she looks up from her book and winks at him then returns to her reading
a school bell rings and three hundred screaming kids of all ages come running from the doors
not your average ten year old
even decked out in bell bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she carries herself that is older wiser sadder
she walks into a closeup and scans the driveway
reflected in her tiny round lavender shades we see the circular driveway of the school jam packed with buses and parental types in their m series mercedes and their lexus
we crane up panning left
holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the mayhem
she looks up and down the street then slowly drops her backpack and sits down on the curb
she pulls a well worn copy of william gibsons neuromancer from her backpack and turns up the raging electronica from her
now there is much less pandemonium
no more buses
we crane down to a medium of holly still in the exact same spot
holly sighs pulls back her headphones and grabs her startac from her backpack
she opens the phone and dials
the phone rings and we pan around the seemingly empty house finally coming to rest on the back of the couch
we jib up and tilt down
melissa is passed out in a pool of her own drool
the phone continues to ring
holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial
we see yellow cab scroll across the phone
she hits send
can i give you a lift
look creep i dont think so she stands up ready for a fight
and there next to her is her father transformed
under his arm is a three foot tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow
she runs to him and wraps her arms around him
what are you doing here
i missed you so much
me too baby
i brought you something
he holds the stuffed giraffe to her
if mom finds out youre here shes gonna have you thrown back in jail
its okay baby
let me give you a ride home
he grabs her stuff
he walks toward gingers silver mercedes clk which hes borrowing
holly runs and jumps on his back
they laugh as he carries her to the car
they sit in the clk parked down the street from hollys house
you believe in me right
of course but ive found a way to get you back sweetheart
its my one shot and im taking it
just give me a couple of days
crying i dont want anything else to happen to you dad
holly everythings going to be okay
you just have to trust me
crying i love you daddy
holly quickly kisses him jumps out and runs crying from the car at full speed with the giraffe
stanley tears rolling down his face slaps the steering wheel trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so badly
suddenly the passenger door opens and a man in a dark blue suit and fed issued shades gets in
who the fuck are you
flipping out his badge friend of a friend
lets take a ride
he motions toward a black taurus now parked across the street
in the back he sees a face he recognizes
the man kinda smiles at stan
being a dick gotta suck to be you
stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge of his nose and jumps out of the car
stan runs across the hood of the taurus and just jumps over the railing
we realize what stan did probably wasnt the smartest move in the world
the cliff is just barely on this side of degrees and drops off about five hundred yards straight down to the pch
stan falls in slow motion about thirty feet before the cliff face angles out enough to break his fall
he begins a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff
roberts runs to the railing and sees stanley sliding falling down the hill
to his men cut him off at the bottom
roberts then hops the railing as his men scramble for the car
roberts hangs in mid air a moment then he too begins the rolling fall down the hill
as he tries to keep his balance is being beaten and battered by the sharp rocky ground
finally he shoots off an outcropping and free falls for fifteen feet
then it really gets bad
clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill to help control the erosion
to stanley however it is the worlds largest slip and slide
he is no longer able to control even badly his descent
now he is flying down the cliff face only the rocks and bushes that slam into his body slows the descent
roberts above him is doing little better
as stan and roberts slide toward the eight lanes of blazing afternoon traffic on the pch
finally stan bounces onto the black top road
he runs headlong into the traffic
cars screech horns blaring as they slide into each other
stanley does not lose the single minded focus of escaping
roberts now at the bottom himself watches as a car slides sideways into stan flipping him over it
stan not stopping to feel the pain runs across the hood of a freshly stopped car
on the other side stan runs down to the beach and runs down the sand at full tilt looking for any escape route
roberts has made up some time due to the auto pedestrian accident which slowed him down a little
stan however is faster
stan does his best jerry rice as he runs down the beach at full speed
suddenly the taurus comes tearing ass across the beach at stanley
stan veers now running through the surf
the taurus veers as well and stan is forced to slide across the hood to keep from getting whacked
the taurus breaks left and slides further into the surf
the fbi driver hits the accelerator and bogs the taurus down tires spinning throwing sand
stan continues to run as roberts makes it to the taurus
he pulls his
from his shoulder holster and fires it into the air
roberts bends over trying to catch his breath
stanley stops putting his hands up
why didnt you do that earlier sir
roberts looks at the agent
go get him
three of the agents bring stanley over
stan slides down by the back wheel
what are you doing in l
catching his breath vacationing
why were you running
we just wanted to talk
are you arresting me
for violating your parole by leaving texas without permission or for evading a federal agent and almost getting me killed in the process
stan just looks at him
no im not
then why are we talking
didnt know the court lifted the sanction preventing you from seeing your daughter
you just want to cut through the pleasantries and get down to business
i can help you with your daughter stan
help me ill help you
youll have to forgive me the fact that you put me in jail for months doesnt inspire a lot of trust
whether i agreed with what you did or not you broke the law stanley
i guess we were both doing what we had to
this was a nice trip down memory lane but if youre not arresting me
so why was it you are in l
i told you vacationing
ya know its funny
axl torvalds was just here for a vacation too
isnt it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time
im a sucker for disneyland
getting up tell torvalds i said hello
if youre not careful you can tell him yourself
stanley looks at roberts
to his men give him a card
stan looks at it
in case you think of anything else you want to tell me
stan turns to walk off
to the agent he elbowed sorry about your nose
you know youre in way over your head here
walking off i know
its a long walk back up the hill stanley
you want us to give you a lift
stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the long journey back up the hill
roberts collapses into the passenger seat
watching stan walk away
ginger walks in and closes the door
she walks over to the dresser and takes off her earrings
then she reaches under her dress and unvelcros the modified mm
glock and its thigh holster dropping it on the dresser
she then pulls off the hip little designer dress she is wearing revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny transmitting receiver taped between her breasts
she stares at herself in the mirror for a moment then slowly starts to untape the bug
i have to hand it to you ginger
you look good wearing anything
even a wire
ginger grabs her glock and spins around the holster dropping away with the touch of a button
she levels it on the dark corner of the room where stanley sits waiting drinking a bottle of gabriels expensive wine
you gonna kill me
beat what are you doing here stanley
i should probably ask you the same question
he leans forward into the light
what happened to you
tossing her her keys sorry about your car
ive had a pretty shitty day so far
looks like it just got worse
beat who are you ginger
i cant tell you
incredulous you cant tell me
well thats just fuckin peachy
loudly who are you
hell kill me
gabriel walking down hallway
thats not my problem is it
youre asking for a lot of faith here ging without givin me any
you stanley brought me into this mess pleadingly stanley i deserve to know whos playing me ginger
hitting each word who the fuck are you
nearing gingers room
quietly im d
stan and ginger hold a moment as ginger
stanley in one quick thinking movement rips the wire from gingers chest and flings it behind the bed just as the door swings open
gabriel stands staring at them
ginger topless weapon in hand and stanley who looks like he had the shit kicked out of him
ginger and stanley both stare at him
well ging doesnt this look friendly
im a friendly girl
stanley looks at ginger for a beat
ginger stares at stanley who turns to look at gabriel
gabriel looks at stan waiting
thought maybe youd like to see me get you your hydra
stan walks toward gabriel
gabriel walks into the hall
stanley looks back at ginger who mouths the words thank you
stanley ignores her
ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed
you look like shit
ginger kick your ass
ginger sighs and tosses her gun onto the bed then follows them
stanley looking a little rough sits in front of the huge array of flat panels
he works quickly
the nitrogen system an array of hoses winding across the living room floor intermittently shoots jets of gas upwards dropping the temperature to a livable degrees
gabriel sits next to stan
ginger walks in
she stands behind stan as he works
the screen shows the mit university logo
then access denied
his fingers work the keyboard
as he talks we track down an old concrete stairwell and down a long dank hallway
my senior year at m
i created the source code for the worm that ive been using for years
we track around a corner
in the basement and through a file room is the only p
still active and on the internet although only a few people know this
its an i
machine and kept online just for historical sake
i hid my worm inside it where no one would ever think to look
we dolly into a closeup on a large ominous dark mainframe
hitting a key
as it hums to life
as it fills with lines of code
who turns around a cocky grin on his face like a proud parent she smiles at him
gabriel walks in
now i just have to modify the code
hes fucking amazing
yes he is
she runs her hand affectionately across the side of his head and walks out
i see you have a groupie
ignoring that you know itd be a lot simpler if you would tell me exactly what the hydra is going to be used for
push in on gabriel as he thinks about it
have you heard of operation swordfish
the lamborghini pulls up in front of a starbucks
youll appreciate the irony here gabriel gets out of the car still talking
in the early eighties the d
set up a network of dummy corporations as a government front to launder drug money and gather evidence
problem is the front companies started making money
lots of money
by when operation swordfish was terminated there was close to million dollars in the d
gabriel and stanley walk through the door and sit down at a window table
money that just sorta disappeared
it didnt disappear
it just sat in those accounts earning interest its been years
you have any concept how much money wed be actually talking about today
thats nine zeros
beat look this is a sweet deal
we go in over phone lines
pop the firewall drop in the hydra and just sit back and wait for the money
before we can tap into the secure cluster you have to find one of the banks on the backbone of this network
do you know how many banks there are in the u
it could take years
beat look behind you stan
stanley turns and looks out the window
they are sitting directly across from the world banc
gabriel and stanley walk toward the house
the camera pans left and we can now see gabriels house poolside
we pull back through a window into a small trailer across the canyon from gabriels house
who is he
we dont know that yet sir
theres definitely something going on
there are two t trunks going into the house
thats serious bandwidth
thermal scopes indicate a huge heat load in the main living area
could be from mainframes although they must have a genny cause power consumption is right on par
some of these fellows might be dressed in armani but they definitely have the swagger of ex military
maybe bodyguards but they seem more like mercs to me
from here were having trouble pinning any of them down
sure would be nice to task a satellite sir
im working on it
send what you have up lines maybe well have one by the end of the week
roberts walks out of the trailer
stanley works at the computer
roberts looks out the window through a camera with a huge lens
gabriel stands by the pool his back toward us
slowly gabriel turns around
he is staring directly at us
roberts instinctively jerks his head up
slowly he looks back into the eyepiece
who the hell is that
he presses the switch and the cameras shutter whirls
close the door
we have a problem
walking toward desk look at these
kaplan spreads out the surveillance photos on the desk
the senator looks up at kaplan
reisman who now stands in a windowless room
the only furniture is a desk on which rests a small laptop and what appears to be a speaker
an operator sits at the desk while kaplan hovers in the b
we have him yet
hes coming online now sir
as reisman speaks the communication guy types
we have a problem gabriel and marco sit at the same type of apparatus a merc at the laptop
reismans dialogue comes out of the speaker but it is no longer reisman it is a
seems you have gotten yourself in a predicament
im not exactly following you
transfer the pictures
gabriel looks at the surveillance photos as they come up
we intercut as they speak
irritated but respectful senator i sincerely hope you did not contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this
goddamn right i did
you know where i got that
from the deputy director of the f
he thought i might be interested
sir with all due respect
do you think there is any aspect of this operation i am not fully aware of
we are aborting the operation and securing alternative means of finance elsewhere
we are aborting this operation
take a vacation
have i ever failed you sir
thats not the point
its my point
senator this operation is going forward
you understand what you are saying
everything is under control
reisman turns to kaplan
regretful do it
terminate the vortex
beat sir he does work for us
as the communication guy leaves son lets say you have a pound rottweiler
he loves you and its his job to protect you
but if he ever bites you even once you gotta put him down
you cant have an uncontrollable weapon running unchecked in your back yard
he becomes a liability
you never know who he might bite next
yessir i understand
stanley works at the keyboard
he reaches for his glass of wine and it is empty
he grabs the bottle
it too has been drained
he sighs and walks into the kitchen
stan walks to the fridge
opens the door
he closes the door and walks off toward the wine cellar
in the wine cellar stan looks around
he opens one door closes it
he opens another same thing
the third he pulls out a bottle
he pulls on another door and it is locked
he pulls again
the glass doors of the temperature controlled reach in wine cooler is opaque with condensation
he bends close
stanley swipes off the condensation inches from his nose
leaning against the glass from the other side
he drops the bottle of wine
crash it shatters
gabriels body is wedged into the degree white wine cooler
stanley looks at the body for a moment realizes something really bad is going on and hauls ass upstairs
stanley runs around the corner
gabriel is standing in the doorway directly in front of stanley
stan damn near falls down
stan cant say a word
whats wrong stanley you look like youve seen a ghost
gabriel looks in and sees the empty wine bottle at the computer station
why cant we talk here
cause i dont want to talk to you in the house stanley
gabriel walks out
stanley slowly follows
stan slowly follows
how you doing stanley
obviously not fine fine
something you need to say to me
freaked what the hell is going on here
totally cool you know anything about harry houdini
stan definitely doesnt get the point
he used to make an elephant disappear in a theater full of people
you know how he did it
gabriel unwraps a piece of gum how
and sticks the piece in his mouth
gabriel whips right down a side street and drops the hammer
he blows through a stop sign then another
he is calm cool but continues to glance in his rearview mirror
what are you doing
we have a tail
beat hope you had a light lunch stan
gabriel slides left into an alley gets it under control and screams toward the other side
a black suburban pulls up closing off the alley
he slides to a stop and slams it into reverse
backwards at plus miles per hour
hold the wheel
gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up a duffel bag
he unzips it and withdraws what the marines call a saw a belgian designed machine gun compact but with rounds of swiss cheese action per minute powerful enough for the
to replace the m
shit its blocked
gabriel looks behind them another black suburban has blocked them in
the one from the other side and a third comes toward them down the alley
keep it straight
the speedometer needle is pegged at as they scream backwards
gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a round box wrapped in white tape and printed with ap
he clips it and pulls back the bolt
he grabs the wheel from stan
its just rough when you grow up lovin james bond movies
dont worry stanley itll be over soon
as the diablo slams backwards into the suburban at sixty mph
gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open roof and unloads full auto into the suburban
the armor piercing shells penetrate the armalite glass ripping the occupants to shreds
gabriel turns firing at the other suburban
stanley slides under gabriel as gabriel steps into the passenger side
the wheels spin the lambo is wedged under the suburban
gabriel continues to blast full auto tearing the suburban to shrapnel
finally the mortally wounded but still kicking lamborghini tears free of the suburban and rockets head on toward the other
stanley drives like a maniac
gabriel rips it on full auto meatloafing the driver
the suburban veers into the wall
stanley whips beside it and gabriel strafes down the side opening it up
stan whips right onto a main street
more suburbans head at them
stan screams left into another alley
through the cross streets whipping by at mph we see suburbans parallel to them
stan cranks his wheel right
changing out a clip keep your cool stanley
the lambo rolls to a stop and gabriel hops out running at the suburbans
after a moment of all out gi joe style blitzkrieg its over
gabriel walks to a body lying in the street
he turns over the body and looks at the face
i knew it
gabriel walks back to one of the burning suburbans where stanley stands
get in the fucking car stanley
im not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on
gabriel pulls out his h k points it at stanley
youre on my good side and you want to stay there
stanley i like you but dont confuse kindness with weakness
so get in the fuckin car
i need my hydra
stanley is working at his terminal
what do you think
i just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street
im just fucking great
it doesnt matter if i get my daughter back if im dead
even if i do survive this whos gonna keep me out of jail
she walks over to him and kneels down places her hand on his leg looks up at him
i wont let anything happen to you stanley
you have to trust me
two hours ago i found out youre d
the feds are crawling up my ass and theres a dead body in the basement that looks just like gabriel
she doesnt move
stanley if we dont find out who hes working for then were just going to have to do this all over again
your little slush fund is not my problem
im pulling the plug on this rodeo
roberts may be an asshole but he is definitely the lesser of the two evils
ive been working on this thing for eight months and i will not let some jarhead fed fuck up my operation
please i know what im doing
you have twelve hours
do what he wants
finish the worm
youre starting to sound just like him
they look at each other
stanley turns toward the computer screens
as it quickly unwinds
reisman dressed in your average fly fishing garb stands in the shallow water of a wide river thinking he has contained the situation is doing what he enjoys most
he rewinds the reel and flicks it out again the hook sails into the distance
a huge cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin
faintly we hear the whine of machinery
jim hears it too odd since we are so far in the boonies
he looks around then up and we push in to a closeup
an evil looking camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the hill directly above him rotors thumping
reisman ducking his cigar falling from his mouth has to fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat
water sprays everywhere as it hovers
slowly it drifts over to the bank and lowers where it touches down briefly the side door slides open
as gabriel steps out and walks toward us
the copter lifts off behind him
reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at his right
gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter disappears over the rise
reisman is not happy
sniffing in air ahh the great american outdoors
ill never understand the appeal of fly fishing jim
a little too much like masturbation for me without the payoff
gabriel looks around suddenly realizing something
thiss a catch and release stream isnt it
gabriel starts to laugh
reisman doesnt catch the joke
oh cmon jim
you gotta see the irony in the chairman of the joint sub committee on crime fishing in a catch and release stream
grimaces not thinking it is funny
how could you do it jim
after all we have sacrificed
all the blood all the death
ive changed my identity so many times i dont even know what i look like anymore
how could you turn on me when we are so close
you did this to yourself
you brought me in to get the job done and you didnt want to know about the consequences
was watching you i told you there was nothing that i was unaware of thats why were here
you are too arrogant too aggressive you have misplaced your loyalties senator
you have sold america out
i am a patriot and patriotism does not have a four year shelf life
unfortunately politicians do
gabriel pulls out his h k dangling it by his side
arrogantly and what are you going to do with that
thomas jefferson once shot a man on the white house lawn for treason senator
you tried to execute me in the name of politics now i execute you in the name of the people
gabriel shoots reisman in the chest
he falls into the water
stanley continues to work
marco walks in
youre up mate
get your shit were headin out
his hands fly across the computer keys he slides in a zip disk transfers the file and runs for the door
outside marco waits in his black porsche turbo ready to roll
stanley walks out of the house
thru thru a snazzy sweat suited kaplan walks out to his shiny new silver porsche racquet ball racquet flipping in hand
hes so downright happy in his confidence that he is on the fast track to political valhalla due to his handling of this gabriel shear debacle he is whistling
he clicks the porsche key unlocking the drivers door tosses in his racquet and climbs in
he shuts the door and slides the key into the ignition
before he cranks it he catches himself in the rearview and winks at himself
smiling he turns the key
the claymore mine hidden under his seat rips the car apart shrapnel tearing upward through his body and out the roof
the thousand pieces of shrapnel divet the concrete ceiling and then bounce across the parking garage floor
stanley is getting out of marcos car
gabriel walks out of the theater back door
over shoulder make sure that bus doesnt top out over fifteen seven
gabriel turns and sees stanley
stan how are you
have you finished
stan pulls out the zip disk and hands it to gabriel who dials his cell phone
into phone hello
this is kristine jorgenson of credit suisse in grand cayman
i need to verify your new account information and have you choose a personal password
jobson there has just been a transfer of ten million u
dollars into your account
stan looks at gabriel who smiles
just like i promised stanley
then let me go
i want to see my daughter
walk with me
im about to do something against my better judgement
im going to tell you something i never tell anyone
im going to tell you who i am
i know who you are
you think im a bank robber
really im just like you
youre a murderer
that i am
i am forced to operate on a different plane than you
but i have ethics
rules to which i must adhere
years ago thomas jefferson wrote a letter to madison because he was concerned that the freedoms of the constitution would be ignored
i dont understand why the fuck youre telling me this
listen to me and you will
in the s armed with this letter j
edgar hoover created an organization to protect the freedoms of this country at all costs
i dont care about any of this
all i care about is my daughter
im talking about your daughter
you your daughter and million other americans who take their freedoms for granted
you dont understand what it takes to protect those freedoms
thats my job stanley to protect your way of life at all costs
so you and your band of lunatics are really stealing all this money to protect me
thats right stanley he opens the theatre door
cause wars cost money
its as if hes just teleported into beirut
weapons hummers a huge armored bus is jacked up at one end of the theatre
gabriels men go about readying themselves
one of the mercs walks over to gabriel to show a modified electronic dog collar
realization hitting him youre going into the fucking bank
thats what im telling you stanley
we are at war
who are we at war with
anyone who infringes on americas freedom
terrorists states stanley
someone must take their war to them
they bomb a church we bomb ten
they hijack a plane we take out an airport
they execute american tourists we tactically nuke an entire city
we must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack americans
im not doing this
i wanted you to do this because you wanted to because we need men like you but our time tables been moved up
just relax and it will all be over in twenty four hours
youre rich stanley
pretty soon holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty foot scarab eating bon bons and living the good life
he turns to walk off
stanley looks around
he spots a generator and moves toward it
stanley reaches down to the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a twist
suddenly the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to arc
in a shower of glass they start exploding from the huge amperage shooting through them from the generator
gabriel turns to see stan standing next to the generator
he moves toward him just as the room goes black
in a moment the secondary lights come up
to himself pretty slick
walking over you want to send a team after him
hell be back
we gotta move
early morning in los angeles
people go peacefully about their early morning business
suddenly three red white and blue hummers crest a hill and tear toward us down the street
halfway down the street they veer right jump the curb and smash through the front plate glass windows of the world banc
stanley rides in the back of a cab as the cab hauls ass to his ex wifes house
as the hummers roll through the furniture and flying glass the side doors fling open and well dressed men in italian suits and sunglasses jump out
customers scream and try to flee but are quickly corralled with machine
a red ferrari f whips around the corner at light speed screams down the street toward us and screeches to a halt outside the bank
it shifts into reverse and slowly backs over the curb and into the bank
a huge armored bus rolls down the street through two parked cars and up onto the sidewalk effectively sealing off the front of the glass bank
mercs begin welding metal plates around the armored bus
we hear the approaching sirens of a fleet of cop cars
the cab pulls up in front of melissas house
stanley jumps out and runs up to the front door
several of the mercs finish putting some sort of collars on several hostages including a young normally good looking but now covered in mascara whimpering blonde girl
stanley busts into her house
in the living room melissa and the infamous larry the porn king are both face down in a pool of blood
he runs from room to room yelling hollys name
the house is deserted
stanley bursts through the door into hollys room
the room is empty and in disarray
as he looks out the window toward la and pulls out roberts card
through glass doors we see the woman slam into the locked doors
the swat guy pulls her into the street
the explosion rips the swat guy and the girl from the beginning apart
this time we see it from another angle
ball bearings ricochet against the plate steel of the bank
as the ball bearings bounce across the street and tap against the coffee shop
everyone in the coffee shop looks at each other like what the fuck just happened
as ball bearings roll back into the street
stanley is standing in the bank
three mercs in donna karen suits point modified m s at his head
he stares at the ground shaking his head
gabriel tosses his frappacino against the wall
get that son of a bitch on the phone
gabriel walks towards the window slinging his fn fal and pulling on his headset
if you need to test my resolve then god help you
you have minutes
that plane better be on the runway
he clicks off
he turns to stan
get my money stanley
not until i see my daughter
gabriel snaps his fingers and a ballistic cloth duffel bag is thrown to gabriel
gabriel is very unhappy
he looks at stanley who is terrified of its contents
as he unzips it
stanley almost cant bear to look
as gabriel slowly reaches in and
pulls out our buddy the giraffe
stanleys heart almost stops
he sighs as gabriel tosses him the giraffe
do you really think i wanted it to come to this
i am not a psychopath stanley but i told you i will sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country including my own
beat now get me my money
will you let holly go once you have the money
both of you
you have my word stanley
they walk past a merc sitting at a desk a laptop open in front of him
marco is paying very close attention to stan
a merc sits at a desk with three laptops and four tiny extra monitors all wired into a large bundle of cables that run across the floor
the merc looks up
on the monitors and laptop screens are present time shots of all angles of the building and the surrounding area
the images constantly change as the merc toggles through the images
look at the cover pattern theyve set up
the right hand doesnt know what the lefts doing
look at this bozo
if the shit drops hes gonna cap his buddy in the back of the head
stanley sits down at the computer console and brings up the banks mainframe
i need the disk
a merc hands it to him and stanley slides it in the computer
his hands work quickly
now it is
suddenly the lights flicker stans screen blanks out momentarily then blazes back to life his code scrambled
stan instinctively jerks his hands away from the keyboard
what the hell just happened
gabriel looks at the lights as they flicker back on the huge portable generator springing to life
they just cut the power
how long to transfer the money
couple of minutes
national bank of zurich
spread it evenly over these accounts
it wont be there that long
good job stanley i got someone who wants to see you
they bring holly out
stanley grabs her and pulls her close to him
are you okay
holly nods yes
stanley and holly are escorted toward the door
gabriel stands in front holding his fn fal
he is speaking in french to several of the mercs
gabriel walks down the steps and unhooks hollys collar
stan is about to freak
to stanley told you i was a man of my word stanley
he walks back
marco unlocks the door
stanley and holly look at each other
holly starts to cry
i love you baby
marco stares at stanley as they walk out
see ya around
i doubt it
he starts to walk out
sir the money just disappeared
the money its gone
gabriel turns around to look at stanley
we zoom into a closeup
what do you mean gone
we see stanley
he looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar
marco pulls his assault rifle but stanley waylays him
they both hit the ground
holly hauls ass into the street
once the fbi swat guys see she is off the sidewalk they scoop her up
gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against stans head as he and marco roll around on the ground
wont do you any good
the money jumps every seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years
course it wasnt supposed to happen for another six hours
the power surge must have scrambled the internal clock
but you kill me and you never get a single dollar
gabriel eases up wheels spinning at millions of rpms
you let the hostages go and then ill tell you where and when you can extract the money
we all walk away nobody gets hurt
the accounts are encrypted with a bit cipher
even i cant break through the fire wall
its my act of god policy
a very tense moment passes
gabriel looks around
he has an idea
tell ya what
marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the hummers winches and throws the line over one of the foot high ceiling buttresses
gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab stanley one placing a knife to his throat
grab agent sculley
marco grabs ginger and drags her kicking fighting over to where gabriel stands brandishing the cable
no dont do this
stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow
gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook and puts it over gingers head pulling it taut around her neck
he cuts the cable tie loose
she digs at them with her fingers
two mercs rush in and grab stanley one placing a knife to his throat
stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow
in all reality stan she has you to thank for this
that first night in prague you broke the d
database that contained her true identity
stan but without you i never would have known
freaking what are you doing
string up the d
marco hits the power switch
ginger is yanked up into the air hanging twenty feet above the floor
just let her down
ill do whatever you want
then get me my money stan
stanley looks up at ginger valiantly struggling for her life
im not doing shit until you bring her down
let her down
gabriel yanks out his
h k turns and shoots the hanging ginger
stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her
he looks up at gabriel and runs at him
gabriel slaps him in the throat spinning him and grabs stan around the neck in the crook of his arm
close and very serious take a moment big guy
dont make me put you in a wheelchair
in the b
two mercs zip gingers body into a black body bag and carry her out
you didnt have to kill her
i didnt stan you did
but were not done yet
to marco marco
marco yanks a seventeen year old girl up from the floor and puts a gun to her head
there are a lot of hostages here
i cared about ginger can you imagine what i could do to someone i dont care about
how long before the money jumps
they better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day
somebody get me a laptop
a laptop appears
gabriel hands it to stanley and nods to the mercs who drop him
stanley drops to his knees placing the computer on the ground
stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear that familiar pulse as he does
he connects onto an encrypted site on the net
his fingers hum over the keys
looking at a screen money just jumped
looking at his watch okay stan
sweat rolls down stanleys face as he works on the machine
numbers scroll across the screen
five columns of numbers scroll
forty five seconds stanley
i need another laptop logged on
he tries to keep from looking up at the crying hostage
the columns decrease
another laptop appears
twenty seconds stan
his fingers still fly
three columns now
he works on the other laptop with his right hand
shes gonna die stanley
it scrolls down to one number
the home page for grand cayman banc appears on the other laptop
account number appears
stanley has typed in the account number and accesses the account
he flies through the transfer information
i need your account number
someone hands him a legal pad
he types it in
four three two
let her go
stanley jumps up and runs over to marco
gabriel puts his gun to the back of stanleys head
now goddammit its done
let her go
gabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with a different laptop
marco drops the girl
well that was fun
a merc holding a cell phone
joy says the plane is ready
well bout time for us to leave
theyll never let you escape
youve gone too far
do you hear that
beat thats the sound of america watching
we move up through the roof of the bank the sky is filled with the thumping of news helicopters
they lead the hostages including stanley onto the bus
he is pushed down into the back
to the driver lets roll
the driver pulls the door lever and it closes
the bus pulls into gear and slowly moves forward
the cops and fbi agents just stare vacantly at the bus
you just gonna let them drive the fuck on outta here
there isnt a free cop in a hundred miles that isnt on his ass
he wants a plane
hell get a plane
a g sits waiting on the tarmac
swat teams move in to cover positions around it
he wont get away
well take them at the airport
roberts tosses the paper he was reading down on the table and walks out shaking his head
the headline reads u
senator james reisman georgia joy and agent thomas jump in a waiting car ready to head toward the airport
roberts watches them then com mandeers another vehicle tearing ass after the bus
the bus rolls down the street
slowly one by one car with flashing lights after car with flashing lights pulls up behind it until a convoy rivaling that of the sugarland express has built up
choppers drop out of the air shadowing the bright yellow school bus
gabriels voice booms from speakers on the exterior of the bus
i dont think any of us want a repeat of this morning
keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times and i want the airspace for five miles clear
dropping the mic and turning to the hostages ladies and gentlemen we will be in your lives for approximately more minutes
this bus has just become your new yard
so sit back think happy thoughts and this will be over before you can say cat in the hat
gabriel smiling turns to stanley
whaddaya think stanley
youll never get away
even if they have to kill everyone on the bus
five hundred bucks says i do
tell ya what stanley ill even spot you the five bills
gabriel walks to the front of the bus puts on a headset and keys a mic
we are moving through the city
behind the bus a huge caravan of police cars and swat trucks follow
stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with gabriel
all the hostages eyes are on him
at the front he looks at gabriel
take a look
cops block off side streets as the convoy ala the gauntlet rolls through l
gabriel seems to be in complete control despite being surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a hundred miles
stan turns to gabriel angry
he grabs him pushing him
how the fuck can you justify all this
youre not looking at the big picture
gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail
stanley heres a scenario
you have the power to cure all of the worlds diseases
but the price for this is that you must kill a single innocent child
could you kill that child to save the world
you disappoint me stanley
its the greatest good
silence for several beats
how about ten innocents
now youre getting it
how about a hundred
gabriel becomes intense
how about a thousand
not to save the world but just to preserve our way of life
no man has the right to make that decision
youre no different than any other terrorist
youre wrong stanley
some men are put here to shape destiny to protect freedom despite the atrocities they must commit
i am one of those men
thousands die every day for no reason at all where is your bleeding heart for them
you give your twenty dollars to greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world
what countries will harbor terrorists when they realize the consequences of what i will do
did you know i can buy nuclear warheads in minsk for forty million each
i buy half a dozen i even get a discount
the driver looking at his watch says something to gabriel in french
gabriel replies to the driver also in french
as the driver shifts down
pressing down the accelerator
nudging toward eighty
what the fu i saw sugarland express stan
didnt like the way it ended
we see a sign that says lax
the bus turns off before they get to the sign
i thought we were going to the airport
the bus hurtles down a road toward a bridge over the la river
one of the mercs in the front speaks french again
gabriel looks around
faintly we can hear powerful rotors approaching
stanley looks out the window as two of the mercs scramble through hatches in the roof
a huge black sikorsky sky crane drops out of the sky
it has matched speed with the bus dragging four crane cables under it
within moments as the bus speeds onto the bridge the mercs on the roof have hooked the cables to the four hard points welded into the bus substructure for just
the mercs drop back into
the bus is lifted from the bridge into the air
roberts hauling ass after the bus sees the sikorsky
well why the fuck not
the swat teams sit and just continue to wait for gabriel who will never show up
joy and agent thomas come screeching up at the airport
agent thomass phone rings and he answers it
joy walks over to the swat leader
everything in place
were ready sir
good running up sir
i dont think theyre coming
what do you mean you dont think theyre coming
listening to the phone the bus was just lifted off the street by a giant helicopter
laughing the only way to fly huh stanley
gabriel says something in french into the radio
the sky crane bus head toward downtown
the bus flies through the canyons of the downtown buildings as it continues to lift
suddenly the bus crests a smaller building and a large sign looms directly in its flight path
the sikorsky swings right but not fast enough
it smashes through the sign and heads directly at a huge glass building
brokers in a bullpen go about their trading business
one looks up as the bus flies toward the huge plate glass windows
his cohorts look up just as the bus slams into the building shattering the windows
everyone holds on for dear life
the bus falls on one side
the resulting tension snaps the sliced cable and the entire rear section of the bus dangles
hostages slam into each other as the bus falls
one of the hostages flies down the center of the bus collides with marco and both go out through the back window
forty feet from the bus they explode
the concussion blows out every window of the bus
the hostages scramble to hold on
the bus now hangs suspended perpendicular to the ground
the sikorsky starts to climb again
gabriel turns to the merc driving the bus who is wearing a headset
listening to his headset then well make it sir
the sikorsky flies upward to the top of the highest skyscraper
roberts chases after the bus
he looks up realizing where they are going and veers off short cutting toward the skyscraper
the sikorsky attempts to set the bus on the rooftop
the back wheels miss the rooftop and the entire bus starts sliding toward the edge
the sikorsky lifts the entire bus back up into the air and then gingerly sets it on the rooftop on all four wheels
the cables are cut loose from the helicopter and drop down onto the roof with a loud clang
roberts rushes to the building
the helicopter then disappears upward into the sky
mercenaries begin to pile off the bus
swat trucks pull up and swat guys roll out
roberts rushes into the skyscraper
swat commandos hit the stairs and elevators
sitting there on a helipad is an evil looking matte black explorer helicopter
gabriel and his men walk off the bus toward the waiting helicopter
gabriel turns back to stanley who is standing on the stairs of the bus
we hear the sound of hundreds of sirens approaching
well stanley gotta fly
take care of that little girl
maybe ill see you again one day
it cant end like this
you cant get away
everything doesnt always end the way you think it will
beat then sides audiences love happy endings
gabriel strides away
we hear the whine of the explorer as it does its final power up for lift off
stanley looks around the bus futilely for some way to stop gabriel
stan can hear the cavalry about to arrive
the explorer slowly lifts upward
the explorer shoots upward into the sky
stan looks around all the hostages look back at him
stanley sees one of the stinger missile launchers broken free of its box
roberts runs onto the roof and sees stanley who has the stinger to his shoulder
he hits the on switch and it whines to life
he sights through the scope as the explorer screams away and pulls the trigger
the missile rips out of the tube and flies toward the explorer
the missile explosion combined with the fuel creates a tremendous fireball
roberts runs and tackles stanley to the ground
suddenly swat guys dressed in full combat gear including masks that cover their faces surround them
they cuff them
one of them almost steps on stanleys face
ignoring him check the rest of the hostages well come back for them
stretchers and emt medics run into the bus
we crane up
and see the absolute pandemonium of ambulances leaving and police cars arriving
we see doctor micheals leaning over what is left of gabriels barely recognizable burned upper torso and head
stan and roberts walk into the room through the metal doors and stop at the end of the table
micheals nervously looks up at stanley and steps back
stanley looks down at the body
are we sure this is gabriel
micheals walks over to a light board on the wall and flicks it on
a full dental x ray glows
micheals hangs another over top of it
the bodys dentals exactly match the dentals the israeli government sent us for an ex mossad agent named gabriel shears
it is indeed gabriel a
it sure looks like gabriel shear
what the hell was he doing in that bank
what about ginger
we searched all the hospitals and morgues but we havent been able to find her body yet
you cant find her body
bodies just dont fucking disappear
roberts voice slowly fades as we push in on stanley internal wheels spinning
to himself disappear
houdinis favorite elephant trick going on inside stans head
a large crowd of people surrounds houdini and pale suited assistants in front of a large elephant in the center ring
houdini made an elephant disappear in a room full of people
his assistants pull a curtain all the way around the elephant
you know how he did it
filled with his assistants
we see his assistants jump out of the elephant and hang the suit inside the curtains
assistants jump out
blend in with the others
houdinis assistants pull back the curtain melding with the assistants inside unbeknownst to the audience of course
the elephant is gone
houdini throws up his hands
no more elephant
in black urban assault gear pushing stan to the ground
realization sinking in
ginger looks at him holding her glock a wire taped between her breasts
so advanced nowadays you could probably pilot it from your trailer
gabriels face smooshed against the glass door
roberts looks at him inquisitively
as a wry indiana jones smirk slowly crosses his face
he slowly shakes his head
cheer up stan we got him
youre a hero
yeah thats me
they walk to the door and out
i was wrong about you stanley
i wanted you to know that
you know you should take your daughter on vacation
relax a little youre lucky to be alive
stanley slaps roberts on the arm and walks out
a woman who looks surprisingly like ginger with blonde hair and dark shades saunters into the credit suisse main bank in monte carlo
she walks up to a desk and sits down in front of a young female bank executive
both women speak in french with i would like to transfer money between my employers accounts
may i have your employers account number and password please
the woman slides a piece of paper across the desk as she casually lights a cigarette
looking at the account number realizing who she is dealing with oh of course
you realize how should i say there is a substantial amount of money in that account
the sexy woman smiles
thats why im here
my employer doesnt like drawing attention to himself
he likes to keep a low profile
the bank executive keys in the account numbers
would you feel more comfortable dealing with the bank president
exhaling would you
a glass of cristal while you
wait a moment
there seems to have been a series of large withdrawals out of this account
the woman spins around the terminal
the executive and the woman look at each other in astonishment then both look back at the screen
the balance now reads
we push into a closeup of the terminal
then through it
we push into a closeup of the terminal
then through it
we shoot through the system of wires and microchips down and through t lines across the world at light speed and exit the computer world from
the screen of stanleys laptop
everything okay dad
stanley sitting at a booth looks up from his laptop at holly who was studying a road map of arizona
just making the last of some charitable donations
stanley finishes shuts down laptop
how about you almost done
folding up road map yep
got it all figured out
well lets do it
they leave table
they exit diner
make their way to a new suv with a thirty foot tricked out airstream trailer stretched out behind it
by the way where exactly are we going
the petrified forest
the petrified forest
stanley opens the driver side door of the suv
and im driving
holly climbs into the vehicle as if to take the wheel
stanley slides in next to her
scoot over you
we crane up and away as the vehicle pulls out of the desert truck stop
know why they call it the petrified forest
and drives off down the road
a man whom we have not seen before but does maintain a certain gabriel air about him hiding behind shades leans against a three hundred year old column reading a
she walks toward him and he signals for the valet
youre not fucking gonna believe this
stanley how much he leave
he takes the in cash from her hand and hands her the paper
they walk down to the dock where a foot off shore cigarette boat waits a valet standing next to it
he hands the valet the
stepping down into the cigarette boat he grins up at ginger
steppng in next to him you dont seem that upset
did you ever see the maltese falcon
she looks at him as he cranks up the cigarette and backs away from the pier
nominated for three academy awards lost but what the fuck does the academy know anyway
john houstons first film and probably bogeys best
he turns the boat around and powers out of the bay
at the end when they realize the birds a fake and all they had gone through and sacrificed was for nothing gutman the bad guy in the movie says well
sir what do you think shall we stand here shed tears and call each other names or shall we go to istanbul
whats in istanbul
the ah stuff dreams are made of
they both smile as the cigarette disappears toward the horizon
