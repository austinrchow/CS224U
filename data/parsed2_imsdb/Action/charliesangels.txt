by ed solomon and john august current revisions by zak penn august a virgin air bursts through the clouds and levels off
we move through the first class cabin
its the regular mix of first class people old money in gucci enjoying freshly baked cookies a millionaire in jeans and a t shirt business people relaxing after a tough
a very nervous man
alone in an aisle seat the emergency row
we hold on him for a moment but not for too long
then we continue moving into stopping at the lavatory the occupied sign switches to vacant and
or actually a james earl jones type who for ease of description well simply refer to as james earl jones steps out of the restroom in full african regalia multi
colored dashiki mufti its a kind of hat the works
he heads up the aisle towards where he is stopped by a im sorry sir
this cabin is restricted to first cl
jones now removes a first class ticket
is this what youre looking for
she looks at it a little confused as to why hes just handing it to her now but then she nods
as he passes oh im sorry
is there anything i can get you
he continues into the first class cabin and toward where he slides in past the nervous shifty eyed man his name is pasqual and sits by the window
after a moment pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans slightly towards jones
tentatively they say birds cant fly this high
they say only angels can
now pasqual nods
nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by shall i pour your scotch
no ill take the bottle
she hands him the airplane sized bottle he waves off the glass
she shrugs leaving
pasqual to resume what he was doing
slowly he removes a roll of certs
he looks to jones well
what about your end of the bargain
from within his dashiki jones pulls out a black velvet pouch
he hands it to pasqual who opens it to find diamonds
a helluva lot of diamonds
he hands the roll of certs to jones
its not breath candy at all but a tiny roll of explosives with a tiny high tech triggering mechanism
the most dangerous explosive material ever invented
hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks
be careful with it huh
both men smile
pasquals very relieved that the deal is done
then suddenly the lights blink out
pasqual looks around nervous
but its just the in flight movie beginning
clouds and a woman holding a torch
columbia pictures presents
david spade and adam sandler in bosom buddies the movie
james earl jones shakes his head rolls his eyes
another movie from an old tv show
well whatre you gonna do
thats very funny
but james earl jones is dead serious
jones grabs pascal in a headlock and turns toward the back of the plane shouting now jones does the unthinkable
holding pasqual tight he yanks open the emergency door release
with a rush the cabin decompresses
panic erupts as air paper and everything not belted in screams out of the open door including james earl jones still holding pasqual in a bear hug
they plummet wind violently tearing at them
pasquals frantic screams doppler quite nicely
they continue to fall gaining speed
pasqual is terrified but jones doesnt seem worried
in fact casually he glances at his watch and then looks at the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the distance
its a jet helicopter
its door opens and now a skydiver leaps out helmet down arms back streaking across the sky in aerodynamic perfection heading directly towards who are still plummeting toward the earth
at terminal velocity
jones begins to let go of pasqual who screams and tries to clutch onto him desperate
over the rushing wind suddenly whommppph
the skydiver spread eagles stopping the wild dive directly behind pasqual and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him
all three are still free falling
james earl jones nods at the skydiver who even under the helmet and goggles is clearly a beautiful woman
meet alexandra alex munday one of charlies angels
shes a sultry bombshell a classic femme fatale only shes playing for the good guys
she gives james earl jones a wink then jerks pasquals rip cord and whoomph
pasquals chute deploys
he flies upward leaving alex and james earl jones both still falling
below the ocean screams up at them
not much time left
james earl jones pulls his belt and his mufti flies up
its actually a tiny drogue chute deploying his entire dashiki
his outfit hides a parachute rig
alex pulls her own rip cord and whoomph her chute unfurls and now
alex and james earl jones gently float towards a cigarette boat floats through the choppy water a gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling say hello to natalie thompson
charlies second angel
at a glance shes the brainy shy girl next door
but put her behind the wheel of any vehicle and shes unstoppable
natalie glances ahead maneuvering the boat perfectly under alex who drops on deck
alex gathers her chute then whips off her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake
here comes james earl jones
natalie guns the boat underneath
a perfect catch
alex helps him with his dashiki chute and then all three look up
here comes pasqual
natalie whips the boat around catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats still bound still scared out of his wits
he gapes wild eyed at the two angels then whirls on james earl jones
you crazy bastard
i think you mean crazy bitch
with that james earl jones reaches up and pulls his face off
latex rips free and standing there without his dashiki james earl jones has a great figure is
stunningly beautiful dylan sanders angel number three
shes the wild one
pasquals jaw drops as dylan shakes her hair free then reaches in her mouth still with james earl jones voice dont need this anymore
and extracts a voice modifying chip
now in her real voice but i sure could use this
and she pulls from her pocket the airplane size bottle of johnnie walker black
she twists it open and downs it
damn i hate to fly
now men in fbi windbreakers haul pasqual away two of them carefully handling the certs explosive
a harmless fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock
its john bosley charlies lieutenant
he reaches the boat which natalie ties off while alex and dylan neatly fold their parachutes
well angels the experimental explosives are back in the hands of the government and the free world can breathe just a lit tle bit easier tonight thanks to you three
alex natalie and dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand each starting to unzip unbutton unsnap their action gear and hand it to bosley as they continue walking
and thanks to you too bos
we couldnt have redirected the flight path without your help
bosley puffs proud
he speaks over the ever growing pile of chutes body suits goggles the dashiki
nothing a little teamwork cant do
at least thats what charlies always telling us right ladies
charlie will be joining us wont he
he sends his regrets
but he wanted you to know that dinner is on him so feel free to celebrate
by now the angels have stripped off all of their equipment revealing eye popping evening gowns
if its on charlie we will
the angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy duds at a private beach club where a waiter greets them with a tray of champagne flutes
they each take a glass turn to each other and raise them
another angels mystery
and the title sequence begins
once upon a time
three fourth grade school photos fill the frame side by side by side
these are three very different girls
natalie with a page boy cut and wearing a catholic schoolgirls uniform sports glasses and braces a bit awkward and gangly even shy
alex formally dressed with perfect pig tails is sophisticated and self possessed a class act even at ten
dylan wild blond hair and faded t shirt has a jaded street wise smirk even at this young age her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence
there were three very different little girls
the triptych remains on screen
now it shifts into now teenagers on home video
natalie working the a v equipment at school hides her face in embarrassment uncomfortable with the camera
alex in riding gear accepting her steeple chase trophy
she knows where to look for the camera
dylan smoking with her tough girl friends in the girls room of her reform school is caught on camera
she flips it off
who grew up into three very different women
theyre all women now in their early twenties
natalie a research fellow at mit and beautiful but not flaunting it demonstrates a chess playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors
alex valedictorian at oxford passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students faculty and parents
dylan in leather and a helmet steps off a harley
she sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend
she decks him then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar
with three things in common
with photographs again
the women as they are now natalie alex dylan
all gorgeous all self assured
and they work for me
now fireball explosions completely fill the screen
my name is charlie
angel silhouettes appear in flames
new music kicks in
and a new title sequence takes over credits continue as we watch the angels in action from presumably previous adventures
a microscope peering natalie cuts a ruby drops it in a laser housing shoots a red beam
dylan wielding kendo sticks spars with two yakzuza
alex side kicks two baddies spins drops a third
zoom back she is at the parthenon
a motocross race
natalie digs in for the finish attacking the last jump with gusto
dylan in traditional islamic robes finds a secret switch
she pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs
at a ballroom dance competition alex wows the crowd while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple
bosley as luka the bad ass pimp bitch slaps a couple of hos actually dylan and alex then winks at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off scared
natalie bites into a messy hot dog has to just laugh
the three angels elbow their way through a roller derby match
in orange prison jumpsuits alex and dylan work in female chain gang
window washer natalie peers into a skyscraper office surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside
on an italian street the three angels buy a paper grin at the headline mystery women save european union
as they high five dylans cone of gelato drops to the sidewalk
the angels look at it look at each other
and just have to laugh
over black we hear a digital ring
close on dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly sheets disoriented and a bit hungover
she hears the ringing where is it coming from
why is it drilling into her head
checking the floor she finds her jeans
digs in the pocket to find her cell phone
recognizing voice hi
ill be right in
she clicks the phone off then starts looking around
where the fuck is she
from the next room we hear a male voice singing my sharona
she checks under the sheets
she pulls her shirt from the floor puts it on
closing her eyes she prays
not him not him not him
oh god no
at the door skinny shirtless chad holds a skillet of eggs
blinded by the daylight dylan emerges from below relieved to see the boat is docked
chad follows her outside pleading
its a mistake
a horrible horrible mistake
she jumps onto the dock
then how come we keep getting back together
dylan just keeps walking
yelling after is it because i live on a boat
this is jason gibbons handsome action movie stud
hes concentrating fiercely
if you dont defuse this bomb logan l
s going to be a new underwater attraction
a bead of sweat drops down jasons face
get off my back sanchez
i know what im doing
reveal alex her face right next to his
the red one or the blue one
marix has a thing for red
red cars red boats red headed hookers
so the red one
thats why im gonna say blue
he makes a snip motion
they both breathe a sigh of relief
you saved the world again logan
she leans forward closer and closer right in his face
thats my job
alex kisses him
its a damn good kiss
jasons into it but pulls away for a second
i dont think sanchez would kiss me
hes a forty year old man
pull back to reveal
alex and jason are in a fully macked out airstream sitting on a bed leaning over an open screenplay
we can tell from our surroundings that jason is a big deal hollywood action star and this trailer is his home away from home
she licks the bridge of his nose then kisses him again
lets have it rewritten
as she smiles a cell phone rings
both alex and jason reach for their phones
jason stands in the doorway in his robe as alex tosses her stuff in the back of a very excellent car
so when you coming back
whenever i can
ill call you
oh great thats helpful
watching her prepare to go i dont get it what kind of executive assistant is on hour call
a very good one
you ask me your boss is an asshole
beat when do i get to meet this charlie guy anyway
charlies not very social
yeah well i think you should quit
charlie needs me
i need you
alex looks back that was more personally revealing than she expected
comes up next to jason
were ready for you on the set
jason nods then back to alex
i gotta go save the world
alex smiles at the irony of that
she blows him a kiss and speeds off
natalie knocks on the door to
a beat later the door swings open to reveal bob
natalie screams in astonishment
i thought you were dead
she pushes past him
natalie makes a beeline for his keys on the table
starts taking one key off the ring
i thought the police might be here
or your neighbors
or your parents here to identify your remains
he has no idea what shes talking about
she goes to where she retrieves a toothbrush
i saw your car was here so i knew you werent carjacked and brutally beaten left to die on the highway
her cell phone rings
she holds up a finger just a sec
answering phone hello
ill be right in
she hangs up
im not dead
but you can understand why i thought so
you missed our date last night
you didnt call or anything
i was just sitting there by myself
angle on bob
what can he say
i can tolerate a lot but punctuality and attendance those rank very high in my list of dating priorities
i can explain
behind natalie a door opens
a topless blonde looks out
to natalie i can explain
behind the blonde isaac hayes looks out
hes also topless
beyond weirded out natalie just leaves
passing cars reveal the one and only charles townsend detective agency
thats what the sign says
in foreground a blender whirrs
still hungover dylan cringes from the sound
natalie pours out three fruit smoothies for the angels
just once i want to date a normal man without a wife or a drug addiction or bondage issues
she and natalie toast
alex is only half in
off their look
ive got a great relationship
your boyfriend thinks youre a secretary
that way he doesnt ask about my work
bosley walks in with a folder
he eyes their drinks
im sorry bosley
i only made enough for three
its not okay but thats our bosley
he takes his seat behind his desk
now we see the biggest addition to the office the angels wall of fame
pictures of every angel from the original cast members to some fictitious ones weve never seen before
the rest of the office is exactly as we remember it right down to the good morning angels
sing songy good morning charlie
the angels take a seat on couches and chairs
im sorry to call you back from vacation but weve got a case that just cant wait
as hes talking the far blinds close themselves
a white screen lowers from the ceiling ready to catch the projected video a handsome man in his s in a cnn profile
the sound is muted be we see him attending a gala in an office surrounded by computers rock climbing smiling in a sit down interview
meet eric knox
oops did bosley say that out loud
hes years old and in three days hell be a billionaire when his company knox technologies goes public
its good to be him
so whats the catch
last night knox was kidnapped from his own office
on video surveillance camera footage of a parking garage
two men in hoods shove knox into black car
no ones heard a thing from the kidnappers
they dont want money
they just want to sink our company
a striking woman in a suit stands in the doorway
angels meet vivian wu vice president of finance for knox technologies
shes hired us to find knox
entering the initial public offering is in three days
if we dont get mr
knox back or if word gets out that hes missing the company stands to lose a billion dollars
she seems to direct this next sentence right to natalie
we need your help
charlie where do we start
alex i want you and bosley to stake out roger corwin
bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned
on video roger corwin
hes an unpleasant looking man whos even nastier when he tries to smile
we see logos for his company red star systems for the past year hes been trying to buy knoxs company and their new browser software
knox refused to sell
his company red start systems has the most to gain from knoxs disappearance
kidnap the founder and you sink the company
lets keep our eyes on mr
if knox is still alive corwin might lead us to him
were on it
any chance you can join us charlie
we see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold
were halfway up the face of yosemites el capitan the ground is hundreds of feet below
id love to angels but ive got my hands full this morning
two beautiful and buxomly climbing buddies smile at him
built into the palm springs hills this very exclusive spa has a fantastic view of the desert
dressed in a crisp spa uniform alex has a sidebar with a white robed bosley
she shows him a tiny electronic device shaped like a bullet
this is a transmitter
ill be able to hear everything you say
where do i hide it
leaning close ill be nude
alex takes a plastic cup drops the transmitter into it
covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket
bosley nods clever
try to get corwin to talk about the industry knox anything
she points him in the direction of the mens spa
but hes frozen with excitement
im going undercover
youll do great
a burst of steam clears revealing bosley
he waddles forward in his shower clogs which squish with every step
hes wearing two towels one around his waist and a second around his chest
as more steam dissipates we see there are seven men sitting on the risers
six are gorgeous ranging from calvin klein models to marlboro men
bosley looks around taking a keen interest
maybe hes checking them out maybe he isnt
we just dont know
the seventh man is roger corwin who we recognize from the videotape
hes leaning forward a gold chain dangling
its beside him that bosley takes a seat
he sets the ice cup and the transmitter in a strategic location
noticing that none of the other men have towels around their bosoms bosley nervously undoes his revealing skin the color of cooked salmon
he fluffs up his sparse chest hair then decides to smush it back down
he tries to make eye contact with corwin working way too hard
annoyed corwin finally looks over
hot in here isnt it
corwin shakes his head idiot
just came here to unwind a little
business these days is go go go
my company just held an initial pubic offering
yes he said pubic
hes about to correct himself when a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off some sweat
we dont see the promised land but bosley does
it flusters him
he sees another guy eating ice chips
bosley does the same
he eats another
re composed so what business are you in
corwin seems wary but bosley is clearly harmless
what do you know about this new browser from knox technologies
corwin bristles at the mention
word on the street is once they raise capital theyll rule the industry
i dont see that happening
the door opens a rush of steam
adonis himself enters
picking a seat behind bosley he pulls off his towel as he passes
we just see a bit of ass but bosley is face to face with the babymaker
one ice chip is not going to do it
he chugs the rest of his cup including which bleeps
corwin and others look over
what the hell was that
the device still in his mouth bosley has no choice but to smile and swallow
his eyes go wide as he chokes it down
corwin gets up to leave
nice talking with you
he shuts his mouth tight
rubs his chest a bit trying to get the transmitter down
corwin walks into a lushly appointed private massage room
a masseuse dressed in a skimpy robe her back to us oils up her hands sensuously near the window
german accent please to take off clothes mr
corwin gets under the sheet on his stomach
the masseuse turns around and now we see that its alex
alex starts to work on his back
she is clearly an expert at this
this is a legit place but theres something undeniably sensual about the whole experience
youre carrying a lot of tension along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae
let me see if i can vork it out
under the table we look up to see corwins face in the cradle
hes in a tortured rapture
alex works along corwins back and neck
she pulls his arms out to the side
the human body is an amazing instrument
just by activating ze right energy points you can improve ze circulation alleviate pain or
corwin goes limp
losing the accent knock a man unconscious
confident corwin is out cold she slides the key strap off his wrist
making sure shes alone alex uses the key to open a locker
she carefully sorts through corwins things finding his palm pilot organizer
she clicks it into a special device which blips as it downloads all his information
putting the palm pilot away she shuts the locker
close on corwin as he suddenly wakes up disoriented
just when we think alexs plan has failed we tilt up to see alex is right there
shes massaging him
you must have dozed off
yeah he must have
a patented angels flip leads us to
the angels are all in the car together cruising down sunset boulevard
dylan drives alex in the passenger seat natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap
can you not drive my car so fast dyl
im trying to type
to alex under her breath i drive too fast
look whos talking
she pulls into an in n out burger right up to the drive thru
three double doubles animal style
three chocolate shakes
while they wait for their order natalie punches something up on her computer
heres corwins itinerary
onscreen we see a list of all corwins plans for the next week
two events in particular stand out dylan glances over the schedule
alright well hit the reception tonight
i only wish we had a clue to go on
the food comes dylan takes it
hold that thought
natalie goes back to the computer again slipping a cd into the drive
dylan hands out the food spilling a lot of it
a big glop of chocolate shake lands on the keyboard
natalie licks the shake off her fingers tapes away at the keyboard
check this out
new program i just got from a friend in the bureau
we take that footage from the kidnapping
on screen the footage downloads from the cd into the program
natalie fast forwards through it until she comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask is partly pulled away from his face
isolate the part of the suspects face thats revealed then retriangulate his bone structure
the program zooms in on the revealed part of his face then runs a series of calculations
a new drawing starts to appear
weve got a composite
natalies portable printer spits out a simulated composite of one skinny bad looking dude
dylan grabs it looks it over
now weve got someone to look for
she hands it to alex to inspect
hell be easy to spot with that open head wound
she turns the composite around revealing that dylan has smudged his head with ketchup
they all just have to laugh
a sophisticated reception is in full swing an ocean of smart suits and power ties
dressed as a catering waitress natalie carries a tray of hors doeuvres
moving with her we pass roger corwin who talks with another suit and further on a conservatively dressed dylan who chats up a group of wall street types
the average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities this one is up points this one is down
its only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector
a few nods
she makes a good point
which analysis method do you prefer
she tries to stall
well there are so many options
i mean who can say what the one best choice is
still walking natalie talks to no one
for my money keppler wilson is a strong choice
more nods ad libbed agreement
the broker guy is impressed
excusing herself dylan turns and subtly touches her ear where shes wearing a hidden radio
natalie loads champagne flutes onto her tray
she looks up to see a very cute bartender pete
she didnt realize he was so close
covering anytime day or night i am
excited to be handing out champagne
what did she just say
but he smiles anyway
she heads back out into the crowd
you can almost see the big l on her forehead
dylan has been watching this
we intercut between her and natalie
sixty five percent of relationships begin in the workplace
hes a bartender
i need dependable
i need reliable
i need a volvo man
natalie walks past dylan not acknowledging her
dylan snaps her fingers
id love some champagne
natalie comes back a little annoyed
dylan takes a glass for herself then foists the other glasses on everyone around her whether they wanted it or not
to natalie why dont you get some more
she nudges natalie in that direction
we tilt up from a japanese comic book to pete
he suddenly realizes natalie is waiting for him
he starts filling more flutes
what are you reading
he holds it up
thats the new michio kazura
thats not even out in america
you know michio kazura
warriors of the broken earth
i just moved back from tokyo
it was the biggest thing since haikiri nomura
tomuru nasgawa ishi tokyo sen
nagada quing gong ni
natalie takes her tray and reluctantly heads off
ask him out
ask him out
she turns and heads back
good to meet you
listen theres an animation festival at the egyptian this week
i was wondering if you might want to
ill meet you there
she smiles hearing the deal close
pushing through a cluster of investors she bumps into a thin man
he doesnt respond but something about this man raises her suspicions
where has she seen him before
as he moves out of earshot
im on it
spotting the thin man she heads his way
offering vegetarian spring roll
he waves her away no
oops she drops a napkin in front of him
she kneels down to get it
as we move in very close on her tray we see that theres a tiny digital display
a metal detector is built into the rim
it blips as she moves past his ankle
and again as she rises up past his chest
the man just keeps walking
to earpiece two guns
one ankle one shoulder
you call it
you take point
ill circle behind
the thin man is headed down the hall
looking back we see dylan enter from the ballroom
he doesnt turn back
excuse me do you know which way the ladies room is
the man takes a sudden right into a service hallway
why do they always run
she slips off her heels to give chase
the thin man comes around the corner
we stay tight on him until he suddenly stops
has come around from the other side
his bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together
hes boxed in
and then a ding
elevator doors open beside him
he looks in to see the clue less bellboy who had a funky groove going on his headphones
in a single motion the thin man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place
hits the button
from opposite directions natalie and dylan run to the elevator but the doors have already shut
checking the panel
hes going down
they take the stairs
natalie and dylan emerge from the staircase to find the elevator empty
to the left exit doors swing tellingly
nat and dylan smash through the exit doors and out into the sun drenched streets of beautiful downtown los angeles
natalie immediately spots the thin man booking down the alley
and they take off after him
what ensues is the fastest wildest two chicks and one guy foot chase youve ever seen
here are some highlights thin man pulls himself clumsily over a chain link fence
dylan and natalie pull an old jackie chan trick and run up the side wall and hop over easily
thin man still on foot waits for traffic to slow then darts across the harbor freeway
by the time dylan and natalie get there traffic is roaring again
undeterred they make their way through tucking and rolling under the wheels of a moving semi
dylan is racing down an alley when a car comes barrelling at her
she leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives underneath her a la one of those thats incredible
they chase the thin man into an industrial laundromat
the scene goes something like this thunderously loud with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt
natalie and dylan are just entering when ring out
they dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly
there are times i wish we carried guns
wheres the challenge in that
angle on the thin man planning his next move
with no good shot at the angels he aims high both guns blazing
he shots out the pipes over their heads sending down a cascade of hot water
dylan and natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded
other pipes shatter from the change in pressure leading to an interior thunderstorm
steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor
natalie and dylan push rolling laundry carts in the thin mans direction
he shoots at them but quickly realizes theyre just trying to waste his bullets
holstering one of his guns he dials his cell phone
on the far wall natalie switches on the overhead hooks which circle on a wire like a ski lift
the thin man looks up distracted not noticing as she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts
shes succeeded in circling behind the thin man as he talks on the phone
she clears her throat
the thin man turns
she kicks him in the jaw
knocked back he drops the phone which cracks and slips under a washing machine
he crab walks back then suddenly springs back to his feet
we werent expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy
right behind him
with a coiled towel she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him
but he reacts smoothly rolling over to charge at natalie picking her up like a sack of potatoes
as he does he grabs her right in the tit
hands off assh
before she can finish her sentence the thin man throws natalie at dylan knocking them both down
he jumps up and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks another releasing a wall of steam we cant see a thing
by the time the fog clears the thin man is long gone
okay to summarize
lying down in the water dylan reaches under the washer to fish out the thin mans busted cell phone
natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor the thin mans cell phone connected by a data cable to the townsend agency computers
rapidly touching the screen she calls up a list of the last thirty five phone calls he received
theyre all from the same location
that was easy
no it wasnt
she points to some code next to the numbers
ive seen this before hes scrambling his calls through a secondary location
we need to tap this phone line at the source then well know where his calls were coming from
checking out the numbers
thats not local where is it
bos can we check a directory
i know where it is
i used to spend every winter there
as she says it
the sign says it welcome to aspen
various establishing shots of the gorgeous mountain town still somehow quaint despite its astonishing wealth
a rowdy establishment just outside of town
the kind of place that rich weekend skiers dont come
lots of over aggressive cowboy biker types drinking more than they should
there are only a few women in the place and they are either waitresses or biker chicks
suddenly everyone stops what theyre doing and turns to the door
charlies angels have entered the room
dressed in their stylish ensembles they couldnt possibly look more out of place
eyes on the prize nat
we gotta tap the phones
that looks like our target
she points to a door at the back of the bar that leads into a glassed in office
two beefy bouncer types are guarding the door
im gonna need a distraction
dylan and natalie smile at each other
i think that can be arranged
the three angels split up bosley tagging along with dylan
sidles up to the bar
a group of three rednecks are downing shots one after another
three shots of tequila please
bosley whispers in her ear and one tom collins
the rednecks stare at dylan drooling
dylan turns to the first one
hey baby why dont you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap
bosley tries to make himself small
ooh that is an enticing offer
but i got a better idea
how about a shot contest
the three rednecks hoot and holler
okay ill take that as a yes
bring ten shots of tequila over to my table
and keep em coming
a group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the mechanical bull
natalie wanders over behind them
mind if i try
the crowd parts for her and natalie hops up on the bull
she cranks it up and lets dylan downs a shot slams it on the table
countless other glasses surround her
reveal that two of the rednecks are down for the count one falling out of his chair the other passed out on the table
the third redneck is slurring badly trying to keep up with dylan
hey ive got an idea
now lets have a chair throwing contest
never heard of it
you just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can
the redneck nods lifts up his chair and heaves it across the bar
dylan and natalie create a distraction while alex sneaks into the back office with bosley to get the phone number of the chalet
a vw van climbs the winding road
as we get closer we see the side reads chalet grams
a ding dong ding ding dong doorbell rings
two thugs with shoulder holsters look up hearing the bell
one was tending to the fire
we expecting somebody
thug two shakes his head
checking his gun thug one grabs for his windbreaker
puts it on over
thug one opens the door to find dylan and natalie dressed in swiss miss outfits complete with blonde braids
correcting dylan guten morgen
correcting natalie guten nacht
to each other guten freund
the girls lean in and hug each other butts sticking out
to the left bosley starts playing oommpa oommpa oommpa oommpa on a wrap around tuba
hes wearing lederhosen with a feather in his hat
natalie begins to yodel
dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug
thug two is approaching from behind curious what the hell is going on
dylan begins to talk sing a song in german about a too curious goat and his worried mistress
even with the pantomime we have no idea whats happening
it seems wholesome but occasionally one of the girls touches the other in a weirdly coquettish oddly sexual way
thug two looks at the address on the envelope
low they got the wrong address
as the angels continue their routine the camera rises three quick cuts to take us to
where a black cat suited alex stands at the chimney
a ribbon of smoke curls from the stack
pulling the pin from a canister she drops it down the chimney
a cheerful fire burns in the over sized fireplace
the canister drops into the flames from above suddenly venting a hissing cloud of halon gas
the fire dies immediately the logs covered with a violent frost
alex doesnt even need a rope
her feet pressed to the sooty walls she expertly slides to the bottom
alex backs out of the fireplace to find a waiting bad guy swinging at her head
she ducks just in time
the poker chings against the stone making a spark
rolling jumping and diving alex scurries as pokerman slashes and stabs
she ducks behind a chair which pokerman catches with the hook winging it across the room
backed against the wall alex yanks on the heavy curtains pulling them down along with the wooden curtain rod
a spin a flourish of velvet and the curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty quarterstaff
she goes on the offensive
thrust parry spin
but hes a worthy adversary
one good karate kick breaks her staff in two
she uses both pieces to club him in the knees then rolls back to the fireplace
she grabs the remaining tool the fireplace tongs
alex catches his weapon in the tong scissors yanking it free with such force the point sticks in the wall
a quick kick knocks pokerman to the floor where alex rolls on top of him
she catches his head in the tongs squeezing his temples
his eyes bulge
young billionaire eric knox paces
hes grungy with two days of stubble but still a darn attractive guy
hearing a kick at the door he turns
a second kick blows the door open
who are you
bosley is about to hyper ventilate on the tuba sweaty and a little blue
dylan and natalies new song has them sharing the saddle of an imaginary horse
when dylan reaches back to slap the horse she hits natalie in the rump
both women tee hee
the thugs think its pretty hot
dylan whispers a secret to natalie
natalie whispers back
turning to the thugs they each lean in to whisper into a different thugs ear
as the men smile the angels suddenly bonk the two mens heads together
both men fall knocked out
stepping over the bodies dylan heads inside
looking for the way out alex leads knox to a closed door
she opens it to find
two more thugs sitting in front the big screen tv watching a college basketball game duke vs
maryland in case you care
the guards look back spotting alex with knox
that wouldnt be so bad if it werent for the watching the game with them
angle on alex
its an oh shit moment
to knox back
the thugs are out of their seats a moment later each of them pulling out a firearm
holding down three keys on the tuba bosley talks into the mouthpiece
it has a secret radio
alex whats your status
running alex pushes knox ahead of her checking their backs
she talks into a wrist mic
good news i found knox
another thug steps out in front of her
she kicks him down the steps
bad news i found company
reaching the bottom of the steps knox is surprised to be grabbed by dylan
at this point hell do whatever they say
dylan rushes knox across the driveway to the waiting van natalie is pulling it around
overhead bright security lights switch on
back at the front door alex pulls it shut
she attaches a carabiner clip to the handle running a thin steel cord from it around the porch column
the first of the thugs reaches the door tries to pull it open but cant
the next few guards try to help him while the rest start smashing through the windows
running with the tuba bosley stops for a moment to catch his breath hands on his knees
okay ready to run again
hes the last to be pulled into the van
a spray of gravel and theyre off
everyone is piled on top of each other
dylan and knox have a few awkward moments as they get untangled
bosley keeps making inappropriate tuba noises
at the wheel natalie is fierce and focused in total control
looking out the back windows alex sees the kidnappers piling into jeeps to give chase
from the side of the house more thugs appear on motorbikes
theyre coming after us
to knox confident we were expecting that
okay new problem
everyones attention whips forward to see the headlights of coming up the high mountain road
it straddles the center line blocking both directions
theres no way around it
thoughts suggestions points to consider
i dont suppose giving up would be a
no it wouldnt
there is no right
she points to a faded closed sign that hangs from a chain
in the darkness who knows what its blocking
but as we hear the thunderous horn from the oncoming truck we know theres no choice
natalie cuts a hard right smashing through the sign
the van thumps and bumps its way across the low grass its headlights only showing ten feet ahead
at any moment the ground could stop in a cliff
the van leaps into empty space
tires spin helpless
the van falls
bosley is the loudest
and then touchdown
the van hits the ground hard but not catastrophically
natalie hits the brakes cuts the wheel hard to avoid hitting in front of them
everyone takes a beat to acknowledge theyre alive
where are we
suddenly a bright light goes on overhead
one by one a series of arc lights switches on forming a snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain
looking out the back windows
its a bobsled run
theyre facing backwards
up ahead the kidnappers are charging down the access roads
the first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute
if it goes down the mountain thats all i need
throwing it into reverse natalie peels out
the jeeps follow
the vw van leads the way down the mountain tail first
as it builds speed it starts to climb the wall each turn getting steeper and steeper
the two jeeps are following
facing the right direction they have a much easier time of it
everything is shaking so violently it looks like a nasa launch
looking out the back hard left
natalie makes the turn
the van rises up nearly tilting over
but they make it through the turn
to dylan is this part of the plan
except for the bobsled run and the backwards part its going exactly according to plan
he smiles at her
he has a nice smile
one of the jeeps makes a move closing the distance to the van
a rifleman leans out the passenger window lining up a shot
the shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield through the horn of bosleys tuba then out the back window
it missed hitting somebody by millimeters
natalie is still focused making each turn as alex calls it
the front jeep gets even more aggressive building speed
it hits the next turn too fast rising up too high along the wall
it tips further and further finally rolling over onto its back
it scrapes across the concrete a shower of sparks as it slows down
with nowhere to go the second jeep brakes hard but cant stop
it smashes into the first jeep a tangle of steel
the combined mass continues sliding down the run like a jagged pinball in the chute
dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes farther and farther away
i think were in the clear
just then two motorbikes race up along the chute walls passing the crippled jeeps
two more motorbikes jump in from above
or maybe not
suddenly natalie gasps remembering something
oh god no
what is it
a dejected pete stands in front of the sign for the anime festival two tickets in hand
i have a date with pete
natalie makes the hard right
the motorcycles are gaining on them but natalie and dylan have to talk through this first
call him hell totally understand
gee sorry pete
i had to rescue a billionaire
she makes the left
ill sound like a flake
i cant stand flakes
he will so give you the second chance
hello i saw the way he looked at you
one motorcycle charges coming up just feet from the windshield
natalie taps on the brakes
the freaked out guy cant slow down in time
he smacks into the windshield then goes flying
were at the bottom
indeed we are
the concrete walls end leaving open ground
slamming on the brakes natalie turns the van around
everyone goes flying
bosley is still on the phone with charlie
back facing the right direction the van charges onward
the motorcycles race up to the passenger side grabbing for the door
dylan slams open the door knocking one rider off
the sliding door opens another rider outside trying to get in
thinking fast knox grabs bosleys tuba and shoves it at the motorcyclist who tumbles taking out the fourth rider in the process
genuinely impressed well done
natalie is at the controls bosley beside her
alex leans forward from the second row
i think that went very well
charlie should send me on more missions
we couldnt have done it without you bos
natalie pats him on the arm
she and alex exchange a quick glance
they have to just laugh
in the back row knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights of aspen
she offers him an airplane sized bottle of johnnie walker black
he takes it and toasts
they both down their drinks in a single shot
a smile and then
the angels triptych descends
the act is over
after a beat we re establishing
charlie is on the speakerphone
the angels are in their usual lounging positions
good work angels
not only did you save knox you saved his company as well
i think that earns us a vacation
to natalie any special guy you were thinking of inviting
natalie grins a guilty smile
our work is only half done
clean shaven and neatly pressed hes still a darn good looking man
vivian wu follows him
meet your new client eric knox
first off thank you
you rescued me for which i am eternally grateful
hes talking to all the angels but his gaze seems to fall most upon dylan
she notices it
but theres still a problem
whoever kidnapped me wasnt just trying to screw up our ipo
they also stole the proprietary software for our new web browser
im sure it was roger corwin but i need proof
thats where you come in angels
circling around we see the video images of corwin and the red star systems logo on the big screen
we need to break into red stars computer systems to see if mr
knoxs software is indeed being converted for red stars use
sounds like a plan
not as easy as that natalie
red stars headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility
were going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system and the best way to get that is through mr
a video image of corwins palm pilot schedule comes up the bigscreen
the shot pulls in close on san diego speedway
we need to pin a camera on him to get footage of the inside of the building
thanks to alexs work at the health spa we know that corwin will be at the san diego speedway on thursday
get close to him angels but dont tip your hand
consider it done
dylan i need you to arrange for mr
id hate to have him kidnapped again
but wed all feel safer if you could join us charlie
from charlies p
looking up at the sunlight
three manta rays swim above us
we can hear the bubbles from charlies regulator
id love to angels
but im in a bit over my head at the moment
a manta ray swims past super close letting us
a majestic craftsman in the hills frank lloyd wright meets conspicuous consumption
a flashlight beam sweeps past revealing dylan
with just her shoulders above the rafters shes checking a dusty crawl space
she finds nothing suspicious
knox stands below dylans boots on his shoulders
the heels dig in a bit but hes not complaining
he moves to help her down but she does a reverse pullup to handle it by herself
she leads the way
the room is huge
through the floor to ceiling windows we see that were up in the hills
knox follows her as she walks
ive got surveillance on all the windows
dont answer the door dont answer the phone
just as big just as beautiful
knox or his decorator has great taste
everything is top quality but unpretentious
also stay away from the windows
theyre bullet proof
the last owner was paranoid
a smile lucky for us
she takes a marker sized device off the table
this is a panic button
tosses it to him press it and one of us can be here in ten minutes
which one of you
she takes her jacket off the couch ready to go
i have a better idea
he tosses her the panic button
stay for dinner
preempting objections im a pretty good cook
i cant mr
quickly im scared
dylan is surprised by this
look i didnt want to admit it but i am
i was kidnapped once and it wasnt fun
i know you probably have other plans but it would be very reassuring
dylan looks him over
normally shed be suspicious but the guy was just kidnapped and he seems sincere
come on dont make me beg
im embarrassed already
she throws her coat back on the sofa
we pan off a half played scrabble game to find dylan and knox at the windows
dylan picks up a family photo knox as a little boy with a father in a military uniform
thats you hunh
taking the photo its the only picture i have of me with my parents
they died a week later
oh im sorry
i had no idea
please dont apologize
i was too young to understand
looking at the photo i never knew how they died
when i was a kid when i got shuffled from one foster home to another i always thought they just disappeared
i only found out later my father was in the military
he and my mother were killed while he was on assignment somewhere in eastern europe
mostly to himself the files were classified but i read enough to know that he was a good man
apparently he was betrayed by one of his own team
thats a lot for a kid to live with
yeah but it motivated me losing my family
it still does
i dont take anything for granted
boy did i have you pegged wrong
intrigued how do you mean
well to be honest i thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything
but thats pretty typical
ive got instincts for the job but when it comes to men
im glad you dont see me as just a client
he brushes his hand against hers
she brushes back fingers against fingers
a long beat
well you are so
is there someone you need to be going home to
beat but i
he kisses her
after a moment she breaks off
its not that it was a bad kiss
it was a damn good kiss
knox moves towards her
dylan holds him back
she stands up
thank you for dinner mr
and lock the door behind me
she gets up and leaves
roaring past on the track
its all thunder smoke and asphalt
with a roar another blur of racers whips past with heat and noise and speed
the lead car bears the familiar markings of red star industries
roger corwin is at the wheel steering calmly to a comfortable lead when he is suddenly bumped
another bump sends him screeching to the left
he almost crashes then gets back on course just as hes passed by
a sleek black car sponsored by the sony corporation and manned by a mysterious driver with texas tornado inscripted on the helmet
we follow the black car as it pulls into the pit
the racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her
of course the racer is natalie aka betty lou hobert the texas tornado
yelling over the engine noise beat texas accent natalie shakes out her hair winks at the pit boss
the pit crew races in to make repairs
dylan dressed in a pit suit kneels by natalies front tire
natalie crouches down next to her so they can talk
i nicked him
should give you enough time to do the deed
im on it
dylan steals away heading for
corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit
the pit repairs his car as corwin is approached by another racer also wearing a red star racing suit
he leans into corwins car and now we see thats its
the thin man
you okay boss
no thanks to you
youre supposed to be my head of security
who is that bitch
the thin man peers over at natalie but shes got her back to him
ill keep an eye out
you do that
corwin peels out onto the track again almost crushing the thin man in the process
dylan sneaks in
in all the cacophony no one notices as she grabs corwins suitcase out of the back seat of his regular car a bitching mercedes
she checks both ways to see if shes being watched
coast is clear dylan
where alex dressed as a trophy girl watches the race through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals
she nods to bosley who is dressed as the flag waver
he speaks into a walkie talkie
lets make the switch
dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit and swaps it with one in corwins car
she carefully switches all his files from the old briefcase to the new one then gives alex a thumbs up
natalie roars back onto the track keeping corwin in her sights
then she spots another red star car coming up right next to her
she locks eyes with the thin man
the two of them recognize each other at the exact same instant
the thin man realizing hes been made jams on the brakes and skids off to the right which leads to a ramp that heads out of the stadium
natalie not wanting to lose him does something crazy
even though shes at the front of the pack she brakes hard swerves into a full degree u turn and starts heading the wrong way on the race track
startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she follows the thin man out of the racetrack
to a chorus of car horns the thin mans blue racer weaves through the spectator traffic entering the speedway
looking back we see natalie is gaining on him
finally clear of the traffic both cars let it rip
looking down on a freeway where a ubiquitous police pursuit is in progress
if youre just joining us were approaching hour five of a pursuit that has lead us all across the southland at speeds up to miles an hour
a beat up gray chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars down the empty freeway
its oddly calm and hypnotizing
chuck time and again we hear the question why dont the police just ram the other car or shoot out the tires
the lapd has a policy of hanging back and following unless
suddenly the blue formula one car comes screeching past the cops and the suspect over miles per hour
what was that
still hot on the thin mans tail natalie has the engine as she passes the police cars we see several officers look over what the hell
natalie catches up to the gray chrysler
looks over to see the wild eyed suspect hunched over the wheel
he looks back at her
a beat later shes passed him just taillights on the freeway
with the lanes cleared for the other chase there is nothing preventing the formula one cars from hitting top speed which they do
natalie is catching up to the thin man
as they head under an overpass we see kids cheering
the thin man checks his gauges
the gas dial is perilously close to empty these cars are meant to be refilled often
up ahead he sees an exit
he starts to slow down
but when youre going miles per hour that can take a while
he misses the exit
natalie is trying to match his speed
the thin man pulls over to the side stops fully
braking as hard as she can natalie still passes him
the thin man throws a u turn heading up the freeway on ramp
we catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads like lions pacing
pulling off her helmet natalie scans right and left for the blue car shes lost sight of him
the narrow windshields of these racers doesnt make it any easier
we look down on natalies car as she rounds a corner still searching
natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the long pier
it pulls a u turn to face her then stops engine idling
theres only way off the pier and its past natalie
the thin man revs his engine
natalie revs hers
angle on a white seagull pecking at something on the pier halfway between the two racers
the bird looks up hearing the engines
angle on the thin man
he pulls his harness tighter
revs his engine higher
angle on natalie
if its a game of chicken he wants shell give it to him
she revs her engine higher still
the noise scares the bird who suddenly flies off
like a flag being dropped thats the signal for both racers to peel out
a cloud of smoke
rubber on asphalt
already reaching a tremendous speed the racers are on a collision course
the thin man isnt going to turn away
neither is natalie
racing faster and faster still theres only one way this can turn out
but then at the very last moment the thin man wusses out
he cuts the wheel right missing natalie and careening off the edge of the pier
in slow motion we watch as his racer hangs in mid air wheels still spinning
back heavy the tail hits the water first
natalie brakes hard cuts the wheel to avoid going off the far end of the pier
she finally stops the rear tire just inch from the edge
craning up along the side of the pier we find natalie looking into the water where the blue racer went in
theres just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles
we see lots of hallways doorways and security locks all from the pov of a mans hip
the footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase that corwin is now carrying with him
we pull back from the video to see we are actually watching it
on the big screen
the angels and bosley watch the footage along with knox and vivian wu
vivian has seated herself close to natalie
so close in fact that natalie keeps having to shift a few inches
dylan meanwhile sits across the room from knox deliberately avoiding eye contact
on the big screen as the videocamera passes a room marked with an intimidating warning sign
thats the room with the mainframe
everything at red star goes through that system
so if we want to find proof that red star stole knoxs technology thats the computer to tap
but they have heavy firewalls and encryption
you cant jack in from outside
youll have to physically be in that room to get at the data
even if we do get inside there wont be time to search for it
theres got to be a hundred terabytes of information there
it could take days
so you install a transmitter
all eyes go over to natalie
patch in directly to the relay broadcast on a high frequency
that way you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home
and they have no idea that you can peek inside
knox is impressed
the other angels nod
its a good idea
thats all fine in theory
but you still have to get inside that room to install it
what about security
red star has a lot of government contracts so security is tight
key card badges throughout
redundant security at all red line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes
pervasive video surveillance lasers air displacement sensors
plus a hard wired fail safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping
it sounds impossible
alex checks with her fellow angels
theyre in agreement
it sounds like fun
with a subtle rush we move into a stylized montage that shows how they do it
it features whip pans freeze frames and zooms to show us only the highlights
only the two directors can disengage the fail safe
we have to get their keys
angle on director s part of the lunchtime crowd
alex and natalie are on the catwalk in the middle of a grinding routine
paying for his drink he fumbles with his wallet
his waitress helps him find the right bill
as she walks away we see the waitress is dylan
we zoom in on the orange key card shes grabbed from him
angle on bosley done up in full clown makeup
he tries to twist a balloon animal but no luck
finally it pops
the children cry
entertaining the adults magician alex whips open her silk handkerchief to reveal that the item has disappeared
angle on director who looks very worried
magicians assistant dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the directors billfold is underneath
getting it back hes relieved
passing behind dylan natalie takes the orange keycard dylan hands off
then we have to get back into red star
problem is their biometric sensors are too good
we need someones help
angle on roger corwin driving his mercedes
he slows a road crew working ahead
angle on dylan dressed in an orange vest manning the slow stop sign
she makes corwin stop leans in to apologize for the delay
behind the mercedes natalie sneaks up
she quickly picks the trunk lock then quietly climbs in
she hoists in a large duffel bag then shuts herself inside
we hear the car moving again
stripped down to a bra natalie attaches an illuminated mirror to the underside of the trunk lid
starts to pull more items from her duffel bag black shoes a dress shirt a tie
we see corwins mercedes pull into the parking garage
walking away from the car corwin hits the remote
the mercedes bwoops
a beat later a hand comes out from under the trunk lid
natalie climbs out only shes not natalie anymore
shes become corwin identical to the last detail
she tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as she walks
corwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid
a laser scans it
the security guard hits the button releasing the gate
he goes back to his magazine as corwin passes through
a beat then
you gonna let me through or what
tommy the guard looks up sees corwin is still at the counter
yeah sorry mr
he hits the button again letting corwin through
tommy goes back to his magazine still a little perplexed
the same places we saw on the videotape
natalie as corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader sending the lights from red to green
she splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack
pulls up a tiny antenna
corwin walks down the hall still talking with his colleague
natalie as corwin is walking right towards them
she turns away as she passes
he didnt even spot her
as a group the angels move through the upscale lunch crowd to find knox and vivian wu at a booth
alex opens a slim sony laptop sets it on the table
red stars mainframe is open for business
astonished vivian wu hits some keys checking that what they say is true
to a passing waiter champagne please
smiling knox motions for them to take a seat
now i know why i hired you
youre the best
a look between the angels
they know its true
to knox re laptop ill have systems get to work on this right away
she reaches for the laptop
bosley snatches it away
uh actually miss wu we will get to work on this right away
any evidence we find will be turned over to you and the proper authorities
i dont think you understand how important that data is mr
oh indeed i do
and thats why ill take very good care of it when i find it
reaching for the laptop but
do as the man says
reluctantly vivian wu pulls her hand away
bosley tucks the laptop into a steel briefcase then stands
where you off to bos
uh oh lemme guess
youre off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort
fire island here i come
dylan does a spit take the other two angels roll their eyes
as bosley exits the restaurant vivian wu eyes him carefully
knox raises a glass to toast the angels
have to go
as they get up
to dylan and you
she notices the other angels staring at her
she doesnt answer at first
natalie quickly picks up whats going on
she glances at alex then clears her throat
hey dylan can we talk to you for a second
natalie alex and dylan kibbitz near the sinks
theres something going on between you and knox
so what so i like him
is that so wrong
uh yeah dylan it is
hes a client
was a client
we finished the job
shes got a point
she doesnt have any point alex i cant believe youre siding with her
im not siding with anyone but technically he is no longer
you know charlie would never approve of this
oh come on charlie wouldnt care
i think youre just being overly cautious
they turn to look at her
im a big girl
i make my own decisions
im going out with him
she walks out of the ladies room
bosley hums in the navy to himself as he walks through a parking garage
hes alone in the echo y garage and everything we know about movies tells us this means trouble
bweep bweep as his alarm shuts off
just as hes about to lift the handle he stops
looks back over his shoulder
did he hear something
he scans the empty garage
no one in sight
mustve been his imagination
bosley climbs in shutting the door behind him
hes putting the keys in the ignition when
a hand clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth
its the thin man
bosley struggles but in moments hes unconscious
the thin man stuffs bosley in the trunk slams it shut revealing
vivian wu standing beside the thin man
shes holding the case bosley refused to give her before
so now we have the transmitter what do we do with fat boy
dirt nap time
not until ive got the information i need
well take him to the compound hold him there
beat in the meantime weve got to tie up some loose ends
whenever you say something like that it means more work for me
ignoring him the angels will figure out they were duped
we cant afford them jeopardizing our plans
here it comes
coldly we have to kill charlies angels
the thin man sighs whips out his cell phone
guess ill cancel my weekend plans
and speaking of weekend plans
jason and alex are walking down a beautiful tree lined cobblestone street holding hands
the buildings and outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint vaguely european town
alex i cant tell you how happy i am you came
no i mean its weird
its weirding me out how happy i am when youre around
am i sick or something
smiling got me
the only bummer is i start to jones when youre not around
what the hell am i gonna do this weekend if youre not with me
well get you some sedatives
youll be fine
he stops takes her in his arms
with the moonlight shining down its very romantic
wait a second
come with me
come with you
miami on the sony jet
ive got two tickets to the final four
jason i dont
wait before you say no let me just say something okay
im sick of how little we see each other
im sick of stealing a day here or a week there
its my job jason
i cant explain it but i have to be on call all the time and
what if i changed all that
what if i told you to quit your job and come live with me
what im saying alex is that i want you to
gunshots ring out
alex in angels mode immediately throws him to the ground and covers him
she feels something wet looks down to see jasons chest covered in blood
my god youre hit
he laughs theyre squibs its fake
he wipes off a little puts it on her tongue
finally convinced she almost lets herself laugh
that we are in a soundstage the cobblestones street is just a set
the gunfire was coming from some effects guys who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage visible through the open loading door
fake guns too
theyre just setting up for the next scene
he helps her up
sorry about that i
smiling god i loved that
the way you yelled and everything
baby you been watching too many movies
he kisses her on the nose alright i gotta go reset these
dont go anywhere
i want to finish this conversation
as he walks out of the soundstage alex is left behind alone
she cleans herself off shaking her head at her own paranoia
a wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster
alex looks at the hole
two more little explosions these barely missing her face
hey is someone firing more squibs or
suddenly without warning the wall is plastered with silenced gunfire
its only alexs instincts that let her duck in time to avoid being turned into swiss cheese
she tucks and rolls behind a styrofoam set as
two gunmen with silenced sniper rifles fan out on the fake city street
crouched behind a wall
she looks both ways
if she tries to break for the open loading door shell lead the gunmen right back to jason
only way out of here is to head for the far wall all the way across the building where theres a fire exit
taking a deep breath she darts across the fake street
fire at her one of them pulling off his silencer and going to machine gun mode
the sound of the gunshots are covered by the sound of the effects guy test firing guns outside
sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams
she lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow cracking the two by fours in half
move slowly through the fake street set
suddenly they hear a creaking sound
they look up to see the whole fake building set collapsing
they dive out of the way just in time to see alex race through the fire doors
alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car parked nearby
the gunmen emerge from the stage and spot her just as she gets the car started
she peels out as a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield
jason has just gotten his squibs refitted
hes facing the opposite direction so he doesnt see alexs car whizz away in the background
jason walks into the soundstage followed by the effects crew
of course shes nowhere to be found
while he looks around one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in the set wall
he presses against it and a flattened he thinks for a moment then shakes his head
a passing filmgoer reveals natalie and pete
seated near the aisle they share a giant tub of popcorn
the movie hasnt started yet but theres a slide show of various anime heroes and villains
thanks for the second chance
i swear im really not a flake
he shrugs it off
how can i deny any woman whos seen all lords of wind and power
i bet theres a dozen women here who fit that description
honestly theres a looks component as well
youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen this close up
how can she not be flattered by that
she would say something back but the moment has gotten so electrified that each little glance just brings on more goofy in loveness
the only solution is to leave
ill be back in two minutes
ill be here
a wee bit smitten natalie enters as the last woman leaves
we hear just the drip drip drip of a faucet and the muzak version of power stations some like it hot
natalie shuts the door behind herself then sets to work putting down a tissue paper seat cover
we look under stall doors to find a pair of black mens boots stepping down from inside
natalie is not alone
natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops
her spider sense is tingling
we tilt up to see a well dressed man
hes at least
he stops at natalies stall door drawing his gun
a beat then he kicks the door open revealing
the automatic toilet flushes itself
the man takes a half step in confused
suddenly the door swings back smashing into his right hand
he drops the gun looking up to see who is perched atop the stall walls
she pushed the door with her foot
grabbing an overhead pipe she performs an acrobatic swing landing both feet on the guys head
he falls into the next row of stalls
natalie reaches for the gun but the man grabs her ankles
he pulls her back across the tile floor flipping her over
that just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts
with a scissors lock around his neck natalie is pulled up while the man falls
she lands a knee on his windpipe
who do you work for
he tries to pull her off
she leans in harder
speak now or never again
motioning with eyes jacket pocket
suspicious she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather billfold
flips it open to reveal an i
national security agency
youre with the nsa
ive been following you
i didnt know which side you were on
beat this is bigger than you think
the anime classic is playing
pete keeps looking back towards the door
hes been ditched again
just when hes about to give up hope natalie is there
im so sorry but i have to go
i cant explain
hands card this is my cell phone number
please call me tomorrow
with that she goes
a beat then she comes back
kisses him once hard
then goes for real
dylan and knox walk hand in hand up a quaint woodsy path behind knoxs home
we can hear music drifting up from the hill in front of them
wheres that music coming from
just a little farther
he helps her up a steep part of the path
as she comes over the crest of a hill
taking in the view oh wow
the hill behind knoxs house has a magnificent view right into the hollywood bowl
the music is the symphony playing something very romantic
they stand there together just listening to the music knox watching her reaction closely
can i ask you a personal question
how much do you know about charlie
dylan seems surprised by this question
i just find it strange that you work for a man youve never met
well i dont know what he looks like but i feel like i know him
we all do
and none of you have any clue who he actually is
and youre never curious to find out
of course but believe me its impossible
beat lets not talk about charlie okay
she smiles t him motioning for them to go back up to knoxs house
in fact lets not talk at all
dylan and knox are asleep in his bed when the doorbell chimes
dylan bolts upright
she slips out of bed peers out the window
vivian wu is waiting by the front door
eric its vivian
i wonder what shes here for
want me to tell her to come back or
id better deal
he kisses her you go back to bed
knox pulls on a robe goes downstairs
as she pulls on her clothes her cell phone rings
she grabs it
dylan we were set up
vivian wu is not who she says she is
shes a former assassin and an all around bitch
natalie shes here
im at knoxs she just showed up
driving her own highly excellent car natalie has it floored
im ten minutes away
wait until i get there
i cant do that
call alex and meet me here
but dylans already hung up
cursing her partner natalie races the car even harder
knox is sitting at the coffee table signing papers
vivian sitting across from him has her cell phone open
they are both surprised to see dylan walk into the room
i see you take your bodyguarding services seriously
still i worry that no one is watching the door
covering oh im watching it
in fact i just called for back up
from her bag vivian pulls a silver mm
all the same im concerned about mr
although knox is clueless its clear the message vivian is sending to dylan
shes in control here
vivian sets the gun on the table in easy reach
explaining vivian just came over to run through some numbers for the ipo
please take a seat
im almost finished
with a knowing glance at dylan she goes back to her phone call
no alternative dylan takes a seat beside knox
both face vivian whose hand is very near the gun
dylan looks at knox as he reads through his papers
he has no idea theres anything wrong
on phone really
vivian gestures to the abandoned scrabble game on the table
why not play
im not much for games
as knox flips pages in the report dylan casually begins pushing scrabble letters around nothing serious
but shes managed to spell
she gets knoxs attention looks to the word up to vivian
knox follows her intention but doesnt seem to believe it
while vivian continues to talk on the phone knox sets his report down
pushes around some letters of his own
the words finally come out as
close on dylan
what does that mean
vivian snaps her phone shut
to knox bad news the other angels are still alive
good news everything else proceeding apace
dylan stands up
what the hell is going on
vivian draws the gun on her
knox moves over toward vivians side
i knew this moment would come sooner or later
i was just hoping for later
a long beat dylan trying to wrap her head around this
all this time we thought red star was behind this but it was you
realizing you faked your kidnapping
knox taps his nose
shes got it
to gain your trust
and get your help
beat i want you to know my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication
oh well in that case i feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker
dylan looks like shes about to leap forward and tear knoxs throat out
vivian gestures for dylan to keep stepping back
i cant believe i trusted you
you trust charlie and youve never even met him
dylan crosses the sill out onto the balcony
and believe me theres a lot about him that you dont know
anyway im not going to be an idiot and stand here talking when we could do something useful like kill you
goodbye dylan ill miss you
how right he is because as soon as vivian squeezes the trigger
dylan drops to the floor then rolls
the bullet misses dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider web crack to spread
dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while vivian pumps off shots
as she comes to the window dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted
the bulletproof glass shatters outward and dylan flies out the window onto the ledge
to vivian ive never seen you do something like that
oh shut up
dylan looks over the edge of the balcony
the drop off is incredibly steep the house is built on stilts and the fall looks like it would kill her
but she doesnt have much choice
come running out onto the balcony just in time to see dylan jump
they rush to the edge look down into a forbidding thicket of trees
she cant have survived
its too far
beat still i should probably check
knox shakes his head
weve got more important things to do
the two of them head back inside
as they do
we hold on the railing then slowly start to drift down to the underside of the balcony
dylan has attached her belt to the bottom of the railing and is hanging in the rafters
as she pulls herself back up
a black sedan pulls onto the tarmac
knox and vivian wu emerge then hustle into a waiting private plane
natalie dylan and alex nurse their wounds and compare notes
i cant believe knox tried to kill me
i mean ive been lied to ive been cheated on but no guy has ever tried to shoot me before
coldly im gonna get him for that
he played us from the very start
it was all just so he could get us to tap into red star
he couldnt figure out a way to do it himself
who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for the national security agency
and now thanks to us hes had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants for god knows what reason
the angels take a beat to let their indignation grow
wait a minute
we installed the transmitter yes but we never gave him the receiver
that laptop was the only way to access the transmitter
and we gave the laptop to
they look at each other
and on that note
we push in over the water to reveal the massive complex half villa half castle
built into the green hills its flanked by oversized windmills
armed guards as if they were necessary make sure no one goes up or down a staircase that leans up into the tower where their dangerous prisoner is being held
bosleys cell as such is a round room
bosley flits about in a panic
hes hardly touched the gourmet food on his tray
except for the pudding
he loves pudding
still a twitter bosley flips through the channels on his big screen tv
he watches a few moments of e
as the thin man takes the tray away bosley suddenly attacks him with the silverware
with a single hand to bosleys forehead the thin man holds him at arms length harmless
he takes the weapons away
bosley whistles to a bright red songbird who has landed on the windowsill
the bird whistles back
bosley thinks theyre having a conversation
bosley is going a little insane
in his spacious bathroom bosley is sitting on the toilet rocking as he makes spaceman noises
we hear a plop in the water and then a bleep bleep
curious he stands up and looks in the bowl
hes surprised by what he sees
alex is on the phone frantically dialing numbers
come on bosley answer
she hangs up then to the angels ive tried all his numbers and paged him five times
i dont even want to think about what im thinking right now
hes alive hes gotta be
she pauses what is that
theres a very faint voice coming from bosleys desk drawer
dylan walks around the desk yanks it open
angels can you hear me
dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer holds him up
bosleys voice gets louder
i dont know if you can hear me
i dont know if this thing is even working
the angels crowd around dylan and the receiver
it seems impossible
close on a satellite mini dish mounted to the roof
we crane down to look in a tower window where bosley is hunched over the tv
on the top of the tv a wire runs from the satellite feed to that bosley swallowed at the spa
its worked its way through his system
i know you cant answer but
i really hope you can hear this
the angels still cant believe theyre hearing his voice
can we trace him
not off a boosted signal
wed have to be within miles
come on bosley
tell us where you are
i dont know where i am really
im in a round room
the walls are white
not white white
more of a cream or an eggshell
yes im going to say vanilla
this isnt helping
i can see the ocean
dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage
wipes off the soot
i dont know which ocean
i was blindfolded the whole time
we were flying
it mustve been three or four hours
with her fingers dylan figures out how far he could have flown
estimates the circumference
frustrated he could be anywhere in north america
the bird bosley was whistling to lands on the tv looks at the transmitter curious
sings its song
wherever it is they have really good pudding
natalie holds up a finger stop
incredulous what pudding
the bird sings its song again
thats a blue spotted egret
they only live in one place
the music revs up as we
a helicopter touches down inside the villa gates
knox and vivian emerge
knox and vivian walk into a fully macked computer room where the thin man is supervising a techie as he taps away at bosleys laptop
our access was cut off at the source
but not before we retrieved the information you wanted
the thin man pulls a piece of paper out of a printer hands them to knox
the national security agencys secret file on the man known as charles townsend
takes the print out
beat how about bosley
did we get the information we wanted
once we we drugged him he sang like a bird
the thin man hands knox another print out
preparations have been made
we move out tonight
beat where is bosley
in the tower
we were waiting till you gave the word
no time like the present
the thin man nods
the thin man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do away with bosley
you should take a look at this
the henchman leads thin man into
a room lined with monitors that survey the courtyard
henchman points to one in the corner
look at the timer on the camera
its not moving
beat oh this is the oldest one in the book
punch up camera three
another camera angle comes up this also a view of the empty courtyard
now pan left
the henchman does what hes told and on the monitor
we see dylan dressed in a black cat suit as she rewires a security camera
she glances around making sure no one sees her
the old re loop the video camera trick
and look shes not even carrying a gun
beat what is this amateur hour
dylan sneaks her way through the courtyard doing an admirable job of trying to stick to the walls
as she comes around the corner
um excuse me
i think youre trespassing
she whips around to see the thin man standing right behind her
she instantly swings at him he blocks it
shes about to swing again when five guns get cocked against her temple
shes surrounded by guards
the thin man and his boys lead dylan into the house
no offense but as storming the castle plans go this one sucked
and i suppose you could do better
yeah i sure as hell could
how about an underwater entry
or hang gliding over the main tower
theres a million good ways in if you just do your homework
dylan glares at him and as she does
we move in close on dylans funky belt buckle
theres a tiny camera concealed there
natalie and alex huddle around a three inch monitor getting live video from dylans camera
you heard the man
nice work dyl
they move into action
dylan is led inside by the thin man
knox is waiting for her
present for you sir
dylan how nice
welcome to my florida home
not as tasteful as the one in la but much more private
she shrugs off the goons enough already
so tell me knox whats the brilliant plan
you gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder
blackmail the president
the first plan is too complicated and the second is virtually impossible
besides i already have all the money i need and my motivation is much simpler
leaning in close to her revenge
you know what
im not in a gabby mood right now
ive got a score to settle
he flips shut a suitcase filled with c explosive the same stuff we saw pascal selling in the opening scene
seems like youre going a bit overboard
no just leaving myself plenty of margin for error
with that he walks out of the room
the thin man signals to the henchmen
two of them force dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs
then with the thick packing tape they begin binding her arms to the arms of the chair
as they do i dont know why you bother
ive already won
is that so
every moment i sit here is a moment im using to figure out how to take you down
in fact this statement this one im making right here is just me stalling for time while i decide which of your goons im going to flatten first
whispering its gonna be the guy behind me
the thin man cant help but be amused
after all there are six guards and one blonde who is now taped to a chair
by the time your guys are firing ill be at about on my reverse inverted which will land me on fat boy there as promised
nods to the second guard hell take the chair seat in the chin
re two others very slowly now
im warning both of you im going to get you to shoot each other
cliche as that sounds
then to the last two last you guys hell ill make something up
well have fun
the thin man smirks oh so confidently
and what will you do to me
you wont even be here
i mean i dont want to tell you how to do your job but you shouldve killed me by now
because i already know that your people are onto my people which means any moment now youre going to be called out to go and deal suddenly the door flies
open and ah
we have intruders
with a glare to dylan the thin man follows him out
alex dressed in a sexy bikini emerges from the water and instantly takes out two guards
natalie hang glides into a courtyard knocking out two henchmen as she does
alex catches up with her as natalie pulls out a small scanner
you find him
ill get dylan
natalie heads left
alex goes right
racing up the stairs natalie enters a round room with open windows on all sides
a gentle breeze stirs the curtains
theres an amazing degree view from hills to ocean
according to her scanner bosley should be here but theres no one
bosley can you hear me
hearing her voice the feral bosley looks up
is that you
she hears him
she keeps yelling so does he until they both realize that his room is above hers
how do i get up to you
theres a staircase
look for a switch
she begins frantically checking the desk the shelves everything
her cell phone rings
she answers it
how are you
on break pete is talking on a pay phone
i just you said you wanted me to call
natalie keeps checking the shelves looking for a secret switch
i mean thank you for calling
im not an insecure person or anything and ive really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together
two goons race up the stairs into the office
natalie turns to face them
im just wondering if its something i said or did thats making this whole thing so weird between us
the goons approach
into phone can you hold on a sec
hitting mute natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives under the desk
she comes up on the other side with a electric cords attached
she backhands it into the goons who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through their bodies
un muting one more sec
she re mutes
with a roundhouse kick she flattens one of the goons whacks the other with the cell phone
the first goon charges at her but she sidesteps at the last moment leaving goon one to hit goon two
both men topple through the open window falling
un muting sorry about that
listen is this a bad time
not at all
she starts searching again for the switch
you just sound distracted
you know work this week has been really busy
its been hard to focus
behind natalie vivian wu reaches the top of the stairs
she moves stealthily
natalie has no idea shes there
see the thing is im not a full time waitress
i should have been more up front about that its just
at the last moment natalie catches a moving reflection in a shiny trophy
turns to find vivian wu swinging an antique chair at her head
the chair shatters the display case
scrambling to get away natalie drops the phone
natalie what was that
yelling to phone everythings fine
hate to disagree
vivian upends the desk nearly crushing natalie
vivian jumps on top ready to kick the shit out of our angel
as we probably suspected vivian wu is one hell of a martial artist
fortunately so is natalie
in their first series of blows vivian seems to have the upper hand but natalie rallies hard
vivian surprises her with a floor sweeping kick knocking her down
vivian grabs the phone off the floor
is this the famous charlie
confused no its pete
vivian looks at the phone
who the fuck cares
she throws the phone out the open window
getting up natalie stares her down incredulity building to rage
i like that guy
mocking vivian wipes away a tear
natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury a full out mortal kombat
vivian is thrown back against the bookcase where she knocks over a candlestick
thats the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking into the floor
circling around the room each set of shelves drops to a different level forming steps that lead to the upstairs room
as natalie and vivian continue to fight bosley sticks his head down from above watching the brawl
natalie is kicking ass
to vivian do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in los angeles
she slams vivian into the wall
grabs her again hands around her head
to be honest
vivian suddenly leans forward and kisses her right on the lips
i dont care
natalie is surprised for a moment which gives vivian the chance to swing at her
i can handle villainy
i can even handle super villainy
vivian swings and misses again but what you did is just wrong
she head butts vivian knocking her out cold
she throws the limp body on the floor
a beat then natalie looks up to see bosley
suddenly chipper hi bos
from below we hear security whistles
the compound has been breached
dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her
here we go
and now she does exactly what she told the thin man shed do she pitches forward ducking her head so the chairs back crashes into the railing tearing it off
okay that part worked
the guards fire but dylan has already launched herself from the railing into that backflip which lands her on the head of fat boy flattening him bad and smashing the
rest of the chair into kindling
she grabs the wooden seat and whips it up catching bullets from guard before flinging it like a frisbee at guard nailing him right on the chin
quickly she stands again between guards and
now guys i warned you
this is where you shoot each other
the two men scoff disbelieving
then dylan does a head fake both guards panic and fire but dylan drops leaving each man a clear shot at the other
just guards and left
dylans chair arms are still taped to her forearms
okay heres where we improvise
in a whirl she overhead chops guard
drives her right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm into the back of the guard s head
a few more blows then both men fall
now dylan drops into a second chair half exhausted half amused with herself
has one brief beat to take it all in then bosley steps onto the veranda sees dylan sitting in the chair
from his point of view it looks like dylan whose arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair is taped to the chair she now sits in
oh my god let me help you
bosley hurries over freeing her
amused dylan lets him
natalie steps out from inside pausing to kick one guard who was starting to revive
knox carrying the briefcase bomb gets into his waiting helicopter followed closely by the thin man
the helicopter quick ascends just as
run into the courtyard
dont worry well get him
you dont understand
hes got a pound of c in that briefcase
the question is wheres he headed
the three angels turn to see bosley huffing and puffing his way into the courtyard
the man knox is trying to kill has two general admission tickets to the duke maryland game at miami arena
hes going to blow up the arena and kill his target
not that i dont believe you but how exactly do you know all this
because angels i was the one who purchased those tickets
but bosley you hate sports why would you
suddenly getting it you didnt buy them for yourself
you bought them for
bosley lowers his head
suddenly all the angels understand
they race out the courtyard in hot pursuit
racing across the water we find thong clad beach babes moving to a latin beat
art deco buildings flank sun kissed streets
the people are sexy the daiquiris strong and every nights a fiesta welcome to miami
running down the street towards miami arena the three angels pass three other women rollerblading by jill monroe sabrina duncan and kelly garrett
nothing is said but a cool moment just happened
the three angels are running down a very long hallway
their voices are the only sound that echoes off these walls although there is a faint humming that grows louder as they approach two metal fire doors
what do you think he looks like
sixty tall well built
i always saw him as younger
with black hair
no silver hair
hes not george hamilton
hes outside a lot
well know him when we see him thats for sure
if we see him
how hard can it be to spot charlie
they slam into the doors and we
we reverse angle to reveal the inside of miami arena
the first thing that hits us is the wall of sound the noise made by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy
the next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the job facing the angels
hard to spot
the crowd is one enormous teeming mass of brightly colored humanity
the game is in progress duke vs
north carolina and its a barn burner
a one point game with six minutes to go
ball player pulls up and swishes a three pointer duke by two
the crowd goes apeshit
the angels huddle yelling over the deafening noise of the crowd
we have to split up
ill take the luxury boxes
ill take the mezzanine
i got the floor
they split up
dylan leads the charge down the loge section blowing past the security woman who yells after her
behind the rim college player pulls down a brick slams home the rebound
the crowd roars
jason gibbons famous movie star and north carolina alumnus pumps his fists in the air
his luxury box is loaded with fellow tar heels and nameless studio executives
he repeatedly high fives a hollywood type in sunglasses and armani
when suddenly the door to the luxury box is flung open
jason whips around and locks eyes with alex
realizing she has no time to explain and that charlie isnt in here she turns and leaves
while everyone watches confused jason pushes his way through the box and follows alex into the hall
dylan races past rows of seats pissing off plenty of fans in the process
looking everywhere charlie
in the stands
scribble at their monitors
natalie runs behind them scanning the crowd
whip pans from one man to another to another
stopping on a likely candidate
alex bursts in
its a crowd of fifteen cocktail drinking charles townsend
anybody charles townsend
she ducks back into the hallway
alex walks out into the hallway frustrated
then miraculously she spots him
he walks out of one of the luxury boxes holding a large metal briefcase
he heads for the elevator
immediately goes to intercept him but
its the thin man standing behind her with a gun in her back
you move you say anything i perforate you
knox glances back at the thin man nods to him
then he gets in the elevator
the thin man starts edging alex towards some emergency exit doors gun still in her back
alex is trying to think of an escape quickly
she knows that the second he gets her out of this public space hes gonna shoot her
the door gets closer and closer
jesus what is going on
the thin man and alex turn around to face jason who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her
jason hi i
the thin man digs the gun deeper into her back
can i talk to you later
no you can talk to me now
i want to know what the hell is going on
first you disappear with no explanation not even a goodbye
im sorry i
now i see you here but youre with some other guy
hey movie star do yourself a favor and get lost
jason double takes
hes not used to someone talking to him like that
you must be charlie
no no im sick of this shit
im sick of this asshole telling you what you can and cant do
and then with no warning he hauls off and punches the thin man
now jasons just an actor not an ass kicking super detective so his punch isnt all that great
in fact it leaves jason shaking his hand in pain
the thin man a trickle of blood running from his lip smiles
that was stupid
first he pops jason right in the jaw
jason stumbles backward dazed
then he reaches for his gun in the process loosening his grip on alex
jason get down
alex spins out of the thin mans grasp and does a full roundhouse kick knocking the gun out of the thin mans hands
the thin man immediately responds throwing two quick punches which alex expertly blocks and then follows with a hitch kick to the chin
jason dazed and confused thinks he must be hallucinating
what the hell is going on
whats going on is a world class ass kicking courtesy of his girlfriend
while the action star watches in amazement alex unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make jet li green with envy
the thin man doesnt stand a chance
a flying side kick sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell
we follow the fight
to the first landing
the thin man battered and bruised reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun but alex is too fast for him
she stamps on his hand then drops a knee to his throat
right now just by leaning forward i could crush your windpipe
youd die a slow and painful death
you dont want that do you
the thin man shakes his head no
where is the bomb whens it going off
she presses harder
jason slams out into the stairwell looking for alex
he finds her on her walkie talkie the thin man handcuffed to the staircase
gimme one second
jason nods sure
we go to another triptych all three angels on their cell phones in different parts of arena
knox planted the bomb in the basement and its timed to go off when the game clock hits zero
roger that alex ill stop the clock
ill look for the bomb
alex turns back to jason
hes clearly having a difficult time processing everything hes just seen
i lied to you jason
im not a secretary
yeah i can see that
referring to the thin man and that wasnt charlie
im actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building
would it be okay if we talked later
go save the world honey
beat ill be waiting for you
natalie stares up at the clock
the whistle blows
whew that was close
but itll start up any second
she has to keep it stopped
she glances to the sidelines and gets an idea
music starts from overhead the respective teams cheerleaders coming out for one last routine
as they kick into gear natalie comes out with them dressed as a duke cheerleader
she follows along with the dancers a bit timid at first then more confident as she gets into it
dylan races through the basement looking for the briefcase
then she spots it hooked into some wires that snake up into ceiling above
dylan approaches it cautiously
she slowly opens the top
to herself alright dylan all we have to do is figure out which wire to cut
there are about fifty different wires in every color in the crayola box
alex still searching for charlie notices something strange
youre kidding me
is fully transformed on the court from wallflower to full out cheerleader
its not that shes as good as the other cheerleaders
the song ends
the cheerleaders vacate the court but natalie keeps dancing her heart out
she has fans watching her and shes totally in the moment
but theres another agenda as well
the time out is over but one cheerleader doesnt seem to notice
officials cant start the clock again while shes on the court
dylan has picked two wires
chartreuse and magenta
this has gotta be it
she prepares to snip them with her wire cutters when
i wouldnt do that if i were you
she spins to see knox standing behind her
see if you snip any of those wires the bomb will blow up
its gonna blow anyway once the clock gets to zero
who told you that my idiotic henchman
do you think i tell him anything thats confidential
he holds up a small triggering device
its the same one we saw pascal try to sell in the opening scene
this is what triggers that bomb
so if youll kindly step away ill refrain from killing both of us
realizing she has no choice dylan stands up and backs away
in different circumstances dylan i think you and i could have worked out
we have a lot in common
yeah i fall for assholes and you are one
beat as he backs up well i must be going
if you like your body parts attached to your torso i suggest you do the same
knox turns to go but the other angels are blocking his way
give it up knox
give us the detonator
stumbling backwards knox holds it up high
ill blow this building sky high i swear
dont do it eric
its me you want not all these innocent people
everyone turns as one to a figure emerging from the shadows
thats right its charlie
finally after all these years we get a look at him and boy is it
hes not what we expected
short portly dressed in a were t shirt the angels are absolutely floored by charlies appearance
charlie ignores their stares and addresses knox directly
your father was a double agent eric
yes i revealed him but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail
beat he was my friend
its still your fault you arrogant prick
you still killed my father
maybe i did
but why should you kill all these people
if you hate me so much just shoot me
just shoot me eric
charlie spreads his arms leaving knox a plenty wide target
its a horribly tense moment
the angels are frozen watching knox decide charlies fate
knox is sweating debating his choices
can he really do this
charlies not the glamorous smug asshole he imagined
he starts lowering his gun
quickly ill just kill you
it all happens in the blink of an eye
knox fires hitting charlie in the chest
natalie leaps out and tackles knox
alex dives and grabs the detonator before it has a chance to go off
dylan runs to charlies side
she hold shim in her arms as the other angels gather round their fallen leader
he gasps for air
hes trying to say something
then dylan notices something weird
hes not gasping for air theres something stuck in his mouth
with a great hacking cough he spits it out
its a voice chip like the one dylan used in the opening scene
ucch that tasted terrible
the voice isnt charlies
dylan reaches down and rips off charlies mask revealing
are you okay
he pulls back the padding from the suit revealing a small wound where the bullet grazed his side
hurts but it looks like itll heel
dylan laughs alex ruffles his hair
hey wait a second
if bosleys here
then wheres charlie
the angels all look at each other
no one knows
in gorgeous slow motion the three angels walk side by side with a calm assurance fireballs exploding behind them
as music rises the angels triptych descends then peels away to reveal
the angels kick back on the white sands tropical drinks in hand
bosley is there as well with a grass hat and zinc on his sniffer
charlie is on the cellular speakerphone
great work angels
youll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation
the angels and bosley clink glasses
enjoy your vacation angels
thank you charlie
they toast the speakerphone
alex natalie i know youve been putting in some long hours on this case so i thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends
walking across the beach towards them
each is carrying a drink of his own
damn those men look good
alex and natalie share a smile
any chance youll be joining us charlie
were in charlies point of view
we can see part of his reflection in the window not enough to see his face but we get some sense of the man
he turns away begins walking
steps down onto the sand
to cell phone id love to angels
but i have some precious treasures to watch over
with that he hangs up
we stay in his p
walking across the beach
and its not just any beach
were on the same beach
looking right we see the backs of the angels and bosley
they have no idea that charlie is walking right behind them
a beat then dylan looks back
she looks directly as us at charlie tracking as we move past
does she somehow recognize its charlie
from her reaction its not clear
a beat then we
dylan looks back forward again
did she just see charlie
her smile tells us she thinks she did
she raises a toast
they knock glasses
right at the moment we should probably fade out bosley spills his icy drink in his lap
his eyes go wide
the angels just have to laugh
we freeze frame then
