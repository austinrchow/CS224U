margolis original draft hot summer night
the flesh district hookers working the sidewalks stopping cars
mike reilly s paces a corner restless looking for action
wet hair three day beard trenchcoat sneakers heat seeking weary eyes
he flashes a wad of bills in an effort to get some attention
no one notices
across the street bill rice s a ragged transient strolls over
know what the problem is kid
youre too ugly to get propositioned
look whos talking old man
cmon its a quiet night
rice starts away
reilly pauses then trudges after him
rice and reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag talk with their mouths full as they walk
next week we work the park
i gotta get back on top
get off the sleaze detail
you will one day at a time
ill be old and grey when it happens
they share a grin pass a bag lady who wears a pie tin crown holding her hand out to a pimp getting into a cadillac
a small gift sir for the queen
the pimp ignores her screeches off
the bag lady pulls out a pad adds his license number to a list glances up at rice and reilly
bag lady cont
i keep a record see
they dont pay i dont forget
rice fishes some change out of his pocket
here you go your highness
thank you officer
she pushes her shopping cart away
rice and reilly look at each other crack up surprised she knew he was a cop
so whatll you do
after they give you the gold watch
hell i got a gold watch
it just dont work
maybe theyll give me a new fishing pole or something useful
you dont fish
how hard can it be
the grand kids been buggin me about taking them camping
you outta the city
thats a fish out of water
whats with all this family talk lately anyway
one of these days youre gonna get tired of fighting the shit
when that happens youll wish you had family
i got close but it never woulda worked
they stop beside a dirty beat up studebaker parked in the alley climb in reilly behind the wheel
cluttered with debris clothes boxes personal items
reilly jiggles the ignition the engine coughs and sputters finally turns over
why dont you just shoot it and put it out of its misery
what are you talking about its purring like a kitty
i thought you said whats her names brother was going to fix it
she didnt work out had to cut her loose
what was it this time
she wanted to cook me breakfast
the white van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly deserted buildings garage
reilly and rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights come on in the building
two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the building briefly then disappear
they hear a brief heated argument that is cut short abruptly
cmon lets check it out
were vice i didnt see no pimps or hookers in that van
but if youre so gung ho wed best call it in for some back up
nah lets just take a look see
reilly jumps out and heads for the building
rice rolls his eyes follows
a huge old battered machine shop
spooky darkness dead quiet
moonlight filters in through dirt smeared windows
the door creaks as reilly and rice slip in stop eyes scan
just rows of glistening machines
rice gestures for reilly to spread out
they head in footsteps echoing shadows washing over them
then glancing over reilly sees a shape hiding behind a machine
he steps towards it
the shape whirls a beautiful spitfire of a girl with piercing blue eyes
she tries to bolt
reilly grabs her
she struggles pulls a knife slashes his arm drawing blood through his trenchcoat
son of a bitch
he punches her full force in the face she collapses knocked out cold
rice rushes over
yeah just a nick
then over reillys shoulder rice sees a dark silhouette emerging from behind a machine
rice draws his pistol
as reilly whirls the silhouette raises a mac
rice shoves reilly aside as the silhouette opens fire
diving for cover reilly flings back his trenchcoat whips out his mm and returns fire at the silhouette blowing the shit out of windows behind sparks showering off machines
silence for an instant reilly looks for rice and finds him bleeding to death on the floor nearby he is completely exposed to the line of fire
the silhouette and another figure open fire on reilly
swan s crazy brilliant manic eyes
and one of his men pale sweaty wearing an earring s continue the barrage
swan fires one shot at a time at rice deliberately aiming not to kill him trying to flush reilly out
rice screams as bullets rip into his legs
reilly tries to reach him but cant shots forcing him back
a dark eyed man with a beard appears in the b
and stealths towards reilly from behind
reilly face is in agony as rice moans in pain
he glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them to the girl lying next to him whats keeping them there
obviously the girl
desperate reilly grabs her by the hair shoves his mm to her head
using her as a shield he drags her in front of rice to protect him
to gunmen drop it
swans eyes flare
he steps out into the open gun aimed at rice eyes locked murderously on reilly
let her go
reilly cocks his hammer fingers trembling
the girl stiffens terrified
beard emerges behind reilly
deadly silent he raises an automatic trying to get a clear shot between machines
no the girl
reilly whirls sees beard shrinks back to stay covered
to swan we gotta get outta here
to swan tell them to drop it now
a deadly stalemate
faraway sirens wail
you have no idea how sorry youre going to be
to the girl dont worry
beard smolders earring sweats
keeping their guns up the three men grab tool bags work their way to the alley door and slip out
the moment theyre gone reilly quickly handcuffs the girl to a machine kneels cradles rice
take your time
one day at a time kid
rice takes reillys hand and pats it on his wristwatch
its all i got
it dont work grinning aint that a shit rices eyes go blank he exhales his last breath
reilly winces eyes welling up
his gaze moves at the girl
the girl stares uncomfortably a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior
looking numb out of place rices blood still on his trenchcoat reilly walks in weaves through a chaos of ringing phones overworked cops suspects being booked
cops look up whisper about him
turning a corner reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop harry hustling the girl out of a booking room
shes got a shiner where reilly hit her
the girl and reilly make eye contact intimate somehow a flash of vulnerability and fear in the girls face
hey reilly captains looking for you
reilly snaps out of it continues on
reilly nods as harry hustles the girl away
behind his desk a work weary captain winters s sucks coffee as he grills artie pluchinsky s a slick suit and tie homicide detective
nothing so far
what about the ballistics report
labs backed up were still waiting for it
reilly walks in
reilly what the hell happened out there
why didnt you call for back up
at a loss sad sir i reilly looks at his watch we notice hes now wearing rices watch
he taps it listens to see if its ticking
winters contid softening dammit rice was a good man i want to work this
youre vice not homicide
besides you dont have the experience and youre too personally involved
but sir you know the rules
youre off the street til i
clears the investigation
now go home and clean yourself up get some rest
harry barges in dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk
she wont talk
look at this shit no i
reilly picks up a twisted plastic wire bracelet
bracelet she was wearing
looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton
maybe she knows your old man
reilly sears into pluchinsky
take it down to the bomb squad artie ill do it
winters eyes him for a beat relents
run this down to the cave
reilly spins and exits quickly
emerging from a dingy back staircase reilly enters a hallway and moves to a door a door marked bomb squad
reilly enters into another world a dungeon cluttered with bomb paraphernalia defusing equipment a dog house ping pong table sheryl crow pin up chicago bears posters yassir arafat dartboard a
photo shrine to dead bomb squaders
a plain fresh faced assistant bev s looks up from her computer station
may i help you
im looking for the bomb squad
theyre not here
where are they
and you are
officer reilly vice
there out on a call perhaps i can help you where
block of lakefront
but i thanks
reilly sprints out
bev tries to finish but hes gone
the studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic
a young uniformed police officer stops reilly in front of a cordoned off section of the street
flashes badge bomb squad
the officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way reilly hits the gas rumbles through
the studebaker swings past a fire truck an ambulance and two squads cars
two officers stand near a building with a worried businessman and his chauffeur
reilly parks yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street
a bomb squad van and sleek black harley davidson parked beyond it
reilly hops out heads cautiously for the limo pooch s a barrel chested ex football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo
red rubber ball in hand hawaiian shirt half tucked in he leads around an equally scruffy labrador retriever schnoz
smell anything schnoz
s a country boy inspects the open trunk
glass s clean cut straight laced easy going smile brilliant leader of the team steps lightly around the open drivers door
pooch contid cont
schnoz come here boy
shhh i hear something
reilly stands off feet
glass notices him
who the heckre you
you the bomb squad
no were terrorists stay back or well blow
were a bit busy at the moment ill give you a statement in a few minutes if were still alive
flashes badge reilly vice
glass and pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where t
has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire
leans down puts his ear to it nods
pooch lifts up schnoz and holds him over the trunk
schnoz sniffs the shoebox whines
schnoz says its loaded
good boy schnozzie
pooch lowers schnoz back to the ground throws him the red ball and trots back to the van climbs up inside and sits watching
alright boys look close
glass pooch and t
take a beat just to look at the shoebox
then glass nods for reilly to move away
reilly takes a few steps back watching as the team works together glass in charge a psychic connection between them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons
whadaya think boy or girl
glass puts on magnifying spectacles precise organized a detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for wires sensors
as the others watch glass rubs his fingertips ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box
he reaches in
slowly pulls it out
its a mickey mouse alarm clock doll a clump of unlit firecrackers taped between mickeys legs
the bomb squaders whoop and howl all except pooch who pulls out a pack of tums shoves half of it in his mouth
its a girl
they all crack up hysterical
reilly stares in disbelief these guys are nuts
in the b
the officers finish getting a statement from the businessman as the still worried chauffeur inspects the limo
and pooch load their equipment into the van as glass fills out paperwork
that guys wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that
i better send meg flowers just in case
and pooch share a laugh as reilly approaches
whos in charge here
pooch points to schnoz
look its important
make an appointment
its about this
reilly holds up the bracelet
glass takes it frowns
where did you get this
off a girls wrist
high grade det cord
this girl either shes got strange taste in jewelry or shes into serious demolition
what do you mean
glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt cuts off a piece of the bracelet plugs it in
fire in the hole
glass tosses it into a sewer drain
a beat then a small explosion smoke billows out of the gutter drain
the nearby officers jump alarmed
the bomb squad guys laugh
glass waves to the officers
sorry about that
to reilly thats an inch of the stuff imagine what the whole thingd do
he grabs back the bracelet turns to leave
hey wait a minute reilly jogs back to his studebaker climbs in and roars off in a cloud of dirty smoke
thatd be some explosive pussy hes got his hands on
pooch and t
share a laugh as glass shakes his head climbs on his harley
the others pile into the van
glass kicks starts his hog and rumbles away van following
thin crowd of day time drinkers
earring walks in moves to a booth where swan and beard are eating
earring pulls out a gallois french cigarette lights up from a book of matches
theyre holding her downtown
what about the cop
if youd let me waste him
what if she talks
i say we split town
come back to this job when things cool
weve got other contracts denver seattle
swan slams his fist down spilling food
no one in bar even looks up from their drink
i want her back and we do the job
i thought we agreed the personal cant interfere with the professional
besides were on a schedule and the cops wont let her go
unless we make them
earring stares uneasily
swan and beard look up freeze
a pair of patrol cops are heading directly towards them
earring reaches under his jacket
swan grabs earrings arm calming him
the cops keep coming then at the last moment they veer left and slide into a booth
swan nods they get up and casually slip outside
reilly hurries in interrupts winters and pluchinsky talking over pluchinskys desk
captain an officer shouts from across the room holding up a phone
captain line one
to reilly i thought i told you he says its important something about the rice shooting
winters snatches up the nearest phone
he listens facial expression changing getting tight
he punches an intercom button the whole room stops looks up as swans voice comes over the squawk box
i said release the girl or alot of people are going to die
winters signals frantically for the call to be traced cops spring into action
swans voice contid cont
its exactly two oclock
if shes not released in one hour people die
wait what do you mean
click the line goes dead
winters slams down the phone no chance of a trace
what the hell was that
a ticking bomb
holds up bracelet its detonation cord for a bomb
its a bluff
the guys full of crap
we cant take the chance
ring down to the bomb squad
i want them on alert
ill do it
goddamit reilly look i saw these guys i can i
i know youre anxious to get back but
just stay out of homicides way or ill have you classifying fingerprints understand
reilly takes off pluchinsky glares
is hunched over a twisted mess of wires untangling them
pooch taste tests dog biscuits for schnoz then feeds them to him as he talks to his wife on the phone
glass is dissecting the mickey mouse clock
no honey im fine
yeah well youre welcome
you deserve flowers more often
bev glances longingly at t
as she gives glass a neck rub
bev youre the greatest
hey im next
winks as bev turns away hard to get
reilly bursts in
hey thats the guy we just got a bomb threat upstairs
this gets everyones attention
a cop was killed last night interrupting a robbery
one of the gang was grabbed a girl
the one i told you about with the detonation cord
well her friends just called in theyre threatening to waste people unless shes released in the next hour
alright lets check it out
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred
vice cop on a homicide
captain assigned me to assist you
what the hell you know about tickers anyway
look nothing personal but you cant just waltz in here and expect to join the team
whatre you talking about
when you need us you love us when you dont were shunned by the rest of the department
weve got one hour
are you coming or not
the squad just stands there
okay fuck you
reilly walks out
the guys look at each other
glass frowns at the bracelet
those vice cops around all that pussy so pent up
bev smirks at t
s language he lowers his eyes
to glass what do you think
call upstairs see what you can find out
re bracelet t
run a trace on this see if you can pin down where it came from
whoever these people are lets hope theyre all talk
reillys studebaker is parked next to the machine shop building
reilly enters and slowly re walks his steps from the shoot out pausing over the chalk outline of rices body
two forensics officers silently comb over the crime scene
reilly pauses sadness overwhelming him
one of the officers nods at him he has to turn away as the emotions come
sophisticated detonation equipment and weapons cover the beds
beard scowls earring sweats as swan puts the finishing touches on a computerized briefcase bomb
what time is it
swan its no use
look we can still make houston shut up
he sets a timer closes the briefcase smiles
briefcase in hand earring slips out and blends into pedestrian traffic
earring walks on just a man with a briefcase
earring slows and passes a bus stop where a group of giggly teenage girls are waiting
he notices a raven haired knockout going into the pub up ahead
he grins and follows her in
a trendy irish pub a sparse lunch crowd
earring enters spots the knockout ordering a drink at the bar slides onto a stool next to her and deposits the briefcase on the floor
hey beautiful can i buy you some bangers and mash
pint of guiness
she gives him a once over turns up her nose nods a thanks to the bartender delivering her white wine
earrings smile doesnt change
you know even the smallest choices in life could change everything
fuck off pal
earring grins and shrugs an oh well
he slides off the stool steps back and exits
leaving the briefcase behind
earring walks out and strolls off
he checks his watch picks up the pace
he disappears around a corner
people stroll by
an ordinary scene on an ordinary day
the silence is screaming
suddenly the bar explodes
a fireball bursts out the front window showering the street with wood and broken glass
chaotic aftermath of the bombing
sirens flashing red lights
police hold back onlookers firemen clean up paramedics carry corpses and moaning victims out of the charred smoking ruins into waiting ambulances
a black and white tears up
winters leaps out pushes through to a dirt covered fire chief
eight dead so far
winters looks grim
reilly screeches up in his studebaker jumps out pushes through flashes his badge enters the police zone
he stops as he sees a bloody female victim being loaded into an ambulance
suddenly a voice snaps him out of it
whatre you doing here
reilly faces him
reilly ignores them starts towards the ruins
pluchinsky shoves him back
i said get the fuck outta here
you touch me again and and what youll shoot me
hey dont mistake me for one of your partners id like to make retirement in one piece
pluchinsky starts to laugh as reilly pops him once hard in the face
pluchinsky staggers backwards grasping his bleeding nose
reilly is ready for more as pluchinsky starts at him
they exchange a few body shots before several cops swarm in and pull them apart
winters hustles over
what the hells going on
son of a bitch
this fuck up is interfering with reilly whatre you doing here
i thought i told you hes with us
they all turn
glass and t
stand there soot smeared wearing utility belts
we asked him to come
yeah hes helping us work up a profile on this thing
hope you dont mind captain might help us catch these guys that much sooner
to reilly coming
reilly looks at the captain awkwardly
go ahead kid
reilly marches after glass and t
leaving pluchinsky fuming holding closed his bloody nose
im filing charges against that mother can it pluchinsky
and shove some cotton up your nose
reilly follows glass and t
that cop who bought it
you didnt tell us he was your partner
weve lost brothers too we know what thats like
lets get something straight
were doing you a favor
youre not exactly a guy we want around explosives
this isnt bumper cars its brain surgery
you wanna work with us you do it our way understand
now wait just a fucking be cool around my men they dont trust strangers
and try not to swear so much its unattractive
reilly glares tongue tied as they walk past the bomb squad van and glass harley enter the wreckage
two firemen drag out a fire hose
and reilly approach a taped off area where pooch is on his hands and knees wet and dirty as he searchs for clues
schnoz sits nearby red ball in his mouth
by the way im glass
this is t
offering dirty hand uh huh
reilly avoids the hand
that theres schnoz mascot and ace bomb sniffer
say hi schnozzie
schnoz ignores them sniffing a charred beam in a corner
points out burn patterns to glass
flame racer partial p
see this wave pattern
definitely self contained
pooch sniffs dirt tastes it
nitro dash of semtrex vegetable oil
what kind of bomb was it
we dont use the b word
so youre the device squad
and you defuse devices
we treat devices
amused anything else i should know
dont push it slick
schnoz whines and paws at something under the beam
they scramble over
pooch can you move it
i dont know
pooch positions himself like a weight lifter preparing to dead lift
he growls as he strains to lift the beam out of the way
glass and t
jump in and go to work with toothbrushes and tweezers
as reilly watches fascinated they uncover a scorched fragment of a briefcase handle
yes baby yes
pooch throws schnoz the red ball
good boy schnoz
daddy loves you
looks like they used silly putty
reilly looks to glass for an explanation
c plastic explosive
helluva fuck factor
reilly again looks for an explanation
dont worry youll pick it up
hey check this out
something glitters in the ashes
pooch picks it up with tweezers
a tiny chip
the guys stare at it puzzled
lemme see that
glass takes it puts on his magnifying spectacles holds it up to the light frowns
probably cash register or something
pooch and t
go back to searching
what can you tell us about the girl with the exploding jewelry
glass turns to see reilly on his way out
ill get back to you
phones are ringing off the hook
reilly bursts in notices winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated tracing equipment
lets go we gotta jump on him the second he calls again
reilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by pluchinsky
you were lucky today vice boy
captain said to leave it alone but just remember im watching you
im sorry detective but youre just not my type
pluchinskys face turns red with rage as
an officer holds up a phone urgently
captain its him
the room scrambles into action as winters grabs the phone
swans voice crackles over the squawk box
dont make me send another
look were prepared to talk what do you want
click dial tone
winters slams down the receiver
cops pull off their tracing headphones glance at each other uneasily
section commanders in my office now
as the room erupts reilly turns to the booking officer
wheres the girl
the one i brought in
reilly takes off
wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder a bored cop flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one way mirror
through it can be seen a bare interrogation room where the girl sits stubbornly at a table across from harry
stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray harry rubs the back of his neck gets up and goes through a door into the viewing booth
the bored cop looks up shuts off the tape recorder
tough is fuck you wheres my lawyer
this chick doesnt say boo
the outer door opens reilly walks in
sorry about rice
reilly nods accepts the condolence
captain said i could give it a crack
she aint no hooker
this is a murder investigation
she was my collar
maybe ill get lucky
but if you got a problem with that talk to the captain
ill be in the can
the bored cop eyes reilly suspiciously as reilly crosses to the other door yanks it open
as reilly enters the girl stiffens at the sight of him
you remember me
reilly shuts the door she doesnt respond
the girl catches a glimpse of his mm under his trenchcoat shes unfazed
he paces circling her
you know your boyfriend just killed a ten year old at a bus stop blew her head clean off
the girl puts up a good front but we can see shes listening
youre just caught in the middle
but weve got a guy out there wasting people just to get you back
it cant be because of your looks
so ill be honest with you reilly goes to the table flicks off the mic
the bored cop doesnt notice hes engrossed in his comic
reilly sits the girl eyes him like a trapped prey
theyre enemies yet theres a strange chemistry between them
let me be very clear about this
the police wont let you go
when your boyfriend realizes this i have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die
i know you dont want that to happen
she stares eyes dark barely registering any emotion at all
a flicker of fear indecision
her lips part fighting it then she looks away letting the fear win
reilly flushes with anger frustration
glass squints through a microscope
pooch sniffs and fumbles dirt samples
rocks to a walkman as he inspects the charred briefcase handle fragment
bev is at her computer searching luggage websites on the net
reilly comes in still frustrated
we missed you whered you go
before reilly can answer t
rips off his headphones
fuckin a i think i got two partial prints here
how bout you glass hows that chip shaking
they all look over
glass stares back darkly
glass what is it
i was wrong
this didnt come from any cash register
its from an ira
ira instant retirement account
deadliest class of tickers in existence
computerized multiple sensors booby traps the works
first showed up in a series of i
bombings in london couple years ago
one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers
the girl is she irish
shes not talking
but she could be
so obviously youve seen one of these devices before
only once at redstone
thats one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it
relax pooch its just a ticker its not personal
lets face it we all knew it would happen sooner or later
the guy who can build a mousetrap thats better than we are
points to reilly and whats he doing to help
shut up t
be nice pooch
they all explode into a shouting match except glass who is in his own world inspecting the microchip an inch from his eyes
a moments mayhem until all of you shut the fuck up
they all go silent stare at reilly except glass
no wonder the rest of the department doesnt want to work with you
youre nothing but a bunch of
reilly walks out
reilly goes to his studebaker climbs in
as he starts it up the passenger door rips open
glass jumps in slams the door furious
nice performance back there
whered you learn that mike ditka sensitivity seminar
hey look no you look mister
first you dont go calling my men names
its bad for morale
second us punks happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did
glass glares a challenge
glaring back reilly guns the engine screeches away
the studebaker rumbles up to the machine shop parks in the same haunting spot as the night before
glass and reilly climb out of the car flashlights in hand
reilly glances around bad memories stirring up
the place has already be combed
forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside
then lets go see what they missed
pulling out a tool kit glass quickly picks the door lock yanks open the door ducks inside
nearly pitch dark inside shafts of late afternoon sunlight glistens on the battered machines
shadows wash over reilly and glass as they retrace the path reilly and rice took the night before glass searching intensely reilly getting more and more uncomfortable
so what were they doing here
i dont know
you tell me
an abandoned machine shop
nice place to build devices
low rent too
but you and rice ruined their perfect hideout
you mentioned something called redstone
redstones the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers
cream of the crop huh
nods top of my class at west point thank you very much
then off to redstone
first half of the course we learned how to build devices
second half wed take them apart
everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs
sounds like terrorist heaven
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith bill jones
id see them up ahead in the hall call their name but they wouldnt turn around
funny thing theyd always disappear after the first half of the course
just how easy is it to build a
with a little training you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something thatd finish off that alleged car of yours
heck didnt you ever watch macgyver
reilly looks at glass strangely until he realizes theyve stopped where rice died
so this is where it happened
reilly fights the memory
eyes well up his hand trembles ever so slightly as he points out
girl was here
the guy in charge was over there with one of his men the other one was back there
glass gets down on his hands and knees scans the floor
reilly talks to distract himself
bombers what kettle of fish are they
typical profile usually losers nobodies thatre afraid to confront their victims
they like scaring people
thats why they call in their threats
same mentality as obscene phone callers
except theyll blow you up if you dont play along
no ninety ninety percent of them are full of baloney
theyre into the power trip not the damage
what scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants then disappear
the worst of the bunch they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever
and they love the carnage
glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a machine picks up a half smoked cigarette butt with tweezers pulls it out kneels
glass straightens it out reads the brand name gallois
doubt somebody who worked here smoked it
only half gone put it out in a hurry
figuring the length assuming it was one of these guys odds are
it was lit outside
glass takes off
glass and reilly search the area
glass moves on his knees aiming the flashlight
this is where the van was parked
then its gotta be here somewhere
look its a longshot
glass pinches something with his tweezers holds it up triumphantly
a used match
a jungle of giant fibers teeming with strange molecules
no question it was definitely the one used to l light the butt
finger pressure suggests a male average build height
no prints trace of nylon fiber
he wore a glove
punches keys on a computer peers through the microscope as glass reilly pooch and bev stand by
this is strange
two computer screens one displays the magnified match from different angles the other spills out a stream of formulae and chemical breakdowns
reading info three foreign particles
what is that some kind of explosive
industrial wood oil
separately any one of these things could lead in several directions but together
they make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber
beat proud of his team a bowling alley
at an adjacent computer bev runs a scan program on the match comparing it against an endless stream of match types on file
schnoz howls awake from a nap as t
stabs the screen as a match is made specifications filling the screen
ace match company flint michigan
amazed you mean you just
you keep a record of
hey matches are a very big thing in our line of work
smirks at reilly punks huh
bev give em a call find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area
pooch why dont you e mail your buddies at langley and on the other side of the pond see if any iras been popping up lately
you got it
to reilly we work fast enough for you
reilly mouth is opened duly impressed
the studebaker and harley swerve up to a run down windowless bowling alley park in a red zone
reilly and t
j climb out of the clunker glass off his bike
checks his hair in the side mirror sniffs his underarms
whatre you doing
my first undercover assignment
i gotta look good right
reilly and glass exchange a grin they drag t
a busy saturday afternoon crowd
rock music blasts reverberating with the echo of crashing balls and pins
the lanes are teeming with sweating bodies
sexy waitresses in skimpy outfits deliver drinks
ogles women as they wander through
so whatre we looking for
someone who smokes french cigarettes
in this crowd
its gonna be marlboros camels and maybe a few kools
reilly and glass nod knowing its a longshot
reilly directs glass and t
to split up to case the place
they move through the rowdy crowd eyes catching every smoker
the music is more redneck rock the crowd as well
glass and t
are in the midst of game of pool nursing bottles of root beer
they continue to play while eyeing those coming and going
reilly enters from the alley catches glass eye and shakes his head
he goes to the bar and orders a coke
he takes the drink and moves over next to glass as t
lines up a shot
how long are we going to stay
til we get a better lead
reillys attention is drawn to a crowded booth in the corner where a few bowling alley girls block the view of the entire booth
glass nudges reilly they look over to see pooch entering the bar
he sees them and moves to the bar
sinks his shot and lines up another as reilly and glass move to meet pooch
pooch produces a printout from his jacket opens it up
unsolved bombings in the last year
boston new york philadelphia
but no real match insurance
exactly my thinking
except none of the targets can actually be linked to government political or special interest concerns
they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies
some insured some not
but theres traces of c and assorted inflammatory additives found in each case
the only common denominator is the detonators all had circuitry consistent with our micro chip
not bad for bomb squad eh

you guys seem pretty tight
weve gotta be
in this business you dont exactly make alot of outside commitments
why do you do it
i dont know its strange
its not the best career path but when you get the bug theres nothing you can do about it
see when you beat one of these things
theres that one second when you realize you saw something you werent supposed to see
this beautiful naked woman
and then the rush comes the high cuz you realize you got away with it
pooch is still with the girls showing one of them how to line up a shot
looks like poochs doing okay
hes married he dont even know what a lesbian is
waves over the bartender
he and glass orders fresh drinks as reilly eyes pretty blonde across the bar
she picks up two beers and grabs a pack of matches off the bar
she turns and moves to the booth in the corner
the bodies part and reilly catches a glimpse of earring
reilly nearly chokes on his coke as earring takes the matches from the blonde
earring checks his watches rises
he looks up and catches reillys eye he smiles then bolts
reilly coughs up his drink and tries to get a word out pointing as earring slips out the exit door next to the booth
glass pats reillys back as he gags eyes blazing
there he goes
he was here the whole time
reilly pushes his way through the crowd with glass on his heels
rushes over and grabs pooch away from the girls at the pool table
reilly runs into a pair of enormous rednecks spilling their beer on them
the rednecks grab him by the collar and prepare to fight as pooch arrives and body blocks the rednecks away from reilly
reilly is released and he continues after earring as pooch and the rednecks mix it up
a brawl breaks out with pooch and t
in the middle as reilly and glass make it to the exit door
reilly flies out but glass freezes dead in his tracks
he spins back to look at the corner booth
the shopping bag sits on the floor under the table
the fight escalates quickly but pooch employs his linebacker skills and cuts down his assailant
a natural streetfighting rabbit puncher
they quickly dispatch the rednecks leaving them bruised and bloodied
they rush for glass and the doorway then lock on glass reaction and stop
reilly runs out into the middle of the street
at the end of the block earring is rushing for the corner
reilly draws his mm aims thru the pedestrian and fires
earring is blown off his feet
he hits the pavement hard
reilly enters and sees glass tj and pooch gathered around the booth in back
say thanks for the back up the bomb squad ignores reilly who now realizes something is wrong
he pushes his way through the bar patrons to the booth
glass glances up at reilly
he set one the son of a
tj and pooch exchange looks theyve never heard glass so close to swearing before
notices a small crowd starting to gather around the booth
calmly clear the area please
loudly you heard him get the fuck away its a bomb
that does it the crowds shriek and scatter
rolling eyes at each other the bomb squaders turn their attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor
the team eyes the package for a moment
glass makes a determination whips out a knife slashes the bag open revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb inside
rubs his temples with dread
glass puts on his magnifying spectacles starts to probe
pooch tests hinges with his tweezers
hands glass a crimp
pooch pries off a back panel fingers shaking lifts it every so slightly sees complex circuitry inside the red glow of a digital readout counting down
fuck factor ten
okay im going in nobody breathe
synchronizing his chronometer to the counter glass begins disengaging sensor switches
he clips off circuits and booby traps with bloodcurdling care peeling away layer after layer of death
shakes his head with awe respect fear
this guys a master
finally he comes to the heart of the bomb a pair of tiny wires leading to the blasting cap one yellow one red
precious seconds tick away
its one of these wires
so cut both
one shuts it down one turns arms it
which ones which
i dont know
theres an old saying when in doubt cut the yellow wire
the device teeters slightly alarming t
and pooch each grab a corner of the device to steady it
reilly follows their lead and kneels goes to reach for a corner as well one hand starts to tremble
you can go back to the van if you like
no im with you
reilly focuses and wills his hands to steady
he grabs a corner and closes his eyes mind over matter
sweat streams as he concentrates like never before
pooch and t
stare at the wires with intensity
glass pulls out a clipper
he eases the clipper into position
he draws in a breath
closing his eyes he clips the yellow wire
reillys eyes snap open
the counter stops on no explosion
pooch and t
whoop and hug like drunk madmen
glass steps away stone faced
reilly follows him wobbly
smiles is this a great job or what
two squad cars have appeared officers cordon off the crime scene
glass watches reilly kneeling over earrings body digging through earrings pockets finding nothing but cash cigarettes and matches
at glass nothing
pooch and t
have the device on the ground a few feet away from the earrings body
they delicately continue to take it apart so it can be transported safely
schnoz sits nearby watching
pooch is on the phone with his wife
i dont know honey
no everythings fine it was nothing
as he says this he lifts a chunk of c and sets it aside
pooch hangs up his phone
pooch and tj exit the bar moving to glass and reilly
you guys hungry
the wifes got a heap of lasagna leftover
at reilly what do ay say
good eats reilly
glass notes reillys hands
good meal would go a long way to steady your system
got work to do dont we
pooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the devices shopping bag hands it to reilly offering a smile
in case you change your mind
reilly looks at it awkwardly then walks away as a news van arrives on the scene
reilly cruises into the bowels of downtown
makes a few turns and parks
in the shadows of a burned out building reilly observes several junkies getting a fix from their connection
reilly watches with scared tempted eyes
he looks at his hands
catches his reflection in the rear view mirror
checks rices watches on his wrist taps it
still not ticking
ashamed he screeches away
a quiet squad room
reilly bangs out something on a computer terminal
he blazes away typing as fast as he can
he holds out his hands
he takes a drink from a protein shake returns to typing
a weary winters looks up from coffee and paperwork as reilly knocks walks in
reilly drops a sheaf of papers on his desk
report on the case so far
you know after a shooting i would normally take your badge and weapon but glass called in already and confirmed it was clean
but from now on any leads on this case go to pluchinsky
hes primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the bomb squad
you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more
reilly nods accepting
i imagine as soon as they find out one of theirs is dead well be getting another call
so get some sleep alright
reilly nods turns and exits
tight on a tv a pretty reporter reports live from the scene
to recap a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago
swan watches the tv report with beard eyes narrowing as he sees reilly in the crowd behind the reporter
while the mans motives and identity remain a mystery police are denying the incident is related to the explosion that ripped through a bar earlier today killing and wounding more
swan kicks in the tv destroying it
swan flips open a suitcase full of bomb making materials and begins to sort through
quiet cozy middle class
the harley and the bomb squad van are parked out front
also the studebaker
reilly exits the bathroom returns to the dining room where the bomb squad is laughing hoeing and haying over dessert
poochs faithful wife meg pours coffee

janie surprises reilly with a shy kiss scurries upstairs with after pooch t
meg clears the dishes schnoz is asleep on the floor
glass and reilly are left alone
reilly takes a sip of coffee hand trembles ever so slightly
how long were you hooked

reilly stares then opens up slowly

reilly holds up his wristwatch

reilly gives him the watch
glass pulls out a mini tool kit pries off the back of the watch examines the works
main springs stuck

he holds out the mini kit
reilly takes it uncertainly but follows glass instructions
okay first push the pin back with this
now while you keep it there stick this in here and turn it slowly
easy thats it
now let the pin go and line up the wheel
that should do it
reilly gives it a tweak looks at the watch surprised
congratulations you just built your first ticker
reilly throws glass a surprised look
reilly and glass have their heads under the hood of the studebaker covered in grease tools everywhere
sits behind the wheel
pooch and schnoz stumble out of the house to watch
okay hit it
guns the engine the studebaker purrs like a tiger

glass glances at pooch

reilly enters to find glass bev t

bev enters another command
the computer goes to work as she turns to reilly

she smiles warmly
he smiles back t
eyes them slightly jealous of the moment
a phone rings
bev answers it
ill tell him
bev hangs up the phone
mike captain wants to see you right away
reilly heads for the door
a strange uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as reilly weaves past cops smoking drinking coffee waiting
they all stare at him
reilly walks in
winters gestures for him to take a seat as he talks on the phone
no of course not but
yes sir i understand
winters hangs up
i got a call from upstairs
they say you questioned the girl
shes refused to say a word to anyone
what made you think you could get her to talk
but i had to try
reilly i think ive shown that im a patient man
rice was your biggest fan and ive tried to honor him by giving you some slack
but you are very close to running out of slack
winters lets this sink in then holds up reillys report
i read your report
id say its got detective written all over it

reilly nods shifts uncomfortably
now that out of the way
the girl wants to talk to you alone
reilly is shocked
so get going lets close this thing
reilly bolts off
reilly enters to find harry and the girl waiting for him
harry looks the girl over nods at reilly

reilly nods harry exits
reilly sits down at the table opposite her

mary takes a deep breath eyes welling
there is a motel downtown near the machine shop

reilly rises and moves to her
their eyes linger a moment a bond between them
then why tell me
people are dying
reilly nods and touches her shoulder a light squeeze
he turns and exits
an army of cops and squad cars out front pluchinsky silently directs a swat team to the door
reilly and the bomb squad watch from a distance as they break down the door
shouting mayhem as the team floods into the room
pluchinsky brings up the rear
after a beat pluchinsky re emerges shaking his head
swan and beard watch from behind a car
beard gives swan a dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner
reilly and glass are visibly disappointed
as the others grumble about it reilly notices someone across the street the bag lady with the pie tin crown holding her hand out to a man getting into his
the man ignores her screeches off
the bag lady scribbles down his license number in her pad
glass follows reillys stare
be right back
reilly crosses the street intercepts the bag lady as shes pushing her cart away
im looking for two men who were staying at the hotel over there one has a beard the others tall thin

harry moves off to the dispatcher as a fax machine comes to life on the desk next to pluchinsky
a fax spews out
pluchinsky get four squad cars out to my house get my family out of there tell my wife im on my way
cops race to their cars
an armada of black and whites scream out of the parking lot
winters appears and jumps into his ford sedan and tears out
suspects driving a dark green ford grenada license number one two eight michael vincent edward
squad cars roar up and down the streets
two cars are parked out in front of one house in particular
in the squad room pluchinsky and some men wait anxiously by phones computer consoles radio switchboard
reilly idles in his studebaker
and pooch come out of the parking lot in the bomb squad van glass motors along side reilly
he guns the bike and takes the lead followed by reilly then the van
they pull out into traffic and head towards the suburbs
beard drives swan rides shotgun
a briefcase lies on the seat between them
as he makes a left beard notices the bomb squad van coming the other direction
weve got company
swan whirls pulls a gun as glass and reilly pass them
reilly double takes
reilly grabs his radio mic yells into it
glass there they are
pooch right in front of you you got em you got em
reilly skids to a dead stop
glass up ahead tries to maneuver around slowing cars as
the grenada speeds down a street right in front of the bomb squad van
pooch cranks into a turn and gives chase
reilly and glass are pinned in by other cars
they both finally squeeze out of their jams in different directions
an excited t
jumps on the radio
dispatch this is bomb squad
suspects sighted on fern street two blocks from hq
all available units
beard speeds around another corner the lumbering van has difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the grenada for a moment
the grenada speeds up heading towards the police station up ahead
the bomb squad van appears and speeds up
swan stands discreetly in a phone booth watching as
beard steers towards a parked squad car next to the station on collision course
at the last second beard dives from the moving car hits the pavements and rolls
the grenada crashes into the squad car
but no explosion
the bomb squad van skids to a stop as two uniformed officers rush out of the station
beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down the street
pooch and t
jump out of the van leaving a barking schnoz inside and sprint towards the grenada guns drawn
pooch is quickly huffing and puffing
continues after beard as pooch moves towards the grenada
the uniforms follow t
glass on his harley appears from behind the van
at the far end of the street the studebaker rumbles into view followed by a squad car lights flashing
everyone closing in on beard
aims and yells at beard
beard whirls around spraying automatic weapon fire at t
and the uniforms they hit the pavement
a few nearby pedestrians scream and drop to the ground
reilly jumps out of his studebaker as beard turns his fire on him blowing out his windshield
back at the grenada pooch ducks for cover by the open drivers door
glass runs his harley behind a parked car
the squad car behind reilly skids to a stop and as beard shifts his aim t
and reilly each pump two shots into beards torso
beard spins around drops dead silence on the street
relief all around
everyone stands back up
s jaw drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with his bullets
pooch exhales in relief then hears beeping coming from the front seat of the car
he looks in to see the briefcase open countdown ticking away
the grenada explodes in a massive fire ball throwing nearby glass off his feet
everyone else drops back to the ground covering their heads
swan grins and walks away down an alley
we can hear the cry of schnoz wailing from the front seat of van
reilly stares off into space
surreal silence like a dream
reilly looks at his watch keeps his eyes low as he steals a glance at glass in the other chair face wracked with pain loss
they both look through the glass office at the squad room outside the sounds of reality fade in
phones ringing voices shouting
a tense chaotic emergency atmosphere
reilly and glass rise as winters walks in closes the door
he sits behind his desk lights a cigarette
glass sorry about pooch he was a good man
we dont have time to give you a break right now were going ahead and my god youre going to use her arent you
ignoring reilly glass youre to stand by with your team
i promised her shed be safe

reilly youre done for now
what the hell were you thinking directing the bomb squad team into hot pursuit
they had no business i know
youve been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two police officer fatalities
ill need your badge and your weapon
reilly looks at glass therell be no stepping in this time
he glares at winters reaches into his jacket pulls out the badge and tosses it on winters desk
he pulls out his mm pops out the clip and open the chamber sets it down
reilly and glass trudge out both profoundly disturbed as they head across the squad room
glass veers off
reilly stares eyes wet watching him disappear
glancing over he notices bev and t
sitting with meg down the hall tommy and janie asleep in her lap
schnoz walks up to meg whimpering
bev wraps her arm around her
puts his hand on bevs shoulder
pluchinsky brushes roughly past reilly snapping him out of it
he turns walks dejectedly out
an armored van screeches up
doors fly open
metro swat team jumps out with equipment helmets rush into the building
winters and his men wait by phones
their watches tick
so does the clock on the wall
swat team captain benson huddles with his men
a phone rings shattering the quiet
harry answers it holds it up urgently
winters takes it
a new high tech tracer flicks on a new piece of equipment
swans voice comes over the squawk box growling low
you motherfuckers you dont learn do you
were prepared to talk shut up
the tracer homes in on the signal
you have exactly thirty minutes to release the girl where you found her
how do we know youll keep your word
click dial tone
winters flashes a look at the tracer
the tracer yanks off his headphones in utter frustration
to his men okay lets move
the room erupts into action
benson and the swat team are the first ones out the door
an unmarked police car pulls up and stops behind the machine shop
harry sits behind the wheel
mary sits in the back handcuffed to pluchinsky
pluchinsky unlocks the cuffs
marys eyes flare
get out and go to the machine shop mary steps out of the car
she glances around then heads in the opposite direction of the machine shop
he starts to go after her but realizes hed better clear the area
he peals out
undercover men in various disguises track her from cars and on foot communicating by hidden mics
a wino eyes her carefully lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers
shes out of the bag
mary exits the alley onto the street searching where to go
she turns down the street and moves fast eyes darting about
the swat van is tucked into an alley
winters benson and team monitor the radio communication
on the radio position four
turning on elm
mary crosses the street a camero nearly clips her
she makes it safely to the sidewalk and passes a truck driver eating a hot dog
after she moves off
speaks into sleave six
shes crossing to main
mary looks around quickly blends into a crowd coming out of a store and ducks inside
truck driver cont

shes out of sight
winters grabs the mic
seal the building
to benson lets move
the swat van rumbles to life
mary bolts through the store ducks through a service door
mary bursts out runs like a spooked horse
as she dashes to the mouth of the the alley she runs smack into the camaro that almost hit her
it screeches to a stop
the passenger door flies open
mary leans down and looks in flushes
he reaches over and yanks her inside tears away
the truck driver runs into the other end of the alley
he starts to give chase as swan tosses a small package out of the car
the truck driver dives for cover as
a dumpster explodes
the truck driver jumps to his feet
into sleave we have contact
black camaro the van speeds up as we hear
license number hqw
from every direction unmarked cars squad units and the swat van converge on the area
swan drives with deadly confidence glances at mary tenderly
alex i know

he swerves left then right pulling a transmitter out of his pocket
what is that
he sets a dial to pushes a button
the transmitter counts down
the camaro tears down a one way alley going the wrong way
undercover vehicles race after the camero seconds behind
they swerve into the alley
then just as swan whooshes out a charge explodes a stack of gallon drums
they fall down into the path of the pursuers who crash into the flaming drums
the lead car explodes
mary looks back in horror as shes whisked away
dark filthy last stop to nowhere
drunk dejected looking like shit reilly waits for a fix with a couple other junkies
the tv in the bar drones in the background
the dealer appears and gestures to reilly
cmon cowboy youre next
reilly trudges over
okay whats it gonna be

reilly looks up sharply as he hears the tv visible through the doorway
were coming to you live near the scene of that latest explosion that ripped through a downtown alley less than half an hour ago
something clears behind reilly eyes
impatient hey asshole
despite growing fears and talk of a coverup police have sealed off the area and are refusing to comment about fatalities or the rumor that terrorists may be involved
reillys eyes shift mind racing
hey im talking to you suddenly himself again reilly bolts up sending the dealer and his equipment scattering and streaks off
he bursts out of the front door of the bar into the glare of sunlight
we can hear sirens not too far off
driving like a maniac as usual reilly grabs the radio mike with one hand pulls his back up
out of the glove box
he listens out the window for the sirens he looks up at the sound of approaching helicopters
in the service bay a mechanic raises the black camaro on a hydraulic lift out of sight from the street
out front swan pays an attendant climbs into an orange u haul truck with mary drives off
a beat a squad car and an unmarked speed past the gas station
swan brushes marys hair from her face
we could get something to eat
mary shakes her head scared
whats the matter
she forces a smile
swan frowns suspiciously as he turns down a service road pulls into
swan pulls up to the loading dock of the warehouse
why are we stopping here

mary turns white
no more killing
stay in the truck
he gets out disappears into the building
mary glances around desperately sees a phone booth at the corner
she looks back at the warehouse the phone again terrified
yanking her door open mary dashes to the booth searches her pockets
she dials zero
it rings and rings then finally

marys back is to the warehouse as she waits forever
police sergeant doyle speaking

he slides up the door revealing the drums and explosives to the bomb squad
he reaches in and grabs a remote control
sirens are coming closer only a block or two away
glass and t
drop their jaws
they see swan depress the remote arming the explosives
yelling glass you guys take cover goddammit

reilly hes got enough to do it
reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the side of the alley escaping swans view
he moves around the van pulling mary along
swan sprays a flurry of bullets over reillys head
reilly dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his face
swan whirls and sprays the bomb squad van dropping t
with a shot to the leg

mary dives onto swan and grabs at the remote clasping it in her hands
swan collapses mary on top of him
reilly and glass sprint at the u haul reaching a trembling bleeding mary
she clinches her jaw fighting the grief holding on to the remote
reilly reaches mary first and puts his hands over hers she looks up into his eyes distraught

glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set up

glass stares at the digital read out on the device anchored in one of the c crates
cmon talk to me

he has a timer going as back up in case we got a hold of the remote
first run your fingers along the edges feel for a sensor
reilly does it the way he saw glass do it before

reilly feels around finally finds an access hole
reilly works the hole bigger
not enough time

reilly hand disappears into the hole
his fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes each layer
dont touch that
the red digital numbers keep counting down more metal
stay to your left
the swat van and a unit arrive winters and benson jump out the swat team is about to follow get outta here swans down but theyre chilling a device
winters looks to the action at the u haul sees reilly and glass busy at work
he nods at benson
finally reilly fingers touch a button object
we hear the swat van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley
something round two wires
thats the blasting cap good
okay now grab it by the base and pull it straight up
theres gotta be something else in there another cap maybe
make up your mind trigger
ease your thumb over to the right feel anything
reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around
yeah another round thing
okay one of the caps turns it on the other shuts it down
which ones which
i dont know
when in doubt pull the yellow wire
how the hell do you feel yellow
no excuses just do it
reilly glares at glass
his face is dripping with sweat
his fingers shift back to the first cap
they close over it ready to pull
but then they stop
glass stabs him with a look
lightning quick reilly fingers fly back and yank the second cap out of its base
the counter stops
reilly and glass and stare at it holding their breath hardly daring to believe its true
they whoop and explode with relief
its finally over
not bad for a rookie
reilly and glass turn to mary who has lost consciousness but is still holding the remote tightly
glass looks up to see t
and bev peeking from around their van
all clear but we need an ambulance
bev jumps into the van to make the call as t
starts limping towards the u haul
schnoz yelps and drops from the van and runs for the u haul
reilly cradles mary in his lap as glass kneels and removes the remote the red light stops flashing then turns off
arrives and looks down at reilly and mary then at the device in the u haul
the room is back to its usual bustling activity
winters is going through reports on his desk as reilly enters
reilly is cleaned up shaven haircut new suit
a new man
winters look up impressed with the change
mayor loves a hero
winters hands reilly an envelope and a new badge
just want you wanted
your promotion and transfer
thank you captain
winters nods and goes back to his paperwork
and bev work closely together on a mock device
is teaching her the job
they smile warmly at each other
glass is on the computer
hey you look great
flinches but she winks at him to calm him down
no longer threatened
glass doesnt look up from his computer
glass points to the work station next to him where a bomb squad protocol program is waiting on the screen
reilly smiles and he sits next to glass hands him the transfer papers envelope
softening welcome to the family
glass accepts the papers and shakes reillys hand
nice to be here
that feeling wont last long
glass and bev start laughing
after a beat reilly joins in heartily
